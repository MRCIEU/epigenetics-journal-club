"35944927","Molecular heterogeneity and commonalities in pancreatic cancer precursors with gastric and intestinal phenotype.","Gut","Due to the limited number of modifiable risk factors, secondary prevention strategies based on early diagnosis represent the preferred route to improve the prognosis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Here, we provide a comparative morphogenetic analysis of PDAC precursors aiming at dissecting the process of carcinogenesis and tackling the heterogeneity of preinvasive lesions.Targeted and whole-genome low-coverage sequencing, genome-wide methylation and transcriptome analyses were applied on a final collective of 122 morphologically well-characterised low-grade and high-grade PDAC precursors, including intestinal and gastric intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN) and pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasias (PanIN).Epigenetic regulation of mucin genes determines the phenotype of PDAC precursors. PanIN and gastric IPMN display a ductal molecular profile and numerous similarly regulated pathways, including the Notch pathway, but can be distinguished by recurrent deletions and differential methylation and, in part, by the expression of mucin-like 3. Intestinal IPMN are clearly distinct lesions at the molecular level with a more instable genotype and are possibly related to a different ductal cell compartment.PDAC precursors with gastric and intestinal phenotype are heterogeneous in terms of morphology, genetic and epigenetic profile. This heterogeneity is related to a different cell identity and, possibly, to a different aetiology.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC. No commercial re-use.

"35943854","Epigenetic and integrative cross-omics analyses of cerebral white matter hyperintensities on MRI.","Brain","Cerebral white matter hyperintensities on MRI are markers of cerebral small vessel disease, a major risk factor for dementia and stroke. Despite the successful identification of multiple genetic variants associated with this highly heritable condition, its genetic architecture remains incompletely understood. More specifically, the role of DNA methylation has received little attention. We investigated the association between white matter hyperintensity burden and DNA methylation in blood at approximately 450,000 CpG sites in 9,732 middle-aged to older adults from 14 community-based studies. Single-CpG and region-based association analyses were carried out. Functional annotation and integrative cross-omics analyses were performed to identify novel genes underlying the relationship between DNA methylation and white matter hyperintensities. We identified 12 single-CpG and 46 region-based DNA methylation associations with white matter hyperintensity burden. Our top discovery single CpG, cg24202936 (P = 7.6 × 10-8), was associated with F2 expression in blood (P = 6.4 × 10-5), and colocalized with FOLH1 expression in brain (posterior probability =0.75). Our top differentially methylated regions were in PRMT1 and in CCDC144NL-AS1, which were also represented in single-CpG associations (cg17417856 and cg06809326, respectively). Through Mendelian randomization analyses cg06809326 was putatively associated with white matter hyperintensity burden (P = 0.03) and expression of CCDC144NL-AS1 possibly mediated this association. Differentially methylated region analysis, joint epigenetic association analysis, and multi-omics colocalization analysis consistently identified a role of DNA methylation near SH3PXD2A, a locus previously identified in genome-wide association studies of white matter hyperintensities. Gene set enrichment analyses revealed functions of the identified DNA methylation loci in the blood-brain barrier and in the immune response. Integrative cross-omics analysis identified 19 key regulatory genes in two networks related to extracellular matrix organization, and lipid and lipoprotein metabolism. A drug repositioning analysis indicated antihyperlipidemic agents, more specifically peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha, as possible target drugs for white matter hyperintensities. Our epigenome-wide association study and integrative cross-omics analyses implicate novel genes influencing white matter hyperintensity burden, which converged on pathways related to the immune response and to a compromised blood brain barrier possibly due to disrupted cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions. The results also suggest that antihyperlipidemic therapy may contribute to lowering risk for white matter hyperintensities possibly through protection against blood brain barrier disruption.© The Author(s) 2022.

"35941660","Identification of TMEM129, encoding a ubiquitin-protein ligase, as an effector gene of osteoarthritis genetic risk.","Arthritis Res Ther","Osteoarthritis is highly heritable and genome-wide studies have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with the disease. One such locus is marked by SNP rs11732213 (T > C). Genotype at rs11732213 correlates with the methylation levels of nearby CpG dinucleotides (CpGs), forming a methylation quantitative trait locus (mQTL). This study investigated the regulatory activity of the CpGs to identify a target gene of the locus.Nucleic acids were extracted from the articular cartilage of osteoarthritis patients. Samples were genotyped, and DNA methylation was quantified by pyrosequencing at 14 CpGs within a 259-bp interval. CpGs were tested for enhancer effects in immortalised chondrocytes using a reporter gene assay. DNA methylation at the locus was altered using targeted epigenome editing, with the impact on gene expression determined using quantitative polymerase chain reaction.rs11732213 genotype correlated with DNA methylation at nine CpGs, which formed a differentially methylated region (DMR), with the osteoarthritis risk allele T corresponding to reduced levels of methylation. The DMR acted as an enhancer and demethylation of the CpGs altered expression of TMEM129. Allelic imbalance in TMEM129 expression was identified in cartilage, with under-expression of the risk allele.TMEM129 is a target of osteoarthritis genetic risk at this locus. Genotype at rs11732213 impacts DNA methylation at the enhancer, which, in turn, modulates TMEM129 expression. TMEM129 encodes an enzyme involved in protein degradation within the endoplasmic reticulum, a process previously implicated in osteoarthritis. TMEM129 is a compelling osteoarthritis susceptibility target.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35941262","cfDNA methylome profiling for detection and subtyping of small cell lung cancers.","Nat Cancer","Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is characterized by morphologic, epigenetic and transcriptomic heterogeneity. Subtypes based upon predominant transcription factor expression have been defined that, in mouse models and cell lines, exhibit potential differential therapeutic vulnerabilities, with epigenetically distinct SCLC subtypes also described. The clinical relevance of these subtypes is unclear, due in part to challenges in obtaining tumor biopsies for reliable profiling. Here we describe a robust workflow for genome-wide DNA methylation profiling applied to both patient-derived models and to patients' circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA). Tumor-specific methylation patterns were readily detected in cfDNA samples from patients with SCLC and were correlated with survival outcomes. cfDNA methylation also discriminated between the transcription factor SCLC subtypes, a precedent for a liquid biopsy cfDNA-methylation approach to molecularly subtype SCLC. Our data reveal the potential clinical utility of cfDNA methylation profiling as a universally applicable liquid biopsy approach for the sensitive detection, monitoring and molecular subtyping of patients with SCLC.© 2022.

"35938981","Profiling of epigenetic marker regions in murine ILCs under homeostatic and inflammatory conditions.","J Exp Med","Epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation play an essential role in imprinting specific transcriptional patterns in cells. We performed genome-wide DNA methylation profiling of murine lymph node-derived ILCs, which led to the identification of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and the definition of epigenetic marker regions in ILCs. Marker regions were located in genes with a described function for ILCs, such as Tbx21, Gata3, or Il23r, but also in genes that have not been related to ILC biology. Methylation levels of the marker regions and expression of the associated genes were strongly correlated, indicating their functional relevance. Comparison with T helper cell methylomes revealed clear lineage differences, despite partial similarities in the methylation of specific ILC marker regions. IL-33-mediated challenge affected methylation of ILC2 epigenetic marker regions in the liver, while remaining relatively stable in the lung. In our study, we identified a set of epigenetic markers that can serve as a tool to study phenotypic and functional properties of ILCs.© 2022 Beckstette et al."

Revealing the potential epigenetic mechanisms involved in callus development can improve our understanding of the regeneration process of plant cells, which will be beneficial for overcoming regeneration recalcitrance in peach. In this study, we report on single-base resolution mapping of DNA methylation and reprogramming of the pattern of trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3) at the genome-wide level during the leaf-to-callus transition in peach. Overall, mCG and mCHH were predominant at the genome-wide level and mCG was predominant in genic regions. H3K27me3 deposition was mainly detected in the gene body and at the TSS site, and GAGA repetitive sequences were prone to recruit H3K27me3 modification. H3K27me3 methylation was negatively correlated with gene expression.In vitroculture of leaf explants was accompanied by DNA hypomethylation and H3K27me3 demethylation, which could activate auxin- and cytokinin-related regulators to induce callus development. The DNA methylation inhibitor 5-azacytidine could significantly increase callus development, while the H3K27me3 demethylase inhibitor GSK-J4 dramatically reduced callus development. These results demonstrate the roles of DNA methylation and H3K27me3 modification in mediating chromatin status during callus development. Our study provides new insights into the epigenetic mechanisms through which differentiated cells acquire proliferative competence to induce callus development in plants.© The Author(s) 2022.

DNA methylation is known to play an important role in the regulation of the immune processes behind COVID-19 progression, however it has not been studied in depth. In this study, we aim to evaluate the implication of DNA methylation in COVID-19 progression by means of a genome-wide DNA methylation analysis combined with DNA genotyping. The results reveal the existence of epigenomic regulation of functional pathways associated with COVID-19 progression and mediated by genetic loci. We find an environmental trait-related signature that discriminates mild from severe cases and regulates, among other cytokines, IL-6 expression via the transcription factor CEBP. The analyses suggest that an interaction between environmental contribution, genetics, and epigenetics might be playing a role in triggering the cytokine storm described in the most severe cases.© 2022.

"35927734","Methylome decoding of RdDM-mediated reprogramming effects in the Arabidopsis MSH1 system.","Genome Biol","Plants undergo programmed chromatin changes in response to environment, influencing heritable phenotypic plasticity. The RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway is an essential component of this reprogramming process. The relationship of epigenomic changes to gene networks on a genome-wide basis has been elusive, particularly for intragenic DNA methylation repatterning.Epigenomic reprogramming is tractable to detailed study and cross-species modeling in the MSH1 system, where perturbation of the plant-specific gene MSH1 triggers at least four distinct nongenetic states to impact plant stress response and growth vigor. Within this system, we have defined RdDM target loci toward decoding phenotype-relevant methylome data. We analyze intragenic methylome repatterning associated with phenotype transitions, identifying state-specific cytosine methylation changes in pivotal growth-versus-stress, chromatin remodeling, and RNA spliceosome gene networks that encompass 871 genes. Over 77% of these genes, and 81% of their central network hubs, are functionally confirmed as RdDM targets based on analysis of mutant datasets and sRNA cluster associations. These dcl2/dcl3/dcl4-sensitive gene methylation sites, many present as singular cytosines, reside within identifiable sequence motifs. These data reflect intragenic methylation repatterning that is targeted and amenable to prediction.A prevailing assumption that biologically relevant DNA methylation variation occurs predominantly in density-defined differentially methylated regions overlooks behavioral features of intragenic, single-site cytosine methylation variation. RdDM-dependent methylation changes within identifiable sequence motifs reveal gene hubs within networks discriminating stress response and growth vigor epigenetic phenotypes. This study uncovers components of a methylome ""code"" for de novo intragenic methylation repatterning during plant phenotype transitions.© 2022. The Author(s)."

In this study, we analyzed the transcriptional activation of theONSENretrotransposon, which is activated by high-temperature stress inArabidopsis thaliana. We found that its transcription is significantly higher in the Japanese ecotype Kyoto. Considering that transposons are epigenetically regulated, DNA methylation levels were analyzed, revealing that CHH methylation was reduced in Kyoto compared to the standard ecotype, Col-0. A mutation was also detected in the KyotoCMT2gene, encoding a CHH methyltransferase, suggesting that it may be responsible for increased expression ofONSEN. CHH methylation is controlled by histone modifications through a self-reinforcing loop between DNA methyltransferase and histone methyltransferase. Analysis of these modifications revealed that the level of H3K9me2, a repressive histone marker for gene expression, was lower in Kyoto than in Col-0. The level of another repressive histone marker, H3K27me1, was decreased in Kyoto; however, it was not impacted in a Col-0cmt2mutant. Therefore, in addition to theCMT2mutation, other factors may reduce repressive histone modifications in Kyoto.Copyright © 2022 Nozawa, Masuda, Saze, Ikeda, Suzuki, Takagi, Tanaka, Ohama, Niu, Kato and Ito."

We herein sought to identify epigenetic signatures operating in the context of polygenic risk for BD in young people at high familial risk (HR) of BD. Peripheral blood-derived DNA was assayed using Illumina PsychArray, and Methylation-450K or -EPIC BeadChips. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) were calculated using summary statistics from recent genome-wide association studies for BD, major depressive disorder (MDD) and cross-disorder (meta-analysis of eight psychiatric disorders). Unrelated HR participants of European ancestry (n = 103) were stratified based on their BD-PRS score within the HR-population distribution, and the top two quintiles (High-BD-PRS; n = 41) compared against the bottom two quintiles (Low-BD-PRS; n = 41). The High-BD-PRS stratum also had higher mean cross-disorder-PRS and MDD-PRS (ANCOVA p = 0.035 and p = 0.024, respectively). We evaluated DNA methylation differences between High-BD-PRS and Low-BD-PRS strata using linear models. One differentially methylated probe (DMP) (cg00933603; p = 3.54 × 10-7) in VARS2, a mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase, remained significantly hypomethylated after multiple-testing correction. Overall, BD-PRS appeared to broadly impact epigenetic processes, with 1,183 genes mapped to nominal DMPs (p < 0.05); these displayed convergence with genes previously associated with BD, schizophrenia, chronotype, and risk taking. We tested poly-methylomic epigenetic profiles derived from nominal DMPs in two independent samples (n = 54 and n = 82, respectively), and conducted an exploratory evaluation of the effects of family environment, indexing cohesion and flexibility. This study highlights an important interplay between heritable risk and epigenetic factors, which warrant further exploration.© 2022. The Author(s)."

People with hearing loss induced by occupational noise were recruited as the case group and those with normal hearing but still exposed to occupational noise were recruited as the control group. A total of 60 participants were included, of which 30 participants were in the case group and 30 in the control group. The methylation level was detected by 850k genome-wide DNA methylation chip technology. The significance of differential methylated position (DMP) was tested by R-packet 'Champ'. The differential methylated region (DMR) was analyzed by using Champ's Bumphunter algorithm. Cluster profiler was used to analyze the gene list for GO and KEGG pathway enrichment.Results:There was significant difference between two groups in binaural high-frequency average hearing threshold (P<0.05), but there was no significant difference in age, smoking, drinking, hypertension, physical exercise and cumulative noise exposure. The results of DMP and DMR analysis showed that 713875 sites were detected in the case group and the control group, and 439 methylation sites with significant difference, accounting for 0.06%; 650 regions were detected, and 72 methylation regions with significant differences, accounting for 11.08%. Compared with the control group, the results of GO enrichment analysis showed that the case group had statistically significant differences in four pathways: axogenesis of projection neurons in the central nervous system, neuronal development in the central nervous system, axogenesis of neurons in the central nervous system and neuronal differentiation in the central nervous system. KEGG enrichment analysis showed that there were significant differences in sphingolipid metabolism, aldosterone synthesis and secretion, primary bile acid biosynthesis pathway between the case group and the control group.Conclusion:The occurrence of occupational noise-induced hearing loss may be related to the regulation of gene expression related to axogenesis of projection neurons in the central nervous system, development of neurons in the central nervous system, axogenesis of neurons in the central nervous system, differentiation of neurons in the central nervous system, sphingolipid metabolism, aldosterone synthesis and secretion, primary bile acid biosynthesis and gene methylation related to metabolism."
"35921480","Epigenetic Clock Acceleration Is Linked to Age at Onset of Parkinson's Disease.","Mov Disord","Aging is the strongest risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD), which is a clinically heterogeneous movement disorder with highly variable age at onset. DNA methylation age (DNAm age) is an epigenetic clock that could reflect biological aging.The aim was to evaluate whether PD age at onset is associated with DNAm-age acceleration (difference between DNAm age and chronological age).We used the genome-wide Infinium MethylationEPIC array to assess DNAm age in discovery (n = 96) and replication (n = 182) idiopathic PD cohorts and a unique longitudinal LRRK2 cohort (n = 220) at four time points over a 3-year period, comprising 91 manifesting and 129 nonmanifesting G2019S carriers at baseline. Cox proportional hazard regression and multivariate linear regression were used to evaluate the relation between DNAm-age acceleration and PD age at onset, which was highly variable in manifesting G2019S carriers (36-75 years) and both idiopathic PD cohorts (26-77 and 35-81 years).DNAm-age acceleration remained steady over the 3-year period in most G2019S carriers. It was strongly associated with age at onset in the LRRK2 cohort (P = 2.25 × 10-15) and discovery idiopathic PD cohort (P = 5.39 × 10-9), suggesting that every 5-year increase in DNAm-age acceleration is related to about a 6-year earlier onset. This link was replicated in an independent idiopathic PD cohort (P = 1.91 × 10-10). In each cohort, the faster-aging group has an increased hazard for an earlier onset (up to 255%).This study is the first to demonstrate that DNAm-age acceleration is related to PD age at onset, which could be considered in disease-modifying clinical trials. Future studies should evaluate the stability of DNAm-age acceleration over longer time periods, especially for phenoconverters from nonmanifesting to manifesting individuals. © 2022 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.© 2022 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society."

In excess they can perturb glucose homeostasis, with individuals predisposed to glucose intolerance more sensitive to these negative effects. While DEX is known to negatively impact β-cell function, it is unclear how. Hence, our aim was to investigate the effect of DEX on β-cell function, both alone and in combination with a diabetogenic milieu in the form of elevated glucose and palmitate.Human pancreatic EndoC-βH1 cells were cultured in the presence of high glucose and palmitate (glucolipotoxicity) and/or a pharmacological concentration of DEX, before functional and molecular analyses.Either treatment alone resulted in reduced insulin content and secretion, while the combination of DEX and glucolipotoxicity promoted a strong synergistic effect. These effects were associated with reduced insulin biosynthesis, likely due to downregulation of PDX1, MAFA, and the proinsulin converting enzymes, as well as reduced ATP response upon glucose stimulation. Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis found changes on PDE4D, MBNL1 and TMEM178B, all implicated in β-cell function, after all three treatments. DEX alone caused very strong demethylation of the glucocorticoid-regulated gene ZBTB16, also known to influence the β-cell, while the combined treatment caused altered methylation of many known β-cell regulators and diabetes candidate genes.DEX treatment and glucolipotoxic conditions separately alter the β-cell epigenome and function. The combination of both treatments exacerbates these changes, showing that caution is needed when prescribing potent glucocorticoids in patients with dysregulated metabolism.Copyright © 2022.

Epigenetic regulation plays a crucial role in atherosclerosis. Our study was aimed at finding potential biomarkers associated with the occurrence of atherosclerosis. Two datasets were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) analysis was performed on methylation data using CpGassoc package. The differential expression analysis was conducted on mRNA data using limma package. The GO (Gene Ontology) and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) functional enrichment was done in clusterProfiler package. Finally, the logistic regression model was constructed using generalized linear model (glm) function. Between atherosclerotic vs. nonatherosclerotic samples, totally 4980 cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites (annotated to 2860 genes) and 132 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to atherosclerosis were identified. The annotated 2860 genes and 132 DEGs were significantly enriched in 9 and 4 KEGG pathways and 289 and 132 GO terms, respectively. After cross-analysis, 6 crucial CpG sites were screened to build the model, including cg01187920, cg03422911, cg08018825, cg10967350, cg14473924, and cg25313204. The diagnostic model could reliably separate the atherosclerosis samples from nonatherosclerotic samples.

"35914392","Examining the epigenetic mechanisms of childhood adversity and sensitive periods: A gene set-based approach.","Psychoneuroendocrinology","Sensitive periods are developmental stages of heightened plasticity when life experiences, including exposure to childhood adversity, have the potential to exert more lasting impacts. Epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation (DNAm), may provide a pathway through which adversity induces long-term biological changes. DNAm shifts may be more likely to occur during sensitive periods, especially within genes that regulate the timing of sensitive periods. Here, we investigated the possibility that childhood adversity during specific life stages is associated with DNAm changes in genes known to regulate the timing and duration of sensitive periods.Genome-wide DNAm profiles came from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (n = 785). We first used principal component analysis (PCA) to summarize DNAm variation across 530 CpG sites mapped to the promoters of 58 genes previously-identified as regulating sensitive periods. Gene-level DNAm summaries were calculated for genes regulating sensitive period opening (ngenes= 15), closing (ngenes= 36), and expression (ngenes= 8). We then performed linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to test associations between seven types of parent-reported, time-varying measures of exposure to childhood adversity and DNAm principal components. To our knowledge, this is the first time LDA has been applied to analyze functionally grouped DNAm data to characterize associations between an environmental exposure and epigenetic differences.Suggestive evidence emerged for associations between sexual or physical abuse as well as financial hardship during middle childhood, and DNAm of genetic pathways regulating sensitive period opening and expression. However, no statistically significant associations were identified after multiple testing correction.Our gene set-based method combining PCA and LDA complements epigenome-wide approaches. Although our results were largely null, these findings provide a proof-of-concept for studying time-varying exposures and gene- or pathway-level epigenetic modifications.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

"35913571","Single-base methylome analysis reveals dynamic changes of genome-wide DNA methylation associated with rapid stem growth of woody bamboos.","Planta","CG and CHG methylation levels in the rapid shoot growth stages (ST2-ST4) of woody bamboos were obviously decreased, which might regulate the internode elongation during rapid shoot growth, while CHH methylation was strongly associated with shoot developmental time or age. DNA methylation plays a critical role in the regulation of plant growth and development. Woody bamboos have a unique trait of rapid stem growth resulted from internode elongation at the shooting period. However, it is still unclear whether DNA methylation significantly controls the bamboo rapid stem growth. Here we present whole-genome DNA methylation profiles of the paleotropical woody bamboo Bonia amplexicaulis at five newly defined stages of shoot growth, named ST1-ST5. We found that CG and CHG methylation levels in the rapid shoot growth stages (ST2-ST4) were significantly lower than in the incubation (ST1) and plateau stages (ST5). The changes in methylation levels mainly occurred in flanking regions of genes and gene body regions, and 23647 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identified between ST1 and rapid shoot growth stages (ST2-ST4). Combined with transcriptome analysis, we found that DMR-related genes enriched in the auxin and jasmonic acid (JA) signal transduction, and other pathways closely related to plant growth. Intriguingly, CHH methylation was not involved in the rapid shoot growth, but strongly associated with shoot developmental time by gradually accumulating in transposable elements (TEs) regions. Overall, our results reveal the importance of DNA methylation in regulating the bamboo rapid shoot growth and suggest a role of DNA methylation associated with development time or age in woody bamboos.© 2022.

The methylated island recovery assay (MIRA-seq) or methylated CpG-binding domain sequencing (MBD-seq) was used to define the genome-wide methylation profiles in aggressive cBCL in Golden Retrievers to determine if cBCL can be better defined by epigenetic changes than by DNA mutations. DNA hypermethylation patterns were relatively homogenous within cBCL samples in Golden Retrievers, in different breeds and in geographical regions. Aberrant hypermethylation is thus suspected to be a central and early event in cBCL lymphomagenesis. Distinct subgroups within cBCL in Golden Retrievers were not identified with DNA methylation profiles. In comparison, the methylome profile of human DLBCL (hDLBCL) is relatively heterogeneous. Only moderate similarity between hDLBCL and cBCL was seen and cBCL likely cannot be accurately classified into the subtypes seen in hDLBCL. Genes with hypermethylated regions in the promoter-TSS-first exon of cBCL compared to normal B cells often also had additional hyper- and hypomethylated regions distributed throughout the gene suggesting non-randomized repeat targeting of key genes by epigenetic mechanisms. The prevalence of hypermethylation in transcription factor families in aggressive cBCL may represent a fundamental step in lymphomagenesis."

Here we present data from seven RTs from three pediatric patients who all had multi-organ involvement. The tumors were analyzed using a multimodal molecular approach, which included exome sequencing of tumor and germline comparator and RNA sequencing and DNA array-based methylation profiling of tumors.SMARCB1germline alterations were identified in all patients and in all tumors. We observed a second hit inSMARCB1 viachr22 loss of heterozygosity. By methylation profiling, all tumors were classified as rhabdoid tumors with a corresponding subclassification within the MYC, TYR, or SHH AT/RT subgroups. Using RNA-seq gene expression clustering, we recapitulated the classification of known AT/RT subgroups. Synchronous brain and kidney tumors from the same patient showed different patterns of either copy number variants, single-nucleotide variants, and/or genome-wide DNA methylation, suggestive of non-clonal origin. Furthermore, we demonstrated that a lung and abdominal metastasis from two patients shared overlapping molecular features with the patient's primary kidney tumor, indicating the likely origin of the metastasis. In addition to theSMARCB1events, we identified other whole-chromosome events and single-nucleotide variants in tumors, but none were found to be prognostic, diagnostic, or offer therapeutic potential for rhabdoid tumors. While our findings are of biological interest, there may also be clinical value in comprehensive molecular profiling in patients with multiple rhabdoid tumors, particularly given the potential prognostic and therapeutic implications for different rhabdoid tumor subgroups demonstrated in recent clinical trials and other large cohort studies.Copyright © 2022 Miller, Wheeler, LaHaye, Schieffer, Cearlock, Venkata, Bravo, Grischow, Kelly, White, Pierson, Boué, Koo, Klawinski, Ranalli, Shaikhouni, Salloum, Shatara, Leonard, Wilson, Cottrell, Mardis and Koboldt."
"35912111","Epigenetic Regulation of Phenotypic Sexual Plasticity Inducing Skewed Sex Ratio in Zebrafish.","Front Cell Dev Biol","The plasticity of sexual phenotype in response to environmental conditions results in biased sex ratios, and their variation has an effect on population dynamics. Epigenetic modifications can modulate sex ratio variation in species, where sex is determined by genetic and environmental factors. However, the role of epigenetic mechanisms underlying skewed sex ratios is far from being clear and is still an object of debate in evolutionary developmental biology. In this study, we used zebrafish as a model animal to investigate the effect of DNA methylation on sex ratio variation in sex-biased families in response to environmental temperature. Two sex-biased families with a significant difference in sex ratio were selected for genome-wide DNA methylation analysis using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS). The results showed significant genome-wide methylation differences between male-biased and female-biased families, with a greater number of methylated CpG sites in testes than ovaries. Likewise, pronounced differences between testes and ovaries were identified within both families, where the male-biased family exhibited a higher number of methylated sites than the female-biased family. The effect of temperature showed more methylated positions in the high incubation temperature than the control temperature. We found differential methylation of many reproduction-related genes (e.g.,sox9a, nr5a2, lhx8a, gata4) and genes involved in epigenetic mechanisms (e.g.,dnmt3bb.1, dimt1l,hdac11, h1m) in both families. We conclude that epigenetic modifications can influence the sex ratio variation in zebrafish families and may generate skewed sex ratios, which could have a negative consequence for population fitness in species with genotype-environment interaction sex-determining system under rapid environmental changes.Copyright © 2022 Hosseini, Trakooljul, Hirschfeld, Wimmers, Simianer, Tetens, Sharifi and Brenig."

Little is known about whether and how the assembly of root microbiota may be controlled by epigenetic regulation, which is crucial for gene transcription and genome stability. Here we show that dysfunction of the histone demethylase IBM1 (INCREASE IN BONSAI METHYLATION 1) in Arabidopsis thaliana substantially reshaped the root microbiota, with the majority of the significant amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) being decreased. Transcriptome analyses of plants grown in soil and in sterile growth medium jointly disclosed salicylic acid (SA)-mediated autoimmunity and production of the defense metabolite camalexin in the ibm1 mutants. Analyses of genome-wide histone modifications and DNA methylation highlighted epigenetic modifications permissive for transcription at several important defense regulators. Consistently, ibm1 mutants showed increased resistance to the pathogen Pseudomonas syringae DC3000 with stronger immune responses. In addition, ibm1 showed substantially impaired plant growth promotion in response to beneficial bacteria; the impairment was partially mimicked by exogenous application of SA to wild-type plants, and by a null mutation of AGP19 that is important for cell expansion and that is repressed with DNA hypermethylation in ibm1. IBM1-dependent epigenetic regulation imposes strong and broad impacts on plant-microbe interactions and thereby shapes the assembly of root microbiota.© 2022. The Author(s)."

Given the epigenetic modifications can contribute to an aberrant regulation of angiogenesis and microenvironment, we investigated DNA methylation profiles to determine clinical benefit of bevacizumab in NSCLC patients.Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling was performed in NSCLC patients treated with chemotherapy in combination with bevacizumab. Patients were divided into better prognosis group (A group) and inferior prognosis group (B group) based on their survival. The difference of methylation patterns and respective functional enrichment analysis were performed between two groups. Prognostic DNA methylation signature for bevacizumab was established with the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression analyses. TISIDB database was further used to infer immunological relationship for prognostic related DNA methylation.Twenty patients were included in this study, and significantly distinct methylation patterns were observed between patients with different prognosis. Related genes of different methylation regions were significantly enriched in the biological process of cell projection assembly, neutrophil mediated immunity, and pathway of VEGFA-VEGFR2 signaling pathway, neutrophil degranulation. A 10-gene DNA methylation signature for prognosis prediction was established with the C-index of 0.76. And host genes of signature were found to be related to the abundance of ActCD4, Th1, ActCD8, NKT and neutrophil cells.The 10-gene DNA methylation signature could serve as a novel biomarker to predict the clinical benefit of bevacizumab therapy and improve this anti-tumor approach for NSCLC patients.© 2022.

Previously, we investigated genome-wide DNA methylation alterations during MDS evolution to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) by next-generation sequencing (NGS). Herein, we further determined the role and clinical implications of an evident methylation change in CpG islands at the SLIT2 promoter identified by NGS. First, increased SLIT2 promoter methylation was validated in 11 paired MDS/AML patients during disease evolution. Additionally, SLIT2 promoter methylation was markedly increased in MDS/AML patients compared with controls and was correlated with poor clinical phenotype and outcome. Interestingly, SLIT2 expression was particularly upregulated in AML patients and was not correlated with SLIT2 promoter methylation. However, the SLIT2-embedded genes SLIT2-IT1 and miR-218 were downregulated in AML patients, which was negatively associated with SLIT2 promoter methylation and further validated by demethylation studies. Functionally, SLIT2-IT1/miR-218 overexpression exhibited antileukemic effects by affecting cell proliferation, apoptosis and colony formation in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, SLIT2-IT1 may function as a competing endogenous RNA by sponging miR-3156-3p to regulate BMF expression, whereas miR-218 may directly target HOXA1 in MDS progression. In summary, our findings demonstrate that SLIT2 promoter hypermethylation is associated with disease evolution in MDS and predicts poor prognoses in both MDS and AML. Epigenetic inactivation of SLIT2-IT1/miR-218 by SLIT2 promoter hypermethylation could be a promising therapeutic target in MDS.© 2022.

"35904121","Functional correlation of genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in genetic neurodevelopmental disorders.","Hum Mutat","An expanding range of genetic syndromes are characterized by genome-wide disruptions in DNA methylation profiles referred to as episignatures. Episignatures are distinct, highly sensitive and specific biomarkers that have recently been applied in clinical diagnosis of genetic syndromes. Episignatures are contained within the broader disorder-specific genome-wide DNA methylation changes which can share significant overlap amongst different conditions. In this study we performed functional genomic assessment and comparison of disorder-specific and overlapping genome-wide DNA methylation changes related to 65 genetic syndromes with previously described episignatures. We demonstrate evidence of disorder-specific and recurring genome-wide differentially methylated probes (DMPs) and regions (DMRs). The overall distribution of DMPs and DMRs across the majority of the neurodevelopmental genetic syndromes analyzed showed substantial enrichment in gene promoters and CpG islands, and under-representation of the more variable intergenic regions. Analysis showed significant enrichment of the DMPs and DMRs in gene pathways and processes related to neurodevelopment, including neurogenesis, synaptic signaling and synaptic transmission. This study expands beyond the diagnostic utility of DNA methylation episignatures by demonstrating correlation between the function of the mutated genes and the consequent genomic DNA methylation profiles as a key functional element in the molecular etiology of genetic neurodevelopmental disorders.

"35899434","Socioeconomic changes predict genome-wide DNA methylation in childhood.","Hum Mol Genet","Childhood socioeconomic position (SEP) is a major determinant of health and well-being across the entire life course. To effectively prevent and reduce health risks related to SEP, it is critical to better understand when and under what circumstances socioeconomic adversity shapes biological processes. DNA methylation (DNAm) is one such mechanism for how early life adversity 'gets under the skin'. In this study, we evaluated the dynamic relationship between SEP and DNAm across childhood using data from 946 mother-child pairs in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). We assessed six SEP indicators spanning financial, occupational, and residential domains during very-early childhood (ages 0-2), early childhood (ages 3-5), and middle childhood (ages 6-7). Epigenome-wide DNAm were measured at 412956 CpGs from peripheral blood at age 7. Using an innovative two-stage structured life course modeling approach, we tested three life-course hypotheses for how SEP shapes DNAm profiles-accumulation, sensitive period, and mobility. We showed that changes in the socioeconomic environment were associated with the greatest differences in DNAm, and that middle childhood may be a potential sensitive period when socioeconomic instability is especially important in shaping DNAm. Top SEP-related DNAm CpGs were overrepresented in genes involved in pathways important for neural development, immune function, and metabolic processes. Our findings highlight the importance of socioeconomic stability during childhood and if replicated, may emphasize the need for public programs to help children and families experiencing socioeconomic instability and other forms of socioeconomic adversity.© The Author(s) 2022.

Unfortunately, PCR-based testing has limitations and may not result in a positive test early in the course of infection before symptoms develop. Enveloped RNA viruses, such as coronaviruses, alter peripheral blood methylation and DNA methylation signatures may characterize asymptomatic versus symptomatic infection. We used Illumina's Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip array to profile peripheral blood samples from 164 patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR, of whom 8 had no symptoms. Epigenome-wide association analysis identified 10 methylation sites associated with infection and a quantile-quantile plot showed little inflation.

Here, we examined genome-wide DNA methylation in chorionic villi and decidual tissues from patients suffering RM and from healthy women who had undergone artificial abortion (n = 5 each). We found that 13,426 and 5816 CpG sites were differentially methylated in chorionic villi and decidua, respectively. DNA methylation profiles of chorionic villi, but not decidua, in RM patients was clearly distinct from AA controls. Among the differentially methylated genes, the enhancer region of SPATS2L was significantly more highly methylated in RM patients (n = 19) than AA controls (n = 19; mean methylation level, 52.0%-vs.-28.9%, P < 0.001), resulting in reduced expression of SPATS2L protein in the former. Functionally, depletion of SPATS2L in extravillous trophoblast cells decreased their invasion and migration abilities. Our data indicate that particularly the chorionic villi in RM patients exhibit distinct DNA methylation profiles compared with normal pregnancies and that this changed DNA methylation status may impede the progression of embryo development via the altered expression of genes such as SPATS2L in the villi.© 2022.

"35895726","Classification of follicular-patterned thyroid lesions using a minimal set of epigenetic biomarkers.","Eur J Endocrinol","The minimally invasive fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) is the current gold standard for the diagnosis of thyroid nodule malignancy. However, the correct discrimination of follicular neoplasia often requires more invasive diagnostic techniques. The lack of suitable immunohistochemical markers to distinguish between follicular thyroid carcinoma and other types of follicular-derived lesions complicates diagnosis, and despite most of these tumours being surgically resected, only a small number will test positive for malignancy. As such, the development of new orthogonal diagnostic approaches may improve the accuracy of diagnosing thyroid nodules.This study includes a retrospective, multi-centre training cohort including 54 fresh-frozen follicular-patterned thyroid samples and two independent, multi-centre validation cohorts of 103 snap-frozen biopsies and 33 FNAC samples, respectively.We performed a genome-wide genetic and epigenetic profiling of 54 fresh-frozen follicular-patterned thyroid samples using exome sequencing and the Illumina Human DNA Methylation EPIC platform. An extensive validation was performed using the bisulfite pyrosequencing technique.Using a random forest approach, we developed a three-CpG marker-based diagnostic model that was subsequently validated using bisulfite pyrosequencing experiments. According to the validation cohort, this cost-effective method discriminates between benign and malignant nodules with a sensitivity and specificity of 97 and 88%, respectively (positive predictive value (PPV): 0.85, negative predictive value (NPV): 0.98).Our classification system based on a minimal set of epigenetic biomarkers can complement the potential of the diagnostic techniques currently available and would prioritize a considerable number of surgical interventions that are often performed due to uncertain cytology.In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the number of people diagnosed with thyroid nodules. The current challenge is their etiological diagnosis to discount malignancy without resorting to thyroidectomy. The method proposed here, based on DNA pyrosequencing assays, has high sensitivity (0.97) and specificity (0.88) for the identification of malignant thyroid nodules. This simple and cost-effective approach can complement expert pathologist evaluation to prioritize the classification of difficult-to-diagnose follicular-patterned thyroid lesions and track tumor evolution, including real-time monitoring of treatment efficacy, thereby stimulating adherence to health promotion programs."

Participants were located in multiple centers. This study was restricted to women with genome-wide DNA methylation data, generated from baseline blood samples within 3 WHI ancillary studies. Median (IQR) follow-up times from baseline were 21.6 (19.6-22.9) years and 21.4 (19.8-22.7) years for women who survived to age 90 years with and without intact mobility, respectively, and 13.2 (8.8-16.7) for women who did not survive to age 90 years. Data were analyzed from December 2020 to July 2021.EAA was estimated using 4 established ""clocks"": Horvath pantissue, Hannum, Pheno, and Grim.Using multinomial logistic regression, odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs were estimated for 3 healthy longevity outcomes for each clock: survival to age 90 years with intact mobility, survival to age 90 years without intact mobility, and no survival to age 90 years.Among 1813 women, there were 464 women (mean [SD] age at baseline, 71.6 [3.5] years) who survived to age 90 years with intact mobility and cognitive functioning, 420 women (mean [SD] age at baseline, 71.3 [3.2] years) who survived to age 90 years without intact mobility and cognitive functioning, and 929 women (mean [SD] age at baseline, 70.2 [3.4] years) who did not survive to age 90 years. Women who survived to age 90 years with intact mobility and cognitive function were healthier at baseline compared with women who survived without those outcomes or who did not survive to age 90 years (eg, 143 women [30.8%] vs 101 women [24.0%] and 202 women [21.7%] with 0 chronic conditions). The odds of surviving to age 90 years with intact mobility were lower for every 1 SD increase in EAA compared with those who did not survive to age 90 years as measured by AgeAccelHorvath (OR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.69-0.96; P = .01), AgeAccelHannum (OR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.56-0.80; P < .001), AgeAccelPheno (OR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.51-0.72; P < .001), and AgeAccelGrim (OR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.55-0.84; P < .001). ORs were similar for women who survived to age 90 years with intact mobility and cognitive function (eg, AgeAccelHorvath: OR per 1 SD increase in EAA, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.71-0.98; P = .03) compared with women who did not survive to age 90 years.These findings suggest that EAA may be a valid biomarker associated with healthy longevity among older women and may be used for risk stratification and risk estimation of future functional and cognitive aging. Outcomes suggest that future studies may focus on the potential for public health interventions to counteract EAA and its association with poor health outcomes to lower disease burden while increasing longevity."

Analysis of DNA methylation profiles has been shown to be a reliable method to classify central nervous system (CNS) tumours with high accuracy. We aimed to prospectively analyse CNS tumours diagnosed in Sweden, to assess the clinical impact of adding DNA methylation-based classification to standard paediatric brain tumour diagnostics in an unselected cohort.All CNS tumours diagnosed in children (0-18 years) during 2017-2020 were eligible for inclusion provided sufficient tumour material was available. Tumours were analysed using genome-wide DNA methylation profiling and classified by the MNP brain tumour classifier. The initial histopathological diagnosis was compared with the DNA methylation-based classification. For incongruent results, a blinded re-evaluation was performed by an experienced neuropathologist.Two hundred forty tumours with a histopathology-based diagnosis were profiled. A high-confidence methylation score of 0.84 or more was reached in 78% of the cases. In 69%, the histopathological diagnosis was confirmed, and for some of these also refined, 6% were incongruent, and the re-evaluation favoured the methylation-based classification. In the remaining 3% of cases, the methylation class was non-contributory. The change in diagnosis would have had a direct impact on the clinical management in 5% of all patients.Integrating DNA methylation-based tumour classification into routine clinical analysis improves diagnostics and provides molecular information that is important for treatment decisions.

We recently demonstrated that VB12 oral supplementation coordinates ileal epithelial cells (iECs) and gut microbiota functions to resist pathogen colonization in mice, but it remains unclear whether VB12 directly modulates the cellular homeostasis of iECs derived from humans. Here, we integrated transcriptomic, metabolomic, and epigenomic analyses to identify VB12-dependent molecular and metabolic pathways in human iEC microtissue cultures. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) revealed that VB12 notably activated genes involved in fatty acid metabolism and epithelial cell proliferation while suppressing inflammatory responses in human iECs. Untargeted metabolite profiling demonstrated that VB12 facilitated the biosynthesis of amino acids and methyl groups, particularlyS-adenosylmethionine (SAM), and supported the function of the mitochondrial carnitine shuttle and TCA cycle. Further, genome-wide DNA methylation analysis illuminated a critical role of VB12 in sustaining cellular methylation programs, leading to differential CpG methylation of genes associated with intestinal barrier function and cell proliferation. Together, these findings suggest an essential involvement of VB12 in directing the fatty acid and mitochondrial metabolisms and reconfiguring the epigenome of human iECs to potentially support cellular oxygen utilization and cell proliferation."

Three metabotype clusters were identified using four standard clinical parameters and BMI. Regression models were used to associate diet and DNA methylation, and to test for effect modification. Few significant signals were identified in the basic analysis while many significant signals were observed in models including food group-metabotype interaction terms. Most findings refer to interactions of food intake with metabotype 3, which is the metabotype with the most unfavorable metabolic profile. This research highlights the importance of the metabolic characteristics of subjects when identifying associations between diet and white blood cell DNA methylation in EWAS."

However, its genome reference has not been annotated for epigenetic markers affecting various biological processes, including muscle growth/atrophy. Increased energetic demands during gonadogenesis/reproduction provoke muscle atrophy in rainbow trout. We described DNA methylation and its associated gene expression in atrophying muscle by comparing gravid, diploid females to sterile, triploid females. Methyl Mini-seq and RNA-Seq were simultaneously used to characterize genome-wide DNA methylation and its association with gene expression in rainbow trout muscle. Genome-wide enrichment in the number of CpGs, accompanied by depleted methylation levels, was noticed around the gene transcription start site (TSS). Hypermethylation of CpG sites within ±1 kb on both sides of TSS (promoter and gene body) was weakly/moderately associated with reduced gene expression. Conversely, hypermethylation of the CpG sites in downstream regions of the gene body +2 to +10 kb was weakly associated with increased gene expression. Unlike mammalian genomes, rainbow trout gene promotors are poor in CpG islands, at &lt;1% compared to 60%. No signs of genome-wide, differentially methylated (DM) CpGs were observed due to the polyploidy effect; only 1206 CpGs (0.03%) were differentially methylated, and these were primarily associated with muscle atrophy. Twenty-eight genes exhibited differential gene expression consistent with methylation levels of 31 DM CpGs. These 31 DM CpGs represent potential epigenetic markers of muscle atrophy in rainbow trout. The DM CpG-harboring genes are involved in apoptosis, epigenetic regulation, autophagy, collagen metabolism, cell membrane functions, and Homeobox proteins. Our study also identified genes explaining higher water content and modulated glycolysis previously shown as characteristic biochemical signs of rainbow trout muscle atrophy associated with sexual maturation. This study characterized DNA methylation in the rainbow trout genome and its correlation with gene expression. This work also identified novel epigenetic markers associated with muscle atrophy in fish/lower vertebrates."

We identified significant differences in the burden of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in tumors from BRCA1/2 compared to non-BRCA1/2 carriers (mean 659 DMRs and 388 DMRs in paired comparisons respectively). We identified overexpression of immune pathways in BRCA1/2 carriers compared to non-carriers, implicating an increased immune response in improved survival (P = 0.006) in these BRCA1/2 carriers.These findings indicate methylome and gene expression programs established in the primary tumor are conserved throughout disease progression, even after extensive chemotherapy treatment, and that changes in methylation and gene expression are unlikely to serve as drivers for chemoresistance in HGSOC.© 2022.

Epigenetic DNA methylation patterns can evaluate acceleration of biological age relative to chronological age. The impact of initial HIV infection on five epigenetic measures of aging was examined before and approximately 3 years after HIV infection in the same individuals (n=102). Significant epigenetic age acceleration (median 1.9-4.8 years) and estimated telomere length shortening (all p≤0.001) were observed from pre-to post-HIV infection, and remained significant in three epigenetic measures after controlling for T cell changes. No acceleration was seen in age- and time interval-matched HIV-uninfected controls. Changes in genome-wide co-methylation clusters were also significantly associated with initial HIV infection (p≤ 2.0 × 10-4). These longitudinal observations clearly demonstrate an early and substantial impact of HIV infection on the epigenetic aging process, and suggest a role for HIV itself in the earlier onset of clinical aging.© 2022 The Author(s)."

This is especially important in older adults whose vitamin D deficiency occurs with a high prevalence. This study aimed to examine the influence of lifestyle and vitamin D on global DNA methylation patterns in an elderly cohort in Southwest of Sweden. We also sought to examine the methylation levels of specific genes involved in vitamin D's molecular and metabolic activated pathways. We performed a genome wide methylation analysis, using Illumina Infinium DNA Methylation EPIC 850kBeadChip array, on 277 healthy individuals from Southwest Sweden at the age of 70-95. The study participants also answered queries on lifestyle, vitamin intake, heart medication, and estimated health. Vitamin D intake did not in general affect methylation patterns, which is in concert with other studies. However, when comparing the group of individuals taking vitamin supplements, including vitamin D, with those not taking supplements, a difference in methylation in the solute carrier family 25 (SCL25A24) gene was found. This confirms a previous finding, where changes in expression of SLC25A24 were associated with vitamin D treatment in human monocytes. The combination of vitamin D intake and high physical activity increased methylation of genes linked to regulation of vitamin D receptor pathway, the Wnt pathway and general cancer processes. To our knowledge, this is the first study detecting epigenetic markers associated with the combined effects of vitamin D supplementation and high physical activity.

We demonstrated distinct 6mA methylation levels and 6mA distribution patterns in different types of transcription genes, which hinted at different epigenetic rules. Furthermore, the moderate 6mA density genes inP. vaginatumfunctionally correlated with stress resistance, which also maintained a higher transcriptional level. On the other hand, a specific 6mA distribution pattern in the gene body and near TSS was observed in gene groups with higher RNA expression, which maybe implied some kind of regularity between 6mA site distribution and the protein coding genes transcription was possible. Our study provides new insights into the association between 6mA methylation and gene expression, which may also contribute to key agronomic traits inP. vaginatum.Copyright © 2022 Hao, Xing, Hu, Wang, Tang and Liao."
"35870943","Epigenetic silencing and tumor suppressor gene of HAND2 by targeting ERK signaling in colorectal cancer.","Cell Commun Signal","The screening biomarkers for early detection of colorectal cancer (CRC) is lacking. The aim is to identify epigenetic silenced genes and clarify its roles and underlying mechanism in CRC. We conducted integrative analyses of epigenome-wide Human Methylation 450 K arrays and transcriptome to screen out candidate epigenetic driver genes with transcription silencing. Methylated silencing HAND2 were identified and verified in large CRC cohort. The mechanism of HAND2 expression by promoter inhibition were clarified both in vitro and vivo assays. Cell biofunctional roles of HAND2 methylation was investigated in CRC cells. HAND2 reconstitution were constructed by lentivirus plasmid and tumor xenograft model of HAND2 were built subcutaneously. Genomic mRNA analysis by RNA-sequencing and subsequent GSEA analysis were performed to identify potential target of HAND2 and qPCR/WB was conducted to identify the results.We firstly reported high frequency of HAND2 methylation in promoter in CRC and hypermethylation was negatively correlated with expression silencing and leaded to poor survival in several CRC cohort patients. 5-Aza treatment to demethylated HAND2 could revert its expression in CRC cells. Functionally, HAND2 reconstitution can inhibit cell proliferation, invasion and migration in vitro. In tumor xenograft, HAND2 reconstruction significantly repressed tumor growth when compared to control vector. Thousands of aberrant expressed genes were observed in the heatmap of RNA-sequencing data. HAND2 reconstitution could bind to ERK and reduce its phosphorylation by CoIP assay. These above results showed HAND2 reconstitution perturbed the activation of MAPK/ERK signaling by reduction of ERK phosphorylation.HAND2 is one tumor suppressor by targeting ERK signaling and one potential epigenetic driver gene in CRC.

"35870905","EpiVisR: exploratory data analysis and visualization in epigenome-wide association analyses.","BMC Bioinformatics","With the widespread availability of microarray technology for epigenetic research, methods for calling differentially methylated probes or differentially methylated regions have become effective tools to analyze this type of data. Furthermore, visualization is usually employed for quality check of results and for further insights. Expert knowledge is required to leverage capabilities of these methods. To overcome this limitation and make visualization in epigenetic research available to the public, we designed EpiVisR.The EpiVisR tool allows to select and visualize combinations of traits (i.e., concentrations of chemical compounds) and differentially methylated probes/regions. It supports various modes of enriched presentation to get the most knowledge out of existing data: (1) enriched Manhattan plot and enriched volcano plot for selection of probes, (2) trait-methylation plot for visualization of selected trait values against methylation values, (3) methylation profile plot for visualization of a selected range of probes against selected trait values as well as, (4) correlation profile plot for selection and visualization of further probes that are correlated to the selected probe. EpiVisR additionally allows exporting selected data to external tools for tasks such as network analysis.The key advantage of EpiVisR is the annotation of data in the enriched plots (and tied tables) as well as linking to external data sources for further integrated data analysis. Using the EpiVisR approach will allow users to integrate data from traits with epigenetic analyses that are connected by belonging to the same individuals. Merging data from various data sources among the same cohort and visualizing them will enable users to gain more insights from existing data.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35870268","Ovarian transcriptome analysis of diploid and triploid rainbow trout revealed new pathways related to gonadal development and fertility.","Animal","Triploidisation represents several advantages (e.g. sterility) and therefore is routinely applied in aquaculture of several commercially important fish species, including rainbow trout. The comparative transcriptomic analysis of ovaries of triploid (3N) and diploid (2N) female rainbow trout revealed a total of 9 075 differentially expressed genes (DEGs; 4 105 genes upregulated in 2N and 4 970 genes upregulated in 3N ovaries, respectively). Identified clusters for DEGs upregulated in 3N and 2N ovaries were different, including carbohydrate and lipid metabolic process and transport, protein modification, signalling (related to folliculogenesis) and response to stimulus for DEGs upregulated in 2N, and developmental process, signalling (related to apoptosis, cellular senescence and adherence junctions) and regulation of RNA metabolic process for DEGs upregulated in 3N. The enrichment of processes involved in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in 2N ovaries indicated high metabolism of ovarian tissue and the energy reservoir generation indispensable during the earliest stages of development. Our results highlight the importance of oocyte hydration along with oestrogen, insulin, leptin, fibroblast growth factor, and Notch signalling and pathways related to the regulation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels in proper oocyte meiotic maturation prior to ovulation in 2N ovaries. Conversely, triploidisation may lead to an increase in ovarian cellular senescence and apoptosis, which in turn can result in abnormal gonadal morphology and fibrosis. The downregulation of genes responsible for the precise regulation of meiosis and proper chromosome segregation during meiosis probably affects meiotic maturation via irregular meiotic division of chromosomes. The induction of triploidy of the rainbow trout genome resulted in enhanced expression of male-specific genes, genes responsible for re-establishing the transcriptional balance after genome reorganisation and genes involved in regulatory mechanisms, including gene silencing and DNA methylation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first genome-wide investigation providing in-depth comprehensive and comparative gene expression patterns in the ovary from 2N and 3N rainbow trout females helping in elucidating the molecular mechanisms leading to impaired gonadal development and sterility of female triploids.Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

Genome-wide DNA methylation was profiled and four epigenetic clocks, including epigenetic clocks of chronological age, mortality and telomere length were calculated. Patients that relapsed during the follow-up showed epigenetic acceleration of the telomere length clock (p = 0.030). Shorter telomere length was associated with cognitive performance (working memory, r = 0.31 p = 0.015; verbal fluency, r = 0.28 p = 0.028), but no direct effect of cognitive function or symptom severity on relapse was detected. The results of the present study suggest that epigenetic age acceleration could be involved in the clinical course of schizophrenia and could be a useful marker of relapse when measured in remission stages.© 2022.

"35860865","Evidence of chromatin and transcriptional dynamics for cold development in peach flower bud.","New Phytol","• In temperate zones, fruit trees regulate their annual growth cycle to seasonal environmental changes. During the cold season, growth is limited by both environmental and genetic factors. After the exposure to low temperature and fulfillment of chilling requirements, mild temperatures promote the growth and flowering. However, an insufficient chilling exposure may lead to non-uniform blooming, with a negative impact on fruit set. • To gain insights into the flower development in the fruit tree buds, peach is an interesting model, flower and vegetative bud being distinct organs. To understand how flower bud development is regulated, we integrated cytological observations, epigenetic and chromatin genome wide data with transcriptional changes, to identify the main regulatory factors involved in flower development during chilling accumulation. • We demonstrated that there is not growth cessation in peach flower buds during chilling accumulation, but there are changes in transcript level of key genes of hormone metabolism and flower bud development, in distribution of histone modifications (H3K4me3 and H3K27me3), and DNA methylation. • All together our findings indicate that during the cold season flower bud is in a non-dormant status and that the chilling experience allows flower differentiation to be completed.This article is protected by copyright.

We performed epigenome-wide association analyses (n = 223) to estimate associations between maternal active or inactive asthma, as compared to never asthma, and placental differentially methylated positions (DMPs) and differentially variable positions (DVPs). Models adjusted for maternal pre-pregnancy body mass index, smoking status, parity, age and education level and child sex. P-values were FDR-adjusted.One hundred and fifty-nine (71.3%) pregnant women reported no history of asthma (never asthma), 15 (6.7%) reported inactive, and 49 (22%) reported active antenatal asthma. Women predominantly self-identified as Black/Hispanic Black [88 (39.5%)] and Hispanic/non-Black [42 (18.8%)]. We identified 10 probes at FDR<0.05 and 4 probes at FDR<0.10 characterized by higher variability in maternal active asthma compared to never asthma mapping to GPX3, LHPP, PECAM1, ATAD3C, and ARHGEF4 and 2 probes characterized by lower variation mapping to CHMP4A and C5orf24. Amongst women with inactive asthma, we identified 52 probes, 41 at FDR<0.05 and an additional 11 at FDR <0.10, with higher variability compared to never asthma; BMP4, LHPP, PHYHIPL, and ZSCAN23 were associated with multiple DVPs. No associations were observed with DMPs.We observed alterations in placental DNAm in women with antenatal asthma, as compared to women without a history of asthma.

"35856716","High-dimension to high-dimension screening for detecting genome-wide epigenetic and noncoding RNA regulators of gene expression.","Bioinformatics","The advancement of high-throughput technology characterizes a wide variety of epigenetic modifications and noncoding RNAs across the genome involved in disease pathogenesis via regulating gene expression. The high-dimensionality of both epigenetic/noncoding RNA and gene expression data make it challenging to identify the important regulators of genes. Conducting univariate test for each possible regulator-gene pair is subject to serious multiple comparison burden, and direct application of regularization methods to select regulator-gene pairs is computationally infeasible. Applying fast screening to reduce dimension first before regularization is more efficient and stable than applying regularization methods alone.We propose a novel screening method based on robust partial correlation to detect epigenetic and noncoding RNA regulators of gene expression over the whole genome, a problem that includes both high-dimensional predictors and high-dimensional responses. Compared to existing screening methods, our method is conceptually innovative that it reduces the dimension of both predictor and response, and screens at both node (regulators or genes) and edge (regulator-gene pairs) levels. We develop data-driven procedures to determine the conditional sets and the optimal screening threshold, and implement a fast iterative algorithm. Simulations and applications to long non-coding RNA and microRNA regulation in Kidney cancer and DNA methylation regulation in Glioblastoma Multiforme illustrate the validity and advantage of our method.The R package, related source codes and real data sets used in this paper are provided at https://github.com/kehongjie/rPCor.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.© The Author(s) (2022).

Five indices of DNA methylation age (DNAm age) were calculated, i.e. Horvath clock, Hannum clock, DNAm PhenoAge, GrimAge and Li clock. Epigenetic AA was defined as the residual of regressing DNAm age on chronological age. Lifestyle factors studied included smoking status, alcohol consumption, eating habits, physical activity level and body shape defined by a combination of BMI and waist circumference. Cardiometabolic risk factors included blood pressure, blood glucose level and total cholesterol level. Linear regression model was used to analyze the association of lifestyle and cardiometabolic risk factors with AA (β).Results:GrimAge_AA was associated with smoking status, alcohol consumption, physical activity level and BMI. Compared with non-smokers, non-drinkers, or participants with BMI of 18.5- 23.9 kg/m2, the smokers who smoked 1-14 cigarettes/day (β=0.71, 95%CI: 0.57-0.86), 15-24 cigarettes/day (β=0.88, 95%CI: 0.73-1.03), and ≥25 cigarettes/day (β=0.99, 95%CI: 0.81-1.18), respectively, heavy drinkers with daily pure alcohol consumption ≥60 g (β=0.33, 95%CI: 0.11-0.55) and participants with BMI<18.5 kg/m2(β=0.23, 95%CI: 0.03-0.43) showed accelerated aging. Compared with those in the lowest quintile of physical activity level, participants in the top three quintile of physical activity level showed decelerated aging (β=-0.13, 95%CI: -0.26-0.01,β=-0.12, 95%CI: -0.26-0.02, andβ=-0.14, 95%CI: -0.27- -0.00, respectively). GrimAge_AA decreased with the increase of the number of healthy lifestyle factors (P<0.001). Compared with the participants with 0 to 1 healthy lifestyle factor, theβof those with 2, 3, or 4 to 5 healthy lifestyle factors were -0.30 (95%CI: -0.47- -0.12), -0.47 (95%CI: -0.65- -0.30) and -0.72 (95%CI: -0.90- -0.53), respectively. The other four indices were not statistically significantly associated with most lifestyle factors. None of the five indices of AA was associated with blood pressure, blood glucose level or total cholesterol level.Conclusion:People with unhealthy lifestyle showed accelerated epigenetic aging, that is, the predicted DNAm age is older than their own chronological age."

Currently, the JmjC domain-containing proteins have been reported in many species; however, they have not been systematically studied in grapes. In this paper, 21 VviJMJ gene family members were identified from the whole grape genome, and the VviJMJ genes were classified into five subfamilies: KDM3, KDM4, KDM5, JMJD6, and JMJ-only based on the phylogenetic relationship and structural features of Arabidopsis and grape. After that, the conserved sites of VviJMJ genes were revealed by protein sequence analysis. In addition, chromosomal localization and gene structure analysis revealed the heterogeneous distribution of VviJMJ genes on grape chromosomes and the structural features of VviJMJ genes, respectively. Analysis of promoter cis-acting elements demonstrated numerous hormone, light, and stress response elements in the promoter region of the VviJMJ genes. Subsequently, the grape fruit was treated with MTA (an H3K4 methylation inhibitor), which significantly resulted in the early ripening of grape fruits. The qRT-PCR analysis showed that VviJMJ genes (except VviJMJ13c) had different expression patterns during grape fruit development. The expression of VviJMJ genes in the treatment group was significantly higher than that in the control group. The results indicate that VviJMJ genes are closely related to grape fruit ripening.© 2022. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

This study aimed to investigate the role of DNA methylation in SALS using whole blood of SALS patients.In total, 32 SALS patients and 32 healthy controls were enrolled in this study. DNA was isolated from whole blood collected from the participants. DNA methylation profiles were generated using Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip.We identified 34 significant differentially methylated positions (DMPs) in whole blood from SALS patients, compared with the healthy controls. Of these DMPs, five were hypermethylated and 29 were hypomethylated; they corresponded to 13 genes. For the DMPs, ATAD3B and BLK were hypermethylated, whereas DDO, IQCE, ABCB1, DNAH9, FIGN, NRP1, TMEM87B, CCSAP, ST6GALNAC5, MYOM2, and RUSC1-AS1 were hypomethylated. We also identified 12 differentially methylated regions (DMRs), related to 12 genes (NWD1, LDHD, CIS, IQCE, TNF, PDE1C, LGALS1, CSNK1E, LRRC23, ENO2, ELOVL2, and ELOVL2-AS1). According to data from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database, DNAH9 and TNF are involved in the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) pathway. Correlation analysis between clinical features and DNA methylation profiling indicated that the methylation level of ELOVL2 and ARID1B was positively associated with the age of onset (r = 0.86, adjust P  = 0.001) and disease duration (r = 0.83, adjust P  = 0.01), respectively.We found aberrant methylation in DMP- and DMR-related genes, implying that many epigenetic alterations, such as the hypomethylation of DNAH9 and TNF, play important roles in ALS etiology.

"35850911","Effect of menopausal hormone therapy on methylation levels in early and late postmenopausal women.","Clin Epigenetics","Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death among postmenopausal women but standard primary prevention strategies in women are not as effective as in men. By comparison, the Early versus Late Intervention Trial with Estradiol (ELITE) study demonstrated that hormone therapy (HT) was associated with significant reduction in atherosclerosis progression in women who were within six years of menopause compared to those who were 10 or more years from menopause. These findings are consistent with other studies showing significant reductions in all-cause mortality and CVD with HT, particularly when initiated in women younger than 60 years of age or within 10 years since menopause. To explore the biological mechanisms underlying the age-related atheroprotective effects of HT, we investigated changes in methylation of blood cells of postmenopausal women who participated in ELITE.We first validated the epigenetic data generated from blood leukocytes of ELITE participants by replicating previously known associations between smoking and methylation levels at previously identified CpG sites, such as cg05575921 at the AHRR locus. An epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) evaluating changes in methylation through interactions with time-since-menopause and HT revealed two significantly associated CpG sites on chromosomes 12 (cg19552895; p = 1.1 × 10-9) and 19 (cg18515510; p = 2.4 × 10-8). Specifically, HT resulted in modest, but significant, increases in methylation levels at both CpGs but only in women who were 10 or more years since menopause and randomized to HT. Changes in carotid artery intima-media thickness (CIMT) from baseline to 36 months after HT were not significantly correlated with changes in methylation levels at either cg19552895 or cg18515510. Evaluation of other previously identified CpG sites at which methylation levels in either blood or vascular tissue were associated with atherosclerosis also did not reveal any differences in methylation as a function of HT and time-since-menopause or with changes in CIMT.We identified specific methylation differences in blood in response to HT among women who were 10 or more years since menopause. The functional consequence of these change with respect to atherosclerosis progression and protective effects of HT remains to be determined and will require additional studies.© 2022.

"35843982","Adipose methylome integrative-omic analyses reveal genetic and dietary metabolic health drivers and insulin resistance classifiers.","Genome Med","There is considerable evidence for the importance of the DNA methylome in metabolic health, for example, a robust methylation signature has been associated with body mass index (BMI). However, visceral fat (VF) mass accumulation is a greater risk factor for metabolic disease than BMI alone. In this study, we dissect the subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) methylome signature relevant to metabolic health by focusing on VF as the major risk factor of metabolic disease. We integrate results with genetic, blood methylation, SAT gene expression, blood metabolomic, dietary intake and metabolic phenotype data to assess and quantify genetic and environmental drivers of the identified signals, as well as their potential functional roles.Epigenome-wide association analyses were carried out to determine visceral fat mass-associated differentially methylated positions (VF-DMPs) in SAT samples from 538 TwinsUK participants. Validation and replication were performed in 333 individuals from 3 independent cohorts. To assess functional impacts of the VF-DMPs, the association between VF and gene expression was determined at the genes annotated to the VF-DMPs and an association analysis was carried out to determine whether methylation at the VF-DMPs is associated with gene expression. Further epigenetic analyses were carried out to compare methylation levels at the VF-DMPs as the response variables and a range of different metabolic health phenotypes including android:gynoid fat ratio (AGR), lipids, blood metabolomic profiles, insulin resistance, T2D and dietary intake variables. The results from all analyses were integrated to identify signals that exhibit altered SAT function and have strong relevance to metabolic health.We identified 1181 CpG positions in 788 genes to be differentially methylated with VF (VF-DMPs) with significant enrichment in the insulin signalling pathway. Follow-up cross-omic analysis of VF-DMPs integrating genetics, gene expression, metabolomics, diet, and metabolic traits highlighted VF-DMPs located in 9 genes with strong relevance to metabolic disease mechanisms, with replication of signals in FASN, SREBF1, TAGLN2, PC and CFAP410. PC methylation showed evidence for mediating effects of diet on VF. FASN DNA methylation exhibited putative causal effects on VF that were also strongly associated with insulin resistance and methylation levels in FASN better classified insulin resistance (AUC=0.91) than BMI or VF alone.Our findings help characterise the adiposity-associated methylation signature of SAT, with insights for metabolic disease risk.© 2022.

Here, we conducted a study to describe the global DNA methylation landscape of UTUC and UCB and to address the prognostic value of DNA methylation subtype and responses to the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor SGI-110 in urothelial carcinoma (UC).Using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (n = 49 samples), we analyzed epigenomic features and profiles of UTUC (n = 36) and UCB (n = 9). Next, we characterized potential links between DNA methylation, gene expression (n = 9 samples), and clinical outcomes. Then, we integrated an independent UTUC cohort (Fujii et al., n = 86) and UCB cohort (TCGA, n = 411) to validate the prognostic significance. Furthermore, we performed an integrative analysis of genome-wide DNA methylation and gene expression in two UC cell lines following transient DNA methyltransferase inhibitor SGI-110 treatment to identify potential epigenetic driver events that contribute to drug efficacy.We showed that UTUC and UCB have very similar DNA methylation profiles. Unsupervised DNA methylation classification identified two epi-clusters, Methy-High and Methy-Low, associated with distinct muscle-invasive statuses and patient outcomes. Methy-High samples were hypermethylated, immune-infiltrated, and enriched for exhausted T cells, with poor clinical outcome. SGI-110 inhibited the migration and invasion of Methy-High UC cell lines (UMUC-3 and T24) by upregulating multiple antitumor immune pathways.DNA methylation subtypes pave the way for predicting patient prognosis in UC. Our results provide mechanistic rationale for evaluating SGI-110 in treating UC patients in the clinic.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35842682","Psychostimulant-induced aberrant DNA methylation in an in vitro model of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells.","Clin Epigenetics","Several reports have provided crucial evidence in animal models that epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation, may be involved in psychostimulant-induced stable changes at the cellular level in the brain. Epigenetic editors DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and ten-eleven translocation enzymes (TETs) coordinate expression of gene networks, which then manifest as long-term behavioural changes. However, the extent to which aberrant DNA methylation is involved in the mechanisms of substance use disorder in humans is unclear. We previously demonstrated that cocaine modifies gene transcription, via DNA methylation, throughout the brain and in peripheral blood cells in mice.We treated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy male donors (n = 18) in vitro with psychostimulants (amphetamine, cocaine). After treatment, we assessed mRNA levels and enzymatic activities of TETs and DNMTs, conducted genome-wide DNA methylation assays and next-generation sequencing. We found that repeated exposure to psychostimulants decreased mRNA levels and enzymatic activity of TETs and 5-hydroxymethylation levels in PBMCs. These data were in line with observed hyper- and hypomethylation and mRNA expression of marker genes (IL-10, ATP2B4). Additionally, we evaluated whether the effects of cocaine on epigenetic editors (DNMTs and TETs) and cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-10 could be reversed by the DNMT inhibitor decitabine. Indeed, decitabine eliminated cocaine's effect on the activity of TETs and DNMTs and decreased cytokine levels, whereas cocaine increased IL-6 and decreased IL-10.Our data suggest that repeated psychostimulant exposure decreases TETs' enzymatic activity in PBMCs. Co-treatment with decitabine reversed TETs' levels and modulated immune response after repeated cocaine exposure. Further investigation is needed to clarify if TET could represent a putative biomarker of psychostimulant use and if DNMT inhibition could have therapeutic potential.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35841774","A review of epigenetics and its association with ageing of muscle and bone.","Maturitas","Ageing is defined as the 'increasing frailty of an organism with time that reduces the ability of that organism to deal with stress'. It has been suggested that epigenetics may underlie the observation that some individuals appear to age faster than others. Epigenetics is the study of changes which occur in an organism due to changes in expression of the genetic code rather than changes to the genetic code itself; that is, epigenetic mechanisms impact upon the function of DNA without changing the DNA sequence. It is important to recognise that epigenetic changes, in contrast to genetic changes, can vary according to different cell types and therefore can demonstrate significant tissue-specificity. There are different types of epigenetic mechanisms: histone modification, non-coding RNAs and DNA methylation. Epigenetic clocks have been developed using statistical techniques to identify the optimal combination of CpG sites (from methylation arrays) to correlate with chronological age. This review considers how epigenetic factors may affect rates of ageing of muscle and bone and provides an overview of current understanding in this area. We discuss studies using first-generation epigenetic clocks, as well as the second-generation iterations, which appear to show stronger associations with the ageing muscle phenotype. We also review epigenome-wide association studies that have been performed in various tissues examining relationships with osteoporosis and fracture. It is hoped that an understanding of this area will lead to interventions that might prevent or reduce rates of musculoskeletal ageing in later life.Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).

"35841380","Maternal prenatal immunity, neonatal trained immunity, and early airway microbiota shape childhood asthma development.","Allergy","The path to childhood asthma is thought to initiate in utero and be further promoted by postnatal exposures. However, the underlying mechanisms remain underexplored. We hypothesized that prenatal maternal immune dysfunction associated with increased childhood asthma risk (revealed by low IFN-γ:IL-13 secretion during the third trimester of pregnancy) alters neonatal immune training through epigenetic mechanisms and promotes early-life airway colonization by asthmagenic microbiota.We examined epigenetic, immunologic, and microbial features potentially related to maternal prenatal immunity (IFN-γ:IL-13 ratio) and childhood asthma in a birth cohort of mother-child dyads sampled pre-, peri-, and postnatally (N = 155). Epigenome-wide DNA methylation and cytokine production were assessed in cord blood mononuclear cells (CBMC) by array profiling and ELISA, respectively. Nasopharyngeal microbiome composition was characterized at age 2-36 months by 16S rRNA sequencing.Maternal prenatal immune status related to methylome profiles in neonates born to non-asthmatic mothers. A module of differentially methylated CpG sites enriched for microbe-responsive elements was associated with childhood asthma. In vitro responsiveness to microbial products was impaired in CBMCs from neonates born to mothers with the lowest IFN-γ:IL-13 ratio, suggesting defective neonatal innate immunity in those who developed asthma during childhood. These infants exhibited a distinct pattern of upper airway microbiota development characterized by early-life colonization by Haemophilus that transitioned to a Moraxella-dominated microbiota by age 36 months.Maternal prenatal immune status shapes asthma development in her child by altering the epigenome and trained innate immunity at birth, and is associated with pathologic upper airway microbial colonization in early life.© 2022 The Authors.

"35837968","A DNA Methylation-Based Epigenetic Signature for the Identification of Lymph Node Metastasis in T1 Colorectal Cancer.","Ann Surg","This study aimed to unravel the lymph node metastasis (LNM)-related methylated DNA (mDNA) landscape and develop a mDNA signature to identify LNM in patients with T1 colorectal cancers (T1 CRC).Considering the invasiveness of T1 CRC, current guidelines recommend endoscopic resection in patients with LNM-negative, and radical surgical resection only for high-risk LNM-positive patients. Unfortunately, the clinicopathological criteria for LNM risk-stratification are imperfect, resulting in frequent misdiagnosis leading to unnecessary radical surgeries and post-surgical complications.We conducted genome-wide methylation profiling of 39 T1 CRC specimens to identify differentially methylated CpGs between LNM-positive and LNM-negative, and performed quantitative pyrosequencing analysis in 235 specimens from three independent patient cohorts, including 195 resected tissues (training cohort: n=128, validation cohort: n=67) and 40 pre-treatment biopsies.Using logistic regression analysis, we developed a nine-CpG signature to distinguish LNM-positive versus LNM-negative surgical specimens in the training cohort (area under the curve [AUC]=0.831, 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.755-0.892; P<0.0001), which was subsequently validated in additional surgical specimens (AUC=0.825; 95% CI=0.696-0.955; P=0.003) and pre-treatment biopsies (AUC=0.836; 95% CI=0.640-1.000, P=0.0036). This diagnostic power was further improved by combining the signature with conventional clinicopathological features.We established a novel epigenetic signature that can robustly identify LNM in surgical specimens and even pre-treatment biopsies from patients with T1 CRC. Our signature has strong translational potential to improve the selection of high-risk patients who require radical surgery while sparing others from its complications and expense.Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

We carried out an epigenome-wide analysis of the association between several measures of individual- and area-level prenatal SD and DNAm assessed in neonatal cord blood via the Infinium EpicBeadChip among offspring born to mothers of White British (N = 455) and Pakistani (N = 493) origin in the Born in Bradford Study. Models were adjusted for mother's age, ethnicity, and education level as well as cell-type fractions and then for maternal health behaviours and neonate characteristics, and last, stratified by mother's ethnicity. P-values were corrected for multiple testing and a permutation-based approach was used to account for small cell sizes. Among all children, housing tenure (owning versus renting) as well as father's occupation (manual versus non-manual) were each associated with DNAm of one CpG site and index of multiple deprivation (IMD) was associated with DNAm of 11 CpG sites. Among children born to White British mothers, father's occupation (student or unemployed versus non-manual) was associated with DNAm of 1 CpG site and IMD with DNAm of 3 CpG sites. Among children born to Pakistani mothers, IMD was associated with DNAm of 1 CpG site. Associations were largely unchanged after further adjustment for maternal health behaviours or neonate characteristics and remained statistically significant. Our findings suggest that individual- and area-level prenatal SD may shape alterations to the neonatal epigenome, but associations vary across ethnic groups."

Though there has been some association between genetic polymorphisms and age of onset, there has been little exploration of the role of epigenetic processes. We sought to explore the influence of DNA methylation, a key epigenetic mechanism, and its association with the age of onset of illness.One hundred thirty-eight participants aged 18-75 years and previously diagnosed with SCZ spectrum disorders by the Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (SCID DSM-5) were recruited. Venous blood was collected and genome-wide DNA methylation was quantified using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array. Individual CpG sites and regions of differential methylation were explored by the age of onset; covariates included age, sex, as well as white blood cell composition.Binary grouping (early vs. late onset) revealed four intergenic CpG sites on chromosome 2 that were above the expected P-value threshold, with hypermethylation of the CpG site cg10392614 most strongly associated with early-onset SCZ. The four most strongly associated CpG sites, including cg 10392614, were intergenic. Continuous analysis revealed the top CpG site to be cg11723066, which is linked to the JAM3 gene, with hypomethylation associated with earlier onset; however, results were below the expected P-value threshold.Studies on DNA methylation in the first-episode psychosis population may help further our understanding of the role of epigenetics in the age of onset of SCZ.Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

The advent of genome-wide analysis methods has made it possible to uncover genetic and epigenetic fluctuation such as abnormal DNA methylation in gene promoter regions that is expected to play a key role in GC. The study of gastric malignancies requires an etiological perspective, andHelicobacter pylori(H. pylori) was identified to play a role in GC.H. pyloriinfection causes chronic inflammation of the gastric epithelium causing abnormal polyclonal methylation, which might raise the risk of GC. In the last two decades, various pathogenic factors by whichH. pyloriinfection causes GC have been discovered. Abnormal DNA methylation is triggered in several genes, rendering them inactive. In GC, methylation patterns are linked to certain subtypes including microsatellite instability. Multiple cancer-related processes are more usually changed by abnormal DNA methylation than through mutations, according to current general and combined investigations. Furthermore, the amount of acquired abnormal DNA methylation is heavily linked to the chances of developing GC. Therefore, we investigated abnormal DNA methylation in GC and the link between methylation andH. pyloriinfection.© 2022 Korean Pharmacopuncture Institute."

Three histopathological patterns have been described: specific DNTs (both the simple form and the complex form) comprising the specific glioneuronal element, and also the non-specific/diffuse form which lacks it, and has unclear phenotype-genotype correlations with numerous differential diagnoses.We used targeted methods (immunohistochemistry, fluorescence in situ hybridisation and targeted sequencing) and large-scale genomic methodologies including DNA methylation profiling to perform an integrative analysis to better characterise a large retrospective cohort of 82 DNTs, enriched for tumours that showed progression on imaging.We confirmed that specific DNTs are characterised by a single driver event with a high frequency of FGFR1 variants. However, a subset of DNA methylation-confirmed DNTs harbour alternative genomic alterations to FGFR1 duplication/mutation. We also demonstrated that a subset of DNTs sharing the same FGFR1 alterations can show in situ progression. In contrast to the specific forms, ""non-specific/diffuse DNTs"" corresponded to a heterogeneous molecular group encompassing diverse, newly-described, molecularly distinct entities.Specific DNT is a homogeneous group of tumours sharing characteristics of paediatric low-grade gliomas: a quiet genome with a recurrent genomic alteration in the RAS-MAPK signalling pathway, a distinct DNA methylation profile and a good prognosis but showing progression in some cases. The ""non-specific/diffuse DNTs"" subgroup encompasses various recently described histomolecular entities, such as PLNTY and diffuse astrocytoma, MYB or MYBL1 altered.© 2022 The Authors.

We hypothesized that the programming of the central nervous system (CNS), hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and autonomic nervous system (ANS) induced by prenatal stress (PS) is reflected in electrophysiological and epigenetic biomarkers. In this study, we aimed to find noninvasive epigenetic biomarkers of PS in the newborn salivary DNA.A total of 728 pregnant women were screened for stress exposure using Cohen Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), 164 women were enrolled, and 114 dyads were analyzed. Prenatal Distress Questionnaire (PDQ) was also administered to assess specific pregnancy worries. Transabdominal fetal electrocardiograms (taECG) were recorded to derive coupling between maternal and fetal heart rates resulting in a 'Fetal Stress Index' (FSI). Upon delivery, we collected maternal hair strands for cortisol measurements and newborn's saliva for epigenetic analyses. DNA was extracted from saliva samples, and DNA methylation was measured using EPIC BeadChip array (850 k CpG sites). Linear regression was used to identify associations between PSS/PDQ/FSI/Cortisol and DNA methylation. We found epigenome-wide significant associations for 5 CpG with PDQ and cortisol at FDR < 5%. Three CpGs were annotated to genes (Illumina Gene annotation file): YAP1, TOMM20 and CSMD1, and two CpGs were located approximately lay at 50 kb from SSBP4 and SCAMP1. In addition, two differentiated methylation regions (DMR) related to maternal stress measures PDQ and cortisol were found: DAXX and ARL4D.Genes annotated to these CpGs were found to be involved in secretion and transportation, nuclear signaling, Hippo signaling pathways, apoptosis, intracellular trafficking and neuronal signaling. Moreover, some CpGs are annotated to genes related to autism, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and schizophrenia. However, our results should be viewed as hypothesis generating until replicated in a larger sample. Early assessment of such noninvasive PS biomarkers will allow timelier detection of babies at risk and a more effective allocation of resources for early intervention programs to improve child development. A biomarker-guided early intervention strategy is the first step in the prevention of future health problems, reducing their personal and societal impact.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35836279","An epigenome-wide association study of insulin resistance in African Americans.","Clin Epigenetics","African Americans have a high risk for type 2 diabetes (T2D) and insulin resistance. Studies among other population groups have identified DNA methylation loci associated with insulin resistance, but data in African Americans are lacking. Using DNA methylation profiles of blood samples obtained from the Illumina Infinium® HumanMethylation450 BeadChip, we performed an epigenome-wide association study to identify DNA methylation loci associated with insulin resistance among 136 non-diabetic, unrelated African American men (mean age 41.6 years) from the Howard University Family Study.We identified three differentially methylated positions (DMPs) for homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) at 5% FDR. One DMP (cg14013695, HOXA5) is a known locus among Mexican Americans, while the other two DMPs are novel-cg00456326 (OSR1; beta = 0.027) and cg20259981 (ST18; beta = 0.010). Although the cg00456326 DMP is novel, the OSR1 gene has previously been found associated with both insulin resistance and T2D in Europeans. The genes HOXA5 and ST18 have been implicated in biological processes relevant to insulin resistance. Differential methylation at the significant HOXA5 and OSR1 DMPs is associated with differences in gene expression in the iMETHYL database. Analysis of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) did not identify any epigenome-wide DMRs for HOMA-IR. We tested transferability of HOMA-IR associated DMPs from five previous EWAS in Mexican Americans, Indian Asians, Europeans, and European ancestry Americans. Out of the 730 previously reported HOMA-IR DMPs, 47 (6.4%) were associated with HOMA-IR in this cohort of African Americans.The findings from our study suggest substantial differences in DNA methylation patterns associated with insulin resistance across populations. Two of the DMPs we identified in African Americans have not been reported in other populations, and we found low transferability of HOMA-IR DMPs reported in other populations in African Americans. More work in African-ancestry populations is needed to confirm our findings as well as functional analyses to understand how such DNA methylation alterations contribute to T2D pathology.© 2022.

"35835915","YAP induces an oncogenic transcriptional program through TET1-mediated epigenetic remodeling in liver growth and tumorigenesis.","Nat Genet","Epigenetic remodeling is essential for oncogene-induced cellular transformation and malignancy. In contrast to histone post-translational modifications, how DNA methylation is remodeled by oncogenic signaling remains poorly understood. The oncoprotein YAP, a coactivator of the TEAD transcription factors mediating Hippo signaling, is widely activated in human cancers. Here, we identify the 5-methylcytosine dioxygenase TET1 as a direct YAP target and a master regulator that coordinates the genome-wide epigenetic and transcriptional reprogramming of YAP target genes in the liver. YAP activation induces the expression of TET1, which physically interacts with TEAD to cause regional DNA demethylation, histone H3K27 acetylation and chromatin opening in YAP target genes to facilitate transcriptional activation. Loss of TET1 not only reverses YAP-induced epigenetic and transcriptional changes but also suppresses YAP-induced hepatomegaly and tumorigenesis. These findings exemplify how oncogenic signaling regulates the site specificity of DNA demethylation to promote tumorigenesis and implicate TET1 as a potential target for modulating YAP signaling in physiology and disease.© 2022.

Here, we examined the genome-wide DNA methylation differentiation between male and female hatchling gonads of the temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) Mauremys mutica (M. mutica) using methylation-dependent restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (MethylRAD-seq) to test differentially methylated genes underlying sexual development. Several categories, including heat shock genes (HSP90A, HSP30C), histone- (KDM8) and ubiquitin-related genes (TRIM39), kinases (WNK3) and gonad differentiation or gonadal development related genes (HSD17B8, HSD17B12), were identified as candidates for future study. Additionally, we identified several regulatory pathways potentially mediating TSD thermosensitivity such as the GnRH signaling pathway and calcium signaling pathway. These findings provide evidence that sexually dimorphic DNA methylation may be associated with sex determination or sex differentiation in TSD M. mutica.© The Author(s) 2022.

Recently, m6A modification has been found in circRNA, and m6A circRNAs also play important roles in various biological processes and a variety of diseases. Our previous study had been demonstrated that circRNAs were differentially expressed in skin ulceration syndrome (SUS) diseased sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus. However, whether the function of circRNAs are dependent on m6A levels are largely unknown. Here, we firstly investigated the genome-wide map of m6A circRNAs in sea cucumbers with different stages of Vibrio splendidus challenge, that's Control group, SUS-diseased group, and SUS-resistant group. MeRIP-seq revealed that m6A abundances were enriched in circRNAs in all three groups, especially for SUS-resistant group. Among them, more than 62% of modified circRNAs harbor only a single m6A peak and about 55% of m6A sites in circRNAs were derived from sense overlapping in each group. After V. splendidus infection, we found that most of m6A peaks in circRNAs were upregulated and less were downregulated in both SUS-diseased and SUS-resistant groups when compared with Control. Furthermore, GO analysis indicated that the host genes of circRNAs with dysregulated m6A peaks in SUS-diseased and SUS-resistant groups were both mainly enriched in the adhesion pathway. More importantly, we discovered that more than 50% m6A circRNAs showed a positive correlation between the circRNAs expression and m6A methylation levels both in SUS-diseased and SUS-resistant groups. Therefore, a core circRNA-miRNA-mRNA (ceRNA) network whether influenced by m6A modification was constructed based on conjoint analysis. Our results indicated that several selected m6A circRNAs bind with miRNAs were mainly targeting to ubiquitylation system and adhesion pathway. What's more, three candidate m6A circRNAs and three target genes were validated by MeRIP-qPCR and qPCR, whose m6A levels in circRNA and mRNA expressions were consistent with disease occurrence or disease resistance. All of our current findings suggested that m6A circRNAs could play important roles during pathogen infection and might be served as a new molecular biomarker in SUS disease diagnose of A. japonicus.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

Childhood health effects of prenatal exposures may be mediated through changes to DNA methylation detectable at birth.Among 429 non-smoking women in a cohort study of mother-infant pairs in Colorado, USA, we estimated associations between prenatal exposure to ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone (O3), and epigenome-wide DNA methylation of umbilical cord blood cells at delivery (2010-2014). We calculated average PM2.5and O3in each trimester of pregnancy and the full pregnancy using inverse-distance-weighted interpolation. We fit linear regression models adjusted for potential confounders and cell proportions to estimate associations between air pollutants and methylation at each of 432,943 CpGs. Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identified using comb-p. Previously in this cohort, we reported positive associations between 3rd trimester O3exposure and infant adiposity at 5 months of age. Here, we quantified the potential for mediation of that association by changes in DNA methylation in cord blood.We identified several DMRs for each pollutant and period of pregnancy. The greatest number of significant DMRs were associated with third trimester PM2.5(21 DMRs). No single CpGs were associated with air pollutants at a false discovery rate <0.05. We found that up to 8% of the effect of 3rd trimester O3on 5-month adiposity may be mediated by locus-specific methylation changes, but mediation estimates were not statistically significant.Differentially methylated regions in cord blood were identified in association with maternal exposure to PM2.5and O3. Genes annotated to the significant sites played roles in cardiometabolic disease, immune function and inflammation, and neurologic disorders. We found limited evidence of mediation by DNA methylation of associations between third trimester O3exposure and 5-month infant adiposity.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

These two marks are largely mutually exclusive and target distinct sets of genes in the mammalian genome. However, how H3K27me3 shapes the DNA methylome remains elusive. Here, we report that the loss of H3K27me3 modification leads to increased DNA methylation at previously marked H3K27me3 sites, indicating that H3K27me3 negatively regulates DNA methylation. Genome-wide analysis of H3 ubiquitination, essential for recruitment and activation of DNA methyltransferase DNMT1, reveals the absence of H3 ubiquitination at H3K27me3 marked nucleosomes. Moreover, loss of H3K27me3 modification induces an increase in H3K18 ubiquitination at the corresponding hyper-methylated loci. Importantly, we show that H3K27me3 directly inhibits UHRF1-mediated H3 ubiquitination toward nucleosomes in a defined biochemical assay. Taken together, our findings reveal a general mechanism for H3K27me3-mediated shaping of the mammalian DNA methylome via modulation of H3 ubiquitination.© 2022.

Unbiased whole-genome methylome was studied in the wound-edge (WE) tissue of chronic wound patients. A total of 4689 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identified in chronic WE compared to unwounded (UW) human skin. Hypermethylation was more frequently observed (3661 DMRs) in the chronic WE compared to hypomethylation (1028 DMRs). Twenty-six hypermethylated DMRs were involved in epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). Bisulfite sequencing validated hypermethylation of a predicted specific upstream regulator TP53. RNA sequencing analysis was performed to qualify findings from methylome analysis. Analysis of the downregulated genes identified the TP53 signaling pathway as being significantly silenced. Direct comparison of hypermethylation and downregulated genes identified four genes, ADAM17, NOTCH, TWIST1 and SMURF1, that functionally represent the EMT pathway. Single-cell RNA sequencing studies identified that these effects on gene expression were limited to the keratinocyte cell compartment. Experimental murine studies established that tissue ischemia potently induces WE gene methylation and that 5'-azacytidine, inhibitor of methylation, improved wound closure. To specifically address the significance of TP53 methylation, keratinocyte-specific editing of TP53 methylation at the WE was achieved by a tissue nanotransfection (TNT) based CRISPR/dCas9 approach. This work identified that reversal of methylation-dependent keratinocyte gene-silencing represents a productive therapeutic strategy to improve wound closure."

Genetic, pathological and functional studies have shown that CD8 and Gamma delta (γ/δ) T-lymphocytes are involved in inflammatory processes in affected regions of arteries causing vascular damage. The molecular function of these lymphocytes remains unclear and currently no epigenetic studies are available in TA. We primarily performed genome wide methylation analysis in CD8 T cells and γδ T cells of patients with TA and compared with healthy controls.Methods:We recruited 12 subjects in each group namely TA patient and healthy controls. Blood samples were collected after obtaining informed written consent. CD8 T cells and γδ T cells were separated from whole blood. DNA extracted from these cells and were subjected to bisulfite treatment. Finally, bisulfite treated DNA was loaded in Infinium Methylation EPIC array. Bioinformatics analysis was used to identify differential methylation regions which were then mapped to genes.Results:Interleukin (IL)-32 and Lymphotoxin-A were genes significantly hypomethylated in CD8 T-cells. Anti-inflammatory cytokine genes,IL-10,IL-1RNandIL-27were hypomethylated in γδ T cells of TA patients as compared to healthy controls. Gene enrichment analysis using Gene Ontology (GO) database and Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) identified that genes involved in T-cell receptor signalling pathways were hypomethylated in CD8 T-cells and hypermethylated in γδ T cells of TA patients.Conclusion:CD8 T-cells might play a major role in immunopathogenesis of inflammation in TA, whereas γδ T cells may play a regulatory role.Copyright © 2022 Kabeerdoss, Danda, Goel, Mohan, Danda and Scofield."

However, potato production is affected by numerous biotic and abiotic stresses, among whichFusariumdry rot is a disease that has significant effect on potato production, storage, and processing. However, the role of DNA methylation in regulating potato response toFusariumtoxin deoxynivalenol (DON) stress is still not fully understood. In this study, we performed DNA methylome and transcriptome analyses of potato tubers treated with five concentrations of DON. The global DNA methylation levels in potato tubers treated with different concentrations of DON showed significant changes relative to those in the control. In particular, the 20 ng/ml treatment showed the largest decrease in all three contexts of methylation levels, especially CHH contexts in transposon regions. The differentially methylated region (DMR)-associated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were significantly enriched in resistance-related metabolic pathways, indicating that DNA methylation plays an essential role in potato response to DON stress. Furthermore, we examined lesions on potato tubers infested withFusariumafter treatment. Furthermore, the potato tubers treated with 5 and 35 ng/ml DON had lesions of significantly smaller diameters than those of the control, indicating that DON stress may induce resistance. We speculate that this may be related to epigenetic memory created after DNA methylation changes. The detailed DNA methylome and transcriptome profiles suggest that DNA methylation plays a vital role in potato disease resistance and has great potential for enhancing potato dry rot resistance.Copyright © 2022 Shi, Qin, Li and Wang."

We aimed to investigate the relationship between multiple measures of epigenetic aging acceleration with clinical, functioning, and cognitive outcomes in patients with BD and controls. Blood genome-wide DNA methylation levels were measured in BD patients (n = 153) and matched healthy controls (n = 50) with the Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip (Illumina). Epigenetic age estimates were calculated using an online tool, including the recently developed lifespan predictor GrimAge, and analyzed with generalized linear models controlling for demographic variables and blood cell proportions. BD was significantly associated with greater GrimAge acceleration (AgeAccelGrim, β=0.197, p = 0.009), and significant group-dependent interactions were found between AgeAccelGrim and blood cell proportions (CD4+ T-lymphocytes, monocytes, granulocytes, and B-cells). Within patients, higher AgeAccelGrim was associated with worse cognitive function in multiple domains (short-term affective memory (β=-0.078, p = 0.030), short-term non-affective memory (β=-0.088, p = 0.018), inhibition (β=0.064, p = 0.046), and problem solving (β=-0.067, p = 0.034)), age of first diagnosis with any mood disorder (β=-0.076, p = 0.039) or BD (β=-0.102, p = 0.016), as well as with current non-smoking status (β=-0.392, p < 0.001).

DNA methylation has been regarded as the most promising age-predictive biomarker. Measuring themethylation level at the genome-wide scaleis an important step to screen specific markers for forensic age prediction. In present study, we screened out five age-related CpG sites from the public EPIC BeadChip data and evaluated them in a training set (115 blood) by multiplex methylation SNaPshot assay. Through full subset regression, the five markers were narrowed down to three, namely cg10501210 (C1orf132), cg16867657 (ELOVL2), and cg13108341 (DNAH9), of which the last one was a newly discovered age-related CpG site. An age prediction model was built based on these three markers, explaining 86.8% of the variation of age with a mean absolute deviation (MAD) of 4.038 years. Then, the multiplex methylation SNaPshot assay was adjusted according to the age prediction model. Considering that bloodstains are one of the most common biological samples in practical cases, three validation sets composed of 30 blood, 30 fresh bloodstains and 30 aged bloodstains were used for evaluation of the age prediction model. The MAD of each set was estimated as 4.734, 4.490, and 5.431 years, respectively, suggesting that our age prediction model was applicable for age prediction for blood and bloodstains in Chinese Han population of 11-71 age. In general, this study describes a workflow of screening CpG markers from public chip data and presents a 3-CpG markers model for forensic age prediction.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

"35809138","Transcriptional activation of budding yeast DDI2/3 through chemical modifications of Fzf1.","Cell Biol Toxicol","DDI2 and DDI3 (DDI2/3) are two identical genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae encoding cyanamide (CY) hydratase. They are not only highly induced by CY, but also by a DNA-damaging agent methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), and the regulatory mechanism is unknown. In this study, we performed a modified genome-wide genetic synthetic array screen and identified Fzf1 as a zinc-finger transcriptional activator required for CY/MMS-induced DDI2/3 expression. Fzf1 binds to a DDI2/3 promoter consensus sequence CS2 in vivo and in vitro, and this interaction was enhanced in response to the CY treatment. Indeed, experimental over production of Fzf1 alone was sufficient to induce DDI2/3 expression; however, CY and MMS treatments did not cause the accumulation or apparent alteration in migration of cellular Fzf1. To test a hypothesis that Fzf1 is activated by covalent modification of CY and MMS, we performed mass spectrometry of CY/MMS-treated Fzf1 and detected a few modified lysine residues. Amino acid substitutions of these residues revealed that Fzf1-K70A completely abolished MMS-induced and reduced CY-induced DDI2/3 expression, indicating that the Fzf1-K70 methylation activates Fzf1. This study collectively reveals a novel regulatory mechanism by which Fzf1 is activated by chemical modifications and in turn induces the expression of its target genes for detoxification.© 2022.

Heynh.) and rice (Oryza sativaL.) in recent years, its function in maize (Zea maysL.) remains poorly characterized. To better understand the function of histone lysine methylation in maize, SDG102, a H3 lysine 36 (H3K36) methylase, was chosen for functional characterization using overexpressed and knockout transgenic plants. SDG102-deficiency in maize caused multiple phenotypes including yellow leaves in seedlings, late-flowering, and increased adult plant height, while the overexpression ofSDG102led to reduced adult plant height. The key flowering genes,ZCN8/ZCN7andMADS4/MADA67, were downregulated in SDG102-deficient plants. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments showed that H3 lysine 36 trimethylation (H3K36me3) levels were reduced at these loci. Perturbation ofSDG102expression caused the misexpression of multiple genes. Interestingly, the overexpression or knockout ofSDG102also led to genome-wide decreases and increases in the H3K36me3 levels, respectively.

Its inhibition results in increased systemic bile salt concentrations. NTCP is also the entry receptor for the hepatitis B/D virus. We investigated interindividual hepaticSLC10A1/NTCP expression using various omics technologies.SLC10A1/NTCP mRNA expression/protein abundance was quantified in well-characterized 143 human livers by real-time PCR and LC-MS/MS-based targeted proteomics. Genome-wide SNP arrays andSLC10A1next-generation sequencing were used for genomic analyses.SLC10A1DNA methylation was assessed through MALDI-TOF MS. Transcriptomics and untargeted metabolomics (UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS) were correlated to identify NTCP-related metabolic pathways.SLC10A1mRNA and NTCP protein levels varied 44-fold and 10.4-fold, respectively. Non-genetic factors (e.g., smoking, alcohol consumption) influenced significantly NTCP expression. Genetic variants inSLC10A1or other genes do not explain expression variability which was validated in livers (n= 50) from The Cancer Genome Atlas. The identified two missenseSLC10A1variants did not impair transport function in transfectants. Specific CpG sites inSLC10A1as well as single metabolic alterations and pathways (e.g., peroxisomal and bile acid synthesis) were significantly associated with expression. Inter-individual variability of NTCP expression is multifactorial with the contribution of clinical factors, DNA methylation, transcriptional regulation as well as hepatic metabolism, but not genetic variation."

However, it remains unknown how H3K9me3 is reprogrammed during human early embryo development. Here, we profiled genome-wide H3K9me3 in human oocytes and early embryos and discovered stage-specific H3K9me3 deposition on long terminal repeats (LTRs) at the 8-cell and blastocyst stages. We found that 8-cell-specific H3K9me3 was temporarily established in enhancer-like regions, whereas blastocyst-specific H3K9me3 was more stable. DUX and multiple Krüppel-associated box domain zinc finger proteins(KRAB-ZNFs) were identified as potential factors for establishing 8C- and blastocyst-specific H3K9me3, respectively. Intriguingly, our analysis showed that stage-specific H3K9me3 allocation was attenuated by either Dux knockout or Zfp51 knockdown in mouse early embryos. Moreover, we observed the existence of H3K4me3/H3K9me3 and H3K4me3/H3K27me3 bivalent chromatin domains in human blastocysts, priming for lineage differentiation. Together, our data unveil that the epigenetic switch from DNA methylation to H3K9me3 ensures the precise regulation of retrotransposons in human pre-implantation embryos.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

DNA methylation-based classification and understanding of microenviromental heterogeneity may allow stratification into clinically relevant molecular subtypes of LUADs.We characterize the genome-wide DNA methylation landscape of 88 resected LUAD tumors. Exome sequencing focusing on a panel of cancer-related genes was used to genotype these adenocarcinoma samples. Bioinformatic and statistical tools, the immune cell composition, DNA methylation age (DNAm age), and DNA methylation clustering were used to identify clinically relevant subgroups.Deconvolution of DNA methylation data identified immunologically hot and cold subsets of lung adenocarcinomas. Additionally, concurrent factors were analyzed that could affect the immune microenvironment, such as smoking history, ethnicity, or presence of KRAS or TP53 mutations. When the DNAm age was calculated, a lower DNAm age was correlated with the presence of a set of oncogenic drivers, poor overall survival, and specific immune cell populations. Unsupervised DNA methylation clustering identified 6 molecular subgroups of LUAD tumors with distinct clinical and microenvironmental characteristics.Our results demonstrate that DNA methylation signatures can stratify lung adenocarcinoma into clinically relevant subtypes, and thus such classification of LUAD at the time of resection may lead to better methods in predicting tumor recurrence and therapy responses."

Deleted in breast cancer 1 (DBC1) has been shown to act as a negative regulator of epigenetic modifiers and as a co-activator for nuclear receptors and other transcription factors. However, little is known about the role of DBC1 in the regulation of histone modifications and chromatin landscapes. Here, we analyzed genome-wide profiles of active enhancer and promoter marks in colorectal cancer cells and report DBC1 as a critical positive regulator of histone epigenetic writers KMT2D (H3K4 methyltransferase) and p300 (histone acetyltransferase). DBC1 is required for establishing the landscape of active enhancers, for genome-wide chromatin binding and enhancer recruitment of KMT2D and p300, and for gene activation involved in colorectal cancer progression. DBC1 interacts directly with KMT2D and p300, and enhances KMT2D-mediated histone H3K4 methylation (H3K4me1/2/3) and p300-mediated H3 acetylation. Importantly, DBC1 contributes to super-enhancer formation and function by facilitating the recruitment of KMT2D and p300 and by enhancing their functional interaction and cooperative cross-talk. Our results highlight the critical role of DBC1 as a key positive regulator of KMT2D and p300, and provide insights into regulatory mechanisms underlying the interplay between the enhancer epigenomic writers in enhancer activation.© The Author(s) 2022.

"35800457","A Molecular Cloning and Sanger Sequencing-based Protocol for Detecting Site-specific DNA Methylation.","Bio Protoc","DNA methylation is a conserved chemical modification, by which methyl groups are added to the cytosine of DNA molecules. Methylation can influence gene expression without changing the sequence of a particular gene. This epigenetic effect is an intriguing phenomenon that has puzzled biologists for years. By probing the temporal and spatial patterns of DNA methylation in genomes, it is possible to learn about the biological role of cytosine methylation, as well as its involvement in gene regulation and transposon silencing. Advances in whole-genome sequencing have led to the widespread adoption of methods that examine genome-wide patterns of DNA methylation. Achieving sufficient sequencing depth in these types of experiments is costly, particularly for pilot studies in organisms with large genome sizes, or incomplete reference genomes. To overcome this issue, assays to determine site-specific DNA methylation can be used. Although often used, these assays are rarely described in detail. Here, we describe a pipeline that applies traditional TA cloning, Sanger sequencing, and online tools to examine DNA methylation. We provide an example of how to use this protocol to examine the pattern of DNA methylation at a specific transposable element in maize.Copyright © 2022 The Authors; exclusive licensee Bio-protocol LLC."

We explored the epigenetic signatures of COVID-19 in peripheral blood using data from an ongoing prospective observational study of COVID-19 called the Norwegian Corona Cohort Study. A series of EWASs were performed to compare the DNA methylation profiles between COVID-19 cases and controls three months post-infection. We also investigated differences associated with severity and long-COVID. Three CpGs-cg22399236, cg03607951, and cg09829636-were significantly hypomethylated (FDR < 0.05) in COVID-19 positive individuals. cg03607951 is located in IFI44L which is involved in innate response to viral infection and several systemic autoimmune diseases. cg09829636 is located in ANKRD9, a gene implicated in a wide variety of cellular processes, including the degradation of IMPDH2. The link between ANKRD9 and IMPDH2 is striking given that IMPDHs are considered therapeutic targets for COVID-19. Furthermore, gene ontology analyses revealed pathways involved in response to viruses. The lack of significant differences associated with severity and long-COVID may be real or reflect limitations in sample size. Our findings support the involvement of interferon responsive genes in the pathophysiology of COVID-19 and indicate a possible link to systemic autoimmune diseases.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35798798","DNA methylation fingerprint of hepatocellular carcinoma from tissue and liquid biopsies.","Sci Rep","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is amongst the cancers with highest mortality rates and is the most common malignancy of the liver. Early detection is vital to provide the best treatment possible and liquid biopsies combined with analysis of circulating tumour DNA methylation show great promise as a non-invasive approach for early cancer diagnosis and monitoring with low false negative rates. To identify reliable diagnostic biomarkers of early HCC, we performed a systematic analysis of multiple hepatocellular studies and datasets comprising > 1500 genome-wide DNA methylation arrays, to define a methylation signature predictive of HCC in both tissue and cell-free DNA liquid biopsy samples. Our machine learning pipeline identified differentially methylated regions in HCC, some associated with transcriptional repression of genes related with cancer progression, that benchmarked positively against independent methylation signatures. Combining our signature of 38 DNA methylation regions, we derived a HCC detection score which confirmed the utility of our approach by identifying in an independent dataset 96% of HCC tissue samples with a precision of 98%, and most importantly successfully separated cfDNA of tumour samples from healthy controls. Notably, our risk score could identify cell-free DNA samples from patients with other tumours, including colorectal cancer. Taken together, we propose a comprehensive HCC DNA methylation fingerprint and an associated risk score for detection of HCC from tissue and liquid biopsies.© 2022. The Author(s)."

However, the functional role of different COL4As (COL4A1/2/3/4/5/6) in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is unclear.We obtained the data from online open-access databases including ONCOMINE, UALCAN, GEPIA, Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), cBioPortal, METASCAPE, STRING, TIMER, GSCALite, MEXPRESS, and TISIDB to explore the correlation between COL4As expression and genome-wide difference, progression, prognosis, genetic mutation, functional enrichment, tumor immune microenvironment, and methylation in ccRCC patients.The significantly higher COL4A1/2 expression and lower COL4A3/4/5/6 expression were observed in ccRCC tissues than in normal kidney tissues. Transcriptomic levels of COL4A1/2/3/4 were significantly correlated with tumor grade and stage. The higher expression levels of COL4A1/2/3/4 were accompanied by a longer overall survival time (OS); the higher expression levels of COL4A3/4 with lower expression levels of COL4A5 were associated with a longer disease-free time (DFS). Univariate/multivariate regression model analysis showed that COL4A4 could be a potential independent biomarker for ccRCC prognosis. And a high mutation rate (29%) of COL4As was observed in ccRCC patients. However, there were no relationships between mutation rates of COL4As and OS, DFS in ccRCC patients (p>0.05). Besides, we founded that the COL4As expressions were significant associated with the infiltration of the immune cells, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, three immunomodulators (immunoinhibitory, immunostimulator, MHC molecule), chemokines, and receptors.The results suggested that the transcript levels of COL4As could act as potential indicators for early disease progression. The expression of COL4A4 could contribute directly to disease prognosis. Besides, COL4A1/2/3/4 widely participated in tumor immunity.

This study aimed to perform a genome-wide integrated analysis of the transcriptome and methylome and assess the efficacy of their prognostic signature model in patients with OSCC. We analyzed transcriptome and methylome data from 391 OSCC samples and 41 adjacent normal samples. A total of 8074 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 10,084 differentially expressed CpGs (DMCpGs) were identified. Then 241 DEGs with DMCpGs were identified. According to the prognostic analysis, the prognostic signature of methylation-related differentially expressed genes (mrDEGPS) was established. mrDEGPS consisted of seven prognostic methylation-related genes, including ESRRG, CCNA1, SLC20A1, COL6A6, FCGBP, CDKN2A, and ZNF43. mrDEGPS was a significant stratification factor of survival (P < 0.00001) irrespective of the clinical stage. The immune effector components, including B cells, CD4+T cells, and CD8+T cells, were decreased in the tumor environment of patients with high mrDEGPS. Immune checkpoint expressions, including CTLA-4, PD-1, LAG3, LGALS9, HAVCR2, and TIGHT, were comprehensively elevated (P < 0.001). The estimated half-maximal inhibitory concentration difference between low- and high-risk patients was inconsistent among chemotherapeutic drugs. In conclusion, the transcriptome-methylome interaction pattern in OSCC is complex. mrDEGPS can predict patient survival and responses to immunotherapy and chemotherapy and facilitate clinical decision-making in patients with OSCC.© 2022.

Reliable predictors to guide treatment decisions before or in an early stage of treatment are needed. DNA-methylation has been proven a useful biomarker in different clinical conditions, but its importance for mechanisms of antidepressant response has not yet been determined. 80 MDD patients were selected out of >500 participants from the Early Medication Change (EMC) cohort with available genetic material based on their antidepressant response after four weeks and stratified into clear responders and age- and sex-matched non-responders (N = 40, each). Early improvement after two weeks was analyzed as a secondary outcome. DNA-methylation was determined using the Illumina EPIC BeadChip. Epigenome-wide association studies were performed and differentially methylated regions (DMRs) identified using the comb-p algorithm. Enrichment was tested for hallmark gene-sets and in genome-wide association studies of depression and antidepressant response. No epigenome-wide significant differentially methylated positions were found for treatment response or early improvement. Twenty DMRs were associated with response; the strongest in an enhancer region in SORBS2, which has been related to cardiovascular diseases and type II diabetes. Another DMR was located in CYP2C18, a gene previously linked to antidepressant response. Results pointed towards differential methylation in genes associated with cardiac function, neuroticism, and depression. Linking differential methylation to antidepressant treatment response is an emerging topic and represents a step towards personalized medicine, potentially facilitating the prediction of patients' response before treatment.© 2022.

"35792157","Dynamic mechanism of phase variation in bacteria based on multistable gene regulatory networks.","J Theor Biol","Phase variation, which causes splitting the homogeneous bacterial population into subpopulations of the cells with different and reversible activity of the same variable genes, provide bacteria with wide opportunities to implement their adaptation strategies. Meanwhile, the gene networks perform integral regulation of the genome and control over the formation of phenotypic traits of the organism. Mechanisms of phase variation, such as genomic rearrangements and DNA methylation, affect the regulatory contours of gene networks. At the same time, the gene networks themselves may be the key cause of the appearance of phenotypic variants. Here we propose a new class of gene networks that represent a ring connection of genetic triggers based on an oscillator with cyclic gene repression, termed the tringers. It is shown in silico that the tringers are able to provide splitting the homogeneous bacterial population into cellular subpopulations with alternative expression of controlled genes (phases), stable inheritance of phases, and switching between them, in particular, returning to a homogeneous state. Switching can be carried out under the influence of external and internal factors, both directly and by signals from specialized molecular genetic systems of the cell, in particular, the response to various types of stress. Such epigenetic structures with the function of a phase switching controller are possible in nature and applicable in synthetic biology.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

DNA methylation was measured from cord blood at birth in 11 cohorts and from peripheral blood in children (4-13 years) in 8 cohorts. Outcomes included parent-reported sleep duration, sleep initiation and fragmentation problems, and actigraphy-estimated sleep duration, sleep onset latency and wake-after-sleep-onset duration.We found no associations between DNA methylation at birth and parent-reported sleep duration (n = 3658), initiation problems (n = 2504), or fragmentation (n = 1681) (p values above cut-off 4.0 × 10-8). Lower methylation at cg24815001 and cg02753354 at birth was associated with longer actigraphy-estimated sleep duration (p = 3.31 × 10-8, n = 577) and sleep onset latency (p = 8.8 × 10-9, n = 580), respectively. DNA methylation in childhood was not cross-sectionally associated with any sleep outcomes (n = 716-2539).DNA methylation, at birth or in childhood, was not associated with parent-reported sleep.

"35790763","Mechanistic basis for maintenance of CHG DNA methylation in plants.","Nat Commun","DNA methylation is an evolutionarily conserved epigenetic mechanism essential for transposon silencing and heterochromatin assembly. In plants, DNA methylation widely occurs in the CG, CHG, and CHH (H = A, C, or T) contexts, with the maintenance of CHG methylation mediated by CMT3 chromomethylase. However, how CMT3 interacts with the chromatin environment for faithful maintenance of CHG methylation is unclear. Here we report structure-function characterization of the H3K9me2-directed maintenance of CHG methylation by CMT3 and its Zea mays ortholog ZMET2. Base-specific interactions and DNA deformation coordinately underpin the substrate specificity of CMT3 and ZMET2, while a bivalent readout of H3K9me2 and H3K18 allosterically stimulates substrate binding. Disruption of the interaction with DNA or H3K9me2/H3K18 led to loss of CMT3/ZMET2 activity in vitro and impairment of genome-wide CHG methylation in vivo. Together, our study uncovers how the intricate interplay of CMT3, repressive histone marks, and DNA sequence mediates heterochromatic CHG methylation.© 2022. The Author(s)."

To correct the EWAS false discovery, some non-reference models based on sparse principal component analysis (sparse PCA) have been proposed. These models assume that all methylation sites have the same priori probability in each PC load. However, it is known that there already has gene network structure corresponding to the methylation site. How to integrate this genome network knowledge into the sparse PCA models to enhance the performance of existing models is an open research problem. We introduce GN-ReFAEWAS, a non-reference analysis model which integrates the prior gene network structure into the PCA framework to control the false discovery in EWAS. We used one simulated data set, three real data sets, and three additional tests for experiments and compared with four existing models.

Direct nanopore sequencing of DNA provides a means to detect allelic methylation and to overcome the drawbacks of methylation array and short-read technologies. Here, we used publicly available nanopore sequencing data for 12 standard B-lymphocyte cell lines to acquire the genome-wide mapping of imprinted intervals in humans. Using the sequencing data, we were able to phase 95% of the human methylome and detect 94% of the previously well-characterized, imprinted DMRs. In addition, we found 42 novel imprinted DMRs (16 germline and 26 somatic), which were confirmed using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) data. Analysis of WGBS data in mouse (Mus musculus), rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta), and chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) suggested that 17 of these imprinted DMRs are conserved. Some of the novel imprinted intervals are within or close to imprinted genes without a known DMR. We also detected subtle parental methylation bias, spanning several kilobases at seven known imprinted clusters. At these blocks, hypermethylation occurs at the gene body of expressed allele(s) with mutually exclusive H3K36me3 and H3K27me3 allelic histone marks. These results expand upon our current knowledge of imprinting and the potential of nanopore sequencing to identify imprinting regions using only parent-offspring trios, as opposed to the large multi-generational pedigrees that have previously been required.© 2022, Akbari et al."
"35786392","Genomic map of candidate human imprint control regions: the imprintome.","Epigenetics","Imprinted genes - critical for growth, metabolism, and neuronal function - are expressed from one parental allele. Parent-of-origin-dependent CpG methylation regulates this expression at imprint control regions (ICRs). Since ICRs are established before tissue specification, these methylation marks are similar across cell types. Thus, they are attractive for investigating the developmental origins of adult diseases using accessible tissues, but remain unknown. We determined genome-wide candidate ICRs in humans by performing whole-genome bisulphite sequencing (WGBS) of DNA derived from the three germ layers and from gametes. We identified 1,488 hemi-methylated candidate ICRs, including 19 of 25 previously characterized ICRs (https://humanicr.org/). Gamete methylation approached 0% or 100% in 332 ICRs (178 paternally and 154 maternally methylated), supporting parent-of-origin-specific methylation, and 65% were in well-described CTCF-binding or DNaseI hypersensitive regions.

While the content of microarray technology is fixed, NGS-based approaches, such as the Roche Nimblegen, SeqCap Epi Enrichment System (SeqCap), offer the flexibility of targeting most CpGs in a gene. With the current usage of microarrays and emerging NGS-based technologies, it is important to establish whether data generated from the two platforms are comparable. We harnessed 112 samples from the Center for the Health Assessment of Mothers and Children of Salinas (CHAMACOS) birth cohort study and compared DNA methylation between the EPIC microarray and SeqCap forPON1and nine additional candidate genes, by evaluating epigenomic coverage and correlations. We conducted multivariable linear regression and principal component analyses to assess the ability of the EPIC array and SeqCap to detect biological differences in gene methylation by thePON1-108single nucleotide polymorphism. We found an overall high concordance (r= 0.84) between SeqCap and EPIC DNA methylation, among highly methylated and minimally methylated regions. However, substantial disagreement was present between the two methods in moderately methylated regions, with SeqCap measurements exhibiting greater within-site variation. Additionally, SeqCap did not capturePON1SNP associated differences in DNA methylation that were evident with the EPIC array.

Diabetes could lead to multiple complications including retinopathy, nephropathy, and cardiovascular disease that greatly increase morbidity and mortality. Epigenetic changes have also been linked to diabetes-related complications. Genes associated with many pathophysiological features of these vascular complications (e.g., inflammation, fibrosis, and oxidative stress) can be regulated by epigenetic mechanisms involving histone posttranslational modifications, DNA methylation, changes in chromatin structure/remodeling, and noncoding RNAs. Intriguingly, these epigenetic changes triggered during early periods of hyperglycemic exposure and uncontrolled diabetes are not immediately corrected even after restoration of normoglycemia and metabolic balance. This latency in effect across time and conditions is associated with persistent development of complications in diabetes with prior history of poor glycemic control, termed as metabolic memory or legacy effect. Epigenetic modifications are generally reversible and provide a window of therapeutic opportunity to ameliorate cellular dysfunction and mitigate or ""erase"" metabolic memory. Notably, trained immunity and related epigenetic changes transmitted from hematopoietic stem cells to innate immune cells have also been implicated in metabolic memory. Hence, identification of epigenetic variations at candidate genes, or epigenetic signatures genome-wide by epigenome-wide association studies can aid in prompt diagnosis to prevent progression of complications and identification of much-needed new therapeutic targets. Herein, we provide a review of epigenetics and epigenomics in metabolic memory of diabetic complications covering the current basic research, clinical data, and translational implications."
"35783865","The Genetics and Epigenetics of Ventricular Arrhythmias in Patients Without Structural Heart Disease.","Front Cardiovasc Med","Ventricular arrhythmia without structural heart disease is an arrhythmic disorder that occurs in structurally normal heart and no transient or reversible arrhythmia factors, such as electrolyte disorders and myocardial ischemia. Ventricular arrhythmias without structural heart disease can be induced by multiple factors, including genetics and environment, which involve different genetic and epigenetic regulation. Familial genetic analysis reveals that cardiac ion-channel disorder and dysfunctional calcium handling are two major causes of this type of heart disease. Genome-wide association studies have identified some genetic susceptibility loci associated with ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, yet relatively few loci associated with no structural heart disease. The effects of epigenetics on the ventricular arrhythmias susceptibility genes, involving non-coding RNAs, DNA methylation and other regulatory mechanisms, are gradually being revealed. This article aims to review the knowledge of ventricular arrhythmia without structural heart disease in genetics, and summarizes the current state of epigenetic regulation.Copyright © 2022 Wang and Tu."
"35782726","Domestication and improvement genes reveal the differences of seed size- and oil-related traits in soybean domestication and improvement.","Comput Struct Biotechnol J","To address domestication and improvement studies of soybean seed size- and oil-related traits, a series of domesticated and improved regions, loci, and candidate genes were identified in 286 soybean accessions using domestication and improvement analyses, genome-wide association studies, quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping and bulked segregant analyses in this study. As a result, 534 candidate domestication regions (CDRs) and 458 candidate improvement regions (CIRs) were identified in this study and integrated with those in five and three previous studies, respectively, to obtain 952 CDRs and 538 CIRs; 1469 loci for soybean seed size- and oil-related traits were identified in this study and integrated with those in Soybase to obtain 433 QTL clusters. The two results were intersected to obtain 245 domestication and 221 improvement loci for the above traits. Around these trait-related domestication and improvement loci, 7 domestication and 7 improvement genes were found to be truly associated with these traits, and 372 candidate domestication and 87 candidate improvement genes were identified using gene expression, SNP variants in genome, miRNA binding, KEGG pathway, DNA methylation, and haplotype analysis. These genes were used to explain the trait changes in domestication and improvement. As a result, the trait changes can be explained by their frequencies of elite haplotypes, base mutations in coding region, and three factors affecting their expression levels. In addition, 56 domestication and 15 improvement genes may be valuable for future soybean breeding. This study can provide useful gene resources for future soybean breeding and molecular biology research.© 2022 The Author(s)."
"35781319","Random Field Modeling of Multi-trait Multi-locus Association for Detecting Methylation Quantitative Trait Loci.","Bioinformatics","CpG sites within the same genomic region often share similar methylation patterns and tend to be co-regulated by multiple genetic variants that may interact with one another.We propose a multi-trait methylation random field (multi-MRF) method to evaluate the joint association between a set of CpG sites and a set of genetic variants. The proposed method has several advantages. First, it is a multi-trait method that allows flexible correlation structures between neighboring CpG sites (e.g., distance-based correlation). Second, it is also a multi-locus method that integrates the effect of multiple common and rare genetic variants. Third, it models the methylation traits with a beta distribution to characterize their bimodal and interval properties. Through simulations, we demonstrated that the proposed method had improved power over some existing methods under various disease scenarios. We further illustrated the proposed method via an application to a study of congenital heart defects (CHD) with 83 cardiac tissue samples. Our results suggested that gene BACE2, a mQTL candidate, colocalized with expression QTLs in artery tibial and harbored genetic variants with nominal significant associations in two genome-wide association studies of CHD.https://github.com/chenlyu2656/Multi-MRF.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.© The Author(s) (2022).

"35779161","The Methylation Inhibitor 5-Aza-2'-Deoxycytidine Induces Genome-Wide Hypomethylation in Rice.","Rice (N Y)","DNA methylation is a conserved epigenetic modification which is vital for regulating gene expression and maintaining genome stability in both mammals and plants. Homozygous mutation of rice methyltransferase 1 (met1) gene can cause host death in rice, making it difficult to obtain plant material needed for hypomethylation research. To circumvent this challenge, the methylation inhibitor, 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (AzaD), is used as a cytosine nucleoside analogue to reduce genome wide hypomethylation and is widely used in hypomethylation research. However, how AzaD affects plant methylation profiles at the genome scale is largely unknown. Here, we treated rice seedlings with AzaD and compared the AzaD treatment with osmet1-2 mutants, illustrating that there are similar CG hypomethylation and distribution throughout the whole genome. Along with global methylation loss class I transposable elements (TEs) which are farther from genes compared with class II TEs, were more significantly activated, and the RNA-directed DNA Methylation (RdDM) pathway was activated in specific genomic regions to compensate for severe CG loss. Overall, our results suggest that AzaD is an effective DNA methylation inhibitor that can influence genome wide methylation and cause a series of epigenetic variations.© 2022. The Author(s)."

The m6A methylation, as the main member of epigenetic modifications, has been found to play an important role in different pulmonary diseases, but its regulatory effect on PM-induced lung damage remains unknown. This study firstly used the methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeRIP-seq) to reveal the m6A methylome profiles in the lung tissues of mice with acute PM exposure. Compared with the normal control, a total of 2210 differentially hypermethylated m6A peaks within 1879 genes and 1278 differentially hypomethylated m6A peaks within 1153 genes were identified in the PM-exposed group. Conjoint analysis of MeRIP-seq and high-throughput sequencing for RNA (RNA-seq) data predicated several potential pathways including MAPK signaling pathway, cell senescence, and cell cycle. Four m6A-modified differentially expressed genes (IL-1a, IL-1b, ADAM-8, and HMOX-1) were selected for validation using MeRIP-qPCR. Furthermore, the m6A-modified IL-1a promoted PM-induced inflammation via regulating MAPK signaling pathway. These results provide a new insight into the biological mechanism of PM-induced lung damage, and help us to develop new methods to prevent and treat PM-induced adverse health effects.Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

This study aimed to delineate differences in methylation patterns between T1D-affected and healthy individuals by examining the genome-wide methylation of individuals from three Arab families from Kuwait with T1D-affected mono-/dizygotic twins and non-twinned siblings. Bisulfite sequencing of DNA from the peripheral blood of the affected and healthy individuals from each of the three families was performed. Methylation profiles of the affected individuals were compared to those of the healthy individuals Principal component analysis on the observed methylation profiling based on base-pair resolution clustered the T1D-affected twins together family-wide. The sites/regions that were differentially methylated between the T1D and healthy samples harbored 84 genes, of which 18 were known to be differentially methylated in T1D individuals compared to healthy individuals in publicly available gene expression data resources. We further validated two of the 18 genes-namely ICA1 and DRAM1 that were hypermethylated in T1D samples compared to healthy samples-for upregulation in T1D samples from an extended study cohort of familial T1D. The study confirmed that the ICA1 and DRAM1 genes are differentially expressed in T1D samples compared to healthy samples.© 2022. The Author(s)."

We are unaware of epidemiological studies on longitudinal PA and placental DNA methylation (DNAm).We evaluated the association between PA before and during pregnancy and placental DNAm.Placental tissues were obtained at delivery and methylation was measured using HumanMethylation450 Beadchips for participants in the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Fetal Growth Studies-Singletons among 298 participants. Using the Pregnancy PA Questionnaire, women recalled periconception PA (past 12 months) at 8-13 weeks gestation, and PA since last visit at four follow-up visits at 16-22, 24-29, 30-33, 34-37 weeks. We conducted linear regression for associations of PA at each visit with methylation controlling for false discovery rate (FDR). Top 100 CpGs were queried for enrichment of functional pathways using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis.Periconception PA was significantly associated with 1 CpG site. PA since last visit for visits 1-4 was associated with 2, 2, 8, 0 CpGs (log fold changes ranging from -0.0319 to 0.0080, after controlling for FDR). The largest change in methylation occurred at a site in TIMP2, which is known to encode a protein critical for vasodilation, placentation, and uterine expansion during pregnancy (log fold change: -0.05, 95% confidence interval: -0.06, -0.03 per metabolic equivalent of task [MET]-hours/week at 30-33 weeks). Most significantly enriched pathways include Cardiac Hypertrophy Signaling, B Cell Receptor Signaling, and Netrin Signaling. Significant CpGs and enriched pathways varied by visit.Recreational PA in the year prior and during pregnancy was associated with placental DNAm. The associated CpG sites varied based on timing of PA. If replicated, the findings may inform the mechanisms underlying the impacts of PA on placenta health.

Multi-omics analyses showed that the most significant and largest number of associations among the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), DNA-methylated CpGs, MGMT expression, and AD-related neuropathological traits were observed among women. Furthermore, promoter capture Hi-C analyses revealed long-range interactions of the MGMT promoter with MGMT SNPs and CpG sites.These findings suggest that epigenetically regulated MGMT expression is involved in AD pathogenesis, especially in women.© 2022 The Authors.

To date, the regulation and function of DNA methylation is still unknown in tomato plants. Here, we generatedSlCMT4mutants using the CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing system. We observed severe developmental defects in CRISPR-Cas9-mediatedSlCMT4mutants, including small and thick leaves, increased lateral buds, defective stamens and pistils, small fruit size with reduced setting rate, and defective seed development. The alterations at hormonal levels (IAA, tZR, strigol) were consistent with the multibranching phenotype inSlCMT4mutant plants. CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout ofSlCMT4induced the expression of two pollen-specific genes (PMEIandPRALF) that suppressed the development of pollen wall and pollen tube elongation, which is responsible for irregular and defective pollen. The small-sized fruit phenotype is probably associated with upregulated expression of theIMAgene and reduced seeds in the mutant lines. Furthermore, we performed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) of fruits and found thatSlCMT4knockout reduced genome-wide cytosine methylation. A reduction of methylation was also observed in a 2-kp region of theIMAandLOXBpromoters in theSlCMT4-mutant fruits, indicating that the hypermethylation status of the CHH context is critical for the inhibition ofIMAandLOXBpromoter activity. Our results show thatSlCMT4is required for normal development of tomato vegetative and reproductive organs. This study illuminates the function ofSlCMT4and sheds light on the molecular regulatory mechanism of tomato plant architecture and fruit development and ripening.© The Author(s) 2022.

"35767387","Genome-wide methylation in the panmictic European eel (Anguilla anguilla).","Mol Ecol","The role of methylation in adaptive, developmental and speciation processes has attracted considerable interest, but interpretation of results is complicated by diffuse boundaries between genetic and non-genetic variation. We studied whole genome genetic and methylation variation in the European eel, distributed from subarctic to subtropical environments, but with panmixia precluding genetically based local adaptation beyond single-generation responses. Overall methylation was 70.9%, with hypomethylation predominantly found in promoters and first exons. Redundancy analyses involving juvenile glass eels showed 0.06% and 0.03% of the variance at SNPs to be explained by localities and environmental variables, respectively, with GO terms of genes associated with outliers primarily involving neural system functioning. For CpGs 2.98% and 1.36% of variance was explained by localities and environmental variables. Differentially methylated regions particularly included genes involved in developmental processes, with Hox clusters featuring prominently. Life stage (adult versus glass eels) was the most important source of inter-individual variation in methylation, probably reflecting both ageing and developmental processes. Demethylation of transposable elements relative to pure European eel was observed in European X American eel hybrids, possibly representing postzygotic barriers in this system characterized by prolonged speciation and ongoing gene flow. Whereas the genetic data are consistent with a role of single-generation selective responses, the methylation results underpin the importance of epigenetics in the life cycle of eels and suggest interactions between local environments, development and phenotypic variation mediated by methylation variation. Eels are remarkable by having retained eight Hox clusters, and the results suggest important roles of methylation at Hox genes for adaptive processes.© 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."
"35765087","Low reliability of DNA methylation across Illumina Infinium platforms in cord blood: implications for replication studies and meta-analyses of prenatal exposures.","Clin Epigenetics","There is an increasing interest in the role of epigenetics in epidemiology, but the emerging research field faces several critical biological and technical challenges. In particular, recent studies have shown poor correlation of measured DNA methylation (DNAm) levels within and across Illumina Infinium platforms in various tissues. In this study, we have investigated concordance between 450 k and EPIC Infinium platforms in cord blood. We could not replicate our previous findings on the association of prenatal paracetamol exposure with cord blood DNAm, which prompted an investigation of cross-platform DNAm differences.This study is based on two DNAm data sets from cord blood samples selected from the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa). DNAm of one data set was measured using the 450 k platform and the other data set was measured using the EPIC platform. Initial analyses of the EPIC data could not replicate any of our previous significant findings in the 450 k data on associations between prenatal paracetamol exposure and cord blood DNAm. A subset of the samples (n = 17) was included in both data sets, which enabled analyses of technical sources potentially contributing to the negative replication. Analyses of these 17 samples with repeated measurements revealed high per-sample correlations ([Formula: see text] 0.99), but low per-CpG correlations ([Formula: see text] ≈ 0.24) between the platforms. 1.7% of the CpGs exhibited a mean DNAm difference across platforms > 0.1. Furthermore, only 26.7% of the CpGs exhibited a moderate or better cross-platform reliability (intra-class correlation coefficient ≥ 0.5).The observations of low cross-platform probe correlation and reliability corroborate previous reports in other tissues. Our study cannot determine the origin of the differences between platforms. Nevertheless, it emulates the setting in studies using data from multiple Infinium platforms, often analysed several years apart. Therefore, the findings may have important implications for future epigenome-wide association studies (EWASs), in replication, meta-analyses and longitudinal studies. Cognisance and transparency of the challenges related to cross-platform studies may enhance the interpretation, replicability and validity of EWAS results both in cord blood and other tissues, ultimately improving the clinical relevance of epigenetic epidemiology.© 2022.

"35765052","Aberrant DNA hydroxymethylation reshapes transcription factor binding in myeloid neoplasms.","Clin Epigenetics","Epigenetic abnormalities in DNA hydroxymethylation (5hmC) have been detected in patients with myeloid neoplasms, suggesting that 5hmC might act as a valuable epigenetic mark to reflect the disease status of myeloid neoplasms. Here, we report systematic genome-wide mapping of the DNA hydroxymethylomes in over 70 patients with myeloid neoplasms. Our integrative analysis leads to the identification of distinct 5hmC signatures that can sensitively discriminate patients from healthy individuals. At the molecular level, we unveiled dynamic 5hmC changes within key transcription factor (e.g., the CEBP family) binding motifs that are essential for hematopoiesis and myeloid lineage specification. 5hmC redistribution was found to alter the genome-wide binding of CEBP-α, thereby reprogramming transcriptional outputs to affect leukemia cell survival and stemness. Taken together, we provide a comprehensive 5hmC atlas representative of myeloid neoplasms, which sets the stage for future exploration on the epigenetic etiology of hematological malignancies. Mechanistically, our study further furnishes important insights into how abnormal 5hmC distribution in patients directly interrupts the binding of transcription factors to reshape transcriptional landscapes and aggravate leukemogenesis.© 2022.

"35764919","Along the Bos taurus genome, uncover candidate imprinting control regions.","BMC Genomics","In mammals, Imprinting Control Regions (ICRs) regulate a subset of genes in a parent-of-origin-specific manner. In both human and mouse, previous studies identified a set of CpG-rich motifs occurring as clusters in ICRs and germline Differentially Methylated Regions (gDMRs). These motifs consist of the ZFP57 binding site (ZFBS) overlapping a subset of MLL binding units known as MLL morphemes. MLL or MLL1 (Mixed Lineage Leukemia 1) is a relatively large multidomain protein that plays a central role in the regulation of transcription. The structures of both MLL1 and MLL2 include a domain (MT) that binds CpG-rich DNA and a conserved domain (SET) that methylates lysine 4 in histone H3 producing H3K4me3 marks in chromatin.Since genomic imprinting impacts many developmental and key physiological processes, we followed a previous bioinformatics strategy to pinpoint ICR positions in the Bos taurus genome. Initial genome-wide analyses involved finding the positions of ZFP57 binding sites, and the CpG-rich motifs (ZFBS-morph overlaps) along cattle chromosomal DNA. By creating plots displaying the density of ZFBS-morph overlaps, we removed background noise and thus improved signal detection. With the density-plots, we could view the positions of peaks locating known and candidate ICRs in cattle DNA. Our evaluations revealed the correspondence of peaks in plots to reported known and inferred ICRs/DMRs in cattle. Beside peaks pinpointing such ICRs, the density-plots also revealed additional peaks. Since evaluations validated the robustness of our approach, we inferred that the additional peaks may correspond to candidate ICRs for imprinted gene expression.Our bioinformatics strategy offers the first genome-wide approach for systematically localizing candidate ICRs. Furthermore, we have tailored our datasets for upload onto the UCSC genome browser so that researchers could find known and candidate ICRs with respect to a wide variety of annotations at all scales: from the positions of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs), to positions of genes, transcripts, and repeated DNA elements. Furthermore, the UCSC genome browser offers tools to produce enlarged views: to uncover the genes in the vicinity of candidate ICRs and thus discover potential imprinted genes for experimental validations.© 2022.

Placental CpG methylation provides mechanistic information regarding the relationship between prenatal epigenetic programming, prematurity, neonatal inflammation, and later-in-life health.We contrasted CpG methylation in the placenta and neonatal blood spots in relation to neonatal inflammation in the Extremely Low Gestational Age Newborn (ELGAN) cohort. Neonatal inflammation status was based on the expression of six inflammation-related proteins, assessed as (1) day-one inflammation (DOI) or (2) intermittent or sustained systemic inflammation (ISSI, inflammation on ≥2 days in the first 2 postnatal weeks). Epigenome-wide CpG methylation was assessed in 354 placental samples and 318 neonatal blood samples.Placental CpG methylation displayed the strongest association with ISSI (48 CpG sites) but was not associated with DOI. This was in contrast to CpG methylation in blood spots, which was associated with DOI (111 CpG sites) and not with ISSI (one CpG site).Placental CpG methylation was strongly associated with ISSI, a measure of inflammation previously linked to later-in-life cognitive impairment, while day-one neonatal blood methylation was associated with DOI.Neonatal inflammation increases the risk of adverse later-life outcomes, especially in infants born extremely preterm. CpG methylation in the placenta and neonatal blood spots were evaluated in relation to neonatal inflammation assessed via circulating proteins as either (i) day-one inflammation (DOI) or (ii) intermittent or sustained systemic inflammation (ISSI, inflammation on ≥2 days in the first 2 weeks). Tissue specificity was observed in epigenetic-inflammatory relationships: placental CpG methylation was associated with ISSI, neonatal blood CpG methylation was associated with DOI. Supporting the placental origins of disease framework, placental epigenetic patterns are associated with a propensity for ISSI in neonates.© 2022.

Our aim was to identify novel genetic factors and genes contributing to DKD by performing meta-analysis of previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on DKD and by integrating the results with renal transcriptomics datasets.We performed GWAS meta-analyses using ten phenotypic definitions of DKD, including nearly 27,000 individuals with diabetes. Meta-analysis results were integrated with estimated quantitative trait locus data from human glomerular (N=119) and tubular (N=121) samples to perform transcriptome-wide association study. We also performed gene aggregate tests to jointly test all available common genetic markers within a gene, and combined the results with various kidney omics datasets.The meta-analysis identified a novel intronic variant (rs72831309) in the TENM2 gene associated with a lower risk of the combined chronic kidney disease (eGFR<60 ml/min per 1.73 m2) and DKD (microalbuminuria or worse) phenotype (p=9.8×10-9; although not withstanding correction for multiple testing, p>9.3×10-9). Gene-level analysis identified ten genes associated with DKD (COL20A1, DCLK1, EIF4E, PTPRN-RESP18, GPR158, INIP-SNX30, LSM14A and MFF; p<2.7×10-6). Integration of GWAS with human glomerular and tubular expression data demonstrated higher tubular AKIRIN2 gene expression in individuals with vs without DKD (p=1.1×10-6). The lead SNPs within six loci significantly altered DNA methylation of a nearby CpG site in kidneys (p<1.5×10-11). Expression of lead genes in kidney tubules or glomeruli correlated with relevant pathological phenotypes (e.g. TENM2 expression correlated positively with eGFR [p=1.6×10-8] and negatively with tubulointerstitial fibrosis [p=2.0×10-9], tubular DCLK1 expression correlated positively with fibrosis [p=7.4×10-16], and SNX30 expression correlated positively with eGFR [p=5.8×10-14] and negatively with fibrosis [p<2.0×10-16]).Altogether, the results point to novel genes contributing to the pathogenesis of DKD.The GWAS meta-analysis results can be accessed via the type 1 and type 2 diabetes (T1D and T2D, respectively) and Common Metabolic Diseases (CMD) Knowledge Portals, and downloaded on their respective download pages ( https://t1d.hugeamp.org/downloads.html ; https://t2d.hugeamp.org/downloads.html ; https://hugeamp.org/downloads.html ).© 2022.

DNA methylation was analyzed using the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip array. Analysis of variance and paired t-test were used to identify differentially methylated loci after 4 and 12 weeks of dietary treatment. A false discovery rate approach with a significance threshold of <5% was used to adjust for multiple comparisons.We observed a genome-wide decrease in DNA methylation, both globally and at specific sites, after 4 and 12 weeks of dietary treatment. A substantial share of the differentially methylated positions (CpGs) were annotated to genes associated with epilepsy (n = 7), lipid metabolism (n = 8), and transcriptional regulation (n = 10). Furthermore, five of the identified genes were related to inositol phosphate metabolism, which may represent a possible mechanism by which the ketogenic diet attenuates seizures.A better understanding of the modified ketogenic diet's influence at the molecular level may be the key to unraveling the mechanisms by which the diet can ameliorate seizures and possibly to identifying novel therapeutic targets for epilepsy.© 2022 The Authors.

Therefore, in the present study, we aimed to assess genome-wide DNA methylation changes associated explicitly with the pathogenesis of UC.DNA methylation changes were identified by comparing UC tissues with healthy controls (HCs) from the GEO databases. The candidate genes were obtained and verified in clinical samples. Moreover, the underlying molecular mechanism related to Zbtb7b in the pathogenesis of UC was explored using the dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis model.Bioinformatic analysis from GEO databases confirmed that Zbtb7b, known as Th-inducing POZ-Kruppel factor (ThPOK), was demethylated in UC tissues. Then, we demonstrated that Zbtb7b was in a hypo-methylation pattern through the DSS-induced colitis model (P = 0.0357), whereas the expression of Zbtb7b at the mRNA and protein levels was significantly up-regulated in the inflamed colonic tissues of UC patients (qRT-PCR, WB, IHC: P < 0.0001, P = 0.0079, P < 0.0001) and DSS-induced colitis model (qRT-PCR, WB, IHC: P < 0.0001, P = 0.0045, P = 0.0004). Moreover, the expression of Zbtb7b was positively associated with the degree of UC activity. Mechanically, over-expression of Zbtb7b might activate the maturation of CD4+T cells (FCM, IF: P = 0.0240, P = 0.0003) and repress the differentiation of double-positive CD4+CD8+T (DP CD4+CD8+T) cells (FCM, IF: P = 0.0247, P = 0.0118), contributing to the production of inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α (P = 0.0005, P = 0.0005), IL-17 (P = 0.0014, P = 0.0381), and IFN-γ (P = 0.0016, P = 0.0042), in the serum and colonic tissue of DSS-induced colitis model.Epigenetic DNA hypo-methylation of Zbtb7b activated the maturation of CD4+T cells and repressed the differentiation of DP CD4+CD8+T cells, resulting in the production of inflammatory cytokines and colonic inflammation in UC. Therefore, Zbtb7b might be a diagnostic and therapeutic biomarker for UC, and hypo-methylation might affect the biological function of Zbtb7b.© 2022. The Author(s)."

Although viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, may evade host immune responses by epigenetic mechanisms including DNA methylation, little is known about whether these modifications are important in defence against and healthy recovery from COVID-19 in the host. To this end, epigenome-wide DNA methylation patterns from COVID-19 convalescents were compared to uninfected controls from before and after the pandemic. Peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) DNA was extracted from uninfected controls, COVID-19 convalescents, and symptom-free individuals with SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell-responses, as well as from PBMCs stimulatedin vitrowith SARS-CoV-2. Subsequently, the Illumina MethylationEPIC 850K array was performed, and statistical/bioinformatic analyses comprised differential DNA methylation, pathway over-representation, and module identification analyses. Differential DNA methylation patterns distinguished COVID-19 convalescents from uninfected controls, with similar results in an experimental SARS-CoV-2 infection model. A SARS-CoV-2-induced module was identifiedin vivo, comprising 66 genes of which six (TP53, INS, HSPA4, SP1, ESR1,andFAS) were present in correspondingin vitroanalyses. Over-representation analyses revealed involvement in Wnt, muscarinic acetylcholine receptor signalling, and gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor pathways. Furthermore, numerous differentially methylated and network genes from both settings interacted with the SARS-CoV-2 interactome. Altered DNA methylation patterns of COVID-19 convalescents suggest recovery from mild-to-moderate SARS-CoV-2 infection leaves longstanding epigenetic traces. Bothin vitroandin vivoexposure caused epigenetic modulation of pathways thataffect odour perception. Future studies should determine whether this reflects host-induced protective antiviral defense or targeted viral hijacking to evade host defence."
"35754944","Epigenetics in susceptibility, progression, and diagnosis of periodontitis.","Jpn Dent Sci Rev","Periodontitis is characterized by irreversible destruction of periodontal tissue. At present, the accepted etiology of periodontitis is based on a three-factor theory including pathogenic bacteria, host factors, and acquired factors. Periodontitis development usually takes a decade or longer and is therefore called chronic periodontitis (CP). To search for genetic factors associated with CP, several genome-wide association study (GWAS) analyses were conducted; however, polymorphisms associated with CP have not been identified. Epigenetics, on the other hand, involves acquired transcriptional regulatory mechanisms due to reversibly altered chromatin accessibility. Epigenetic status is a condition specific to each tissue and cell, mostly determined by the responses of host cells to stimulations by local factors, like bacterial inflammation, and systemic factors such as nutrition status, metabolic diseases, and health conditions. Significantly, epigenetic status has been linked with the onset and progression of several acquired diseases. Thus, epigenetic factors in periodontal tissues are attractive targets for periodontitis diagnosis and treatments. In this review, we introduce accumulating evidence to reveal the epigenetic background effects related to periodontitis caused by genetic factors, systemic diseases, and local environmental factors, such as smoking, and clarify the underlying mechanisms by which epigenetic alteration influences the susceptibility of periodontitis.© 2022 The Authors."

The genetic basis of asthma exacerbations has been studied in several populations, but no prior study has performed a multi-ancestry meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (meta-GWAS) for this trait. We aimed to identify common genetic loci associated with asthma exacerbations across diverse populations and to assess their functional role in regulating DNA methylation and gene expression.A meta-GWAS of asthma exacerbations in 4989 Europeans, 2181 Hispanics/Latinos, 1250 Singaporean Chinese, and 972 African Americans analyzed 9.6 million genetic variants. Suggestively associated variants (p ≤ 5 × 10-5) were assessed for replication in 36,477 European and 1078 non-European asthma patients. Functional effects on DNA methylation were assessed in 595 Hispanic/Latino and African American asthma patients and in publicly available databases. The effect on gene expression was evaluated in silico.One hundred and twenty-six independent variants were suggestively associated with asthma exacerbations in the discovery phase. Two variants independently replicated: rs12091010 located at vascular cell adhesion molecule-1/exostosin like glycosyltransferase-2 (VCAM1/EXTL2) (discovery: odds ratio (ORT allele) = 0.82, p = 9.05 × 10-6and replication: ORT allele = 0.89, p = 5.35 × 10-3) and rs943126 from pantothenate kinase 1 (PANK1) (discovery: ORC allele = 0.85, p = 3.10 × 10-5and replication: ORC allele = 0.89, p = 1.30 × 10-2). Both variants regulate gene expression of genes where they locate and DNA methylation levels of nearby genes in whole blood.This multi-ancestry study revealed novel suggestive regulatory loci for asthma exacerbations located in genomic regions participating in inflammation and host defense.© 2022 The Authors.

"35753057","A Bayesian hierarchical model for improving measurement of 5mC and 5hmC levels: Toward revealing associations between phenotypes and methylation states.","Genet Epidemiol","5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) is a methylation state linked with gene regulation, commonly found in cells of the central nervous system. 5hmC is associated with demethylation of cytosines from 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to the unmethylated state. The presence of 5hmC can be inferred by a paired experiment involving bisulfite and oxidation-bisulfite treatments on the same sample, followed by a methylation assay using a platform such as the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip (EPIC). Existing methods for analysis of the resulting EPIC data are not ideal. Most approaches ignore the correlation between the two experiments and any imprecision associated with DNA damage from the additional treatment. Estimates of 5mC/5hmC levels free from these limitations are desirable to reveal associations between methylation states and phenotypes. We propose a hierarchical Bayesian method called Constrained HYdroxy Methylation Estimation (CHYME) to simultaneously estimate 5mC/5hmC signals as well as any associations between these signals and covariates or phenotypes, while accounting for the potential impact of DNA damage and dependencies induced by the experimental design. Simulations show that CHYME has valid type 1 error and better power than a range of alternative methods, including the popular OxyBS method and linear models on transformed proportions. Other methods we examined suffer from hugely inflated type 1 error for inference on 5hmC proportions. We use CHYME to explore genome-wide associations between 5mC/5hmC levels and cause of death in postmortem prefrontal cortex brain tissue samples. These analyses indicate that CHYME is a useful tool to reveal phenotypic associations with 5mC/5hmC levels.© 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC."

Pectin is the primary constituent of cell walls, a degree of methylation of pectin polysaccharides regulated by the pectin methylesterase (PME) genes can greatly affect the Al binding capacity. The knowledge on PME gene family in tea plant is still poor.We identified 66 (CsPME1-CsPME66) PME genes from C. sinensis genome. We studied their protein characterization, conserved motifs, gene structure, systematic evolution and gene expression under Al treatments, to establish a basis for in-depth research on the function of PMEs in tea plant. Gene structures analysis revealed that the majority of PME genes had 2-4 exons. Phylogenetic results pointed out that the PME genes from the same species displayed comparatively high sequence consistency and genetic similarity. Selective pressure investigation suggested that the Ka/Ks value for homologous genes of PME family was less than one. The expression of CsPMEs under three Al concentration treatments was tissue specific, eight PME genes in leaves and 15 in roots displayed a trend similar to of the Al contents and PME activities under Al concentration treatments, indicating that the degree of pectin de-esterification regulated by PME was crucial for Al tolerance of tea plant.Sixty-six CsPME genes were identified for the first time in tea plant. The genome-wide identification, classification, evolutionary and transcription analyses of the PME gene family provided a new direction for further research on the function of PME gene in Al tolerance of tea plant.© 2022.

To explore the function of NAP1 family genes in moso bamboo (Phyllostachys edulis), characterized by extremely rapid growth and a long flowering cycle, we originally conducted a genome-wide analysis of the PheNAP1 gene. The phylogenetic relationship, gene expression pattern, DNA methylation, and histone modification were analyzed. Eventually, 12 PheNAP1 genes were recognized from thePhyllostachys edulisgenome, divided into two sorts: the NRP subfamily (four members) and the NAP subfamily (eight members). Highly conserved motifs exist in each subfamily, which are distinct between subfamilies. PheNAP1 was distributed homogeneously on 10 out of 24 chromosomes, and gene duplication contributed significantly to the enhancement of the PheNAP1 gene in the genome.Cis-acting element analysis showed that PheNAP1 family genes are involved in light, hormone, and abiotic stress responses and may play an important role in the rapid growth and flowering. PheNAP1 exhibited the highest expression level in fast-growing shoots, indicating it is closely associated with the rapid growth of moso bamboo. Besides, PheNAP1 can rescue the early-flowering phenotype ofnrp1-1 nrp2-2, and it affected the expression of genes related to the flowering pathway, likeBSU1, suggesting the vital role that PheNAP1 may take in the flowering process of moso bamboo. In addition, histone modification results showed that PheNAP1 could bind to phosphorylation-, acetylation-, and methylation-modified histones to further regulate gene expression. A sketch appears: that PheNAP1 can accompany histones to regulate fast-growth- and flowering-related genes in moso bamboo. The consequences of this study enrich the understanding of the epigenetic regulation mechanism of bamboo plants and lays a foundation for further studies on the role of the NAP1 gene inPhyllostachys edulisand the function of chromatin regulation in forest growth and development."

In this study, we aimed to prioritize the most likely 'causal' genes and identify functional characteristics and underlying biological pathways of POAG candidate genes.We used the results of a large POAG genome-wide association analysis study from GERA and UK Biobank cohorts. First, we performed systematic gene-prioritization analyses based on: (i) nearest genes; (ii) nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms; (iii) co-regulation analysis; (iv) transcriptome-wide association studies; and (v) epigenomic data. Next, we performed functional enrichment analyses to find overrepresented functional pathways and tissues.We identified 142 prioritized genes, of which 64 were novel for POAG.BICC1,AFAP1, andABCA1were the most highly prioritized genes based on four or more lines of evidence. The most significant pathways were related to extracellular matrix turnover, transforming growth factor-β, blood vessel development, and retinoic acid receptor signaling. Ocular tissues such as sclera and trabecular meshwork showed enrichment in prioritized gene expression (&gt;1.5 fold). We found pleiotropy of POAG with intraocular pressure and optic-disc parameters, as well as genetic correlation with hypertension and diabetes-related eye disease.Our findings contribute to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying glaucoma pathogenesis and have prioritized many novel candidate genes for functional follow-up studies."

In grapevine interaction with pathogens, epigenetic regulation still remains a black box. In this work, we characterized grapevine DNA methyltransferase gene family and identified nine DNA methyltransferases genes across eight grapevine chromosomes coding for 17 proteins. We also assessed the modulation of global cytosine methylation and gene expression levels of these genes with the aim of establishing a connection between DNA methylation and grapevine resistance towards downy mildew. Our results revealed that, in the incompatible interaction, an early hypomethylation, coupled with downregulation of DNMT and CMT genes occurs very early after pathogen inoculation. Additionally, the compatible interaction is characterized by a hypermethylation at 6hpi. A temporal delay is evident between the shifts in DNA methyltransferases gene expression in both compatible and incompatible interactions which in turn may be reflected in the global methylation percentage. Overall, we present the first evidence of an epigenetic regulation role in grapevine defense against P. viticola.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

The majority of melanocytic proliferations can be classified solely based on clinical and pathological criteria, however in select cases a definitive diagnostic assessment remains challenging and additional diagnostic biomarkers would be advantageous. We analyzed melanomas, nevi, Spitz nevi and atypical spitzoid tumors using parallel sequencing (exons of 611 genes and 507 gene translocation analysis) and methylation arrays (850k Illumina EPIC). By combining detailed genetic and epigenetic analysis with reference-based and reference-free DNA methylome deconvolution we compared Spitz nevi to nevi and melanoma and assessed the potential for these methods in classifying challenging spitzoid tumors. Results were correlated with clinical and histologic features. Spitz nevi were found to cluster independently of nevi and melanoma and demonstrated a different mutation profile. Multiple copy number alterations and TERT promoter mutations were identified only in melanomas. Genome-wide methylation in Spitz nevi was comparable to benign nevi while the Leukocytes UnMethylation for Purity (LUMP) algorithm in Spitz nevi was comparable to melanoma. Histologically difficult to classify Spitz tumor cases were assessed which, based on methylation arrays, clustered between Spitz nevi and melanoma and in terms of genetic profile or copy number variations demonstrated worrisome features suggesting a malignant neoplasm. Comprehensive sequencing and methylation analysis verify Spitz nevi as an independent melanocytic entity distinct from both nevi and melanoma. Combined genetic and methylation assays can offer additional insights in diagnosing difficult to classify Spitzoid tumors.© 2022 The Authors.

However, metabolites with a high degree of missingness, such as drug metabolites and xenobiotics, are often excluded from such studies due to a lack of statistical power and higher uncertainty in their quantification. Here we propose ratios between related drug metabolites as GWAS phenotypes that can drastically increase power to detect genetic associations between pairs of biochemically related molecules. As a proof-of-concept we conducted a GWAS with 520 individuals from the Qatar Biobank for who at least five of the nine available acetaminophen metabolites have been detected. We identified compelling evidence for genetic variance in acetaminophen glucuronidation and methylation by UGT2A15 and COMT, respectively. Based on the metabolite ratio association profiles of these two loci we hypothesized the chemical structure of one of their products or substrates as being 3-methoxyacetaminophen, which we then confirmed experimentally. Taken together, our study suggests a novel approach to analyze metabolites with a high degree of missingness in a GWAS setting with ratios, and it also demonstrates how pharmacological pathways can be mapped out using non-targeted metabolomics measurements in large population-based studies."

Moreover, sensation-seeking, or biological correlates of sensation-seeking, are suggested as factors linking victimization to delinquency. Here, we focused on epigenetic correlates of sensation-seeking. First, we identified DNA methylation (DNAm) patterns related to sensation-seeking. Second, we investigated the association between sensation-seeking related DNAm and the development of delinquency. Third, we examined whether victimization was related to sensation-seeking related DNAm and the development of delinquency. Participants (N= 905; 49% boys) came from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. DNAm was assessed at birth, age 7 and age 15-17. Sensation-seeking (self-reports) was assessed at age 11 and 14. Delinquency (self-reports) was assessed at age 17-19. Sensation-seeking epigenome-wide association study revealed that no probes reached the critical significance level. However, 20 differential methylated probes reached marginal significance. With these 20 suggestive sites, a sensation-seeking cumulative DNAm risk score was created. Results showed that this DNAm risk score at age 15-17 was related to delinquency at age 17-19. Moreover, an indirect effect of victimization to delinquency via DNAm was found. Sensation-seeking related DNAm is a potential biological correlate that can help to understand the development of delinquency, including how victimization might be associated with adolescent delinquency."

Identifying the maternal factors that contribute to adverse birth outcomes in the next generation is thus a priority. Epigenetic clocks, which have emerged as powerful tools for quantifying biological aging and various dimensions of physiological dysregulation, hold promise for clarifying relationships between maternal biology and infant health, including the maternal factors or states that predict birth outcomes. Nevertheless, studies exploring the relationship between maternal epigenetic age and birth outcomes remain few. Here, we attempt to replicate a series of analyses previously reported in a US-based sample, using a larger similarly aged sample (n = 296) of participants of a long-running study in the Philippines. New pregnancies were identified prospectively, dried blood spot samples were collected during the third trimester, and information was obtained on gestational age at delivery and offspring weight after birth. Genome-wide DNA methylation was assessed with the Infinium EPIC array. Using a suite of 15 epigenetic clocks, we only found one significant relationship: advanced age on the epigenetic clock trained on leptin predicted a significantly earlier gestational age at delivery (β = - 0.15, p = 0.009). Of the other 29 relationships tested predicting gestational age and offspring birth weight, none were statistically significant.

"35733026","Investigating Histone Modification Dynamics by Mechanistic Computational Modeling.","Methods Mol Biol","The maintenance of transcriptional states regulated by histone modifications and controlled switching between these states are fundamental concepts in our understanding of nucleosome-mediated epigenetic memory. Any approach relying on genome-wide bioinformatic analyses alone offers limited scope for dissecting the molecular mechanisms involved in maintenance and switching. Mechanistic mathematical models-describing the dynamics of histone modifications at individual genomic loci-offer an alternative way to investigate these mechanisms. These models, in conjunction with quantitative experimental data-ChIP data, quantification of mRNA levels, and single-cell fluorescence tracking in clonal lineages-can generate predictions that drive more targeted experiments, allowing us to understand mechanisms that would be challenging to unravel by a purely experimental approach. In this chapter, we describe a generic stochastic modeling framework that can be used to capture histone modification dynamics and associated molecular processes-including transcription and read-write feedback by chromatin modifying complexes-at individual genomic loci. Using a specific example-transcriptional silencing by Polycomb-mediated H3K27 methylation-we demonstrate how to construct and simulate a stochastic histone modification model. We provide a step-by-step guide to programming simulations for such a model and discuss how to analyze the simulation output.© 2022.

We evaluated the utility of using lifetime-long self-reported exposures for identifying differential methylation in an amyotrophic lateral sclerosis cases-control cohort of 855 individuals. Individuals submitted paper-based surveys on exposure and occupational histories as well as whole blood samples. Genome-wide DNA methylation levels were quantified using the Illumina Infinium Human Methylation450 array. We analyzed 15 environmental exposures using the OSCA software linear and MOA models, where we regressed exposures individually by methylation adjusted for batch effects and disease status as well as predicted scores for age, sex, cell count, and smoking status. We also regressed on the first principal components on clustered environmental exposures to detect DNA methylation changes associated with a more generalised definition of environmental exposure. Five DNA methylation probes across three environmental exposures (cadmium, mercury and metalwork) were significantly associated using the MOA models and seven through the linear models, with one additionally across a principal component representing chemical exposures. Methylome-wide significance for four of these markers was driven by extreme hyper/hypo-methylation in small numbers of individuals. The results indicate the potential for using self-reported exposure histories in detecting DNA methylation changes in response to the environment, but also highlight the confounded nature of environmental exposure in cohort studies.© 2022.

It has been recently demonstrated that PD patients have reduced fecal levels of the potent epigenetic modulator butyrate and its bacterial producers.Here, we investigate whether the changes in the gut microbiome and associated metabolites are related to PD symptoms and epigenetic markers in leucocytes and neurons.Stool, whole blood samples, and clinical data were collected from 55 PD patients and 55 controls. We performed DNA methylation analysis on whole blood samples and analyzed the results in relation to fecal short-chain fatty acid concentrations and microbiota composition. In another cohort, prefrontal cortex neurons were isolated from control and PD brains. We identified genome-wide DNA methylation by targeted bisulfite sequencing.We show that lower fecal butyrate and reduced counts of genera Roseburia, Romboutsia, and Prevotella are related to depressive symptoms in PD patients. Genes containing butyrate-associated methylation sites include PD risk genes and significantly overlap with sites epigenetically altered in PD blood leucocytes, predominantly neutrophils, and in brain neurons, relative to controls. Moreover, butyrate-associated methylated-DNA regions in PD overlap with those altered in gastrointestinal (GI), autoimmune, and psychiatric diseases.Decreased levels of bacterially produced butyrate are related to epigenetic changes in leucocytes and neurons from PD patients and to the severity of their depressive symptoms. PD shares common butyrate-dependent epigenetic changes with certain GI and psychiatric disorders, which could be relevant for their epidemiological relation. © 2022 The Authors.

In an epigenome-wide association study using the Infinium MethylationEPIC Beadchip, we sought to identify genome-wide placental differentially methylated genes and enriched pathways in GDM, and to assess the correlations with fetal growth and metabolic health biomarkers in cord blood. The study samples were 30 pairs of term placentas in GDM vs. euglycemic pregnancies (controls) matched by infant sex and gestational age at delivery in the Shanghai Birth Cohort. Cord blood metabolic health biomarkers included insulin, C-peptide, proinsulin, IGF-I, IGF-II, leptin and adiponectin. Adjusting for maternal age, pre-pregnancy BMI, parity, mode of delivery and placental cell type heterogeneity, 256 differentially methylated positions (DMPs,130 hypermethylated and 126 hypomethylated) were detected between GDM and control groups accounting for multiple tests with false discovery rate <0.05 and beta-value difference >0.05. WSCD2 was identified as a differentially methylated gene in both site- and region-level analyses.

Multiple lines of evidence suggest epigenetic mechanisms may mediate the impact of heritable genetic variation on phenotypes. Here, we investigated whether DNA methylation mediates the effect of genetic risk loci for childhood ALL. We performed an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) including 808 childhood ALL cases and 919 controls from California-based studies using neonatal blood DNA. For differentially methylated CpG positions (DMPs), we next conducted association analysis with 23 known ALL risk SNPs followed by causal mediation analyses addressing the significant SNP-DMP pairs. DNA methylation at CpG cg01139861, in the promoter region of IKZF1, mediated the effects of the intronic IKZF1 risk SNP rs78396808, with the average causal mediation effect (ACME) explaining ~ 30% of the total effect (ACME P = 0.0031). In analyses stratified by self-reported race/ethnicity, the mediation effect was only significant in Latinos, explaining ~ 41% of the total effect of rs78396808 on ALL risk (ACME P = 0.0037). Conditional analyses confirmed the presence of at least three independent genetic risk loci for childhood ALL at IKZF1, with rs78396808 unique to non-European populations. We also demonstrated that the most significant DMP in the EWAS, CpG cg13344587 at gene ARID5B (P = 8.61x10-10), was entirely confounded by the ARID5B ALL risk SNP rs7090445. Our findings provide new insights into the functional pathways of ALL risk SNPs and the DNA methylation differences associated with risk of childhood ALL.© The Author(s) 2022.

"35715741","Hypermethylation of TMEM240 predicts poor hormone therapy response and disease progression in breast cancer.","Mol Med","Approximately 25% of patients with early-stage breast cancer experience cancer progression throughout the disease course. Alterations in TMEM240 in breast cancer were identified and investigated to monitor treatment response and disease progression.Circulating methylated TMEM240 in the plasma of breast cancer patients was used to monitor treatment response and disease progression. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data in Western countries and Illumina methylation arrays in Taiwanese breast cancer patients were used to identify novel hypermethylated CpG sites and genes related to poor hormone therapy response. Quantitative methylation-specific PCR (QMSP), real-time reverse transcription PCR, and immunohistochemical analyses were performed to measure DNA methylation and mRNA and protein expression levels in 394 samples from Taiwanese and Korean breast cancer patients. TMEM240 gene manipulation, viability, migration assays, RNA-seq, and MetaCore were performed to determine its biological functions and relationship to hormone drug treatment response in breast cancer cells.Aberrant methylated TMEM240 was identified in breast cancer patients with poor hormone therapy response using genome-wide methylation analysis in the Taiwan and TCGA breast cancer cohorts. A cell model showed that TMEM240, which is localized to the cell membrane and cytoplasm, represses breast cancer cell proliferation and migration and regulates the expression levels of enzymes involved in estrone and estradiol metabolism. TMEM240 protein expression was observed in normal breast tissues but was not detected in 88.2% (67/76) of breast tumors and in 90.0% (9/10) of metastatic tumors from breast cancer patients. QMSP revealed that in 54.5% (55/101) of Taiwanese breast cancer patients, the methylation level of TMEM240 was at least twofold higher in tumor tissues than in matched normal breast tissues. Patients with hypermethylation of TMEM240 had poor 10-year overall survival (p = 0.003) and poor treatment response, especially hormone therapy response (p < 0.001). Circulating methylated TMEM240 dramatically and gradually decreased and then diminished in patients without disease progression, whereas it returned and its levels in plasma rose again in patients with disease progression. Prediction of disease progression based on circulating methylated TMEM240 was found to have 87.5% sensitivity, 93.1% specificity, and 90.2% accuracy.Hypermethylation of TMEM240 is a potential biomarker for treatment response and disease progression monitoring in breast cancer.© 2022.

"35715447","Computational epigenetic landscape analysis reveals association of CACNA1G-AS1, F11-AS1, NNT-AS1, and MSC-AS1 lncRNAs in prostate cancer progression through aberrant methylation.","Sci Rep","Aberrant expression of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), caused by alterations in DNA methylation, is a driving factor in several cancers. Interplay between lncRNAs' aberrant methylation and expression in prostate cancer (PC) progression still remains largely elusive. Therefore, this study characterized the genome-wide epigenetic landscape and expression profiles of lncRNAs and their clinical impact by integrating multi-omics data implementing bioinformatics approaches. We identified 62 differentially methylated CpG-sites (DMCs) and 199 differentially expressed lncRNAs (DElncRNAs), where 32 DElncRNAs contain 32 corresponding DMCs within promoter regions. Significant negative correlation was observed between 8 DElncRNAs-DMCs pairs. 3 (cg23614229, cg23957912, and cg11052780) DMCs and 4 (CACNA1G-AS1, F11-AS1, NNT-AS1, and MSC-AS1) DElncRNAs were identified as high-risk factors for poor prognosis of PC patients. Overexpression of hypo-methylated CACNA1G-AS1, F11-AS1, and NNT-AS1 and down-regulation of hyper-methylated MSC-AS1 significantly lower the survival of PC patients and could be a potential prognostic and therapeutic biomarker. These DElncRNAs were found to be associated with several molecular functions whose deregulation can lead to cancer. Involvement of these epigenetically deregulated DElncRNAs in cancer-related biological processes was also noticed. These findings provide new insights into the understanding of lncRNA regulation by aberrant DNA methylation which will help to clarify the epigenetic mechanisms underlying PC.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35714765","Identification and functional implications of pseudouridine RNA modification on small noncoding RNAs in the mammalian pathogen Trypanosoma brucei.","J Biol Chem","Trypanosoma brucei, the parasite that causes sleeping sickness, cycles between an insect and a mammalian host. However, the effect of RNA modifications such as pseudouridinylation on its ability to survive in these two different host environments is unclear. Here, two genome-wide approaches were applied for mapping pseudouridinylation sites (Ψs) on small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA), 7SL RNA, vault RNA, and tRNAs from T. brucei. We show using HydraPsiSeq and RiboMeth-seq that the Ψ on C/D snoRNA guiding 2'-O-methylation increased the efficiency of the guided modification on its target, rRNA. We found differential levels of Ψs on these noncoding RNAs in the two life stages (insect host and mammalian host) of the parasite. Furthermore, tRNA isoform abundance and Ψ modifications were characterized in these two life stages demonstrating stage-specific regulation. We conclude that the differential Ψ modifications identified here may contribute to modulating the function of noncoding RNAs involved in rRNA processing, rRNA modification, protein synthesis, and protein translocation during cycling of the parasite between its two hosts.Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

"35714684","Influences of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon on the epigenome toxicity and its applicability in human health risk assessment.","Environ Res","The existence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in ambient air is an escalating concern worldwide because of their ability to cause cancer and induce permanent changes in the genetic material. Growing evidence implies that during early life-sensitive stages, the risk of progression of acute and chronic diseases depends on epigenetic changes initiated by the influence of environmental cues. Several reports deciphered the relationship between exposure to environmental chemicals and epigenetics, and have known toxicants that alter the epigenetic states. Amongst PAHs, benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) is accepted as a group 1 cancer-causing agent by the International Agency for the Research on Cancer (IARC). B[a]P is a well-studied pro-carcinogen that is metabolically activated by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)/cytochrome P450 pathway. Cytochrome P450 plays a pivotal role in the stimulation step, which is essential for DNA adduct formation. Accruing evidence suggests that epigenetic alterations assume a fundamental part in PAH-promoted carcinogenesis. This interaction between PAHs and epigenetic factors results in an altered profile of these marks, globally and locus-specific. Some of the epigenetic changes due to exposure to PAHs lead to increased disease susceptibility and progression. It is well understood that exposure to environmental carcinogens, such as PAH triggers disease pathways through changes in the genome. Several evidence reported due to the epigenome-wide association studies, that early life adverse environmental events may trigger widespread and persistent variations in transcriptional profiling. Moreover, these variations respond to DNA damage and/or a consequence of epigenetic modifications that need further investigation. Growing evidence has associated PAHs with epigenetic variations involving alterations in DNA methylation, histone modification, and micro RNA (miRNA) regulation. Epigenetic alterations to PAH exposure were related to chronic diseases, such as pulmonary disease, cardiovascular disease, endocrine disruptor, nervous system disorder, and cancer. This hormetic response gives a novel perception concerning the toxicity of PAHs and the biological reaction that may be a distinct reliance on exposure. This review sheds light on understanding the latest evidence about how PAHs can alter epigenetic patterns and human health. In conclusion, as several epigenetic change mechanisms remain unclear yet, further analyses derived from PAHs exposure must be performed to find new targets and disease biomarkers. In spite of the current limitations, numerous evidence supports the perception that epigenetics grips substantial potential for advancing our knowledge about the molecular mechanisms of environmental toxicants, also for predicting health-associated risks due to environmental circumstances exposure and individual susceptibility.Published by Elsevier Inc."
"35713935","Embryonic heat conditioning in chicks induces transgenerational heat/immunological resilience via methylation on regulatory elements.","FASEB J","The question of whether behavioral traits are heritable is under debate. An obstacle in demonstrating transgenerational inheritance in mammals originates from the maternal environment's effect on offspring phenotype. Here, we used in ovo embryonic heat conditioning (EHC) of first-generation chicks, demonstrating heredity of both heat and immunological resilience, confirmed by a reduced fibril response in their untreated offspring to either heat or LPS challenge. Concordantly, transcriptome analysis confirmed that EHC induces changes in gene expression in the anterior preoptic hypothalamus (APH) that contribute to these phenotypes in the offspring. To study the association between epigenetic mechanisms and trait heritability, DNA-methylation patterns in the APH of offspring of control versus EHC fathers were evaluated. Genome-wide analysis revealed thousands of differentially methylated sites (DMSs), which were highly enriched in enhancers and CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) sites. Overlap analysis revealed 110 differentially expressed genes that were associated with altered methylation, predominantly on enhancers. Gene-ontology analysis shows pathways associated with immune response, chaperone-mediated protein folding, and stress response. For the proof of concept, we focused on HSP25 and SOCS3, modulators of heat and immune responses, respectively. Chromosome conformational capture (3C) assay identified interactions between their promoters and methylated enhancers, with the strongest frequency on CTCF binding sites. Furthermore, gene expression corresponded with the differential methylation patterns, and presented increased CTCF binding in both hyper- and hypomethylated DMSs. Collectively, we demonstrate that EHC induces transgenerational thermal and immunological resilience traits. We propose that one of the mechanisms underlying inheritance depends on three-dimensional (3D) chromatin reorganization.© 2022 The Authors.

"35712082","DNA methylation dynamics associated with long-term isolation of simulated space travel.","iScience","Long-term isolation is one of the risk factors that astronauts will encounter in spaceflight. At present, few researches have explored DNA methylation dynamics during long-term isolation. In this study, using time series DNA methylation data from ""Mars-500"" mission, we conducted a multi-step analysis to investigate the characteristics and dynamic patterns of DNA methylation as well as their functional insights during long-term isolation. The results showed that genome-wide methylation changes were minimal. In the six identified DNA methylation dynamic patterns, most of significantly fluctuating CpG sites could be returned to the baseline in post-isolation, and the remaining sites persistently decreased during isolation. Next, functional enrichment analysis of genes with each pattern revealed strong functional specificity. Some patterns were also significantly associated with nervous system diseases, digestive system diseases and cancers. In conclusion, the DNA methylation dynamics during long-term isolation have great functional significance, and might be helpful for protection of astronaut health.© 2022 The Author(s)."
"35712076","Investigating the genetic architecture of eye colour in a Canadian cohort.","iScience","Eye color is highly variable in populations with European ancestry, ranging from low to high quantities of melanin in the iris. Polymorphisms in theHERC2/OCA2locus have the largest effect on eye color in these populations, although other genomic regions also influence eye color. We performed genome-wide association studies of eye color in a Canadian cohort of European ancestry (N = 5,641) and investigated candidate causal variants. We uncovered several candidate causal signals in theHERC2/OCA2region, whereas other loci likely harbor a single causal signal. We observed colocalization of eye color signals with the expression or methylation profiles of cultured primary melanocytes. Genetic correlations of eye and hair color suggest high genome-wide pleiotropy, but locus-level differences in the genetic architecture of both traits. Overall, we provide a better picture of the polymorphisms underpinning eye color variation, which may be a consequence of specific molecular processes in the iris melanocytes.© 2022 The Author(s)."
"35712020","Context-dependant enhancers as a reservoir of functional polymorphisms and epigenetic markers linked to alcohol use disorders and comorbidities.","Addict Neurosci","Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is one of the major causes of mortality and morbidity world-wide. It is estimated that 50% of the causes of AUD are heritable. Efforts to determine the genetic determinants governing AUD using genome wide association studies (GWAS) show that the most strongly associated SNPs occur within, or in the vicinity of, genes encoding enzymes that metabolise ethanol. However, these studies were not so conclusive in identifying the genes that influenced the choice to drink ethanol or why a proportion of the population become addicted. Most importantly, these studies also found that over 98% of the 1292 SNPs associated with AUD (p<1 × 10-6) were found outside of coding regions and within the poorly understood non-coding genome. Many years of study have shown that functional components of the non-coding genome include enigmatic enhancer elements whose biological role is to modulate levels of gene expression in specific cells, in specific amounts and in response to the correct stimuli. The current short review introduces the functional components of the non-coding genome, such as promoters and enhancers, and critically assesses the latest methods of identifying and characterising their context dependant roles in AUD and mental health disorders. We then go on to examine what is known about the roles of enhancers, such as the GAL5.1 enhancer, in alcohol intake and explore how enhancers are affected by polymorphic variation and epigenetic markers such as DNA-methylation and may influence susceptibility to AUD. The review finishes by discussing the future of AUD genetics and what technologies will need to be brought to bear to understand how genetic and environmentally induced changes in enhancer structure may contribute to the need to drink alcohol to excess.© 2022 The Authors."
"35711915","DNA Methylation Analysis of Turner Syndrome BAV.","Front Genet","Turner Syndrome (TS) is a rare cytogenetic disorder caused by the complete loss or structural variation of the second sex chromosome. The most common cause of early mortality in TS results from a high incidence of left-sided congenital heart defects, including bicuspid aortic valve (BAV), which occurs in about 30% of individuals with TS. BAV is also the most common congenital heart defect in the general population with a prevalence of 0.5-2%, with males being three-times more likely to have a BAV than females. TS is associated with genome-wide hypomethylation when compared to karyotypically normal males and females. Alterations in DNA methylation in primary aortic tissue are associated with BAV in euploid individuals. Here we show significant differences in DNA methylation patterns associated with BAV in TS found in peripheral blood by comparing TS BAV (n= 12), TS TAV (n= 13), and non-syndromic BAV (n= 6). When comparing TS with BAV to TS with no heart defects we identified a differentially methylated region encompassing the BAV-associated geneMYRF, and enrichment for binding sites of two known transcription factor contributors to BAV. When comparing TS with BAV to euploid women with BAV, we found significant overlapping enrichment for ChIP-seq transcription factor targets including genes in theNOTCH1pathway, known for involvement in the etiology of non-syndromic BAV, and other genes that are essential regulators of heart valve development. Overall, these findings suggest that altered DNA methylation affecting key aortic valve development genes contributes to the greatly increased risk for BAV in TS.Copyright © 2022 Gutierrez, Davis, Nevonen, Ward, Carbone and Maslen."
"35711756","Changes in Higher-Order Chromosomal Structure of <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> Under Simulated Microgravity.","Front Microbiol","Our previous work have shown that certain subpopulations ofKlebsiella pneumoniaeexhibit significant phenotypic changes under simulated microgravity (SMG), including enhanced biofilm formation and cellulose synthesis, which may be evoked by changes in gene expression patterns. It is well known that prokaryotic cells genomic DNA can be hierarchically organized into different higher-order three-dimensional structures, which can highly influence gene expression. It is remain elusive whether phenotypic changes induced by SMG in the subpopulations ofK. pneumoniaeare driven by genome higher-order structural changes. Here, we investigated the above-mentioned issue using the wild-type (WT)K. pneumoniae(WT was used as a control strain and continuously cultivated for 2 weeks under standard culture conditions of normal gravity) and two previous identified subpopulations (M1 and M2) obtained after 2 weeks of continuous incubation in a SMG device. By the combination of genome-wide chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C), RNA-seq and whole-genome methylation (WGS) analyses, we found that the along with the global chromosome interactions change, the compacting extent of M1, M2 subpopulations were much looser under SMG and even with an increase in active, open chromosome regions. In addition, transcriptome data showed that most differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were upregulated, whereas a few DEGs were downregulated in M1 and M2. The functions of both types DEGs were mainly associated with membrane fractions. Additionally, WGS analysis revealed that methylation levels were lower in M1 and M2. Using combined analysis of multi-omics data, we discovered that most upregulated DEGs were significantly enriched in the boundary regions of the variable chromosomal interaction domains (CIDs), in which genes regulating biofilm formation were mainly located. These results suggest thatK. pneumoniaemay regulate gene expression patterns through DNA methylation and changes in genome structure, thus resulting in new phenotypes in response to altered gravity.Copyright © 2022 Wang, Shen, Yin, Huang, Ye, Li, Shi, Bai, Guo, Jin, Lin, Zhang, Jiang, Wang, Han and Zhao."

In the present study, we define the genetic association with kidney function in 1.5 million individuals and identify 878 (126 new) loci. We map the genotype effect on the methylome in 443 kidneys, transcriptome in 686 samples and single-cell open chromatin in 57,229 kidney cells. Heritability analysis reveals that methylation variation explains a larger fraction of heritability than gene expression. We present a multi-stage prioritization strategy and prioritize target genes for 87% of kidney function loci. We highlight key roles of proximal tubules and metabolism in kidney function regulation. Furthermore, the causal role of SLC47A1 in kidney disease is defined in mice with genetic loss of Slc47a1 and in human individuals carrying loss-of-function variants.

In this study, we performed imputation-based and conventional methylome-wide association analyses for breast cancer (BrCa) and prostate cancer (PrCa). The imputation-based approach identified DNA methylation at cytosine-phosphate-guanine sites (CpGs) associated with BrCa and PrCa risk utilising genome-wide association summary statistics (NBrCa = 228,951, NPrCa = 140,254) and prebuilt methylation prediction models, while the conventional approach identified CpG associations utilising TCGA and GEO experimental methylation data (NBrCa = 621, NPrCa = 241). Enrichment analysis of the association results implicated 77 and 81 genetically influenced CpGs for BrCa and PrCa, respectively. Furthermore, analysis of differential gene expression around these CpGs suggests a genome-epigenome-transcriptome mechanistic relationship. Conditional analyses identified multiple independent secondary SNP associations (Pcond < 0.05) around 28 BrCa and 22 PrCa CpGs. Cross-cancer analysis identified eight common CpGs, including a strong therapeutic target in SREBF1 (17p11.2)-a key player in lipid metabolism.

The objective of this study was to identify additional lupus-associated DNA methylation changes and determine the genetic contribution to epigenetic changes characteristic of lupus.Genome-wide DNA methylation was assessed in naïve CD4+T cells from 74 patients with lupus and 74 age-matched, sex-matched and race-matched healthy controls. We applied a trend deviation analysis approach, comparing methylation data in our cohort with over 16 500 samples. Methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTL) analysis was performed by integrating methylation profiles with genome-wide genotyping data.In addition to the previously reported epigenetic signature in interferon-regulated genes, we observed hypomethylation in the promoter region of the miR-17-92 cluster in patients with lupus. Members of this microRNA cluster play an important role in regulating T cell proliferation and differentiation. Expression of two microRNAs in this cluster, miR-19b1 and miR-18a, showed a significant positive correlation with lupus disease activity. Among miR-18a target genes,TNFAIP3, which encodes a negative regulator of nuclear factor kappa B, was downregulated in lupus CD4+T cells. MeQTL identified in lupus patients showed overlap with genetic risk loci for lupus, includingCFBandIRF7. The lupus risk allele inIRF7(rs1131665) was associated with significantIRF7hypomethylation. However, <1% of differentially methylated CpG sites in patients with lupus were associated with an meQTL, suggesting minimal genetic contribution to lupus-associated epigenotypes.The lupus defining epigenetic signature, characterised by robust hypomethylation of interferon-regulated genes, does not appear to be determined by genetic factors. Hypomethylation of the miR-17-92 cluster that plays an important role in T cell activation is a novel epigenetic locus for lupus.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022. No commercial re-use.

Despite its importance, how the esophageal stratified squamous epithelium executes its self-renewal and maintenance remains elusive. In this study, using 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) label-chase in rats in vivo and rat esophageal organoids in vitro together with genome-wide DNA methylation and single-cell RNA sequencing, we identified a slow-cycling/quiescent stem cell population that contained high levels of hemidesmosomes (HDs) and low levels of Wnt signaling localized spatially and randomly at the basal layer of the esophageal epithelium. Pseudotime cell trajectory analysis indicated that tissue cells originated from quiescent basal stem cells in the basal layer. Perturbations of HD component expression and/or Wnt signaling reduced the stem cell population in the basal layer of esophageal keratinocyte organoids, resulting in alterations in the organoid formation rate, size, morphogenesis, and proliferation-differentiation homeostasis. Furthermore, not only high levels of HDs and low levels of Wnt signaling but also an interplay between HD and Wnt signaling defined the stem cells of the basal layer. Hence, HDs and Wnt signaling are critical determinants for defining the stem cells of the basal layer required for tissue homeostasis in mammalian esophagi.© The Author(s) 2022.

In this study, we used DNA methylation derived telomere length (DNAmTL) as a novel approach to investigate the role of alcohol use on the aging process. DNAmTL was estimated by 140 cytosine phosphate guanines (CpG) sites in 372 individuals with alcohol use disorder (AUD) and 243 healthy controls (HC) and assessed using various endophenotypes and clinical biomarkers. Validation in an independent sample of DNAmTL on alcohol consumption was performed (N = 4219). Exploratory genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on DNAmTL were also performed to identify genetic variants contributing to DNAmTL shortening. Top GWAS findings were analyzed using in-silico expression quantitative trait loci analyses and related to structural MRI hippocampus volumes of individuals with AUD. DNAmTL was 0.11-kilobases shorter per year in AUD compared to HC after adjustment for age, sex, race, and blood cell composition (p = 4.0 × 10-12). This association was partially attenuated but remained significant after additionally adjusting for BMI, and smoking status (0.06 kilobases shorter per year, p = 0.002). DNAmTL shortening was strongly associated with chronic heavy alcohol use (ps < 0.001), elevated gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (ps < 0.004). Comparison of DNAmTL with PCR-based methods of assessing TL revealed positive correlations (R = 0.3, p = 2.2 × 10-5), highlighting the accuracy of DNAmTL as a biomarker. The GWAS meta-analysis identified a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs4374022 and 18 imputed ones in Thymocyte Expressed, Positive Selection Associated 1(TESPA1), at the genome-wide level (p = 3.75 × 10-8). The allele C of rs4374022 was associated with DNAmTL shortening, lower hippocampus volume (p < 0.01), and decreased mRNA expression in hippocampus tissue (p = 0.04). Our study demonstrates DNAmTL-related aging acceleration in AUD and suggests a functional role for TESPA1 in regulating DNAmTL length, possibly via the immune system with subsequent biological effects on brain regions negatively affected by alcohol and implicated in aging.© 2022.

We conducted a genome-wide methylation screen to identify novel methylation markers that distinguish EAC and high grade dysplasia (HGD) from normal squamous epithelium (SQ) or non-dysplastic BE (NDBE).DNA methylation profiling of samples from SQ, NDBE, HGD and EAC was performed using HM450 methylation arrays (Illumina) and reduced-representation bisulfite-sequencing. Ultra-sensitive methylation-specific droplet digital PCR and NGS-based bisulfite-sequencing assays were developed to detect the methylation level of candidate CpGs in independent esophageal biopsy and endoscopic brushing samples.Five candidate methylation markers were significantly hypermethylated in HGD/EAC samples compared to SQ or NDBE (P < 0.01) in both esophageal biopsy and endoscopic brushing samples. In an independent set of brushing samples used to construct biomarker panels, a 4-marker panel (Model 1) demonstrated sensitivity of 85.0% and 90.8% for HGD and EACs respectively, with 84.2% and 97.9% specificity for NDBE and SQ respectively. In a validation set of brushing samples, the panel achieved sensitivity of 80% and 82.5% for HGD and EAC respectively, at specificity of 67.6% and 96.3% for NDBE and SQ samples.A novel DNA methylation marker panel differentiates HGD/EAC from SQ/NDBE.

However, the functional importance of the m6A methylation machinery in ferroptosis regulation in hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (HPSCC) remains unclear.We herein performed bioinformatic analysis, cell biological analyses, transcriptome-wide m6A sequencing (m6A-seq, MeRIP-seq), RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (RIP-seq), followed by m6A dot blot, MeRIP-qPCR, RIP-qPCR, and dual-luciferase reporter assays.The results revealed that ALKBH5-mediated m6A demethylation led to the posttranscriptional inhibition of NFE2L2/NRF2, which is crucial for the regulation of antioxidant molecules in cells, at two m6A residues in the 3'-UTR. Knocking down ALKBH5 subsequently increased the expression of NFE2L2/NRF2 and increased the resistance of HPSCC cells to ferroptosis. In addition, m6A-mediated NFE2L2/NRF2 stabilization was dependent on the m6A reader IGF2BP2. We suggest that ALKBH5 dysregulates NFE2L2/NRF2 expression in HPSCC through an m6A-IGF2BP2-dependent mechanism.Together, these results have revealed an association between the ALKBH5-NFE2L2/NRF2 axis and ferroptosis, providing insight into the functional importance of reversible mRNA m6A methylation and its modulators in HPSCC.© 2022 The Authors.

"35666835","Exercise-induced histone H3 trimethylation at lysine 27 facilitates the adaptation of skeletal muscle to exercise in mice.","J Physiol","Histone H3 trimethylation at lysine 27 (H3K27me3) is known to act as a transcriptionally repressive histone modification via heterochromatin formation. In skeletal muscle, it was also reported that H3K27me3 was enriched at the sites transcriptionally activated by exercise, although the role of H3K27me3 in adaptation to exercise is unknown. In this study, using mouse tibialis anterior muscle, we initially determined the genome-wide enrichment of RNA polymerase II and histone H3 trimethylation at lysine 4 (H3K4me3) and H3K27me3 using chromatin immunoprecipitation, followed by sequencing analysis. The loci that were transcriptionally upregulated by a single bout of running exercise were marked by both H3K27me3 and H3K4me3, which were also correlated with the distribution of RNA polymerase II. The genes that were not responsive to exercise exhibited high H3K4me3 occupancy, similar to the upregulated genes but with less H3K27me3. Next, we tested the effects of GSK343, a specific inhibitor of enhancer of zeste homologue 2 (EZH2). Unexpectedly, GSK343 administration enhanced the H3K27me3 occupancy at the target loci, leading to the upregulation of gene responses to acute exercise. Administration of GSK343 also facilitated the phenotypic transformation of type IIb to type IIa fibres and the upregulation of AMPK phosphorylation and levels of heat shock protein 70, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α and muscle RING finger 1. Furthermore, in contrast to the accelerated adaptation to exercise by GSK343, administration of the EZH1/2 dual inhibitor valemetostat prevented the changes in the aforementioned parameters after exercise training. These results indicate that exercise-induced H3K27me3 plays a key role in inducing exercise-related effects in the skeletal muscle. KEY POINTS: Exercise mediates histone H3 trimethylation at lysine 27 (H3K27me3) at transcriptionally upregulated loci in skeletal muscle, but the role of H3K27me3 in the adaptation of skeletal muscle to exercise training is unclear. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing analysis demonstrated that H3K27me3, in addition to H3K4me3 modifications, is the hallmark of sites showing higher responses to acute exercise. GSK343, a selective inhibitor of the enhancer of zeste homologue 2 (EZH2), enhanced the gene responses to a single bout of exercise and accelerated the adaptive changes during exercise training in association with myonuclear H3K27me3 accumulation. Administration of valemetostat, an EZH1/2 dual inhibitor, repressed myonuclear H3K27me3 accumulation during training and caused a failure of adaptive changes. Exercise-induced H3K27me3 might play a key role in inducing exercise-related effects in skeletal muscle.© 2022 The Authors. The Journal of Physiology © 2022 The Physiological Society."

This review focuses on our current understanding of genomic disorders that arise from large structural chromosome rearrangements in patients with NDDs, as well as difficulties in overlap of clinical presentation and molecular diagnosis. We discuss the implications of epigenetics, specifically DNA methylation (DNAm), in NDDs and genomic disorders, and consider the implications and clinical impact of copy number and genomic DNAm testing in patients with suspected genetic NDDs. We summarize evidence of global methylation episignatures in CNV-associated disorders that can be used in the diagnostic pathway and may provide insights into the molecular pathogenesis of genomic disorders. Finally, we discuss the potential for combining CNV and DNAm assessment into a single diagnostic assay."
"35859152","Polycomb-lamina antagonism partitions heterochromatin at the nuclear periphery.","Nat Commun","The genome can be divided into two spatially segregated compartments, A and B, which partition active and inactive chromatin states. While constitutive heterochromatin is predominantly located within the B compartment near the nuclear lamina, facultative heterochromatin marked by H3K27me3 spans both compartments. How epigenetic modifications, compartmentalization, and lamina association collectively maintain heterochromatin architecture remains unclear. Here we develop Lamina-Inducible Methylation and Hi-C (LIMe-Hi-C) to jointly measure chromosome conformation, DNA methylation, and lamina positioning. Through LIMe-Hi-C, we identify topologically distinct sub-compartments with high levels of H3K27me3 and differing degrees of lamina association. Inhibition of Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) reveals that H3K27me3 is essential for sub-compartment segregation. Unexpectedly, PRC2 inhibition promotes lamina association and constitutive heterochromatin spreading into H3K27me3-marked B sub-compartment regions. Consistent with this repositioning, genes originally marked with H3K27me3 in the B compartment, but not the A compartment, remain largely repressed, suggesting that constitutive heterochromatin spreading can compensate for H3K27me3 loss at a transcriptional level. These findings demonstrate that Polycomb sub-compartments and their antagonism with lamina association are fundamental features of genome structure. More broadly, by jointly measuring nuclear position and Hi-C contacts, our study demonstrates how compartmentalization and lamina association represent distinct but interdependent modes of heterochromatin regulation.© 2022.

We compared epigenetic changes of differentially methylated regions (DMR) of genes in colon tissues of 225 colon cancer cases (154 non-obese and 71 obese) and 15 healthy non-obese controls by accessing The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data. We applied machine-learning-based analytics including generalized regression (GR) as a confirmatory validation model to identify the factors that could contribute to DMRs impacting colon cancer to enhance prediction accuracy. We found that age was a significant predictor in obese cancer patients, both alone (p= 0.003) and interacting with hypomethylated DMRs ofZBTB46, a tumor suppressor gene (p= 0.008). DMRs of three additional genes:HIST1H3I(p= 0.001), an oncogene with a hypomethylated DMR in the promoter region;SRGAP2C(p= 0.006), a tumor suppressor gene with a hypermethylated DMR in the promoter region; andNFATC4(p= 0.006), an adipocyte differentiating oncogene with a hypermethylated DMR in an intron region, are also significant predictors of cancer in obese patients, independent of age. The genes affected by these DMR could be potential novel biomarkers of colon cancer in obese patients for cancer prevention and progression."
"35668933","The Prospective Application of Melatonin in Treating Epigenetic Dysfunctional Diseases.","Front Pharmacol","In the past, different human disorders were described by scientists from the perspective of either environmental factors or just by genetically related mechanisms. The rise in epigenetic studies and its modifications, i.e., heritable alterations in gene expression without changes in DNA sequences, have now been confirmed in diseases. Modifications namely, DNA methylation, posttranslational histone modifications, and non-coding RNAs have led to a better understanding of the coaction between epigenetic alterations and human pathologies. Melatonin is a widely-produced indoleamine regulator molecule that influences numerous biological functions within many cell types. Concerning its broad spectrum of actions, melatonin should be investigated much more for its contribution to the upstream and downstream mechanistic regulation of epigenetic modifications in diseases. It is, therefore, necessary to fill the existing gaps concerning corresponding processes associated with melatonin with the physiological abnormalities brought by epigenetic modifications. This review outlines the findings on melatonin's action on epigenetic regulation in human diseases including neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular diseases. It summarizes the ability of melatonin to act on molecules such as proteins and RNAs which affect the development and progression of diseases.Copyright © 2022 Monayo and Liu."
"35860466","Further Introduction of DNA Methylation (DNAm) Arrays in Regular Diagnostics.","Front Genet","Methylation tests have been used for decades in regular DNA diagnostics focusing primarily on Imprinting disorders or specific loci annotated to specific disease associated gene promotors. With the introduction of DNA methylation (DNAm) arrays such as the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 Beadchip array or the Illumina Infinium Methylation EPIC Beadchip array (850 k), it has become feasible to study the epigenome in a timely and cost-effective way. This has led to new insights regarding the complexity of well-studied imprinting disorders such as the Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome, but it has also led to the introduction of tests such as EpiSign, implemented as a diagnostic test in which a single array experiment can be compared to databases with known episignatures of multiple genetic disorders, especially neurodevelopmental disorders. The successful use of such DNAm tests is rapidly expanding. More and more disorders are found to be associated with discrete episignatures which enables fast and definite diagnoses, as we have shown. The first examples of environmentally induced clinical disorders characterized by discrete aberrant DNAm are discussed underlining the broad application of DNAm testing in regular diagnostics. Here we discuss exemplary findings in our laboratory covering this broad range of applications and we discuss further use of DNAm tests in the near future.Copyright © 2022 Mannens, Lombardi, Alders, Henneman and Bliek."
"35631142","Postnatal Choline Supplementation Rescues Deficits in Synaptic Plasticity Following Prenatal Ethanol Exposure.","Nutrients","Prenatal ethanol exposure (PNEE) is a leading cause of neurodevelopmental impairments, yet treatments for individuals with PNEE are limited. Importantly, postnatal supplementation with the essential nutrient choline can attenuate some adverse effects of PNEE on cognitive development; however, the mechanisms of action for choline supplementation remain unclear. This study used an animal model to determine if choline supplementation could restore hippocampal synaptic plasticity that is normally impaired by prenatal alcohol. Throughout gestation, pregnant Sprague Dawley rats were fed an ethanol liquid diet (35.5% ethanol-derived calories). Offspring were injected with choline chloride (100 mg/kg/day) from postnatal days (PD) 10-30, and then used for in vitro electrophysiology experiments as juveniles (PD 31-35). High-frequency conditioning stimuli were used to induce long-term potentiation (LTP) in the medial perforant path input to the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. PNEE altered synaptic transmission in female offspring by increasing excitability, an effect that was mitigated with choline supplementation. In contrast, PNEE juvenile males had decreased LTP compared to controls, and this was rescued by choline supplementation. These data demonstrate sex-specific changes in plasticity following PNEE, and provide evidence that choline-related improvements in cognitive functioning may be due to its positive impact on hippocampal synaptic physiology."
"35625888","Effect of Prenatal Opioid Exposure on the Human Placental Methylome.","Biomedicines","Prenatal exposure to addictive drugs can lead to placental epigenetic modifications, but a methylome-wide evaluation of placental DNA methylation changes after prenatal opioid exposure has not yet been performed. Placental tissue samples were collected at delivery from 19 opioid-exposed and 20 unexposed control full-term pregnancies. Placental DNA methylomes were profiled using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylationEPIC BeadChip. Differentially methylated CpG sites associated with opioid exposure were identified with a linear model using the 'limma' R package. To identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) spanning multiple CpG sites, the 'DMRcate' R package was used. The functions of genes mapped by differentially methylated CpG sites and DMRs were further annotated using Enrichr. Differentially methylated CpGs (n= 684, unadjustedp&lt; 0.005 and |∆β| ≥ 0.05) were mapped to 258 genes (includingPLD1,MGAM, andALCS2). Differentially methylated regions (n= 199) were located in 174 genes (includingKCNMA1). Enrichment analysis of the top differentially methylated CpG sites and regions indicated disrupted epigenetic regulation of genes involved in synaptic structure, chemical synaptic transmission, and nervous system development. Our findings imply that placental epigenetic changes due to prenatal opioid exposure could result in placental dysfunction, leading to abnormal fetal brain development and the symptoms of opioid withdrawal in neonates."

Related studies on the effect of advanced age on birth defects were classified as chromosomal abnormalities, neurological and psychiatric disorders, and other systemic diseases. The effect of assisted reproduction technology (ART) on fertility in advanced age was also discussed.Differences in the definition of the range of advanced age and other confounding factors among studies were excluded, most studies believed that advanced parental age would affect pregnancy outcomes and birth defects in offspring.To some extent, advanced parental age caused adverse pregnancy outcomes and birth defects. The occurrence of these results was related to the molecular genetic changes caused by aging, such as gene mutations, epigenetic variations, etc. Any etiology of adverse pregnancy outcomes and birth defects related to aging might be more than one.

"35629277","Epigenetic Effect of Maternal Methyl-Group Donor Intake on Offspring's Health and Disease.","Life (Basel)","Maternal exposure to some dietary and environmental factors during embryonic development can affect offspring's phenotype and, furthermore, the risk of developing diseases later in life. One potential mechanism responsible for this early programming may be the modification of the epigenome, such as DNA methylation. Methyl-group donors are essential for DNA methylation and are shown to have an important role in fetal development and later health. The main goal of the present review is to summarize the available literature data on the epigenetic effect (DNA methylation) of maternal methyl-group donor availability on reproductivity, perinatal outcome, and later health of the offspring. In our literature search, we found evidence for the association between alterations in DNA methylation patterns caused by different maternal methyl-group donor (folate, choline, methionine, betaine) intake and reproductivity, birth weight, neural tube defect, congenital heart defect, cleft lip and palate, brain development, and the development of obesity and associated non-communicable diseases in later life. We can conclude that maternal methyl-group donor availability could affect offspring's health via alterations in DNA methylation and may be a major link between early environmental exposure and the development of diseases in the offspring. However, still, further studies are necessary to confirm the associations and causal relationships."

The mechanistic Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) network orchestrates pancreatic progenitor cell growth and metabolism by nucleating two complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2.To determine the impact of mTORC1/mTORC2 inhibition on amino acid metabolism in mouse pancreatic beta cells (Beta-TC-6 cells, ATCC-CRL-11506) using high-resolution metabolomics (HRM) and live-mitochondrial functions.Pancreatic beta TC-6 cells were incubated for 24 h with either: RapaLink-1 (RL); Torin-2 (T); rapamycin (R); metformin (M); a combination of RapaLink-1 and metformin (RLM); Torin-2 and metformin (TM); compared to the control. We applied high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) LC-MS/MS untargeted metabolomics to compare the twenty natural amino acid profiles to the control. In addition, we quantified the bioenergetics dynamics and cellular metabolism by live-cell imaging and the MitoStress Test XF24 (Agilent, Seahorse). The real-time, live-cell approach simultaneously measures the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) to determine cellular respiration and metabolism. Statistical significance was assessed using ANOVA on Ranks and post-hoc Welcht-Tests.RapaLink-1, Torin-2, and rapamycin decreased L-aspartate levels compared to the control (p= 0.006). Metformin alone did not affect L-aspartate levels. However, L-asparagine levels decreased with all treatment groups compared to the control (p= 0.03). On the contrary, L-glutamate and glycine levels were reduced only by mTORC1/mTORC2 inhibitors RapaLink-1 and Torin-2, but not by rapamycin or metformin. The metabolic activity network model predicted that L-aspartate and AMP interact within the same activity network. Live-cell bioenergetics revealed that ATP production was significantly reduced in RapaLink-1 (122.23 + 33.19), Torin-2 (72.37 + 17.33) treated cells, compared to rapamycin (250.45 + 9.41) and the vehicle control (274.23 + 38.17),p&lt; 0.01. However, non-mitochondrial oxygen consumption was not statistically different between RapaLink-1 (67.17 + 3.52), Torin-2 (55.93 + 8.76), or rapamycin (80.01 + 4.36,p= 0.006).Dual mTORC1/mTORC2 inhibition by RapaLink-1 and Torin-2 differentially altered the amino acid profile and decreased mitochondrial respiration compared to rapamycin treatment which only blocks the FRB domain on mTOR. Third-generation mTOR inhibitors may alter the mitochondrial dynamics and reveal a bioenergetics profile that could be targeted to reduce mitochondrial stress."

The ability to rigorously assess and identify early-life risk factors for later health outcomes, including those with childhood onset, in large population samples is often limited due to measurement challenges such as impractical costs associated with prospective studies with a long follow-up duration, short half-lives for some environmental toxicants, and lack of biomarkers that capture inter-individual differences in biologic response to external environments.Epigenomic patterns, and DNA methylation in particular, have emerged as a potential objective biomarker to address some of these study design and exposure measurement challenges. In this article, we summarize the literature to date on epigenetic changes associated with specific prenatal and early-life exposure domains as well as exposure mixtures in human observational studies and their biomarker potential. Additionally, we highlight evidence for other types of epigenetic patterns to serve as exposure biomarkers. Evidence strongly supports epigenomic biomarkers of exposure that are detectable across the lifespan and across a range of exposure domains. Current and future areas of research in this field seek to expand these lines of evidence to other environmental exposures, to determine their specificity, and to develop predictive algorithms and methylation scores that can be used to evaluate early-life risk factors for health outcomes across the life span.© 2022.

These conditions occur in genetically predisposed individuals in response to environmental factors. Epigenetics, acting by DNA methylation, post-translational histones modifications or by non-coding RNAs, could explain how the exposome (or all environmental influences over the life course, from conception to death) could influence the gene expression to contribute to intestinal inflammation. We performed a scoping search using Medline to identify all the elements of the exposome that may play a role in intestinal inflammation through epigenetic modifications, as well as the underlying mechanisms. The environmental factors epigenetically influencing the occurrence of intestinal inflammation are the maternal lifestyle (mainly diet, the occurrence of infection during pregnancy and smoking); breastfeeding; microbiota; diet (including a low-fiber diet, high-fat diet and deficiency in micronutrients); smoking habits, vitamin D and drugs (e.g., IBD treatments, antibiotics and probiotics). Influenced by both microbiota and diet, short-chain fatty acids are gut microbiota-derived metabolites resulting from the anaerobic fermentation of non-digestible dietary fibers, playing an epigenetically mediated role in the integrity of the epithelial barrier and in the defense against invading microorganisms. Although the impact of some environmental factors has been identified, the exposome-induced epimutations in IBD remain a largely underexplored field. How these environmental exposures induce epigenetic modifications (in terms of duration, frequency and the timing at which they occur) and how other environmental factors associated with IBD modulate epigenetics deserve to be further investigated."

Consistent and supportive parenting plays a key role in life-long health, but it is not known whether positive parenting can mitigate the relationship between neighborhood adversity and poor health. This study examines parenting as a moderator of the links between childhood neighborhood characteristics and adult health indicators.A sample of 305 individuals (61% female; 82% African American, 18% Caucasian) were assessed in childhood (T1; age 11 years; 2003‒2004) and adulthood (T2; age 27 years; 2018‒2021). At T1, neighborhood poverty was derived from census data; neighborhood disorder was reported by parents. Children reported on parental harsh discipline, inconsistent discipline, and parental nurturance. At T2, health outcomes included BMI, serum cortisol and C-reactive protein (CRP), and salivary DNA methylation index related to CRP. Regression models predicted T2 health outcomes from T1 neighborhood and parenting variables and their interactions, adjusting for clustering and confounders. Data were analyzed in 2021.Neighborhood poverty was associated with lower cortisol, whereas neighborhood disorder was linked with CRP‒related DNA methylation. Multiple interactions between neighborhood and parenting variables emerged, indicating that adverse neighborhood conditions were only related to poor adult health when combined with inconsistent discipline and low parental nurturance. By contrast, warm and supportive parenting, consistent discipline, and to a lesser extent harsh discipline buffered children from poor health outcomes associated with neighborhood disadvantage.Interventions enhancing consistent and nurturing parenting may help to reduce the long-term associations of neighborhood disadvantage with poor health.Copyright © 2022 American Journal of Preventive Medicine.

"35836579","Prenatal Exposure to Ambient Air Pollution and Epigenetic Aging at Birth in Newborns.","Front Genet","In uteroair pollution exposure has been associated with adverse birth outcomes, yet effects of air pollutants on regulatory mechanisms in fetal growth and critical windows of vulnerability during pregnancy are not well understood. There is evidence that epigenetic alterations may contribute to these effects. DNA methylation (DNAm) based age estimators have been developed and studied extensively with health outcomes in recent years. Growing literature suggests environmental factors, such as air pollution and smoking, can influence epigenetic aging. However, little is known about the effect of prenatal air pollution exposure on epigenetic aging. In this study, we leveraged existing data on prenatal air pollution exposure and cord blood DNAm from 332 mother-child pairs in the Early Autism Risk Longitudinal Investigation (EARLI) and Markers of Autism Risk in Babies-Learning Early Signs (MARBLES), two pregnancy cohorts enrolling women who had a previous child diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, to assess the relationship of prenatal exposure to air pollution and epigenetic aging at birth. DNAm age was computed using existing epigenetic clock algorithms for cord blood tissue-Knight and Bohlin. Epigenetic age acceleration was defined as the residual of regressing chronological gestational age on DNAm age, accounting for cell type proportions. Multivariable linear regression models and distributed lag models (DLMs), adjusting for child sex, maternal race/ethnicity, study sites, year of birth, maternal education, were completed. In the single-pollutant analysis, we observed exposure to PM2.5,PM10,and O3during preconception period and pregnancy period were associated with decelerated epigenetic aging at birth. For example, pregnancy average PM10exposure (per 10 unit increase) was associated with epigenetic age deceleration at birth (weeks) for both Knight and Bohlin clocks (β= -0.62, 95% CI: -1.17, -0.06;β= -0.32, 95% CI: -0.63, -0.01, respectively). Weekly DLMs revealed that increasing PM2.5during the first trimester and second trimester were associated with decelerated epigenetic aging and that increasing PM10during the preconception period was associated with decelerated epigenetic aging, using the Bohlin clock estimate. Prenatal ambient air pollution exposure, particularly in early and mid-pregnancy, was associated with decelerated epigenetic aging at birth.Copyright © 2022 Song, Feinberg, Bakulski, Croen, Fallin, Newschaffer, Hertz-Picciotto, Schmidt, Ladd-Acosta and Volk."

This paper addresses the impacts of key historical and current Canadian federal policies in relation to the health and well-being of Indigenous Peoples. Far from constituting a mere lesson in history, the connections between colonialist policies and actions on present-day outcomes are evaluated in terms of transgenerational and intergenerational transmission processes, including psychosocial, developmental, environmental, and neurobiological mechanisms and trauma responses. In addition, while colonialist policies have created adverse living conditions for Indigenous Peoples, resilience and the perseverance of many aspects of culture may be maintained through intergenerational processes."
"35773726","DNA methylation: a potential mediator between air pollution and metabolic syndrome.","Clin Epigenetics","Given the global increase in air pollution and its crucial role in human health, as well as the steep rise in prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS), a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms by which environmental pollution may influence MetS is imperative. Exposure to air pollution is known to impact DNA methylation, which in turn may affect human health. This paper comprehensively reviews the evidence for the hypothesis that the effect of air pollution on the MetS is mediated by DNA methylation in blood. First, we present a summary of the impact of air pollution on metabolic dysregulation, including the components of MetS, i.e., disorders in blood glucose, lipid profile, blood pressure, and obesity. Then, we provide evidence on the relation between air pollution and endothelial dysfunction as one possible mechanism underlying the relation between air pollution and MetS. Subsequently, we review the evidence that air pollution (PM, ozone, NO2and PAHs) influences DNA methylation. Finally, we summarize association studies between DNA methylation and MetS. Integration of current evidence supports our hypothesis that methylation may partly mediate the effect of air pollution on MetS.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35815019","Effects of Persistent Binge Drinking on Brain Structure in Emerging Adults: A Longitudinal Study.","Front Psychiatry","Previous cross-sectional research has largely associated binge drinking (BD) with changes in volume and thickness during adolescence and early adulthood. Nevertheless, the long-term alcohol-related effects on gray matter features in youths who had maintained a BD pattern over time have not yet been sufficiently explored. The present study aimed to assess group differences both cross-sectionally and longitudinally [using symmetric percent change (SPC)] on several structural measures (i.e., thickness, surface area, volume). For this purpose, magnetic resonance imaging was recorded twice within a 2-year interval; at baseline (18-19 years) and a follow-up (20-21 years). The sample included 44 university students who were classified as 16 stable binge drinkers (8 females) and 28 stable controls (13 females). Whole-brain analysis showed larger insular surface area in binge drinkers relative to controls at follow-up (cluster-wisep= 0.045). On the other hand, region of interest (ROI) analyses on thickness also revealed a group by sex interaction at follow-up (p= 0.005), indicating that BD males had smaller right rostral middle frontal gyrus thickness than both control males (p= 0.011) and BD females (p= 0.029). Similarly, ROI-based analysis on longitudinal data showed a group by sex interaction in the right nucleus accumbens (p= 0.009) which revealed a decreased volume across time in BD males than in control males (p= 0.007). Overall, continued BD pattern during emerging adulthood appears to lead to gray matter abnormalities in regions intimately involved in reward processing, emotional regulation and executive functions. Notably, some anomalies varied significantly depending on sex, suggesting a sex-specific impact of BD on typical neurodevelopment processes.Copyright © 2022 Pérez-García, Cadaveira, Canales-Rodríguez, Suárez-Suárez, Rodríguez Holguín, Corral, Blanco-Ramos and Doallo."

"35764820","Epigenetic mechanisms regulate sex-specific bias in disease manifestations.","J Mol Med (Berl)","Sex presents a vital determinant of a person's physiology, anatomy, and development. Recent clinical studies indicate that sex is also involved in the differential manifestation of various diseases, affecting both clinical outcome as well as response to therapy. Genetic and epigenetic changes are implicated in sex bias and regulate disease onset, including the inactivation of the X chromosome as well as sex chromosome aneuploidy. The differential expression of X-linked genes, along with the presence of sex-specific hormones, exhibits a significant impact on immune system function. Several studies have revealed differences between the two sexes in response to infections, including respiratory diseases and COVID-19 infection, autoimmune disorders, liver fibrosis, neuropsychiatric diseases, and cancer susceptibility, which can be explained by sex-biased immune responses. In the present review, we explore the input of genetic and epigenetic interplay in the sex bias underlying disease manifestation and discuss their effects along with sex hormones on disease development and progression, aiming to reveal potential new therapeutic targets. KEY MESSAGES: Sex is involved in the differential manifestation of various diseases. Epigenetic modifications influence X-linked gene expression, affecting immune response to infections, including COVID-19. Epigenetic mechanisms are responsible for the sex bias observed in several respiratory and autoimmune disorders, liver fibrosis, neuropsychiatric diseases, and cancer.© 2022.

Recent findings showed that DNA methylation (DNAm) variation is likely to be a consequence of changes in BMI. However, whether DNAm mediates the association of BMI with lung function is unknown. We examined the mediating role of DNAm on the association of pre-adolescent BMI trajectories with post-adolescent and adulthood lung function (forced expiratory volume (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), and FEV1/FVC).Analyses were undertaken in the Isle of Wight birth cohort (IOWBC). Group-based trajectory modelling was applied to infer latent BMI trajectories from age 1 to 10 years. An R package, ttscreening, was applied to identify CpGs at 10 years potentially associated with BMI trajectories for each sex. Linear regressions were implemented to further screen CpGs for their association with lung function at 18 years. Path analysis, stratified by sex, was applied to each screened CpG to assess its role of mediation. Internal validation was applied to further examine the mediation consistency of the detected CpGs based on lung function at 26 years. Mendelian randomization (MR-base) was used to test possible causal effects of the identified CpGs.Two BMI trajectories (high vs. low) were identified. Of the 442,475 CpG sites, 18 CpGs in males and 33 in females passed screening. Eight CpGs in males and 16 CpGs in females (none overlapping) were identified as mediators. For subjects with high BMI trajectory, high DNAm at all CpGs in males were associated with decreased lung function, while 8 CpGs in females were associated with increased lung function at 18 years. At 26 years, 6 CpGs in males and 14 CpGs in females showed the same direction of indirect effects as those at 18 years. DNAm at CpGs cg19088553 (GRIK2) and cg00612625 (HPSE2) showed a potential causal effect on FEV1.The effects of BMI trajectory in early childhood on post-adolescence lung function were likely to be mediated by pre-adolescence DNAm in both males and females, but such mediation effects were likely to diminish over time.© 2022.

"35912103","Folate Carrier Deficiency Drives Differential Methylation and Enhanced Cellular Potency in the Neural Plate Border.","Front Cell Dev Biol","The neural plate border (NPB) of vertebrate embryos segregates from the neural and epidermal regions, and it is comprised of an intermingled group of multipotent progenitor cells. Folate is the precursor of S-adenosylmethionine, the main methyl donor for DNA methylation, and it is critical for embryonic development, including the specification of progenitors which reside in the NPB. Despite the fact that several intersecting signals involved in the specification and territorial restriction of NPB cells are known, the role of epigenetics, particularly DNA methylation, has been a matter of debate. Here, we examined the temporal and spatial distribution of the methyl source and analyzed the abundance of 5mC/5 hmC and their epigenetic writers throughout the segregation of the neural and NPB territories. Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) on Reduced Folate Carrier 1 (RFC1)-deficient embryos leads to the identification of differentially methylated regions (DMRs). In the RFC1-deficient embryos, we identified several DMRs in theNotch1locus, and the spatiotemporal expression ofNotch1and its downstream target geneBmp4were expanded in the NPB. Cell fate analysis on folate deficient embryos revealed a significant increase in the number of cells coexpressing both neural (SOX2) and NPB (PAX7) markers, which may represent an enhancing effect in the cellular potential of those progenitors. Taken together, our findings propose a model where the RFC1 deficiency drives methylation changes in specific genomic regions that are correlated with a dysregulation of pathways involved in early development such as Notch1 and BMP4 signaling. These changes affect the potency of the progenitors residing in the juncture of the neural plate and NPB territories, thus driving them to a primed state.Copyright © 2022 Alata Jimenez and Strobl-Mazzulla."

Patterns of connectivity and adaptation in such species are often thought to be influenced by spatial factors, environmental heterogeneity, and oceanographic and geomorphological features. Population-level studies that analytically integrate genome-wide data with environmental information (i.e., seascape genomics) have the potential to inform the spatial distribution of adaptive diversity in wide-ranging marine species, such as many marine mammals. We assessed genotype-environment associations (GEAs) in 214 common dolphins (Delphinus delphis) along > 3000 km of the southern coast of Australia.We identified 747 candidate adaptive SNPs out of a filtered panel of 17,327 SNPs, and five putatively locally-adapted populations with high levels of standing genomic variation were disclosed along environmentally heterogeneous coasts. Current velocity, sea surface temperature, salinity, and primary productivity were the key environmental variables associated with genomic variation. These environmental variables are in turn related to three main oceanographic phenomena that are likely affecting the dispersal of common dolphins: (1) regional oceanographic circulation, (2) localised and seasonal upwellings, and (3) seasonal on-shelf circulation in protected coastal habitats. Signals of selection at exonic gene regions suggest that adaptive divergence is related to important metabolic traits.To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first seascape genomics study for common dolphins (genus Delphinus). Information from the associations between populations and their environment can assist population management in forecasting the adaptive capacity of common dolphins to climate change and other anthropogenic impacts.© 2022.

"35661546","Accelerated epigenetic aging in newborns with Down syndrome.","Aging Cell","Accelerated aging is a hallmark of Down syndrome (DS), with adults experiencing early-onset Alzheimer's disease and premature aging of the skin, hair, and immune and endocrine systems. Accelerated epigenetic aging has been found in the blood and brain tissue of adults with DS but when premature aging in DS begins remains unknown. We investigated whether accelerated aging in DS is already detectable in blood at birth. We assessed the association between age acceleration and DS using five epigenetic clocks in 346 newborns with DS and 567 newborns without DS using Illumina MethylationEPIC DNA methylation array data. We compared two epigenetic aging clocks (DNAmSkinBloodClock and pan-tissue DNAmAge) and three epigenetic gestational age clocks (Haftorn, Knight, and Bohlin) between DS and non-DS newborns using linear regression adjusting for observed age, sex, batch, deconvoluted blood cell proportions, and genetic ancestry. Targeted sequencing of GATA1 was performed in a subset of 184 newborns with DS to identify somatic mutations associated with transient abnormal myelopoiesis. DS was significantly associated with increased DNAmSkinBloodClock (effect estimate = 0.2442, p < 0.0001), with an epigenetic age acceleration of 244 days in newborns with DS after adjusting for potential confounding factors (95% confidence interval: 196-292 days). We also found evidence of epigenetic age acceleration associated with somatic GATA1 mutations among newborns with DS (p = 0.015). DS was not associated with epigenetic gestational age acceleration. We demonstrate that accelerated epigenetic aging in the blood of DS patients begins prenatally, with implications for the pathophysiology of immunosenescence and other aging-related traits in DS.© 2022 The Authors.

The correlation between fatty liver index (FLI) and genomic CpG sites was analyzed in 322 subjects. Longitudinal changes over 8 years were confirmed in 33 subjects. To identify CpG sites and genes related to FLI, we obtained enrichment terms for 6765 genes. DMRs were identified for both high (n= 128) and low (n= 194) groups on the basis of FLI 30 in 142 men and 180 women. To confirm longitudinal changes in 33 subjects, the ratio of follow-up and baseline investigation values was obtained. Correlations and group comparisons were performed for the 8 year change values.PITPNM3,RXFP3, andTHRBwere hypermethylated in the increased FLI groups, whereasSLC9A2andFOXI3were hypermethylated in the decreased FLI groups. DMRs describing NAFLD were determined, and functions related to inflammation were identified. Factors related to longitudinal changes are suggested, and blood circulation-related functions appear to be important in the management of NAFLD."

Major depressive disorder (MDD) has been hypothesized to show characteristics of accelerated biological aging. This raises the possibility that depressed individuals will show some overlap with elderly populations with respect to their immune response to infection and vaccination. Here we provide an umbrella review of this literature in the context of the SARS CoV-2 pandemic. On balance, the available data do indeed suggest that depression is a risk factor for both adverse outcomes following COVID-19 infection and for reduced COVID-19 vaccine immunogenicity. We conclude that MDD (and other major psychiatric disorders) should be recognized as vulnerable populations that receive priority for vaccination along with other at-risk groups.© 2022.

"35821819","LipidClock: A Lipid-Based Predictor of Biological Age.","Front Aging","Complexity is a fundamental feature of biological systems. Omics techniques like lipidomics can simultaneously quantify many thousands of molecules, thereby directly capturing the underlying biological complexity. However, this approach transfers the original biological complexity to the resulting datasets, posing challenges in data reduction and analysis. Aging is a prime example of a process that exhibits complex behaviour across multiple scales of biological organisation. The aging process is characterised by slow, cumulative and detrimental changes that are driven by intrinsic biological stochasticity and mediated through non-linear interactions and feedback within and between these levels of organization (ranging from metabolites, macromolecules, organelles and cells to tissue and organs). Only collectively and over long timeframes do these changes manifest as the exponential increases in morbidity and mortality that define biological aging, making aging a problem more difficult to study than the aetiologies of specific diseases. But aging's time dependence can also be exploited to extract key insights into its underlying biology. Here we explore this idea by using data on changes in lipid composition across the lifespan of an organism to construct and test a LipidClock to predict biological age in the nematodeCaenorhabdits elegans. The LipidClock consist of a feature transformationviaPrincipal Component Analysis followed by Elastic Net regression and yields and Mean Absolute Error of 1.45 days for wild type animals and 4.13 days when applied to mutant strains with lifespans that are substantially different from that of wild type. Gompertz aging rates predicted by the LipidClock can be used to simulate survival curves that are in agreement with those from lifespan experiments.Copyright © 2022 Unfried, Ng, Cazenave-Gassiot, Batchu, Kennedy, Wenk, Tolwinski and Gruber."

Since DNA methylation is modifiable by external and behavioral exposures, it is important to identify which of these exposures may have the strongest contributions to differences in GrimAA, to help guide potential intervention strategies. Here, we assessed the relative contributions of lifestyle- and health-related components, as well as their collective association, to GrimAA.We included 744 participants (391 men and 353 women) from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study with blood DNA methylation information at CARDIA Exam Year (Y) 20 (2005-2006, mean age 45.9 years). Six cumulative exposures by Y20 were included in the analysis: total packs of cigarettes, total alcohol consumption, education years, healthy diet score, sleep hours, and physical activity. We used quantile-based g-computation (QGC) and Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) methods to assess the relative contribution of each exposure to a single overall association with GrimAA. We also assessed the collective association of the six components combined with GrimAA. Smoking showed the greatest positive contribution to GrimAA, accounting for 83.5% of overall positive associations of the six exposures with GrimAA (QGC weight = 0.835). The posterior inclusion probability (PIP) of smoking also achieved the highest score of 1.0 from BKMR analysis. Healthy diet and education years showed inverse contributions to GrimAA. We observed a U-shaped pattern in the contribution of alcohol consumption to GrimAA. While smoking was the greatest contributor across sex and race subgroups, the relative contributions of other components varied by subgroups.Smoking, alcohol consumption, and education showed the highest contributions to GrimAA in our study. Higher amounts of smoking and alcohol consumption were likely to contribute to greater GrimAA, whereas achieved education was likely to contribute to lower GrimAA. Identifying pertinent lifestyle- and health-related exposures in a context of collective components can provide direction for intervention strategies and suggests which components should be the primary focus for promoting younger GrimAA.© 2022.

Depressive symptoms co-occur in individuals with CM illness at higher rates than the general population, and accelerated aging may explain this. In this secondary analysis, we examined associations between age acceleration; depressive symptoms; and CM traits (hypertension, diabetes mellitus [DM], and obesity) in a cohort of AAW.Genomic and clinical data from the InterGEN cohort (n = 227) were used. Age acceleration was based on the Horvath method of DNA methylation (DNAm) age estimation. Accordingly, DNAm age acceleration (DNAm AA) was defined as the residuals from a linear regression of DNAm age on chronological age. Spearman's correlations, linear and logistic regression examined associations between DNAm AA, depressive symptoms, and CM traits.DNAm AA did not associate with total depressive symptom scores. DNAm AA correlated with specific symptoms including self-disgust/self-hate (-0.13, 95% CI -0.26, -0.01); difficulty with making decisions (-0.15, 95% CI -0.28, -0.02); and worry over physical health (0.15, 95% CI 0.02, 0.28), but were not statistically significant after multiple comparison correction. DNAm AA associated with obesity (0.08, 95% CI 1.02, 1.16), hypertension (0.08, 95% CI 1.01, 1.17), and DM (0.20, 95% CI 1.09, 1.40), after adjustment for potential confounders.Associations between age acceleration and depressive symptoms may be highly nuanced and dependent on study design contexts. Factors other than age acceleration may explain the connection between depressive symptoms and CM traits. AAW with CM traits may be at increased risk of accelerated aging.© The Author(s) 2022."

Group-based trajectory and four-way mediation analyses were used.Overall, and mostly among female and NHW participants, greater RPD in 2010-2012 had a significant adverse total effect on epigenetic aging [2016: DNAm GrimAge, DunedinPoAm38 (MPOA), Levine (PhenoAge) and Horvath 2], with 20-50% of this effect being explained by a pure indirect effect through DEP in 2014-2016. Among females, sustained elevated DEP (2010-2016) was associated with greater LIN DNAm age (β ± SE: +1.506 ± 0.559,p= 0.009, reduced model), patterns observed for elevated DEP (high vs. low) for GrimAge and MPOA DNAm markers. Overall and in White adults, the relationship of the Levine clock with perceived discrimination in general (both EOD and RPD) was mediated through elevated DEP.Sustained elevations in DEP and RPD were associated with select biological aging measures, consistently among women and White adults, with DEP acting as mediator in several RPD-EPICLOCK associations."
"35775492","The Achilles' heel of cancer survivors: fundamentals of accelerated cellular senescence.","J Clin Invest","Recent improvements in cancer treatment have increased the lifespan of pediatric and adult cancer survivors. However, cancer treatments accelerate aging in survivors, which manifests clinically as the premature onset of chronic diseases, such as endocrinopathies, osteoporosis, cardiac dysfunction, subsequent cancers, and geriatric syndromes of frailty, among others. Therefore, cancer treatment-induced early aging accounts for significant morbidity, mortality, and health expenditures among cancer survivors. One major mechanism driving this accelerated aging is cellular senescence; cancer treatments induce cellular senescence in tumor cells and in normal, nontumor tissue, thereby helping mediate the onset of several chronic diseases. Studies on clinical monitoring and therapeutic targeting of cellular senescence have made considerable progress in recent years. Large-scale clinical trials are currently evaluating senotherapeutic drugs, which inhibit or eliminate senescent cells to ameliorate cancer treatment-related aging. In this article, we survey the recent literature on phenotypes and mechanisms of aging in cancer survivors and provide an up-to-date review of the major preclinical and translational evidence on cellular senescence as a mechanism of accelerated aging in cancer survivors, as well as insight into the potential of senotherapeutic drugs. However, only with time will the clinical effect of senotherapies on cancer survivors be visible."

Changes in the epigenome may be involved in pathways linking arsenic to health or serve as biomarkers of exposure. This study investigated associations between prenatal and early-life arsenic exposure and epigenetic age acceleration (EAA) in adults, a biomarker of morbidity and mortality. DNA methylation was measured in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and buccal cells from 40 adults (median age = 49 years) in Chile with and without high prenatal and early-life arsenic exposure. EAA was calculated using the Horvath, Hannum, PhenoAge, skin and blood, GrimAge, and DNA methylation telomere length clocks. We evaluated associations between arsenic exposure and EAA using robust linear models. Participants classified as with and without arsenic exposure had a median drinking water arsenic concentration at birth of 555 and 2 μg/l, respectively. In PBMCs, adjusting for sex and smoking, exposure was associated with a 6-year PhenoAge acceleration [B(95% CI) = 6.01 (2.60, 9.42)]. After adjusting for cell-type composition, we found positive associations with Hannum EAA [B(95% CI) = 3.11 (0.13, 6.10)], skin and blood EAA [B(95% CI) = 1.77 (0.51, 3.03)], and extrinsic EAA [B(95% CI) = 4.90 (1.22, 8.57)]. The association with PhenoAge acceleration in buccal cells was positive but not statistically significant [B(95% CI) = 4.88 (-1.60, 11.36)].

Specifically, aberrant DNA methylation changes in immune cells and alterations to epigenetic clocks in blood relate to severe COVID-19. However, a longitudinal assessment of DNA methylation states and epigenetic clocks in blood from healthy individuals prior to and following test-confirmed non-hospitalized COVID-19 has not been performed. Moreover, the impact of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines upon the host epigenome remains understudied. Here, we first examined DNA methylation states in the blood of 21 participants prior to and following test-confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis at a median time frame of 8.35 weeks; 756 CpGs were identified as differentially methylated following COVID-19 diagnosis in blood at an FDR adjustedp-value < 0.05. These CpGs were enriched in the gene body, and the northern and southern shelf regions of genes involved in metabolic pathways. Integrative analysis revealed overlap among genes identified in transcriptional SARS-CoV-2 infection datasets. Principal component-based epigenetic clock estimates of PhenoAge and GrimAge significantly increased in people over 50 following infection by an average of 2.1 and 0.84 years. In contrast, PCPhenoAge significantly decreased in people fewer than 50 following infection by an average of 2.06 years. This observed divergence in epigenetic clocks following COVID-19 was related to age and immune cell-type compositional changes in CD4+T cells, B cells, granulocytes, plasmablasts, exhausted T cells, and naïve T cells. Complementary longitudinal epigenetic clock analyses of 36 participants prior to and following Pfizer and Moderna mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccination revealed that vaccination significantly reduced principal component-based Horvath epigenetic clock estimates in people over 50 by an average of 3.91 years for those who received Moderna. This reduction in epigenetic clock estimates was significantly related to chronological age and immune cell-type compositional changes in B cells and plasmablasts pre- and post-vaccination. These findings suggest the potential utility of epigenetic clocks as a biomarker of COVID-19 vaccine responses. Future research will need to unravel the significance and durability of short-term changes in epigenetic age related to COVID-19 exposure and mRNA vaccination.Copyright © 2022 Pang, Higgins-Chen, Comite, Raica, Arboleda, Went, Mendez, Schotsaert, Dwaraka, Smith, Levine, Ndhlovu and Corley."

However, recent studies suggest that upward mobility may also have biological costs related to the stresses of crossing social boundaries. We tested associations of life-course social mobility with biological aging using data from participants in the 2016 Health and Retirement Study (HRS) Venous Blood Study who provided blood-chemistry (n = 9,255) and/or DNA methylation (DNAm) data (n = 3,976). We quantified social mobility from childhood to later-life using data on childhood family characteristics, educational attainment, and wealth accumulation. We quantified biological aging using 3 DNAm ""clocks"" and 3 blood-chemistry algorithms. We observed substantial social mobility among study participants. Those who achieved upward mobility exhibited less-advanced and slower biological aging. Associations of upward mobility with less-advanced and slower aging were consistent for blood-chemistry and DNAm measures of biological aging, and were similar for men and women and for Black and White Americans (Pearson-r effect-sizes ∼0.2 for blood-chemistry measures and the DNAm GrimAge clock and DunedinPoAm pace-of-aging measures; effect-sizes were smaller for the DNAm PhenoAge clock). Analysis restricted to educational mobility suggested differential effects by racial identity; mediating links between educational mobility and healthy aging may be disrupted by structural racism. In contrast, mobility producing accumulation of wealth appeared to benefit White and Black Americans equally, suggesting economic intervention to reduce wealth inequality may have potential to heal disparities in healthy aging.© The Author(s) 2022.

"35598567","A cautionary note on altered pace of aging in the COVID-19 era.","Forensic Sci Int Genet","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is highly age-dependent due to hi-jacking the molecular control of the immune cells by the severe acute respiratory syndrome-corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) leading to aberrant DNA methylation (DNAm) pattern of blood in comparison to normal individuals. These epigenetic modifications have been linked to perturbations to the epigenetic clock, development of long COVID-19 syndrome, and all-cause mortality risk. I reviewed the effects of COVID-19 on different molecular age markers such as the DNAm, telomere length (TL), and signal joint T-cell receptor excision circle (sjTREC). Integrating the accumulated clinical research data, COVID-19 and novel medical management may alter the pace of aging in adult individuals (<60 years). As such, COVID-19 might be a confounder in epigenetic age estimation similar to life style diversities, pathogens and pathologies which may influence the interpretation of DNAm data. Similarly, the SARS-CoV-2 affects T-lymphocyte function with possible influence on sjTREC levels. In contrast, TL measurements performed years before the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic proved that short TL predisposes to severe COVID- 19 independently from chronological age. However, the persistence of COVID-19 epigenetic scars and the durability of the immune response after vaccination and their effect on the ongoing pace of aging are still unknown. In the light of these data, the heterogeneous nature of the samples in these studies mandates a systematic evaluation of the currrent methods. SARS-CoV-2 may modify the reliability of the age estimation models in real casework because blood is the most common biological sample encountered in forensic contexts.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

"35585300","Telomere length and epigenetic clocks as markers of cellular aging: a comparative study.","Geroscience","Telomere length (TL) and DNA methylation-based epigenetic clocks are markers of biological age, but the relationship between the two is not fully understood. Here, we used multivariable regression models to evaluate the relationships between leukocyte TL (LTL; measured by qPCR [n = 635] or flow FISH [n = 144]) and five epigenetic clocks (Hannum, DNAmAge pan-tissue, PhenoAge, SkinBlood, or GrimAge clocks), or their epigenetic age acceleration measures in healthy adults (age 19-61 years). LTL showed statistically significant negative correlations with all clocks (qPCR: r =  - 0.26 to - 0.32; flow FISH: r =  - 0.34 to - 0.49; p < 0.001 for all). Yet, models adjusted for age, sex, and race revealed significant associations between three of five clocks (PhenoAge, GrimAge, and Hannum clocks) and LTL by flow FISH (p < 0.01 for all) or qPCR (p < 0.001 for all). Significant associations between age acceleration measures for the same three clocks and qPCR or flow FISH TL were also found (p < 0.01 for all). Additionally, LTL (by qPCR or flow FISH) showed significant associations with extrinsic epigenetic age acceleration (EEAA: p < 0.0001 for both), but not intrinsic epigenetic age acceleration (IEAA; p > 0.05 for both). In conclusion, the relationships between LTL and epigenetic clocks were limited to clocks reflecting phenotypic age. The observed association between LTL and EEAA reflects the ability of both measures to detect immunosenescence. The observed modest correlations between LTL and epigenetic clocks highlight a possible benefit from incorporating both measures in understanding disease etiology and prognosis.© 2022.

"35575089","Biological aging processes underlying cognitive decline and neurodegenerative disease.","J Clin Invest","Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) are among the top contributors to disability and mortality in later life. As with many chronic conditions, aging is the single most influential factor in the development of ADRD. Even among older adults who remain free of dementia throughout their lives, cognitive decline and neurodegenerative changes are appreciable with advancing age, suggesting shared pathophysiological mechanisms. In this Review, we provide an overview of changes in cognition, brain morphology, and neuropathological protein accumulation across the lifespan in humans, with complementary and mechanistic evidence from animal models. Next, we highlight selected aging processes that are differentially regulated in neurodegenerative disease, including aberrant autophagy, mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular senescence, epigenetic changes, cerebrovascular dysfunction, inflammation, and lipid dysregulation. We summarize research across clinical and translational studies to link biological aging processes to underlying ADRD pathogenesis. Targeting fundamental processes underlying biological aging may represent a yet relatively unexplored avenue to attenuate both age-related cognitive decline and ADRD. Collaboration across the fields of geroscience and neuroscience, coupled with the development of new translational animal models that more closely align with human disease processes, is necessary to advance novel therapeutic discovery in this realm."
"35570901","Accelerated Epigenetic Age Among Women with Invasive Cervical Cancer and HIV-Infection in Nigeria.","Front Public Health","Invasive cervical cancer (ICC) is a serious public health burden in Nigeria, where human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) remains highly prevalent. Previous research suggested that epigenetic age acceleration (EAA) could play a role in detection of HIV-associated ICC. However, little research has been conducted on this topic in Africa where the population is most severely affected by HIV-associated ICC. Here, we investigated the association between ICC and EAA using cervical tissues of ICC-diagnosed Nigerian women living with HIV.We included 116 cervical tissue samples from three groups of Nigerian women in this study: (1) HIV+/ICC+ (n= 39); (2) HIV+/ICC- (n= 53); and (3) HIV-/ICC + (n= 24). We utilized four DNA methylation-based EAA estimators; IEAA, EEAA, GrimAA, and PhenoAA. We compared EAA measurements across the 3 HIV/ICC groups using multiple linear regression models. We also compared EAA between 26 tumor tissues and their surrounding normal tissues using pairedt-tests. We additionally performed a receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis to illustrate the area under the curve (AUC) of EAA in ICC.We found the most striking associations between HIV/ICC status and PhenoAge acceleration (PhenoAA). Among HIV-positive women, PhenoAA was on average 13.4 years higher in women with ICC compared to cancer-free women (P= 0.005). PhenoAA was 20.7 and 7.1 years higher in tumor tissues compared to surrounding normal tissues among HIV-positive women (P= 0.009) and HIV-negative women (P= 0.284), respectively. We did not find substantial differences in PhenoAA between HIV-positive and HIV-negative women with ICC.PhenoAA is associated with ICC in HIV-infected women in our study. Our findings suggest that PhenoAA may serve as a potential biomarker for further risk stratification of HIV-associated ICC in Nigeria and similar resource-constrained settings.Copyright © 2022 Musa, Kim, Zheng, Qu, Joyce, Wang, Nannini, Gursel, Silas, Abdulkareem, Imade, Akanmu, Wei, Kocherginsky, Kim, Wehbe, Achenbach, Anorlu, Simon, Sagay, Ogunsola, Murphy and Hou."

Few studies have explored the prognosis of fetuses with congenital anomalies. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and prognosis of congenital anomalies in IVF/ICSI pregnancies, and to analyze the influencing factors contributing to poor prognosis.In this multicenter retrospective cohort study, we followed 405,473 embryo transfer cycles at 15 reproductive centers between January 2010 and December 2019 and enrolled 2,006 intrauterine pregnancies with congenital anomalies. The relatively positive prognosis group with one or more live births and neonatal survival for more than 7 days was compared with the poor prognosis group with poorer outcomes.Among the 168,270 ongoing intrauterine pregnancy cycles, the prevalence of congenital anomalies was 1.19%, wherein the malformation rates of cycles with late abortion and delivery were 2.37% (716/30,202) and 0.93% (1,290/138,068), respectively. Among all IVF/ICSI cycles with congenital anomalies, the relatively positive prognosis rate was 61.39%. Moreover, the fertilization failure rate (2 pro-nuclei rate < 25%) in the poor prognosis group was significantly higher than that in the relatively positive prognosis group (10.89% vs. 5.09%,p< 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed no significant differences in the relatively positive prognosis rate among the various IVF/ICSI protocols. The relatively positive prognosis rate of fertilization failure cycles was 0.180 times that of normal fertilization cycles.Poor fertilization rates during IVF/ICSI treatments are more likely to have poor prognosis in fetuses or neonates with congenital anomalies, and obstetric management should be strengthened in pregnant women, with which pregnant women should be recommended to strengthen obstetric management.Copyright © 2022 Bao, Chen, Hao, Wu, He, Lu, Ji, Qiao, Wang and Chi."

The environment during the preimplantation period, which only lasts a couple of days, has been implicated in adult health, extending to such early stages the concept of the developmental origin of health and disease (DOHaD).In this review, we first provide a brief history of assisted reproductive technology (ART) focusing on in vitro culture and its outcomes during subsequent development mainly in mice and humans. Further, we introduce the ""MEM mouse,"" a novel type 2 diabetes mouse model generated by in vitro culture of preimplantation embryos in alpha minimum essential medium (αMEM).The association between ART and its long-term effects has been carefully examined for its application in human infertility treatment. The ""MEM mouse"" develops steatohepatitis and kidney disease with diabetes into adulthood.The close association between the environment of preimplantation and health in postnatal life is being clarified. The approach by which severe mouse phenotypes are successfully induced by manipulating the environment of preimplantation embryos could provide new chronic disease animal models, which we call ""modified ART-DOHaD"" animal models.

This study aimed to identify susceptibility loci associated with insomnia and migraine comorbidity.We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) involving 1063 clinical outpatients at a tertiary hospital in Taiwan. Migraineurs with and without insomnia were genotyped using the Affymetrix Axiom Genome-Wide TWB 2.0. We performed association analyses for the entire cohort and stratified patients into the following subgroups: episodic migraine (EM), chronic migraine (CM), migraine with aura (MA), and migraine without aura (MoA). Potential correlations between SNPs and clinical indices in migraine patients with insomnia were examined using multivariate regression analysis.The SNP rs1178326 in the geneHDAC9was significantly associated with insomnia. In the EM, CM, MA, and MoA subgroups, we identified 30 additional susceptibility loci. Multivariate regression analysis showed that SNP rs1178326 also correlated with higher migraine frequency and the Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS) questionnaire score. Finally, two SNPs that had been previously reported in a major insomnia GWAS were also significant in our migraineurs, showing a concordant effect.In this GWAS, we identified several novel loci associated with insomnia in migraineurs in a Han Chinese population in Taiwan.

The million copies of PRE1 in the porcine genome have accumulated abundant CpG dinucleotides and unique structural variations, such as direct repeats and patterns of sequence degeneration. The aims of this study were to analyse these structural variations to trace the origin and evolutionary pattern of PRE1 and to investigate potential methylation-related functions of PRE1 based on methylation patterns of PRE1 CpG dinucleotides in different tissues.We investigated the evolutionary trajectory of PRE1 and found that PRE1 originated from the ancestral CHRS-S1 family through three main successive partial duplications. We found that the partial duplications and deletions of PRE1 were likely due to RNA splicing events during retrotransposition. Functionally, correlation analysis showed that the methylation levels of 103 and 261 proximal PRE1 were, respectively, negatively and positively correlated with the expression levels of neighboring genes (Spearman correlation, P < 0.01). Further epigenomic analysis revealed that, in the testis, demethylation of proximal PRE1 in the HORMAD1 and HACD3 genes had tissue-specific enhancer and promoter functions, while in the muscle, methylation of proximal PRE1 repeats in the TCEA3 gene had an enhancer function.The characteristic sequences of PRE1 reflect unique patterns of origin and evolution and provide a structural basis for diverse regulatory functions.© 2022.

To date, the diagnosis of MDD is largely dependent on clinical interviews and questionnaires and still lacks a reliable biomarker. DNA methylation has a stable and reversible nature and is likely associated with the course and therapeutic efficacy of complex diseases, which may play an important role in the etiology of a disease. Here, we identified and validated a DNA methylation biomarker for MDD from four independent cohorts of the Chinese Han population. First, we integrated the analysis of the DNA methylation microarray (n= 80) and RNA expression microarray data (n= 40) and identifiedBICD2as the top-ranked gene. In the replication phase, we employed the Sequenom MassARRAY method to confirm the DNA hypermethylation change in a large sample size (n= 1,346) and used the methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes and a quantitative PCR approach (MSE-qPCR) and qPCR method to confirm the correlation between DNA hypermethylation and mRNA down-regulation ofBICD2(n= 60). The results were replicated in the peripheral blood of mice with depressive-like behaviors, while in the hippocampus of mice,Bicd2showed DNA hypomethylation and mRNA/protein up-regulation. HippocampalBicd2knockdown demonstrates antidepressant action in the chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) mouse model of depression, which may be mediated by increased BDNF expression. Our study identified a potential DNA methylation biomarker and investigated its functional implications, which could be exploited to improve the diagnosis and treatment of MDD."

Gene-environment complementary contributions to the molecular mechanisms involved in psychiatric disorders have emphasized the need to analyze epigenetic marks such as DNA methylation (DNAm) and non-coding RNAs. However, the large and diverse bioinformatic and statistical methods, referring to the confounders of the statistical models, application of multiple-testing adjustment methods, questions regarding the correlation of DNAm across tissues, and sex-dependent differences in results, have raised challenges regarding the interpretation of the results. Based on the example of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and depressive disorder (MDD), we shed light on the current knowledge and usage of methodological tools in analyzing epigenetics. Statistical robustness is an essential prerequisite for a better understanding and interpretation of epigenetic modifications and helps to find novel targets for personalized therapeutics in psychiatric diseases."

Patients were treated with 8-week risperidone monotherapy and divided into responder and non-responder groups according to the Remission in Schizophrenia Working Group (RSWG). We utilized partial least squares (PLS) regression to examine the spatial associations between gene expression of subcortical structures from a publicly available transcriptomic dataset and between-group variances of structural covariance. The peripheral DNA methylation (DNAm) status of a gene of interest (GOI), overlapping between genes detected in the PLS and 108 schizophrenia candidate gene loci previously reported, was examined in parallel with MRI scanning.In the psychotic symptom dimension, non-responders had a higher baseline structural covariance in the putamen-hippocampus-pallidum-accumbens pathway compared with responders. For disorganized symptoms, significant differences in baseline structural covariant connections were found in the putamen-hippocampus-pallidum-thalamus circuit between the two subgroups. The imaging variances related to psychotic symptom response were spatially related to the expression of genes enriched in neurobiological processes and dopaminergic pathways. The DNAm of GOI demonstrated significant associations with patients' improvement of psychotic symptoms.Baseline subcortical structural covariance and peripheral DNAm may relate to antipsychotic treatment response. Phenotypic variations in subcortical connectome related to psychotic symptom response may be transcriptomically and epigenetically underlaid.

Here, 5-azacytidine (5-azaC), an efficient DNA demethylating reagent, induced tree peony flowering with a low deformity rate by rapidly inducingPsFTexpression, whereas GA treatment affected various flowering pathway genes with strong pleiotropy. The 5-azaC treatment, but not GA, significantly reduced the methylation level in thePsFTpromoter with the demethylation of five CG contexts in a 369 bp CG-rich region, and eight light-responsive relatedcis-elements were also predicted in this region, accompanied by enhanced leaf photosynthetic efficiency. Through GO analysis, all methylation-closer differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were located in thethylakoid, the main site for photosynthesis, and were mainly involved inresponse to stimulusandsingle-organism process, whereas GA-closer DEGs had a wider distribution inside and outside of cells, associated with 12 categories of processes and regulations. We further mapped five candidate DEGs with potential flowering regulation, including three kinases (SnRK1,WAK2,and5PTase7) and two bioactive enzymes (cytochrome P450andSBH1). In summary, 5-azaC and GA may have individual roles in inducing tree peony flowering, and 5-azaC could be a preferable regulation approach; DNA demethylation is suggested to be more focused on flowering regulation withPsFTplaying a core role through promoter demethylation. In addition, 5-azaC may partially undertake or replace the light-signal function, combined with other factors, such asSnRK1, in regulating flowering.

The process, which is strongly dependent on methylation marks in other fruits such as tomatoes and oranges, is highly controlled and coordinated in strawberry.Repeated injections of the hypomethylating compound 5-azacytidine (AZA) into green and unripe Fragaria × ananassa receptacles fully arrested the ripening of the fruit. The process, however, was reversible since treated fruit parts reached full maturity within a few days after AZA treatment was stopped. Transcriptomic analyses showed that key genes responsible for the biosynthesis of anthocyanins, phenylpropanoids, and hormones such as abscisic acid (ABA) were affected by the AZA treatment. In fact, AZA downregulated genes associated with ABA biosynthetic genes but upregulated genes associated with its degradation. AZA treatment additionally downregulated a number of essential transcription factors associated with the regulation and control of ripening. Metabolic analyses revealed a marked imbalance in hormone levels, with treated parts accumulating auxins, gibberellins and ABA degradation products, as well as metabolites associated with unripe fruits.AZA completely halted strawberry ripening by altering the hormone balance, and the expression of genes involves in hormone biosynthesis and degradation processes. These results contradict those previously obtained in other climacteric and fleshly fruits, where AZA led to premature ripening. In any case, our results suggests that the strawberry ripening process is governed by methylation marks.© 2022. The Author(s)."

Therefore, we analyzed the LY96 expression and its prognostic role in tumors by multiple databases. We also investigated the correlation between LY96 and copy number, DNA methylation, somatic mutation, microsatellite instability (MSI), tumor mutation burden (TMB), tumor microenvironment (TME), and immune cell infiltration across human cancers. In addition, the biological processes related to LY96 across various tumors and the correlation between LY96 and 50% inhibitive concentration (IC50) of various drugs were investigated. We found that LY96 was differently expressed between tumor and normal tissues and was significantly upregulated in most types of cancers. LY96 was gradually upregulated from stages I to IV in several cancers. Moreover, we found LY96 may play a prognostic role in most cancers, and patients with high or low LY96 expression often show different clinical outcomes. LY96 was also associated with copy number, DNA methylation, somatic mutation, MSI, TMB, TME characteristics, and immune cell infiltration in cancers. LY96 may also regulate classic tumor-associated pathways in several cancers and is related to drug resistance.

"35821857","Considerations Regarding Public Use of Longevity Interventions.","Front Aging","Public attention and interest for longevity interventions are growing. These can include dietary interventions such as intermittent fasting, physical interventions such as various exercise regimens, or through supplementation of nutraceuticals or administration of pharmaceutics. However, it is unlikely that most interventions identified in model organisms will translate to humans, or that every intervention will benefit each person equally. In the worst case, even detrimental health effects may occur. Therefore, identifying longevity interventions using human data and tracking the aging process in people is of paramount importance as we look towards longevity interventions for the public. In this work, we illustrate how to identify candidate longevity interventions using population data in humans, an approach we have recently employed. We consider metformin as a case-study for potential confounders that influence effectiveness of a longevity intervention, such as lifestyle, sex, genetics, age of administration and the microbiome. Indeed, metformin, like most other longevity interventions, may end up only benefitting a subgroup of individuals. Fortunately, technologies have emerged for tracking the rate of 'biological' aging in individuals, which greatly aids in assessing effectiveness. Recently, we have demonstrated that even wearable devices, accessible to everyone, can be used for this purpose. We therefore propose how to use such approaches to test interventions in the general population. In summary, we advocate that 1) not all interventions will be beneficial for each individual and therefore 2) it is imperative that individuals track their own aging rates to assess healthy aging interventions.Copyright © 2022 Liu, McIntyre and Janssens."

Thus, identifying how maternal dietary intakes early affect biological aging in children represents a public health mission. We aimed to assess the relationship between maternal intake of nutrients in early pregnancy and telomere length of cell-free circulating DNA (cfDNA) from amniotic fluid. We used data and samples from the ongoing prospective ""Mamma & Bambino"" study, which recruits mother-child pairs from Catania at the first prenatal visit. Maternal nutrient intakes were assessed using a Food Frequency Questionnaire, while relative telomere length of cfDNA was assessed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Our analysis included 174 mother-child pairs. The intakes of iron, vitamin B1, and magnesium were positively correlated with relative telomere length (p-values < 0.05). However, only the intake of magnesium was positively associated with relative telomere length, after applying a linear regression model (β = 0.002; SE = 0.001; p = 0.024). Magnesium deficiency was negatively associated with relative telomere length after adjusting for the same covariates (β = -0.467; SE = 0.176; p = 0.009). To our knowledge, this is the first evidence of a positive relationship between maternal nutrient intake and telomere length of cfDNA.

A window to measuring biological age.","Aging Med (Milton)","As humans age multiple forms of biological decay ensue, and many aspects of human biology can be measured to determine how far biological machinery has drifted from homeostasis. Research has led to aging clocks being developed that claim to predict biological age as opposed to chronological age. Aging could be regarded as a measured loss of homeostatic biological equilibrium that augments biological decay in fully developed tissues. Measuring aspects of how far various elements of biology have drifted from a youthful state may allow us to make determinations on a subject's health but also make informed predictions on their biological age. As we see across human physiology, many facets that maintain human health taper off such as nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, glutathione, catalase, super oxide dismutase, and more. Extracellular vesicle density also tapers off during age combined with epigenetic drift, telomere attrition, and stem cell exhaustion, whilst genomic instability and biological insults from environment and lifestyle factors increase. Measuring these types of biomarkers with aging clocks may allow subjects to understand their own health more accurately and enable subjects to better focus on their efforts in the pursuit of longevity and, in addition, allow healthcare practitioners to deliver better health advice.© 2022 The Authors.

We report the design and methods for a study aimed at identifying epigenetic biomarkers associated with racism and resiliency that affect gene function and thereby influence SLE in a health disparity population.The Social Factors, Epigenomics and Lupus in African American Women (SELA) Study is a cross-sectional, case-control study. A total of 600 self-reported African American women will be invited to participate. All participants will respond to questionnaires that capture detailed sociodemographic and medical history, validated measures of racial discrimination, social support, as well as disease activity and damage for cases. Participants who wish will receive their genetic ancestry estimates and be involved in research. Blood samples are required to provide peripheral blood mononuclear cell counts, DNA and RNA. The primary goals of SELA are to identify variation in DNA methylation (DNAm) associated with self-reported exposure to racial discrimination and social support, to evaluate whether social DNAm sites affect gene expression, to identify the synergistic effects of social factors on DNAm changes on SLE and to develop a social factors-DNAm predictive model for disease outcomes. This study is conducted in cooperation with the Sea Island Families Project Citizen Advisory Committee.SELA will respond to the pressing need to clarify the interplay and regulatory mechanism by which various positive and negative social exposures influence SLE. Results will be published and shared with patients and the community. Knowledge of the biological impact of social exposures on SLE, as informed by the results of this study, can be leveraged by advocacy efforts to develop psychosocial interventions that prevent or mitigate risk exposures, and services or interventions that promote positive exposures. Implementation of such interventions is paramount to the closure of the health disparities gap.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC. No commercial re-use.

"35740419","Epigenetic Studies for Evaluation of NPS Toxicity: Focus on Synthetic Cannabinoids and Cathinones.","Biomedicines","In the recent decade, numerous new psychoactive substances (NPSs) have been added to the illicit drug market. These are synthetized to mimic the effects of classic drugs of abuse (i.e., cannabis, cocaine, etc.), with the purpose of bypassing substance legislations and increasing the pharmacotoxicological effects. To date, research into the acute pharmacological effects of new NPSs is ongoing and necessary in order to provide an appropriate contribution to public health. In fact, multiple examples of NPS-related acute intoxication and mortality have been recorded in the literature. Accordingly, several in vitro and in vivo studies have investigated the pharmacotoxicological profiles of these compounds, revealing that they can cause adverse effects involving various organ systems (i.e., cardiovascular, respiratory effects) and highlighting their potential increased consumption risks. In this sense, NPSs should be regarded as a complex issue that requires continuous monitoring. Moreover, knowledge of long-term NPS effects is lacking. Because genetic and environmental variables may impact NPS responses, epigenetics may aid in understanding the processes behind the harmful events induced by long-term NPS usage. Taken together, ""pharmacoepigenomics"" may provide a new field of combined study on genetic differences and epigenetic changes in drug reactions that might be predictive in forensic implications."
"35721486","Epigenetic Clocks for Mice Based on Age-Associated Regions That are Conserved Between Mouse Strains and Human.","Front Cell Dev Biol","Aging of mice can be tracked by DNA methylation changes at specific sites in the genome. In this study, we used the recently released Infinium Mouse Methylation BeadChip to compare such epigenetic modifications in C57BL/6 (B6) and DBA/2J (DBA) mice. We observed marked differences in age-associated DNA methylation in these commonly used inbred mouse strains, indicating that epigenetic clocks for one strain cannot be simply applied to other strains without further verification. In B6 mice age-associated hypomethylation prevailed with focused hypermethylation at CpG islands, whereas in DBA mice CpG islands revealed rather hypomethylation upon aging. Interestingly, the CpGs with highest age-correlation were still overlapping in B6 and DBA mice and included the genesHsf4,Prima1,Aspa, andWnt3a. Notably,Hsf4andPrima1were also top candidates in previous studies based on whole genome deep sequencing approaches. Furthermore,Hsf4,Aspa, andWnt3arevealed highly significant age-associated DNA methylation in the homologous regions in human. Subsequently, we used pyrosequencing of the four relevant regions to establish a targeted epigenetic clock that provided very high correlation with chronological age in independent cohorts of B6 (R2= 0.98) and DBA (R2= 0.91). Taken together, the methylome differs extensively between B6 and DBA mice, while prominent age-associated changes are conserved among these strains and even in humans. Our new targeted epigenetic clock with 4 CpGs provides a versatile tool for other researchers analyzing aging in mice.Copyright © 2022 Perez-Correa, Tharmapalan, Geiger and Wagner."
"35710548","Biological aging mediates the associations between urinary metals and osteoarthritis among U.S. adults.","BMC Med","Osteoarthritis (OA) is a worldwide public health concern, mainly afflicting older adults. Although the etiology of OA remains unclear, environmental factors are increasingly considered as non-negligible risk factors. This study aims to evaluate the associations of urinary metals with OA risk and the mediated effect of biological aging.Nine urinary metal concentrations were detected among 12,584 U.S. adults based on the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), including barium (Ba), cadmium (Cd), cobalt (Co), cesium (Cs), molybdenum (Mo), lead (Pb), antimony (Sb), thallium (Tl), and uranium (Tu). Multivariable logistic regression and weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression were used to explore the associations of single metal and mixed metals with OA risk, respectively. Furthermore, biological aging was measured from different perspectives, including cell senescence (telomere length) and whole-body aging (phenotypic age and biological age). Mediation analyses were conducted to investigate the mediated effects of aging on the associations of metals with OA risk.In the single-exposure model, Cd, Co, and Cs were identified to be positively associated with OA risk, with odds ratios (OR) ranging from 1.48 to 1.64 (all P < 0.05). Mixed-exposure analyses showed consistent associations (OR 1.23, 95%CI 1.10 to 1.37) and highlighted that Cd, Co, and Cs were responsible for the outcomes. Additionally, Cd, Co, Cs, Pb, and Tl were positively associated with biological aging markers, while all biological aging markers had significant associations with OA risk. Further mediation analyses showed that the associations of single metal (mainly Cd and Cs) and mixed metals with OA risk parallelly mediated by the above biological aging markers, with the proportion of mediation ranging from 16.89 to 69.39% (all P < 0.05). Moreover, such associations were also serially mediated through telomere length-biological age path and telomere length-phenotypic age path (the proportion of mediation: 4.17-11.67%), indicating that metals accelerated cell senescence to lead to whole-body aging and finally aggravated OA progress.These findings suggested that exposure to metals increased OA risk, which was possibly and partly mediated by biological aging.© 2022.

We aimed to evaluate epigenetic age and DNA methylome differences between CLZ-treated patients and those without psychopharmacological treatment. The DNA methylome was analyzed using the Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip in 31 CLZ-treated patients with psychotic disorders and 56 patients with psychiatric disorders naive to psychopharmacological treatment. Delta age (Δage) was calculated as the difference between predicted epigenetic age and chronological age. CLZ-treated patients were stratified by sex, age, and years of treatment. Differential methylation sites between both groups were determined using linear regression models. The Δage in CLZ-treated patients was on average lower compared with drug-naive patients for the three clocks analyzed; however, after data-stratification, this difference remained only in male patients. Additional differences were observed in Hannum and Horvath clocks when comparing chronological age and years of CLZ treatment. We identified 44,716 differentially methylated sites, of which 87.7% were hypomethylated in CLZ-treated patients, and enriched in the longevity pathway genes. Moreover, by protein-protein interaction, AMPK and insulin signaling pathways were found enriched. CLZ could promote a lower Δage in individuals with long-term treatment and modify the DNA methylome of the longevity-regulating pathways genes.Copyright © 2022 Pérez-Aldana, Martínez-Magaña, Mayén-Lobo, Dávila-Ortiz de Montellano, Aviña-Cervantes, Ortega-Vázquez, Genis-Mendoza, Sarmiento, Soto-Reyes, Juárez-Rojop, Tovilla-Zarate, González-Castro, Nicolini, López-López and Monroy-Jaramillo."
"35624892","The Systemic Effects of Exercise on the Systemic Effects of Alzheimer's Disease.","Antioxidants (Basel)","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive degenerative disorder and a leading cause of dementia in the elderly. The etiology of AD is multifactorial, including an increased oxidative state, deposition of amyloid plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles of the tau protein. The formation of amyloid plaques is considered one of the first signs of the illness, but only in the central nervous system (CNS). Interestingly, results indicate that AD is not just localized in the brain but is also found in organs distant from the brain, such as the cardiovascular system, gut microbiome, liver, testes, and kidney. These observations make AD a complex systemic disorder. Still, no effective medications have been found, but regular physical activity has been considered to have a positive impact on this challenging disease. While several articles have been published on the benefits of physical activity on AD development in the CNS, its peripheral effects have not been discussed in detail. The provocative question arising is the following: is it possible that the beneficial effects of regular exercise on AD are due to the systemic impact of training, rather than just the effects of exercise on the brain? If so, does this mean that the level of fitness of these peripheral organs can directly or indirectly influence the incidence or progress of AD? Therefore, the present paper aims to summarize the systemic effects of both regular exercise and AD and point out how common exercise-induced adaptation via peripheral organs can decrease the incidence of AD or attenuate the progress of AD."

Although distributions of hippocampal volume trajectories for asymptomatic individuals often reveal substantial heterogeneity, it is unclear whether interpretable trajectory classes can be objectively detected and used for prediction analyses.To detect and predict hippocampal trajectory classes in a computationally competitive context using established AD-related risk factors/biomarkers.We used biomarker/risk factor and longitudinal MRI data in asymptomatic adults from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative (n = 351; Mean = 75 years; 48.7% female). First, we applied latent class growth analyses to left (LHC) and right (RHC) hippocampal trajectory distributions to identify distinct classes. Second, using random forest analyses, we tested 38 multi-modal biomarkers/risk factors for their relative importance in discriminating the lower (potentially elevated atrophy risk) from the higher (potentially reduced risk) class.For both LHC and RHC trajectory distribution analyses, we observed three distinct trajectory classes. Three biomarkers/risk factors predicted membership in LHC and RHC lower classes: male sex, higher education, and lower plasma Aβ1-42. Four additional factors selectively predicted membership in the lower LHC class: lower plasma tau and Aβ1-40, higher depressive symptomology, and lower body mass index.Data-driven analyses of LHC and RHC trajectories detected three classes underlying the heterogeneous distributions. Machine learning analyses determined three common and four unique biomarkers/risk factors discriminating the higher and lower LHC/RHC classes. Our sequential analytic approach produced evidence that the dynamics of preclinical hippocampal trajectories can be predicted by AD-related biomarkers/risk factors from multiple modalities."
"35552703","Sperm epigenetic clock associates with pregnancy outcomes in the general population.","Hum Reprod","Is sperm epigenetic aging (SEA) associated with probability of pregnancy among couples in the general population?We observed a 17% lower cumulative probability at 12 months for couples with male partners in the older compared to the younger SEA categories.The strong relation between chronological age and DNA methylation profiles has enabled the estimation of biological age as epigenetic 'clock' metrics in most somatic tissue. Such clocks in male germ cells are less developed and lack clinical relevance in terms of their utility to predict reproductive outcomes.This was a population-based prospective cohort study of couples discontinuing contraception to become pregnant recruited from 16 US counties from 2005 to 2009 and followed for up to 12 months.Sperm DNA methylation from 379 semen samples was assessed via a beadchip array. A state-of-the-art ensemble machine learning algorithm was employed to predict age from the sperm DNA methylation data. SEA was estimated from clocks derived from individual CpGs (SEACpG) and differentially methylated regions (SEADMR). Probability of pregnancy within 1 year was compared by SEA, and discrete-time proportional hazards models were used to evaluate the relations with time-to-pregnancy (TTP) with adjustment for covariates.Our SEACpG clock had the highest predictive performance with correlation between chronological and predicted age (r = 0.91). In adjusted discrete Cox models, SEACpG was negatively associated with TTP (fecundability odds ratios (FORs)=0.83; 95% CI: 0.76, 0.90; P = 1.2×10-5), indicating a longer TTP with advanced SEACpG. For subsequent birth outcomes, advanced SEACpG was associated with shorter gestational age (n = 192; -2.13 days; 95% CI: -3.67, -0.59; P = 0.007). Current smokers also displayed advanced SEACpG (P < 0.05). Finally, SEACpG showed a strong performance in an independent IVF cohort (n = 173; r = 0.83). SEADMR performance was comparable to SEACpG but with attenuated effect sizes.This prospective cohort study consisted primarily of Caucasian men and women, and thus analysis of large diverse cohorts is necessary to confirm the associations between SEA and couple pregnancy success in other races/ethnicities.These data suggest that our sperm epigenetic clocks may have utility as a novel biomarker to predict TTP among couples in the general population and underscore the importance of the male partner for reproductive success.This work was funded in part by grants the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, National Institutes of Health (R01 ES028298; PI: J.R.P. and P30 ES020957); Robert J.

With a focus on the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and the prefrontal cortex (PFC), we aimed to identify the mitochondrial methylation signatures for (1) distinguishing the two brain areas, (2) correlating with aging, and (3) reflecting the influence of illicit drugs on the brain.We collected the brain tissue in the NAcc and the PFC from the deceased individuals without (n = 39) and with (n = 14) drug use and used whole-genome bisulfite sequencing to cover cytosine sites in the mitochondrial genome. We first detected differential methylations between the NAcc and the PFC in the nonusers group (P = 3.89 × 10-9). These function-related methylation differences diminished in the drug use group due to the selective alteration in the NAcc. Then, we found the correlation between the methylation levels and the chronological ages in the nonusers group (R2 = 0.34 in the NAcc and 0.37 in the PFC). The epigenetic clocks in illicit drug users, especially in the ketamine users, were accelerated in both brain regions by comparison with the nonusers. Finally, we summarized the effect of the illicit drugs on the methylation, which could significantly differentiate the drug users from the nonusers (AUC = 0.88 in the NAcc, AUC = 0.94 in the PFC).The mitochondrial methylations were different between different brain areas, generally accumulated with aging, and sensitive to the effects of illicit drugs. We believed this is the first report to elucidate comprehensively the importance of mitochondrial DNA methylation in human brain.© 2022. The Author(s)."

However, their respective contributions to brain maturation are unknown. We found that conditional loss of the de novo DNA methyltransferaseDnmt3ain mouse excitatory neurons altered expression of synapse-related genes, stunted synapse maturation, and impaired working memory and social interest. At the genomic level, loss ofDnmt3aabolished postnatal accumulation of CG and non-CG DNA methylation, leaving adult neurons with an unmethylated, fetal-like epigenomic pattern at ~222,000 genomic regions. The PRC2-associated histone modification, H3K27me3, increased at many of these sites. Our data support a dynamic interaction between two fundamental modes of epigenetic repression during postnatal maturation of excitatory neurons, which together confer robustness on neuronal regulation.© 2022, Li, Pinto-Duarte et al."

Despite the development of high-resolution multi-omics technologies, it is difficult to infer metabolic activity from these indirect measurements. Fortunately, genome-scale metabolic models and constraint-based modeling provide a systems biology framework to investigate the metabolic states and define the genotype-phenotype associations by integrations of multi-omics data. Constraint-Based Reconstruction and Analysis (COBRA) methods are used to build and simulate metabolic networks using mathematical representations of biochemical reactions, gene-protein reaction associations, and physiological and biochemical constraints. These methods have led to advancements in metabolic reconstruction, network analysis, perturbation studies as well as prediction of metabolic state. Most computational tools for performing these analyses are written for MATLAB, a proprietary software. In order to increase accessibility and handle more complex datasets and models, community efforts have started to develop similar open-source tools in Python. To date there is a comprehensive set of tools in Python to perform various flux analyses and visualizations; however, there are still missing algorithms in some key areas. This review summarizes the availability of Python software for several components of COBRA methods and their applications in cancer metabolism. These tools are evolving rapidly and should offer a readily accessible, versatile way to model the intricacies of cancer metabolism for identifying cancer-specific metabolic features that constitute potential drug targets.Copyright © 2022 Ng, Lee, Baloni, Diener, Heath and Su."

Compared to ensemble measurements of biomolecules, single-molecule techniques provide a breadth of information with a high spatial and temporal resolution at the molecular level. Usually, optical and electrical methods are two commonly employed methods for probing single molecules, and some platforms even offer the integration of these two methods such as optofluidics. The recent spark in technological advancement and the tremendous leap in fabrication techniques, microfluidics, and integrated optofluidics are paving the way toward low cost, chip-scale, portable, and point-of-care diagnostic and single-molecule analysis tools. This review provides the fundamentals and overview of commonly employed single-molecule methods including optical methods, electrical methods, force-based methods, combinatorial integrated methods, etc. In most single-molecule experiments, the ability to manipulate and exercise precise control over individual molecules plays a vital role, which sometimes defines the capabilities and limits of the operation. This review discusses different manipulation techniques including sorting and trapping individual particles. An insight into the control of single molecules is provided that mainly discusses the recent development of electrical control over single molecules. Overall, this review is designed to provide the fundamentals and recent advancements in different single-molecule techniques and their applications, with a special focus on the detection, manipulation, and control of single molecules on chip-scale devices."
"35682963","From Omics to Multi-Omics Approaches for In-Depth Analysis of the Molecular Mechanisms of Prostate Cancer.","Int J Mol Sci","Cancer arises following alterations at different cellular levels, including genetic and epigenetic modifications, transcription and translation dysregulation, as well as metabolic variations. High-throughput omics technologies that allow one to identify and quantify processes involved in these changes are now available and have been instrumental in generating a wealth of steadily increasing data from patient tumors, liquid biopsies, and from tumor models. Extensive investigation and integration of these data have led to new biological insights into the origin and development of multiple cancer types and helped to unravel the molecular networks underlying this complex pathology. The comprehensive and quantitative analysis of a molecule class in a biological sample is named omics and large-scale omics studies addressing different prostate cancer stages have been performed in recent years. Prostate tumors represent the second leading cancer type and a prevalent cause of cancer death in men worldwide. It is a very heterogenous disease so that evaluating inter- and intra-tumor differences will be essential for a precise insight into disease development and plasticity, but also for the development of personalized therapies. There is ample evidence for the key role of the androgen receptor, a steroid hormone-activated transcription factor, in driving early and late stages of the disease, and this led to the development and approval of drugs addressing diverse targets along this pathway. Early genomic and transcriptomic studies have allowed one to determine the genes involved in prostate cancer and regulated by androgen signaling or other tumor-relevant signaling pathways. More recently, they have been supplemented by epigenomic, cistromic, proteomic and metabolomic analyses, thus, increasing our knowledge on the intricate mechanisms involved, the various levels of regulation and their interplay. The comprehensive investigation of these omics approaches and their integration into multi-omics analyses have led to a much deeper understanding of the molecular pathways involved in prostate cancer progression, and in response and resistance to therapies. This brings the hope that novel vulnerabilities will be identified, that existing therapies will be more beneficial by targeting the patient population likely to respond best, and that bespoke treatments with increased efficacy will be available soon."

"35896974","Multivariate estimation of factor structures of complex traits using SNP-based genomic relationships.","BMC Bioinformatics","Heritability and genetic correlation can be estimated from genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data using various methods. We recently developed multivariate genomic-relatedness-based restricted maximum likelihood (MGREML) for statistically and computationally efficient estimation of SNP-based heritability ([Formula: see text]) and genetic correlation ([Formula: see text]) across many traits in large datasets. Here, we extend MGREML by allowing it to fit and perform tests on user-specified factor models, while preserving the low computational complexity.Using simulations, we show that MGREML yields consistent estimates and valid inferences for such factor models at low computational cost (e.g., for data on 50 traits and 20,000 individuals, a saturated model involving 50 [Formula: see text]'s, 1225 [Formula: see text]'s, and 50 fixed effects is estimated and compared to a restricted model in less than one hour on a single notebook with two 2.7 GHz cores and 16 GB of RAM). Using repeated measures of height and body mass index from the US Health and Retirement Study, we illustrate the ability of MGREML to estimate a factor model and test whether it fits the data better than a nested model.

Sows with abnormal vulva generally show reproductive disorders. In order to excavate candidate loci and genes associated with pig's vulvar traits, 270 Suhuai pigs with vulvar phenotype were genotyped by a porcine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) Chip. Then, Chip data were imputed using resequenced data of 30 Suhuai pigs as a reference panel. Next, we estimated the heritability and performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for vulvar traits. The heritabilities for the traits vulvar length (VL), vulvar width (VW) and vulvar angle (VA) in this pig population were 0.23, 0.32 and 0.22, respectively. GWAS based on Chip data identified nine significant SNPs on theSus scrofachromosomes (SSC) 2, 7, 9 and 13 for VL or VW. GWAS based on imputed data identified 11 new quantitative trait loci (QTL) on SSC1, 2, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 16 and 17 for VL or VW. The most significant QTL for VL on SSC2 were refined to a 3.48-3.97 Mb region using linkage disequilibrium and linkage analysis (LDLA). In this refined region,FGF19andCCND1, involved in the development of the reproductive tract, cell growth and vulvar cancer, could be new candidate genes affecting VL.

"35864105","Evaluating the role of common risk variation in the recurrence risk of schizophrenia in multiplex schizophrenia families.","Transl Psychiatry","Multiplex families have higher recurrence risk of schizophrenia compared to the families of sporadic cases, but the source of this increased recurrence risk is unknown. We used schizophrenia genome-wide association study data (N = 156,509) to construct polygenic risk scores (PRS) in 1005 individuals from 257 multiplex schizophrenia families, 2114 ancestry-matched sporadic cases, and 2205 population controls, to evaluate whether increased PRS can explain the higher recurrence risk of schizophrenia in multiplex families compared to ancestry-matched sporadic cases. Using mixed-effects logistic regression with family structure modeled as a random effect, we show that SCZ PRS in familial cases does not differ significantly from sporadic cases either with, or without family history (FH) of psychotic disorders (All sporadic cases p = 0.90, FH+ cases p = 0.88, FH- cases p = 0.82). These results indicate that increased burden of common schizophrenia risk variation as indexed by current SCZ PRS, is unlikely to account for the higher recurrence risk of schizophrenia in multiplex families. In the absence of elevated PRS, segregation of rare risk variation or environmental influences unique to the families may explain the increased familial recurrence risk. These findings also further validate a genetically influenced psychosis spectrum, as shown by a continuous increase of common SCZ risk variation burden from unaffected relatives to schizophrenia cases in multiplex families. Finally, these results suggest that common risk variation loading are unlikely to be predictive of schizophrenia recurrence risk in the families of index probands, and additional components of genetic risk must be identified and included in order to improve recurrence risk prediction.© 2022.

"35761182","Impact of linkage disequilibrium heterogeneity along the genome on genomic prediction and heritability estimation.","Genet Sel Evol","Compared to medium-density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data, high-density SNP data contain abundant genetic variants and provide more information for the genetic evaluation of livestock, but it has been shown that they do not confer any advantage for genomic prediction and heritability estimation. One possible reason is the uneven distribution of the linkage disequilibrium (LD) along the genome, i.e., LD heterogeneity among regions. The aim of this study was to effectively use genome-wide SNP data for genomic prediction and heritability estimation by using models that control LD heterogeneity among regions.The LD-adjusted kinship (LDAK) and LD-stratified multicomponent (LDS) models were used to control LD heterogeneity among regions and were compared with the classical model that has no such control. Simulated and real traits of 2000 dairy cattle individuals with imputed high-density (770K) SNP data were used. Five types of phenotypes were simulated, which were controlled by very strongly, strongly, moderately, weakly and very weakly tagged causal variants, respectively. The performances of the models with high- and medium-density (50K) panels were compared to verify that the models that controlled LD heterogeneity among regions were more effective with high-density data.Compared to the medium-density panel, the use of the high-density panel did not improve and even decreased prediction accuracies and heritability estimates from the classical model for both simulated and real traits. Compared to the classical model, LDS effectively improved the accuracy of genomic predictions and unbiasedness of heritability estimates, regardless of the genetic architecture of the trait. LDAK applies only to traits that are mainly controlled by weakly tagged causal variants, but is still less effective than LDS for this type of trait. Compared with the classical model, LDS improved prediction accuracy by about 13% for simulated phenotypes and by 0.3 to ~ 10.7% for real traits with the high-density panel, and by ~ 1% for simulated phenotypes and by - 0.1 to ~ 6.9% for real traits with the medium-density panel.Grouping SNPs based on regional LD to construct the LD-stratified multicomponent model can effectively eliminate the adverse effects of LD heterogeneity among regions, and greatly improve the efficiency of high-density SNP data for genomic prediction and heritability estimation.© 2022.

"35714612","Leveraging the local genetic structure for trans-ancestry association mapping.","Am J Hum Genet","Over the past two decades, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have successfully advanced our understanding of the genetic basis of complex traits. Despite the fruitful discovery of GWASs, most GWAS samples are collected from European populations, and these GWASs are often criticized for their lack of ancestry diversity. Trans-ancestry association mapping (TRAM) offers an exciting opportunity to fill the gap of disparities in genetic studies between non-Europeans and Europeans. Here, we propose a statistical method, LOG-TRAM, to leverage the local genetic architecture for TRAM. By using biobank-scale datasets, we showed that LOG-TRAM can greatly improve the statistical power of identifying risk variants in under-represented populations while producing well-calibrated p values. We applied LOG-TRAM to the GWAS summary statistics of various complex traits/diseases from BioBank Japan, UK Biobank, and African populations. We obtained substantial gains in power and achieved effective correction of confounding biases in TRAM. Finally, we showed that LOG-TRAM can be successfully applied to identify ancestry-specific loci and the LOG-TRAM output can be further used for construction of more accurate polygenic risk scores in under-represented populations.Copyright © 2022 American Society of Human Genetics.

"35674391","Comparing heritability estimators under alternative structures of linkage disequilibrium.","G3 (Bethesda)","The single nucleotide polymorphism heritability of a trait is the proportion of its variance explained by the additive effects of the genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms. The existing approaches to estimate single nucleotide polymorphism heritability can be broadly classified into 2 categories. One set of approaches models the single nucleotide polymorphism effects as fixed effects and the other treats the single nucleotide polymorphism effects as random effects. These methods make certain assumptions about the dependency among individuals (familial relationship) as well as the dependency among markers (linkage disequilibrium) to provide consistent estimates of single nucleotide polymorphism heritability as the number of individuals increases. While various approaches have been proposed to account for such dependencies, it remains unclear which estimates reported in the literature are more robust against various model misspecifications. Here, we investigate the impact of different structures of linkage disequilibrium and familial relatedness on heritability estimation. We show that the performance of different methods for heritability estimation depends heavily on the structure of the underlying pattern of linkage disequilibrium and the degree of relatedness among sampled individuals. Moreover, we establish the equivalence between the 2 method-of-moments estimators, one using a fixed-single nucleotide polymorphism-effects approach, and another using a random-single nucleotide polymorphism-effects approach.© The Author(s) 2022.

Intestinal microbiota was measured in a subgroup of 161 controls, 144 prediabetes and 56 diabetes by using metagenomics sequencing. We identified that plasma choline [Per SD of log-transformed change: odds ratio 1.36 (95 confidence interval 1.16, 1.58)] was positively, while betaine [0.77 (0.66, 0.89)] was negatively associated with diabetes, independently of TMAO. Individuals with diabetes could be accurately distinguished from controls by integrating data on choline, and certain microbiota species, as well as traditional risk factors (AUC=0.971). KOs associated with the carbohydrate metabolism pathway were enhanced in individuals with high choline level. The functional shift in the carbohydrate metabolism pathway in high choline group was driven by speciesRuminococcus lactaris,Coprococcus catusandPrevotella copri. We demonstrated the potential ability for classifying diabetic population by choline and specific species, and provided a novel insight of choline metabolism linking the microbiota to impaired glucose metabolism and diabetes.Copyright © 2022 Zeng, Zhao, Wang, Li, Li, Zheng, Chen, Zhao, Ji, Gao, Liu, Wang, Cheng, Xu, Pan, Sun, Li, Li, He and Zheng."

Detected segments of clonal mosaicism are usually bundled into large-locus regions for statistical analysis. However, low-frequency genes are overlooked and are not sufficient to elucidate qualitative differences between cancer patients and non-patients. Therefore, it is of interest to develop and describe a tool named Sub-GOFA for Sub-Gene Ontology function analysis in clonal mosaicism using semantic similarity. Sub-GOFA measures the semantic (logical) similarity among patients using the sub-GO network structures of various sizes segmented from the gene ontology (GO) for clustering analysis. The sub-GO's root-terms with significant differences are extracted as disease-associated genetic functions. Sub-GOFA selected a high ratio of cancer-associated genes under validation with acceptable threshold.© 2022 Biomedical Informatics."

A comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying HSC aging will be valuable in developing novel therapies for HSC rejuvenation and to prevent the onset of several age-associated diseases and hematological malignancies. This review considers the general causes of HSC aging that range from cell-intrinsic factors to cell-extrinsic factors. In particular, epigenetics and inflammation have been implicated in the linkage of HSC aging, clonality, and oncogenesis.

Despite an increase in reports of possible OA risk loci, it has become clear that genetics is not the sole cause of osteoarthritis. Epigenetics, which can be triggered by environmental influences and result in transcriptional alterations, may have a role in OA pathogenesis. The majority of recent research on the epigenetics of OA has been focused on DNA methylation, histone modification, and non-coding RNAs. However, this study will explore epigenetic regulation in OA at the present stage. How genetics, environmental variables, and epigenetics interact will be researched, shedding light for future studies. Their possible interaction and control processes open up new avenues for the development of innovative osteoarthritis treatment and diagnostic techniques.Copyright © 2022 Cai, Long, Zhao, Lin and Wang."
"35804086","scPCOR-seq enables co-profiling of chromatin occupancy and RNAs in single cells.","Commun Biol","Cell-to-cell variation in gene expression is a widespread phenomenon, which may play important roles in cellular differentiation, function, and disease development1-9. Chromatin is implicated in contributing to the cellular heterogeneity in gene expression10-16. Fully understanding the mechanisms of cellular heterogeneity requires simultaneous measurement of RNA and occupancy of histone modifications and transcription factors on chromatin due to their critical roles in transcriptional regulation17,18. We generally term the occupancy of histone modifications and transcription factors as Chromatin occupancy. Here, we report a technique, termed scPCOR-seq (single-cell Profiling of Chromatin Occupancy and RNAs Sequencing), for simultaneously profiling genome-wide chromatin protein binding or histone modification marks and RNA expression in the same cell. We demonstrated that scPCOR-seq can profile either H3K4me3 or RNAPII and RNAs in a mixture of human H1, GM12878 and 293 T cells at a single-cell resolution and either H3K4me3, RNAPII, or RNA profile can correctly separate the cells. Application of scPCOR-seq to the in vitro differentiation of the erythrocyte precursor CD36 cells from human CD34 stem or progenitor cells revealed that H3K4me3 and RNA exhibit distinct properties in clustering cells during differentiation.

"35656113","Vascular Calcification in Chronic Kidney Disease: An Update and Perspective.","Aging Dis","Chronic kidney disease is a devastating condition resulting from irreversible loss of nephron numbers and function and leading to end-stage renal disease and mineral disorders. Vascular calcification, an ectopic deposition of calcium-phosphate salts in blood vessel walls and heart valves, is an independent risk factor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in chronic kidney disease. Moreover, aging and related metabolic disorders are essential risk factors for chronic kidney disease and vascular calcification. Marked progress has been recently made in understanding and treating vascular calcification in chronic kidney disease. However, there is a paucity of systematic reviews summarizing this progress, and investigating unresolved issues is warranted. In this systematic review, we aimed to overview the underlying mechanisms of vascular calcification in chronic kidney diseases and discuss the impact of chronic kidney disease on the pathophysiology of vascular calcification. Additionally, we summarized potential clinical diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic applications for vascular calcification with chronic kidney disease. This review may offer new insights into the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and therapeutic intervention of vascular calcification.Copyright: © 2022 Ren et al."

The DNA packing is explained by folding of chromatin fiber. This folding leads to the formation of such hierarchical structures as: chromosomal territories, compartments; densely-packed genomic regions known as Topologically Associating Domains (TADs), or Chromatin Contact Domains (CCDs), and loops. We propose models of dynamical human genome folding into hierarchical components in human lymphoblastoid, stem cell, and fibroblast cell lines. Our models are based on explosive percolation theory. The chromosomes are modeled as graphs where CTCF chromatin loops are represented as edges. The folding trajectory is simulated by gradually introducing loops to the graph following various edge addition strategies that are based on topological network properties, chromatin loop frequencies, compartmentalization, or epigenomic features. Finally, we propose the genome folding model - a biophysical pseudo-time process guided by a single scalar order parameter. The parameter is calculated by Linear Discriminant Analysis of chromatin features. We also include dynamics of loop formation by using Loop Extrusion Model (LEM) while adding them to the system. The chromatin phase separation, where fiber folds in 3D space into topological domains and compartments, is observed when the critical number of contacts is reached. We also observe that at least 80% of the loops are needed for chromatin fiber to condense in 3D space, and this is constant through various cell lines. Overall, ourin-silicomodel integrates the high-throughput 3D genome interaction experimental data with the novel theoretical concept of phase separation, which allows us to model event-based time dynamics of chromatin loop formation and folding trajectories.© 2022 The Authors."

These challenges impair HSC function, but whether this functional impairment extends beyond the duration of inflammatory exposure is unknown. Unexpectedly, we observed an irreversible depletion of functional HSCs following challenge with inflammation or bacterial infection, with no evidence of any recovery up to 1 year afterward. HSCs from challenged mice demonstrated multiple cellular and molecular features of accelerated aging and developed clinically relevant blood and bone marrow phenotypes not normally observed in aged laboratory mice but commonly seen in elderly humans. In vivo HSC self-renewal divisions were absent or extremely rare during both challenge and recovery periods. The progressive, irreversible attrition of HSC function demonstrates that temporally discrete inflammatory events elicit a cumulative inhibitory effect on HSCs.

We aim to find new perspectives on the pathological mechanism of the disease and possible drug targets for treatment based on this study.We conducted a phenome-wide MR study to prioritize circulating proteins causally associated with COVID-19 susceptibility, which was defined as ""patients tested positive for COVID-19vs.population controls"", and severity, which was defined as ""patients hospitalized with COVID-19vs.population controls"". And we repeated the analysis for different definition of COVID-19 susceptibility, severity and control groups.Association of three circulating proteins with COVID-19 susceptibility and severity were demonstrated via our study. C-C motif chemokine 4 (OR =1.887, 95% CI: 1.608-2.165, P=8.04×10-6) and 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthase 1 (OR =0.511, 95% CI: 0.266-0.757, P=8.51×10-8) were found respectively positively and negatively correlated with increased COVID-19 severity.

Here we investigate this phenomenon by focusing on the genetic background of this correlation in order to understand the similarities and differences in the genetic regulation of these omics layers.We performed locus-wide association studies of 92 protein levels measured in whole blood for 2,014 samples of European ancestry and found that 66 are genetically regulated. Three female- and one male-specific effects were detected. We estimated the genetically regulated GE for all significant genes in 49 GTEx v8 tissues. A total of 7 proteins showed negative correlations with their respective GE across multiple tissues. Finally, we tested for causal links of GE on protein expression via Mendelian Randomization, and confirmed a negative causal effect of GE on protein level for five of these genes in a total of 63 gene-tissue pairs: BLMH, CASP3, CXCL16, IL6R, and SFTPD. For IL6R, we replicated the negative causal effect on coronary-artery disease (CAD), while its GE was positively linked to CAD.While total GE and protein levels are only weakly correlated, we found high correlations between their genetically regulated components across multiple tissues. Of note, strong negative causal effects of tissue-specific GE on five protein levels were detected.

"35576643","The heart-brain axis: A proteomics study of meditation on the cardiovascular system of Tibetan Monks.","EBioMedicine","There have been mixed reports on the beneficial effects of meditation in cardiovascular disease (CVD), which is widely considered the leading cause of death worldwide.To clarify the role of meditation in modulating the heart-brain axis, we implemented an extreme phenotype strategy, i.e., Tibetan monks (BMI > 30) who practised 19.20 ± 7.82 years of meditation on average and their strictly matched non-meditative Tibetan controls. Hypothesis-free advanced proteomics strategies (Data Independent Acquisition and Targeted Parallel Reaction Monitoring) were jointly applied to systematically investigate and target the plasma proteome underlying meditation. Total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol  (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B (Apo B) and lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] as the potential cardiovascular risk factors were evaluated. Heart rate variability (HRV) was assessed by electrocardiogram.Obesity, hypertension, and reduced HRV is offset by long-term meditation. Notably, meditative monks have blood pressure and HRV comparable to their matched Tibetan controls. Meditative monks have a protective plasma proteome, related to decreased atherosclerosis, enhanced glycolysis, and oxygen release, that confers resilience to the development of CVD. In addition, clinical risk factors in plasma were significantly decreased in monks compared with controls, including total cholesterol, LDL-C, Apo B, and Lp(a).To our knowledge, this work is the first well-controlled proteomics investigation of long-term meditation, which opens up a window for individuals characterized by a sedentary lifestyle to improve their cardiovascular health with an accessible method practised for more than two millennia.See the Acknowledgements section.Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).

We examined the associations of circulating molecule levels with SCAD by integrating data from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of CanSCAD and 7 pQTL studies. Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was applied to examine the associations between circulating molecule levels and AAD by using data from UK Biobank GWAS and pQTL studies. The SCAD-associated SNPs in 1q21.2 were strongly associated with circulating levels of extracellular matrix protein 1 (ECM1) and 25 other proteins (encoded byCTSS,CAT,CNDP1,KNG1,SLAMF7,TIE1,CXCL1,MBL2,ESD,CXCL16,CCL14,KCNE5, CST7,PSME1,GPC3,MAP2K4,SPOCK3,LRPPRC,CLEC4M,NOG,C1QTNF9,CX3CL1,SCP2D1,SERPINF2, andFN1). These proteins were enriched in biological processes such as regulation of peptidase activity and regulation of cellular protein metabolic processes. Proteins (FGF6, FGF9, HGF, BCL2L1, and VEGFA) involved in the Ras signaling pathway were identified to be related to AAD. In addition, SCAD- and AAD-associated SNPs were associated with cytokine and lipid levels. MR analysis showed that circulating ECM1, SPOCK3 and IL1b levels were associated with AAD. Circulating levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and small very-low-density lipoprotein particles were strongly associated with AAD.

How maternal MES-4 protects the germline is not well understood, but its role in H3K36 methylation hinted that it may regulate gene expression in primordial germ cells (PGCs). We tested this hypothesis by profiling transcripts from nascent germlines (PGCs and their descendants) dissected from wild-type andmes-4mutant (lacking maternal and zygotic MES-4) larvae.mes-4nascent germlines displayed downregulation of some germline genes, upregulation of some somatic genes, and dramatic upregulation of hundreds of genes on the X chromosome. We demonstrated that upregulation of one or more genes on the X is the cause of germline death by generating and analyzingmes-4mutants that inherited different endowments of X chromosome(s). Intriguingly, removal of the THAP transcription factor LIN-15B frommes-4mutants reduced X misexpression and prevented germline death.lin-15Bis X-linked and misexpressed inmes-4PGCs, identifying it as a critical target for MES-4 repression.

"35682993","Mechanisms Driving the Emergence of Neuronal Hyperexcitability in Fragile X Syndrome.","Int J Mol Sci","Hyperexcitability is a shared neurophysiological phenotype across various genetic neurodevelopmental disorders, including Fragile X syndrome (FXS). Several patient symptoms are associated with hyperexcitability, but a puzzling feature is that their onset is often delayed until their second and third year of life. It remains unclear how and why hyperexcitability emerges in neurodevelopmental disorders. FXS is caused by the loss of FMRP, an RNA-binding protein which has many critical roles including protein synthesis-dependent and independent regulation of ion channels and receptors, as well as global regulation of protein synthesis. Here, we discussed recent literature uncovering novel mechanisms that may drive the progressive onset of hyperexcitability in the FXS brain.

FXS is caused by a cytosine-guanine-guanine (CGG) trinucleotide repeat expansion in the untranslated region of theFMR1gene leading to the functional loss of the gene's protein product FMRP. Various animal models of FXS have provided substantial knowledge about the disorder. However, critical limitations exist in replicating the pathophysiological mechanisms. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) provide a unique means of studying the features and processes of both normal and abnormal human neurodevelopment in large sample quantities in a controlled setting. Human iPSC-based models of FXS have offered a better understanding of FXS pathophysiology specific to humans. This review summarizes studies that have used hiPSC-based two-dimensional cellular models of FXS to reproduce the pathology, examine altered gene expression and translation, determine the functions and targets of FMRP, characterize the neurodevelopmental phenotypes and electrophysiological features, and, finally, to reactivateFMR1. We also provide an overview of the most recent studies using three-dimensional human brain organoids of FXS and end with a discussion of current limitations and future directions for FXS research using hiPSCs."
"35705990","Hematopoietic differentiation persists in human iPSCs defective in de novo DNA methylation.","BMC Biol","DNA methylation is involved in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression during developmental processes and is primarily established by the DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A) and 3B (DNMT3B). DNMT3A is one of the most frequently mutated genes in clonal hematopoiesis and leukemia, indicating that it plays a crucial role for hematopoietic differentiation. However, the functional relevance of Dnmt3a for hematopoietic differentiation and hematological malignancies has mostly been analyzed in mice, with the specific role for human hematopoiesis remaining elusive. In this study, we therefore investigated if DNMT3A is essential for hematopoietic differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs).We generated iPSC lines with knockout of either exon 2, 19, or 23 and analyzed the impact of different DNMT3A exon knockouts on directed differentiation toward mesenchymal and hematopoietic lineages. Exon 19-/-and 23-/-lines displayed an almost entire absence of de novo DNA methylation during mesenchymal and hematopoietic differentiation. Yet, differentiation efficiency was only slightly reduced in exon 19-/-and rather increased in exon 23-/-lines, while there was no significant impact on gene expression in hematopoietic progenitors (iHPCs). Notably, DNMT3A-/-iHPCs recapitulate some DNA methylation patterns of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with DNMT3A mutations. Furthermore, multicolor genetic barcoding revealed growth advantage of exon 23-/-iHPCs in a syngeneic competitive differentiation assay.Our results demonstrate that iPSCs with homozygous knockout of different exons of DNMT3A remain capable of mesenchymal and hematopoietic differentiation-and exon 23-/-iHPCs even gained growth advantage-despite loss of almost the entire de novo DNA methylation. Partial recapitulation of DNA methylation patterns of AML with DNMT3A mutations by our DNMT3A knockout iHPCs indicates that our model system can help to elucidate mechanisms of clonal hematopoiesis.© 2022.

The present study aimed to investigate the role of NNMT in glioma and to elucidate the associated functional mechanisms.Clinical samples were analyzed by immunohistochemical staining and Western blotting to evaluate NNMT expression in glioma and normal brain tissues. The correlation between NNMT expression and glioma was analyzed using the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Additionally, NNMT was knocked down in two types of glioma cells, U87 and U251, to evaluate the invasive ability of these cells. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to validate NNMT knockdown in the cells. Furthermore, ELISA was used to determine the balance between nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide hydrogen (NAD/NADH ratio), which verified the altered methylation patterns in the cells. The glioma xenograft mouse models were used to verify the regulatory role of NNMT, GAP43, and SIRT1.Analysis based on our clinical glioma samples and TCGA database revealed that overexpression of NNMT was associated with poor prognosis of patients. Knockdown of NNMT reduced the invasive ability of glioma cells, and downregulation of its downstream protein GAP43 occurred due to altered cellular methylation caused by NNMT overexpression. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis confirmed that NNMT modulated the NAD-related signaling pathway and showed a negative association between NNMT and SIRT1. Moreover, the regulatory roles of NNMT, GAP43, and SIRT1 were confirmed in glioma xenograft mouse models.Overexpression of NNMT causes abnormal DNA methylation through regulation of the NAD/NADH ratio, which in turn leads to the downregulation of GAP43 and SIRT1, eventually altering the biological behavior of tumor cells."

Nevertheless, SNP data is desirable both for genotyping and to understand the DNA methylome in the context of the genetic background. The confounding effect of bisulfite conversion however can be conceptually resolved by observing differences in allele counts on a per-strand basis, whereby artificial mutations are reflected by non-complementary base pairs.Herein, we present a computational pre-processing approach for adapting sequence alignment data, thus indirectly enabling downstream analysis on a per-strand basis using conventional variant calling software such as GATK or Freebayes. In comparison to specialised tools, the method represents a marked improvement in precision-sensitivity based on high-quality, published benchmark datasets for both human and model plant variants.The presented ""double-masking"" procedure represents an open source, easy-to-use method to facilitate accurate variant calling using conventional software, thus negating any dependency on specialised tools and mitigating the need to generate additional, conventional sequencing libraries alongside bisulfite sequencing experiments.

"35576187","Epigenetic and transcriptional dysregulation in CD4+ T cells in patients with atopic dermatitis.","PLoS Genet","Atopic dermatitis (AD) is one of the most common skin disorders among children. Disease etiology involves genetic and environmental factors, with 29 independent AD risk loci enriched for risk allele-dependent gene expression in the skin and CD4+ T cell compartments. We investigated the potential epigenetic mechanisms responsible for the genetic susceptibility of CD4+ T cells. To understand the differences in gene regulatory activity in peripheral blood T cells in AD, we measured chromatin accessibility (an assay based on transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing, ATAC-seq), nuclear factor kappa B subunit 1 (NFKB1) binding (chromatin immunoprecipitation with sequencing, ChIP-seq), and gene expression levels (RNA-seq) in stimulated CD4+ T cells from subjects with active moderate-to-severe AD, as well as in age-matched non-allergic controls. Open chromatin regions in stimulated CD4+ T cells were highly enriched for AD genetic risk variants, with almost half of the AD risk loci overlapping AD-dependent ATAC-seq peaks. AD-specific open chromatin regions were strongly enriched for NF-κB DNA-binding motifs. ChIP-seq identified hundreds of NFKB1-occupied genomic loci that were AD- or control-specific. As expected, the AD-specific ChIP-seq peaks were strongly enriched for NF-κB DNA-binding motifs. Surprisingly, control-specific NFKB1 ChIP-seq peaks were not enriched for NFKB1 motifs, but instead contained motifs for other classes of human transcription factors, suggesting a mechanism involving altered indirect NFKB1 binding. Using DNA sequencing data, we identified 63 instances of altered genotype-dependent chromatin accessibility at 36 AD risk variant loci (30% of AD risk loci) that might lead to genotype-dependent gene expression. Based on these findings, we propose that CD4+ T cells respond to stimulation in an AD-specific manner, resulting in disease- and genotype-dependent chromatin accessibility alterations involving NFKB1 binding."

Gaining evidence shows the ART can influence preset epigenetic modifications within cultured oocytes or early embryos and affect their developmental competency. The aim of this review is to describe ART-determined epigenetic changes related to the oogenesis, early embryogenesis, and further in utero development. We confront the latest epigenetic, related epitranscriptomic, and translational regulation findings with the processes of meiotic maturation, fertilization, and early embryogenesis that impact the developmental competency and embryo quality. Post-ART embryo transfer, in utero implantation, and development (placentation, fetal development) are influenced by environmental and lifestyle factors.

"35740266","DNA Methylation and Gene Expression in Blood and Adipose Tissue of Adult Offspring of Women with Diabetes in Pregnancy-A Validation Study of DNA Methylation Changes Identified in Adolescent Offspring.","Biomedicines","Maternal gestational diabetes and obesity are associated with adverse outcomes in offspring, including increased risk of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Previously, we identified a lower DNA methylation degree at genomic sites near the genesESM1,MS4A3, andTSPAN14in the blood cells of adolescent offspring exposed to gestational diabetes and/or maternal obesity in utero. In the present study, we aimed to investigate if altered methylation and expression of these genes were detectable in blood, as well in the metabolically relevant subcutaneous adipose tissue, in a separate cohort of adult offspring exposed to gestational diabetes and obesity (O-GDM) or type 1 diabetes (O-T1D) in utero, compared with the offspring of women from the background population (O-BP). We did not replicate the findings of lower methylation ofESM1,MS4A3, andTSPAN14in blood from adults, either in O-GDM or O-T1D. In contrast, in adipose tissue of O-T1D, we found higherMS4A3DNA methylation, which will require further validation. The adipose tissueESM1expression was lower in O-GDM compared to O-BP, which in turn was not associated with maternal pre-pregnancy BMI nor the offspring's own adiposity. Adipose tissueTSPAN14expression was slightly lower in O-GDM compared with O-BP, but also positively associated with maternal pre-pregnancy BMI, as well as offspring's own adiposity and HbA1c levels. In conclusion, the lower DNA methylation in blood from adolescent offspring exposed to GDM could not be confirmed in the present cohort of adult offspring, potentially due to methylation remodeling with increased aging. In offspring adipose tissue,ESM1expression was associated with maternal GDM, andTSPAN14expression was associated with both maternal GDM, as well as pre-pregnancy BMI. These altered expression patterns are potentially relevant to the concept of developmental programming of cardiometabolic diseases and require further studies."
"35707281","Small Noncoding RNAs Contribute to Sperm Oxidative Stress-Induced Programming of Behavioral and Metabolic Phenotypes in Offspring.","Oxid Med Cell Longev","There is growing evidence that paternal environmental information alters small noncoding RNAs (sncRNAs) in sperm and in turn can induce alterations of metabolic and behavioral phenotypes of the next generation. However, the potential mediators of the effects remain to be elucidated. A great diversity of environmental insults and stresses can convergently induce the elevation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in sperm; nonetheless, it remains unclear whether ROS mediates the biogenesis of sncRNAs in sperm and participates in the reprogramming of offspring phenotypes. Here, we show that ROS could induce the alteration of sncRNA profiles in sperm, especially for transfer RNA-derived small RNAs (tsRNAs) and ribosomal RNA-derived small RNAs (rsRNAs). Zygotic injection of 29-34 nt RNA fractions (predominantly tsRNAs and rsRNAs) from oxidative stress (OS) sperm could induce depressive-like and anxiety-like behaviors in male offspring. Moreover, zygotic injection with synthetic RNAs partially resembled OS sperm-induced depressive-like and anxiety-like behaviors in offspring. Male offspring maintained on a chow diet was found to develop impaired glucose tolerance and hyperactive hepatic gluconeogenesis, accompanied by the upregulation of hepatic gluconeogenic and lipolytic genes. Together, our results have shown that ROS-induced alteration of sncRNA profiles in sperm contributes to the alterations of behavioral and metabolic phenotypes of the offspring.Copyright © 2022 Li Ren et al."
"35820851","Recent evidence from omic analysis for redox signalling and mitochondrial oxidative stress in COPD.","J Inflamm (Lond)","COPD is driven by exogenous and endogenous oxidative stress derived from inhaled cigarette smoke, air pollution and reactive oxygen species from dysregulated mitochondria in activated inflammatory cells within the airway and lung. This is compounded by the loss in antioxidant defences including FOXO and NRF2 and other antioxidant transcription factors together with various key enzymes that attenuate oxidant effects. Oxidative stress enhances inflammation; airway remodelling including fibrosis and emphysema; post-translational protein modifications leading to autoantibody generation; DNA damage and cellular senescence. Recent studies using various omics technologies in the airways, lungs and blood of COPD patients has emphasised the importance of oxidative stress, particularly that derived from dysfunctional mitochondria in COPD and its role in immunity, inflammation, mucosal barrier function and infection. Therapeutic interventions targeting oxidative stress should overcome the deleterious pathologic effects of COPD if targeted to the lung. We require novel, more efficacious antioxidant COPD treatments among which mitochondria-targeted antioxidants and Nrf2 activators are promising.© 2022. The Author(s)."

Subsequentin vitroexperiments further validated the potential role of the hub genes in CRC.A comprehensive analysis was performed on multiple CRC datasets and a CRC recurrence model was constructed containing LEMD1, SERPINE1, and SIAE. After further validation in two independent databases, we selected LEMD1 forin vitroexperiments and found that LEMD1 could regulate CRC cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and promote EMT transition. The Rho-GTPase pulldown experiments further indicated that LEMD1 could affect RhoA activity and regulate cytoskeletal dynamics. Finally, we demonstrated that LEMD1 promoted CRC cell migration through the RhoA/ROCK1 signaling pathway.In this study, a CRC relapse model consisting of LEMD1, SERPINE1, and SIAE was constructed by comprehensive analysis of multiple CRC datasets.

"35887244","Mitochondrial Genetic and Epigenetic Regulations in Cancer: Therapeutic Potential.","Int J Mol Sci","Mitochondria are dynamic organelles managing crucial processes of cellular metabolism and bioenergetics. Enabling rapid cellular adaptation to altered endogenous and exogenous environments, mitochondria play an important role in many pathophysiological states, including cancer. Being under the control of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA (mtDNA and nDNA), mitochondria adjust their activity and biogenesis to cell demands. In cancer, numerous mutations in mtDNA have been detected, which do not inactivate mitochondrial functions but rather alter energy metabolism to support cancer cell growth. Increasing evidence suggests that mtDNA mutations, mtDNA epigenetics and miRNA regulations dynamically modify signalling pathways in an altered microenvironment, resulting in cancer initiation and progression and aberrant therapy response. In this review, we discuss mitochondria as organelles importantly involved in tumorigenesis and anti-cancer therapy response. Tumour treatment unresponsiveness still represents a serious drawback in current drug therapies. Therefore, studying aspects related to genetic and epigenetic control of mitochondria can open a new field for understanding cancer therapy response. The urgency of finding new therapeutic regimens with better treatment outcomes underlines the targeting of mitochondria as a suitable candidate with new therapeutic potential. Understanding the role of mitochondria and their regulation in cancer development, progression and treatment is essential for the development of new safe and effective mitochondria-based therapeutic regimens."

Its etiology is not clearly defined but is connected with different factors occurring before and after birth. It remains difficult to identify a single factor or group of factors, and the problem is further complicated by various overlapping mechanisms. In this study, we attempted to determine whether DNA methylation-an epigenetic mechanism-plays a key role in the etiology of MIH. We collected the epithelium of the oral mucosa from children with MIH and healthy individuals and analyzed its global DNA methylation level in each child using a 5-mC DNA ELISA kit after DNA isolation. There was no statistically significant difference between the global DNA methylation levels in the study and control groups. Then, we also analyzed the associations of the DNA methylation levels with different prenatal, perinatal, and postnatal factors, using appropriate statistical methods. Factors such as number of pregnancies, number of births, type of delivery, varicella infection (under 3 years old), and high fever (under 3 years old) were significantly important. This work can be seen as the first step towards further studies of the epigenetic background of the MIH etiology."

ROS can cause damage to various biomolecules, including DNA. The systems that have developed to harness the impacts of ROS are antique evolutionary adaptations that are intricately linked to almost every aspect of cellular function. This research reveals the idea that during evolution, rather than being largely conserved, the molecular pathways reacting to oxidative stress have intrinsic flexibility. The coding sequences of the ATF2, ATF3, ATF4, and ATF6 genes were aligned to examine selection pressure on the genes, which were shown to be very highly conserved among vertebrate species. A total of 33 branches were explicitly evaluated for their capacity to diversify selection. After accounting for multiple testing, significance was determined using the likelihood ratio test with a threshold ofp≤ 0.05. Positive selection signs in these genes were detected across vertebrate lineages. In the selected test branches of our phylogeny, the synonymous rate variation revealed evidence (LRT,pvalue = 0.011 ≤ 0.05) of gene-wide episodic diversifying selection. As a result, there is evidence that diversifying selection occurred at least once on at least one test branch. These findings indicate that the activities of ROS-responsive systems are also theoretically flexible and may be altered by environmental selection pressure. By determining where the genes encoding these processes are ""targeted"" during evolution, we may better understand the mechanism of adaptation to oxidative stress during evolution.Copyright © 2022 Hafiz Ishfaq Ahmad et al."

In this study, we performed an eQTL analysis using single-nuclei RNA sequencing from 192 individuals in eight brain cell types derived from the prefrontal cortex, temporal cortex and white matter. We identified 7,607 eGenes, a substantial fraction (46%, 3,537/7,607) of which show cell-type-specific effects, with strongest effects in microglia. Cell-type-level eQTLs affected more constrained genes and had larger effect sizes than tissue-level eQTLs. Integration of brain cell type eQTLs with genome-wide association studies (GWAS) revealed novel relationships between expression and disease risk for neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases. For most GWAS loci, a single gene co-localized in a single cell type, providing new clues into disease etiology. Our findings demonstrate substantial contrast in genetic regulation of gene expression among brain cell types and reveal potential mechanisms by which disease risk genes influence brain disorders.© 2022.

We aimed to investigate the genetic overlap and distinction of bipolar type I (BD I) & type II (BD II) by conducting integrative post-GWAS analyses.Methods:We utilized single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-level approaches to uncover correlated and distinct genetic loci. Transcriptome-wide association analyses (TWAS) were then approached to pinpoint functional genes expressed in specific brain tissues and blood. Next, we performed cross-phenotype analysis, including exploring the potential causal associations between two BD subtypes and lithium responses and comparing the difference in genetic structures among four different psychiatric traits.Results:SNP-level evidence revealed three genomic loci,SLC25A17, ZNF184, andRPL10AP3, shared by BD I and II, and one locus (MAD1L1) and significant gene sets involved in calcium channel activity, neural and synapsed signals that distinguished two subtypes. TWAS data implicated different genes affecting BD I and II through expression in specific brain regions (nucleus accumbens for BD I). Cross-phenotype analyses indicated that BD I and II share continuous genetic structures with schizophrenia and major depressive disorder, which help fill the gaps left by the dichotomy of mental disorders.Conclusion:These combined evidences illustrate genetic convergence and divergence between BD I and II and provide an underlying biological and trans-diagnostic insight into major psychiatric disorders.Copyright © 2022 Huang, Liu, Wu, Tang, Zhang, Liu, Xiao, Tao, Xie, Dai, Li, Gui and Wang."

However, there is still a vast gap between genetics and biology that needs to be bridged. Here, we followed up blood pressure genome-wide summary statistics of over 750,000 individuals, leveraging comprehensive epigenomic and transcriptomic data from blood with a follow-up in cardiovascular tissues to prioritise likely causal genes and underlying blood pressure mechanisms. We first prioritised genes based on coding consequences, multilayer molecular associations, blood pressure-associated expression levels, and coregulation evidence. Next, we followed up the prioritised genes in multilayer studies of genomics, epigenomics, and transcriptomics, functional enrichment, and their potential suitability as drug targets. Our analyses yielded 1880 likely causal genes for blood pressure, tens of which are targets of the available licensed drugs. We identified 34 novel genes for blood pressure, supported by more than one source of biological evidence. Twenty-eight (82%) of these new genes were successfully replicated by transcriptome-wide association analyses in a large independent cohort (n= ~220,000).

Although genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have revealed multiple ALS susceptibility loci, the exact identities of causal variants, genes, cell types, tissues, and their functional roles in the development of ALS remain largely unknown. Here, we reported a comprehensive post-GWAS analysis of the recent large ALS GWAS (n= 80,610), including functional mapping and annotation (FUMA), transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS), colocalization (COLOC), and summary data-based Mendelian randomization analyses (SMR) in extensive multi-omics datasets. Gene property analysis highlighted inhibitory neuron 6, oligodendrocytes, and GABAergic neurons (Gad1/Gad2) as functional cell types of ALS and confirmed cerebellum and cerebellar hemisphere as functional tissues of ALS. Functional annotation detected the presence of multiple deleterious variants at three loci (9p21.2, 12q13.3, and 12q14.2) and highlighted a list of SNPs that are potentially functional. TWAS, COLOC, and SMR identified 43 genes at 24 loci, including 23 novel genes and 10 novel loci, showing significant evidence of causality. Integrating multiple lines of evidence, we further proposed that rs2453555 at 9p21.2 and rs229243 at 14q12 functionally contribute to the development of ALS by regulating the expression ofC9orf72in pituitary andSCFD1in skeletal muscle, respectively.

First, several characterizations of enhancer-related genes using functional genomics data are informative for autoimmune disease heritability after conditioning on a broad set of regulatory annotations. Second, candidate master-regulator genes defined usingtrans-eQTL in blood are also conditionally informative for autoimmune disease heritability. Third, integrating enhancer-related and master-regulator gene sets with protein-protein interaction (PPI) network information magnified their disease signal. The resulting PPI-enhancer gene score produced >2-fold stronger heritability signal and >2-fold stronger enrichment for drug targets, compared with the recently proposed enhancer domain score.

Here we analyze genetic data from 200,453 UK Biobank participants to map the landscape of inherited predisposition to CH, increasing the number of germline associations with CH in European-ancestry populations from 4 to 14. Genes at new loci implicate DNA damage repair (PARP1, ATM, CHEK2), hematopoietic stem cell migration/homing (CD164) and myeloid oncogenesis (SETBP1). Several associations were CH-subtype-specific including variants at TCL1A and CD164 that had opposite associations with DNMT3A- versus TET2-mutant CH, the two most common CH subtypes, proposing key roles for these two loci in CH development.

When gene expression is sufficiently perturbed, it can lead to disease. To understand how gene expression disruptions percolate through a network, we must first map connections between regulatory genes and their downstream targets. However, we lack comprehensive knowledge of the upstream regulators of most genes. Here, we developed an approach for systematic discovery of upstream regulators of critical immune factors-IL2RA, IL-2 and CTLA4-in primary human T cells. Then, we mapped the network of the target genes of these regulators and putative cis-regulatory elements using CRISPR perturbations, RNA-seq and ATAC-seq. These regulators form densely interconnected networks with extensive feedback loops. Furthermore, this network is enriched for immune-associated disease variants and genes.

Leveraging summary statistics from the hitherto largest genome-wide association study (GWAS) conducted in each trait, we investigated the genetic overlap and causal associations of UL with BC overall, as well as with its subtypes defined by the status of estrogen receptor (ER). We observed a positive genetic correlation between UL and BC overall (rg = 0.09, p = 6.00 × 10-3), which was consistent in ER+ subtype (rg = 0.06, p = 0.01) but not in ER- subtype (rg = 0.06, p = 0.08). Partitioning the whole genome into 1,703 independent regions, local genetic correlation was identified at 22q13.1 for UL with BC overall and with ER+ subtype. Significant genetic correlation was further discovered in 9 out of 14 functional categories, with the highest estimates observed in coding, H3K9ac, and repressed regions. Cross-trait meta-analysis identified 9 novel loci shared between UL and BC. Mendelian randomization demonstrated a significantly increased risk of BC overall (OR = 1.09, 95% CI = 1.01-1.18) and ER+ subtype (OR = 1.09, 95% CI = 1.01-1.17) for genetic liability to UL.

Here, we study up to 38,965 UK Biobank participants with MRI-derived visceral (VAT), abdominal subcutaneous (ASAT), and gluteofemoral (GFAT) adipose tissue volumes. Because these fat depot volumes are highly correlated with BMI, we additionally study six local adiposity traits: VAT adjusted for BMI and height (VATadj), ASATadj, GFATadj, VAT/ASAT, VAT/GFAT, and ASAT/GFAT. We identify 250 independent common variants (39 newly-identified) associated with at least one trait, with many associations more pronounced in female participants. Rare variant association studies extend prior evidence for PDE3B as an important modulator of fat distribution. Local adiposity traits (1) highlight depot-specific genetic architecture and (2) enable construction of depot-specific polygenic scores that have divergent associations with type 2 diabetes and coronary artery disease.

In excitatory neurons, altered transcripts encoded presynaptic factors and were associated with genetic risk for schizophrenia, including common and rare variants. To understand how the deletion contributed to these changes, we defined the minimal protein-protein interaction network that best explains gene expression alterations. We found that many genes in 22q11.2 interact in presynaptic, proteasome, and JUN/FOS transcriptional pathways.

A common 4-bp deletion polymorphism in an enhancer adjacent to BAK1 is significantly associated with the disease risk (rs3831846; P = 2.4 × 10-9, odds ratio = 2.46 [95% CI: 1.83-3.31], minor allele frequency = 0.43). Rs3831846 is in strong linkage disequilibrium with a testicular GCTs susceptibility variant rs210138. In-vitro reporter assays reveal rs3831846 to be a functional variant attenuating the enhancer activity, suggesting its contribution to IGCTs predisposition through altering BAK1 expression. Risk alleles of testicular GCTs derived from the European GWAS show significant positive correlations in the effect sizes with the Japanese IGCTs GWAS (P = 1.3 × 10-4, Spearman's ρ = 0.48).

"35716666","Genetic interactions drive heterogeneity in causal variant effect sizes for gene expression and complex traits.","Am J Hum Genet","Despite the growing number of genome-wide association studies (GWASs), it remains unclear to what extent gene-by-gene and gene-by-environment interactions influence complex traits in humans. The magnitude of genetic interactions in complex traits has been difficult to quantify because GWASs are generally underpowered to detect individual interactions of small effect. Here, we develop a method to test for genetic interactions that aggregates information across all trait-associated loci. Specifically, we test whether SNPs in regions of European ancestry shared between European American and admixed African American individuals have the same causal effect sizes. We hypothesize that in African Americans, the presence of genetic interactions will drive the causal effect sizes of SNPs in regions of European ancestry to be more similar to those of SNPs in regions of African ancestry. We apply our method to two traits: gene expression in 296 African Americans and 482 European Americans in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in 74K African Americans and 296K European Americans in the Million Veteran Program (MVP). We find significant evidence for genetic interactions in our analysis of gene expression; for LDL-C, we observe a similar point estimate, although this is not significant, most likely due to lower statistical power. These results suggest that gene-by-gene or gene-by-environment interactions modify the effect sizes of causal variants in human complex traits.Copyright © 2022 American Society of Human Genetics.

"35836664","Stress-Related Mental Health Disorders and Inflammation in Pregnancy: The Current Landscape and the Need for Further Investigation.","Front Psychiatry","Many studies have focused on psychoimmunological mechanisms of risk for stress-related mental health disorders. However, significantly fewer studies have focused on understanding mechanisms of risk for stress-related disorders during pregnancy, a period characterized by dramatic changes in both the innate and adaptive immune systems. The current review summarizes and synthesizes the extant literature on the immune system during pregnancy, as well as the sparse existing evidence highlighting the associations between inflammation and mood, anxiety, and fear-related disorders in pregnancy. In general, pregnant persons demonstrate lower baseline levels of systemic inflammation, but respond strongly when presented with an immune challenge. Stress and trauma exposure may therefore result in strong inflammatory responses in pregnant persons that increases risk for adverse behavioral health outcomes. Overall, the existing literature suggests that stress, trauma exposure, and stress-related psychopathology are associated with higher levels of systemic inflammation in pregnant persons, but highlight the need for further investigation as the existing data are equivocal and vary based on which specific immune markers are impacted. Better understanding of the psychoimmunology of pregnancy is necessary to reduce burden of prenatal mental illness, increase the likelihood of a successful pregnancy, and reduce the intergenerational impacts of prenatal stress-related mental health disorders.Copyright © 2022 Ravi, Bernabe and Michopoulos."
"35610216","Mothers with higher twinning propensity had lower fertility in pre-industrial Europe.","Nat Commun","Historically, mothers producing twins gave birth, on average, more often than non-twinners. This observation has been interpreted as twinners having higher intrinsic fertility - a tendency to conceive easily irrespective of age and other factors - which has shaped both hypotheses about why twinning persists and varies across populations, and the design of medical studies on female fertility. Here we show in >20k pre-industrial European mothers that this interpretation results from an ecological fallacy: twinners had more births not due to higher intrinsic fertility, but because mothers that gave birth more accumulated more opportunities to produce twins. Controlling for variation in the exposure to the risk of twinning reveals that mothers with higher twinning propensity - a physiological predisposition to producing twins - had fewer births, and when twin mortality was high, fewer offspring reaching adulthood. Twinning rates may thus be driven by variation in its mortality costs, rather than variation in intrinsic fertility.© 2022. The Author(s)."

Mice with homozygous conditional knockout of Ank-G in the adult forebrain display hyperactivity and reduced anxiety-like behaviors, responsive to mood stabilizers. Their behavior switches to a depression-like phenotype when exposed to chronic social defeat stress (SDS), and then spontaneously reverts to baseline hyperactivity. Ank-G heterozygous conditional knockouts (Ank-G Het cKO) have not previously been characterized. Here, we describe the behavior of Ank-G Het cKO mice compared to littermate controls in the open field, elevated plus maze, and forced swim test, under both unstressed and stressed conditions. We found that Ank-G Het cKO is not significantly different from controls at baseline or after chronic SDS. The chronic stress-induced ""depression-like"" behavioral phenotype is persistent for at least 28 days and is responsive to fluoxetine. Strikingly, Ank-G Het cKO mice display increased sensitivity to a short duration SDS, which does not affect controls. The heterozygous Ank-G genetic model may provide novel insights into the role of Ank-G in the pathophysiology of stress sensitivity and ""depression-like"" phenotypes and could be useful for studying Ank-G-related gene-environment interactions.Copyright © 2021 by S.

Anxiety is a common symptom of CSVD. Previous studies have reported the association between inflammatory factors and anxiety in other diseases, but this association in patients with CSVD remains uncovered. Our study aimed to investigate whether serum inflammatory factors correlated with anxiety in patients with CSVD.A total of 245 CSVD patients confirmed using brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were recruited from December 2019 to December 2021. Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA) was used to assess the anxiety symptoms of CSVD patients. Patients with HAMA scores ≥7 were considered to have anxiety symptoms. The serum levels of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-2R, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), serum amyloid A (SAA), C-reactive protein (CRP), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) were detected. We compared levels of inflammatory factors between the anxiety and non-anxiety groups. Logistic regression analyses examined the correlation between inflammatory factors and anxiety symptoms. We further performed a gender subgroup analysis to investigate whether this association differed by gender.In the fully adjusted multivariate logistic regression analysis model, we found that lower levels of IL-8 were linked to a higher risk of anxiety symptoms. Moreover, higher levels of SAA were linked to a lower risk of anxiety symptoms. Our study identified sex-specific effects, and the correlation between IL-8 and anxiety symptoms remained significant among males, while the correlation between SAA and anxiety symptoms remained significant among females.In this study, we found a suggestive association between IL-8, SAA, and anxiety symptoms in CSVD participants. Furthermore, IL-8 and SAA may have a sex-specific relationship with anxiety symptoms.Copyright © 2022 Shan, Wang, Qiao, Bian, Huo, Guo, Liu, Yang, Li, Liu and Han."

RNA-sequencing on four brain regions (cerebellum, cortex, substantia nigra (SN), and striatum) from control animals, MPTP-induced PD, and MPTP-induced PD model treated with exercise for 12 weeks were performed. Transcriptional networks on the four regions were further identified by an integrative network biology approach.The 12-week treadmill exercise significantly improved the motor ability of an MPTP-induced mouse model of PD. RNA-seq analysis showed SN and striatum were remarkably different among individual region's response to exercise in the PD model. Especially, synaptic regulation pathways about axon guidance, synapse assembly, neurogenesis, synaptogenesis, transmitter transport-related pathway, and synaptic regulation genes, including Neurod2, Rtn4rl2, and Cd5, were upregulated in SN and striatum. Lastly, immunofluorescence staining revealed that exercise rescued the loss of TH+synapses in the striatal region in PD mice, which validates the key role of synaptic regulation pathways in exercise-induced protective effectsin vivo.SN and striatum are important brain regions in which critical transcriptional changes, such as in synaptic regulation pathways, occur after the exercise intervention on the PD model.Copyright © 2022 Tong, Zhang, Yao, Li, Hu, Zhang, Song, Guan, Li, Sun and Jin."

Influenced by many factors, such as psychological, hormonal, and genetic factors, the incidence rate of depression in females is approximately two times that in males. However, in preclinical neuroscience research, the selection of the animals' sex for use in depression models has been controversial. At present, in most preclinical studies, the animals generally chosen in depression models have been male rodents rather than female rodents. It remains doubtful whether the data obtained from male animals can be generalized to female animals. The performance of female animals in preclinical studies of depression has been inconclusive. Based on a review of a large number of original studies in the PubMed database, it was found that although male rodents are more commonly used in the study of depression, the use of female animals also shows good modeling of depression and has its advantages. The influence of the animals' sex in the chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) model needs further research.Copyright © 2022 Shuo Jiang et al."

We used RNA sequencing in postmortem DMPFC samples to investigate suicide victims compared to control subjects. 1400 genes differed using log2FC &gt; ±1 and adjustedp-value &lt; 0.05 criteria between groups. Genes associated with depressive disorder, schizophrenia and impaired cognition were strongly overexpressed in top differentially expressed genes. Protein-protein interaction and co-expressional networks coupled with gene set enrichment analysis revealed that pathways related to cytokine receptor signaling were enriched in downregulated, while glutamatergic synaptic signaling upregulated genes in suicidal individuals. A validated differentially expressed gene, which is known to be associated with mGluR5, was the N-terminal EF-hand calcium-binding protein 2 (NECAB2). In situ hybridization histochemistry and immunohistochemistry proved that NECAB2 is expressed in two different types of inhibitory neurons located in layers II-IV and VI, respectively. Our results imply extensive gene expressional alterations in the DMPFC related to suicidal behavior. Some of these genes may contribute to the altered mental state and behavior of suicide victims."

Dioscin, a bioactive natural product, shows various pharmacological effects. However, the activities and mechanisms of dioscin against PD have not been well investigated. In this study, the tests on 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced PC12 cells and rats were carried out. The results showed that dioscin dramatically improved cell viability, decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, improved motor behavior and tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) levels and restored the levels of glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in rats. Mechanism investigation showed that dioscin not only markedly increased the expression level of dual- specificity phosphatase 6 (DUSP6) by 1.87-fold in cells and 2.56-fold in rats, and decreased phospho-extracellular regulated protein kinases (p-ERK) level by 2.12-fold in cells and 2.34-fold in rats, but also increased the levels of nuclear factor erythroid2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), hemeoxygenase-1 (HO-1), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and decreased the levels of kelch-1ike ECH-associated protein l (Keap1) in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, DUSP6 siRNA transfection experiment in PC12 cells validated the protective effects of dioscin against PD via regulating DUSP6 to adjust the Keap1/Nrf2 pathway. Our data supported that dioscin has protection against PD in regulating oxidative stress via DUSP6 signal, which should be considered as an efficient candidate for the treatment of PD in the future."

Selecting ideal therapeutic options in order to hinder the process of aging and decelerate the progression of age-related diseases is valuable. Along therapeutic options, life style modifications may well render the process of aging. The process of aging is affected by alteration in many cellular and signaling pathways amid which mTOR, SIRT1, and AMPK pathways are the most emphasized.

Genetic markers related to aging not only reveal the biological mechanism of aging but also provide age information in forensic research. In this study, we aimed to screen age-associated mRNAs based on the previously reported genome-wide expression data. In addition, predicted models for age estimations were built by three machine learning methods. We identified 283 differentially expressed mRNAs between two groups with different age ranges. Nine mRNAs out of 283 mRNAs showed different expression patterns between smokers and non-smokers and were eliminated from the following analysis. Age-associated mRNAs were further screened from the remaining mRNAs by the cross-validation error analysis of random forest. Finally, 14 mRNAs were chosen to build the model for age predictions. These 14 mRNAs showed relatively high correlations with age. Furthermore, we found that random forest showed the optimal performance for age prediction in comparison to the generalized linear model and support vector machine. To sum up, the 14 age-associated mRNAs identified in this study could be viewed as valuable markers for age estimations and studying the aging process.Copyright © 2022 Jin, Ren, Zhang, Wang, Liu, Ji and Huang."

"35879318","Maternal SMCHD1 regulates Hox gene expression and patterning in the mouse embryo.","Nat Commun","Parents transmit genetic and epigenetic information to their offspring. Maternal effect genes regulate the offspring epigenome to ensure normal development. Here we report that the epigenetic regulator SMCHD1 has a maternal effect on Hox gene expression and skeletal patterning. Maternal SMCHD1, present in the oocyte and preimplantation embryo, prevents precocious activation of Hox genes post-implantation. Without maternal SMCHD1, highly penetrant posterior homeotic transformations occur in the embryo. Hox genes are decorated with Polycomb marks H2AK119ub and H3K27me3 from the oocyte throughout early embryonic development; however, loss of maternal SMCHD1 does not deplete these marks. Therefore, we propose maternal SMCHD1 acts downstream of Polycomb marks to establish a chromatin state necessary for persistent epigenetic silencing and appropriate Hox gene expression later in the developing embryo. This is a striking role for maternal SMCHD1 in long-lived epigenetic effects impacting offspring phenotype.© 2022. The Author(s)."

Recent work demonstrates that social isolation in mothers represents a silent stressor contributing to PTB risk. Here; we investigate the association of inflammatory and stress markers with PTB risk in Long-Evans rats exposed to social isolation stress (SIS) during preconception and pregnancy across four generations (F0-F3). Gestational length; blood glucose; corticosterone levels; and maternal and offspring weights were assessed in two SIS paradigms: transgenerational (TG) and multigenerational (MG) exposure. Maternal uterine tissues were collected 21 days after the dams gave birth. Exposure to SIS reduced pregnancy lengths in the parental generation and neonatal birth weights in the F1 and F2 generations. Interleukin (IL)-1β (Il1b) mRNA levels increased in F0 animals but decreased in the offspring of both stress lineages. Protein levels of IL-1β decreased in the TG lineage. Corticotrophin-releasing hormone receptor 1 (Crhr1) expression decreased in SIS-exposed F0 animals and increased in the TG-F2 and MG-F1 offspring. Expression of enzyme 11-β hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-2 (11bHSD2) was enhanced in F1 animals. These findings suggest SIS has adverse consequences on the F0 mothers; but their F1-F3 progeny may adapt to this chronic stress; thus supporting the fetal programming hypothesis."

A prerequisite to apply OWAS is to choose a trait-related cell type beforehand. However, for most complex traits, the trait-relevant cell types remain elusive. In addition, many complex traits involve multiple related cell types. To address these issues, we develop OWAS-joint, an efficient framework that aggregates predicted chromatin accessibility across multiple cell types, to prioritize disease-associated genomic segments. In simulation studies, we demonstrate that OWAS-joint achieves a greater statistical power compared to OWAS. Moreover, the heritability explained by OWAS-joint segments is higher than or comparable to OWAS segments. OWAS-joint segments also have high replication rates in independent replication cohorts. Applying the method to six complex human traits, we demonstrate the advantages of OWAS-joint over a single-cell-type OWAS approach.

Simulation studies show that compared to standard methods, ARCHIE is better suited to identify ""core""-like genes through which effects of many other genes may be mediated and can capture disease-specific patterns of genetic associations. By applying ARCHIE to publicly available summary statistics from the eQTLGen consortium, we identify gene sets which have significant evidence of trans-association with groups of known genetic variants across 29 complex traits. Around half (50.7%) of the selected genes do not have any strong trans-associations and are not detected by standard methods.

"35871219","A polygenic score indexing a DRD2-related co-expression network is associated with striatal dopamine function.","Sci Rep","The D2 dopamine receptor (D2R) is the primary site of the therapeutic action of antipsychotics and is involved in essential brain functions relevant to schizophrenia, such as attention, memory, motivation, and emotion processing. Moreover, the gene coding for D2R (DRD2) has been associated with schizophrenia at a genome-wide level. Recent studies have shown that a polygenic co-expression index (PCI) predicting the brain-specific expression of a network of genes co-expressed with DRD2 was associated with response to antipsychotics, brain function during working memory in patients with schizophrenia, and with the modulation of prefrontal cortex activity after pharmacological stimulation of D2 receptors. We aimed to investigate the relationship between the DRD2 gene network and in vivo striatal dopaminergic function, which is a phenotype robustly associated with psychosis and schizophrenia. To this aim, a sample of 92 healthy subjects underwent18F-DOPA PET and was genotyped for genetic variations indexing the co-expression of the DRD2-related genetic network in order to calculate the PCI for each subject. The PCI was significantly associated with whole striatal dopamine synthesis capacity (p = 0.038). Exploratory analyses on the striatal subdivisions revealed a numerically larger effect size of the PCI on dopamine function for the associative striatum, although this was not significantly different than effects in other sub-divisions. These results are in line with a possible relationship between the DRD2-related co-expression network and schizophrenia and extend it by identifying a potential mechanism involving the regulation of dopamine synthesis.

"35866592","Differentially Active and Conserved Neural Enhancers Define Two Forms of Adaptive Noncoding Evolution in Humans.","Genome Biol Evol","The human and chimpanzee genomes are strikingly similar, but our neural phenotypes are very different. Many of these differences are likely driven by changes in gene expression, and some of those changes may have been adaptive during human evolution. Yet, the relative contributions of positive selection on regulatory regions or other functional regulatory changes are unclear. Where are these changes located throughout the human genome? Are functional regulatory changes near genes or are they in distal enhancer regions? In this study, we experimentally combined both human and chimpanzee cis-regulatory elements (CREs) that showed either (1) signs of accelerated evolution in humans or (2) that have been shown to be active in the human brain. Using a massively parallel reporter assay, we tested the ability of orthologous human and chimpanzee CREs to activate transcription in induced pluripotent stem-cell-derived neural progenitor cells and neurons. With this assay, we identified 179 CREs with differential activity between human and chimpanzee; in contrast, we found 722 CREs with signs of positive selection in humans. Selection and differentially expressed CREs strikingly differ in level of expression, size, and genomic location. We found a subset of 69 CREs in loci with genetic variants associated with neuropsychiatric diseases, which underscores the consequence of regulatory activity in these loci for proper neural development and function. By combining CREs that either experienced recent selection in humans or CREs that are functional brain enhancers, presents a novel way of studying the evolution of noncoding elements that contribute to human neural phenotypes.© The Author(s) 2022.

"35859581","Biology: Motion is Function.","Function (Oxf)","In 1966 Francis Crick declared that: ""The ultimate aim of the modern movement in biology is to explain all biology in terms of physics and chemistry."" This motivated us to contemplate approaches that unify biology at a fundamental level. Exploration led us to consider the features of energy, entropy, and motion. Overall, it can be considered that motion of matter is the feature of life function. No motion. No function. In initial work we evaluated the hypothesis that the scope for biologic function is mediated mechanistically by a differential for energy transfer. Maximal treadmill running capacity served as a proxy for energy transfer. The span for capacity was estimated ""biologically"" by application of two-way artificial selection in rats for running capacity. Consistent with our ""Energy Transfer Hypothesis"" (ETH), low physical health and dysfunction segregated with low running capacity and high physical health and function segregated with high running capacity. The high energy yield of aerobic metabolism is also consonant with the ETH; that is, amongst the elements of the universe, oxygen is second only to fluorine in electronegativity. Although we deem these energy findings possibly correct, they are based on correlation and do not illuminate function via fundamental principles. For consideration of life, Entropy (2nd Law of thermodynamics) can be viewed as an open system that exchanges energy with the universe operating via nonequilibrium thermodynamics. The Principle of Maximal Entropy Production (MEP) states that: If a source of free energy is present, complex systems can intercept the free energy flow, and self-organize to enhance entropy production. The development of Benard convection cells in a water heat gradient demonstrate simplistic operation of MEP. A direct step forward would be to explain the mechanism of the obligatory motion of molecules for life function. Motion may be mediated by operation of ""action at a distance"" for molecules as considered by the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen Paradox and confirmed by JS Bell. Magnetism, electricity, and gravity are also examples of action at a distance. We propose that some variant of ""action at a distance"" as directed by the property of Maximal Entropy Production (MEP) underwrites biologic motion.© The Author(s) 2022.

As Fisher, Haldane, and Wright established a century ago, Mendelian inheritance is exactly what is needed for natural selection to work efficiently. Yet, the synthesis remains unfinished. We do not understand why sexual reproduction and a fair meiosis predominate in eukaryotes, or how far these are responsible for their diversity and complexity. Moreover, although quantitative geneticists have long known that adaptive variation is highly polygenic, and that this is essential for efficient selection, this is only now becoming appreciated by molecular biologists-and we still do not have a good framework for understanding polygenic variation or diffuse function."

In the past two decades, dramatic advances in genomic methods have facilitated the identification of the loci, genes, and even individual mutations that underlie phenotypic variants that are the putative targets of natural selection. Moreover, these methods have also changed how we can study adaptation by flipping the problem around, allowing us to first examine what loci show evidence of having been under selection, and then connecting these genetic variants to phenotypic variation. As a result, we now have an expanding list of actual genetic changes that underlie potentially adaptive phenotypic variation. Here, we synthesize how considering the effects of these adaptive loci in the context of cellular environments, genomes, organisms, and populations has provided new insights to the genetic architecture of adaptation."
"35814863","Testability of high-dimensional linear models with nonsparse structures.","Ann Stat","Understanding statistical inference under possibly non-sparse high-dimensional models has gained much interest recently. For a given component of the regression coefficient, we show that the difficulty of the problem depends on the sparsity of the corresponding row of the precision matrix of the covariates, not the sparsity of the regression coefficients. We develop new concepts of uniform and essentially uniform non-testability that allow the study of limitations of tests across a broad set of alternatives. Uniform non-testability identifies a collection of alternatives such that the power of any test, against any alternative in the group, is asymptotically at most equal to the nominal size. Implications of the new constructions include new minimax testability results that, in sharp contrast to the current results, do not depend on the sparsity of the regression parameters. We identify new tradeoffs between testability and feature correlation. In particular, we show that, in models with weak feature correlations, minimax lower bound can be attained by a test whose power has thenrate, regardless of the size of the model sparsity."

Second, we explored the effect ofNRN1on brain activity during a working memory task (N-back task; 39 HS, 39 EO and 39 AO; matched by age, sex and estimated IQ). Different haplotypes encompassing the same three Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms(SNPs, rs3763180-rs10484320-rs4960155) were associated with EO in the two samples (GCT, TCC and GTT). Besides, the GTT haplotype was associated with worse N-back task performance in EO and was linked to an inefficient dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activity in subjects with EO compared to HS. Our results show convergent evidence on theNRN1association with EO both from genetic and neuroimaging approaches, highlighting the role of neurotrophins in the pathophysiology of SZ."

However, the driving forces behind quantitative trait variations remain unclear owing to their complexity at the molecular level. This study focused on the natural variation of the free-running period (FRP) of the circadian clock because FRP is a determining factor of the phase phenotype of clock-dependent physiology.Lemna aequinoctialisin Japan is a paddy field duckweed that exhibits a latitudinal cline of critical day length (CDL) for short-day flowering. We collected 72 strains ofL. aequinoctialisand found a significant correlation between FRPs and locally adaptive CDLs, confirming that variation in the FRP-dependent phase phenotype underlies photoperiodic adaptation. Diel transcriptome analysis revealed that the induction timing of anFTgene is key to connecting the clock phase to photoperiodism at the molecular level. This study highlights the importance of FRP as a variation resource for evolutionary adaptation.© 2022 The Author(s)."
"35777959","chromMAGMA: regulatory element-centric interrogation of risk variants.","Life Sci Alliance","Candidate causal risk variants from genome-wide association studies reside almost exclusively in noncoding regions of the genome and innovative approaches are necessary to understand their biological function. Multi-marker analysis of genomic annotation (MAGMA) is a widely used program that nominates candidate risk genes by mapping single-nucleotide polymorphism summary statistics from genome-wide association studies to gene bodies. We augmented MAGMA to create chromatin-MAGMA (chromMAGMA), a method to nominate candidate risk genes based on the presence of risk variants within noncoding regulatory elements (REs). We applied chromMAGMA to a genetic susceptibility dataset for epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), a rare gynecologic malignancy characterized by high mortality. This identified 155 unique candidate EOC risk genes across five EOC histotypes; 83% (105/127) of high-grade serous ovarian cancer risk genes had not previously been implicated in this EOC histotype. Risk genes nominated by chromMAGMA converged on mRNA splicing and transcriptional dysregulation pathways. chromMAGMA is a pipeline that nominates candidate risk genes through a gene regulation-focused approach and helps interpret the biological mechanism of noncoding risk variants for complex diseases.© 2022 Nameki et al."
"35773720","3DFAACTS-SNP: using regulatory T cell-specific epigenomics data to uncover candidate mechanisms of type 1 diabetes (T1D) risk.","Epigenetics Chromatin","Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have enabled the discovery of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are significantly associated with many autoimmune diseases including type 1 diabetes (T1D). However, many of the identified variants lie in non-coding regions, limiting the identification of mechanisms that contribute to autoimmune disease progression. To address this problem, we developed a variant filtering workflow called 3DFAACTS-SNP to link genetic variants to target genes in a cell-specific manner. Here, we use 3DFAACTS-SNP to identify candidate SNPs and target genes associated with the loss of immune tolerance in regulatory T cells (Treg) in T1D.Using 3DFAACTS-SNP, we identified from a list of 1228 previously fine-mapped variants, 36 SNPs with plausible Treg-specific mechanisms of action. The integration of cell type-specific chromosome conformation capture data in 3DFAACTS-SNP identified 266 regulatory regions and 47 candidate target genes that interact with these variant-containing regions in Treg cells. We further demonstrated the utility of the workflow by applying it to three other SNP autoimmune datasets, identifying 16 Treg-centric candidate variants and 60 interacting genes. Finally, we demonstrate the broad utility of 3DFAACTS-SNP for functional annotation of all known common (> 10% allele frequency) variants from the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD). We identified 9376 candidate variants and 4968 candidate target genes, generating a list of potential sites for future T1D or other autoimmune disease research.We demonstrate that it is possible to further prioritise variants that contribute to T1D based on regulatory function, and illustrate the power of using cell type-specific multi-omics datasets to determine disease mechanisms. Our workflow can be customised to any cell type for which the individual datasets for functional annotation have been generated, giving broad applicability and utility.© 2022. The Author(s)."

Criteria that were once considered contraindications to living kidney donation are now viewed as standard of care, while new tools identify novel risk markers that were unrecognized in past decades. Recent work suggests that nearly 10% of a cohort of patients with chronic/end stage kidney disease had an identifiable genetic etiology, many whose original cause of renal disease was either unknown or misdiagnosed. Some also had an incidentally found genetic variant, unrelated to their nephropathy, but medically actionable. These patterns illustrate the substantial potential for genetic testing to better guide the selection of living donors and recipients, but guidance on the proper application and interpretation of novel technologies is in its infancy. In this review, we examine the utility of genetic testing in various kidney conditions, discuss risks and unresolved challenges. Suggested algorithms in the context of related and unrelated donation are offered.Genetic testing is a rapidly evolving strategy for the evaluation of candidates for living donor transplantation and their potential donors that has potential to improve risk assessment and optimize the safety of donation."
"35757777","On Genetic Correlation Estimation With Summary Statistics From Genome-Wide Association Studies.","J Am Stat Assoc","Cross-trait polygenic risk score (PRS) method has gained popularity for assessing genetic correlation of complex traits using summary statistics from biobank-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS). However, empirical evidence has shown a common bias phenomenon that highly significant cross-trait PRS can only account for a very small amount of genetic variance (R2can be < 1%) in independent testing GWAS. The aim of this paper is to investigate and address the bias phenomenon of cross-trait PRS in numerous GWAS applications. We show that the estimated genetic correlation can be asymptotically biased toward zero. A consistent cross-trait PRS estimator is then proposed to correct such asymptotic bias. In addition, we investigate whether or not SNP screening by GWASp-values can lead to improved estimation and show the effect of overlapping samples among GWAS. We analyze GWAS summary statistics of reaction time and brain structural magnetic resonance imaging-based features measured in the Pediatric Imaging, Neurocognition, and Genetics study. We find that the raw cross-trait PRS estimators heavily underestimate the genetic similarity between cognitive function and human brain structures (meanR2= 1.32%), whereas the bias-corrected estimators uncover the moderate degree of genetic overlap between these closely related heritable traits (meanR2= 22.42%).

"35741803","How Variation in Risk Allele Output and Gene Interactions Shape the Genetic Architecture of Schizophrenia.","Genes (Basel)","Schizophrenia is a highly heritable polygenic psychiatric disorder. Characterization of its genetic architecture may lead to a better understanding of the overall burden of risk variants and how they determine susceptibility to disease. A major goal of this project is to develop a modeling approach to compare and quantify the relative effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), copy number variants (CNVs) and other factors. We derived a mathematical model for the various genetic contributions based on the probability of expressing a combination of risk variants at a frequency that matched disease prevalence. The model included estimated risk variant allele outputs (VAOs) adjusted for population allele frequency. We hypothesized that schizophrenia risk genes would be more interactive than random genes and we confirmed this relationship. Gene-gene interactions may cause network ripple effects that spread and amplify small individual effects of risk variants. The modeling revealed that the number of risk alleles required to achieve the threshold for susceptibility will be determined by the average functional locus output (FLO) associated with a risk allele, the risk allele frequency (RAF), the number of protective variants present and the extent of gene interactions within and between risk loci. The model can account for the quantitative impact of protective variants as well as CNVs on disease susceptibility. The fact that non-affected individuals must carry a non-trivial burden of risk alleles suggests that genetic susceptibility will inevitably reach the threshold for schizophrenia at a recurring frequency in the population."

Thus far, the molecular mechanism underlying rapid antler growth has not been properly elucidated, and key genes driving this growth rate have not been fully identified. In this study, based on the newly assembled high-quality sika deer genome, we conducted an integrated analysis of genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) using genome resequencing data from our previous GWAS, with weight and transcriptome sequencing data of faster- vs. slower-growing antlers of sika deer. The expressions of key genes were verified using Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per Million fragments mapped (FPKM) in different tissue zones of the antler growth center, different types of sika deer tissues and antler tissues collected from faster and slower growth rates. The results show that a total of 49 genes related to antler growth rate were identified, and most of those genes were enriched in theIGF1RandLOXmodules. The gene regulation network of antler growth rate through theIGF1Rpathway was constructed. In conclusion, the integration of GWAS and WGCNA analyses had great advantages in identifying regulatory genes of complex antler growth traits over using singular methods individually, and we believe that our findings in the present study can provide further insight into unveiling the mechanism underlying extraordinary fast antler growth rate in particular, as well as the regulatory mechanism of rapid tissue proliferation in general."

Uncovering the genetic basis of complex, quantitative traits such as starvation resistance is technically challenging. We developed a synthetic-population (re)sequencing approach using molecular inversion probes (MIP-seq) to measure relative fitness during and after larval starvation inCaenorhabditis elegans. We applied this competitive assay to 100 genetically diverse, sequenced, wild strains, revealing natural variation in starvation resistance. We confirmed that the most starvation-resistant strains survive and recover from starvation better than the most starvation-sensitive strains using standard assays. We performed genome-wide association (GWA) with the MIP-seq trait data and identified three quantitative trait loci (QTL) for starvation resistance, and we created near isogenic lines (NILs) to validate the effect of these QTL on the trait. These QTL contain numerous candidate genes including several members of the Insulin/EGF Receptor-L Domain (irld) family. We used genome editing to show that four differentirldgenes have modest effects on starvation resistance. Natural variants ofirld-39andirld-52affect starvation resistance, and increased resistance of theirld-39; irld-52double mutant depends ondaf-16/FoxO. DAF-16/FoxO is a widely conserved transcriptional effector of insulin/IGF signaling (IIS), and these results suggest that IRLD proteins modify IIS, although they may act through other mechanisms as well.

We identified 6,778,286cis-eQTL variant-gene transcript (eGene) pairs atp < 5x10- 8(2,855,111 uniquecis-eQTL variants and 15,982 unique eGenes) and 1,469,754trans-eQTL variant-eGene pairs atp < 1e-12 (526,056 uniquetrans-eQTL variants and 7,233 unique eGenes). In addition, 442,379cis-eQTL variants were associated with expression of 1518 long non-protein coding RNAs (lncRNAs). Gene Ontology (GO) analyses revealed that the top GO terms forcis-eGenes are enriched for immune functions (FDR < 0.05). Thecis-eQTL variants are enriched for SNPs reported to be associated with 815 traits in prior GWAS, including cardiovascular disease risk factors. As proof of concept, we used this eQTL resource in conjunction with genetic variants from public GWAS databases in causal inference testing (e.g., COVID-19 severity). After Bonferroni correction, Mendelian randomization analyses identified putative causal associations of 60 eGenes with systolic blood pressure, 13 genes with coronary artery disease, and seven genes with COVID-19 severity.

These low estimates may call into question the prospects of continued progress in genetic discovery for AD within the spectrum of common variants. We highlight dramatic downward biases in previous methods, and we validate a novel method for the estimation of SNP heritability via integration of GWAS and GWAX summary data. We apply our method to investigate the genetic architecture of AD using GWAX from UK Biobank and direct case-control GWAS from the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP). We estimate the liability scale common variant SNP heritability of Clinical AD outside of APOE region at ~7-11%, and we project the corresponding estimate for AD pathology to be up to approximately 23%. We estimate that nearly 90% of common variant SNP heritability of Clinical AD exists outside the APOE region. Rare variants not tagged in standard GWAS may account for additional variance. Our results indicate that, while GWAX for AD in UK Biobank may result in greater attenuation of genetic effects beyond that conventionally assumed, it does not introduce appreciable contamination of signal by genetically distinct traits relative to direct case-control GWAS in IGAP. Genetic risk for AD represents a strong effect of APOE superimposed upon a highly polygenic background."

The fact that whether they share a common genetic etiology remains largely unknown. We explored the shared genetics and causality between AD and SRPs by using high-definition likelihood (HDL), cross-phenotype association study (CPASSOC), transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS), and bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) in summary-level data for AD (N= 455,258) and summary-level data for seven SRPs (sample size ranges from 359,916 to 1,331,010). AD shared a strong genetic basis with insomnia (rg= 0.20;p= 9.70 × 10-5), snoring (rg= 0.13;p= 2.45 × 10-3), and sleep duration (rg= -0.11;p= 1.18 × 10-3). The CPASSOC identifies 31 independent loci shared between AD and SRPs, including four novel shared loci. Functional analysis and the TWAS showed shared genes were enriched in liver, brain, breast, and heart tissues and highlighted the regulatory roles of immunological disorders, very-low-density lipoprotein particle clearance, triglyceride-rich lipoprotein particle clearance, chylomicron remnant clearance, and positive regulation of T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity pathways. Protein-protein interaction analysis identified three potential drug target genes (APOE,MARK4, andHLA-DRA) that interacted with known FDA-approved drug target genes. The CPASSOC and TWAS demonstrated three regions 11p11.2, 6p22.3, and 16p11.2 may account for the shared basis between AD and sleep duration or snoring. MR showed insomnia had a causal effect on AD (ORIVW= 1.02,PIVW= 6.7 × 10-6), and multivariate MR suggested a potential role of sleep duration and major depression in this association. Our findings provide strong evidence of shared genetics and causation between AD and sleep abnormalities and advance our understanding of the genetic overlap between them. Identifying shared drug targets and molecular pathways can be beneficial for treating AD and sleep disorders more efficiently.Copyright © 2022 Chen, Wang, Huang and Jia."

Synthetic approaches permit controlled manipulation of both endogenous and fully engineered systems, providing a flexible platform for investigating causal mechanismsin vivo. Combining synthetic approaches with multi-level phenotyping (phenomics) will supply a detailed, quantitative characterization of how internal and external stimuli shape the morphology and behaviour of living organisms.

"35634922","How does genetic architecture affect eco-evolutionary dynamics? A theoretical perspective.","Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci","Recent studies have revealed the importance of feedbacks between contemporary rapid evolution (i.e. evolution that occurs through changes in allele frequencies) and ecological dynamics. Despite its inherent interdisciplinary nature, however, studies on eco-evolutionary feedbacks have been mostly ecological and tended to focus on adaptation at the phenotypic level without considering the genetic architecture of evolutionary processes. In empirical studies, researchers have often compared ecological dynamics when the focal species under selection has a single genotype with dynamics when it has multiple genotypes. In theoretical studies, common approaches are models of quantitative traits where mean trait values change adaptively along the fitness gradient and Mendelian traits with two alleles at a single locus. On the other hand, it is well known that genetic architecture can affect short-term evolutionary dynamics in population genetics. Indeed, recent theoretical studies have demonstrated that genetic architecture (e.g. the number of loci, linkage disequilibrium and ploidy) matters in eco-evolutionary dynamics (e.g. evolutionary rescue where rapid evolution prevents extinction and population cycles driven by (co)evolution). I propose that theoretical approaches will promote the synthesis of functional genomics and eco-evolutionary dynamics through models that combine population genetics and ecology as well as nonlinear time-series analyses using emerging big data.

Despite the ongoing vaccination program, treating COVID-19 remains a high priority; thus, a better understanding of the disease is urgently needed. Initially, susceptibility was associated with age, sex, and other prior existing comorbidities. However, as these conditions alone could not explain the highly variable clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the attention was shifted toward the identification of the genetic basis of COVID-19. Thanks to international collaborations like The COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative, it became possible the elucidation of numerous genetic markers that are not only likely to help in explaining the varied clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients but can also guide the development of novel diagnostics and therapeutics. Within this framework, this review delineates GWAS and Burden test as traditional methodologies employed so far for the discovery of the human genetic basis of COVID-19, with particular attention to recently emerged predictive models such as the post-Mendelian model. A summary table with the main genome-wide significant genomic loci is provided.

The identified associations made it possible to identify the causal risk factors underlying diseases and investigate the causal relationships among complex traits through Mendelian randomization. Mendelian randomization is a form of instrumental variable analysis that uses SNP associations from genome-wide association studies as instruments to study and uncover causal relationships between complex traits. By leveraging SNP genotypes as instrumental variables, or proxies, for the exposure complex trait, investigators can tease out causal effects from observational data, provided that necessary assumptions are satisfied. We discuss below the development of Mendelian randomization methods in parallel with the growth of genome-wide association studies.

Epigenetic processes that regulate gene expression, such as DNA methylation, have emerged as a promising molecular system in the search for both biomarkers and mechanisms to address this challenge. In this Current Opinion, we discuss the relevance of epigenetics (specifically DNA methylation) for ADHD research and clinical practice, starting with the current state of knowledge, what challenges we have yet to overcome, and what the future may hold in terms of methylation-based applications for personalized medicine in ADHD. We conclude that the field of epigenetics and ADHD is promising but is still in its infancy, and the potential for transformative translational applications remains a distant goal.

However, the evaluation of drug-responsive cells based exclusively on morphological information is challenging, especially in cases of morphologically heterogeneous cells or a small subset of drug-responsive cells. We developed a novel label-free cell sub-population analysis method called ""in silico FOCUS (in silico analysis of featured-objects concentrated by anomaly discrimination from unit space)"" to enable robust phenotypic screening of morphologically heterogeneous spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) model cells. This method with the anomaly discrimination concept can sensitively evaluate drug-responsive cells as morphologically anomalous cells through in silico cytometric analysis. As this algorithm requires only morphological information of control cells for training, no labeling or drug administration experiments are needed. The responses of SBMA model cells to dihydrotestosterone revealed that in silico FOCUS can identify the characteristics of a small sub-population with drug-responsive phenotypes to facilitate robust drug response profiling. The phenotype classification model confirmed with high accuracy the SBMA-rescuing effect of pioglitazone using morphological information alone.

Second, we established a hierarchy of gene clusters from sc-RNAseq data, devised an algorithm to reduce the gene cluster hierarchy to a compact structure, and characterized the gene clusters with functional enrichment and heterogeneity. Third, we developed an algorithm to align the gene cluster hierarchies from multiple datasets to a small number of meta gene clusters. By applying these methods to nine cancer sc-RNAseq datasets, we discovered that cancer cell transcriptomes were more homogeneous within tumors than the accompanying normal cells. Furthermore, many gene clusters from the nine datasets were aligned to two large meta gene clusters, which had high and low heterogeneity and were enriched with distinct functions. Finally, we found the homogeneous meta gene cluster retained stronger expression coherence and associations with survival times in bulk level RNAseq data than the heterogeneous meta gene cluster, yet the combinatorial expression patterns of breast cancer subtypes in bulk level data were not preserved in single-cell data. The inference outcomes derived from nine cancer sc-RNAseq datasets provide insights about the contributing factors for transcriptomic heterogeneity of cancer cells and complex relations between bulk level and single-cell RNAseq data. They demonstrate the utility of our methods to enable a comprehensive characterization of co-expressed gene clusters in a wide range of sc-RNAseq data in cancers and beyond.© 2022.

Here, we use the theory of dynamical systems to support the design of oscillatory systems based on epigenetic control elements. Specifically, we use results that extend the Poincaré-Bendixson theorem for monotone control systems that are coupled to a negative feedback circuit. The methodology is applied to a synthetic epigenetic memory system based on DNA methylation that serves as a monotone control system, which is coupled to a negative feedback. This system is generally able to show sustained oscillations according to its structure; however, a first experimental implementation showed that fine-tuning of several parameters is required. We provide design support by exploring the experimental design space using systems-theoretic analysis of a computational model."
"35941107","The psychiatric risk gene BRD1 modulates mitochondrial bioenergetics by transcriptional regulation.","Transl Psychiatry","Bromodomain containing 1 (BRD1) encodes an epigenetic regulator that controls the expression of genetic networks linked to mental illness. BRD1 is essential for normal brain development and its role in psychopathology has been demonstrated in genetic and preclinical studies. However, the neurobiology that bridges its molecular and neuropathological effects remains poorly explored. Here, using publicly available datasets, we find that BRD1 targets nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial proteins in cell lines and that modulation of BRD1 expression, irrespective of whether it is downregulation or upregulation of one or the other existing BRD1 isoforms (BRD1-L and BRD1-S), leads to distinct shifts in the expression profile of these genes. We further show that the expression of nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial proteins is negatively correlated with the expression of BRD1 mRNA during human brain development. In accordance, we identify the key gate-keeper of mitochondrial metabolism, Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) among BRD1's co-transcription factors and provide evidence that BRD1 acts as a co-repressor of PPAR-mediated transcription. Lastly, when using quantitative PCR, mitochondria-targeted fluorescent probes, and the Seahorse XFe96 Analyzer, we demonstrate that modulation of BRD1 expression in cell lines alters mitochondrial physiology (mtDNA content and mitochondrial mass), metabolism (reducing power), and bioenergetics (among others, basal, maximal, and spare respiration) in an expression level- and isoform-dependent manner. Collectively, our data suggest that BRD1 is a transcriptional regulator of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins and that disruption of BRD1's genomic actions alters mitochondrial functions. This may be the mechanism underlying the cellular and atrophic changes of neurons previously associated with BRD1 deficiency and suggests that mitochondrial dysfunction may be a possible link between genetic variation in BRD1 and psychopathology in humans.© 2022.

However, the X and Y chromosomes harbor an identical gene content of 950 genes each. In this study, we conducted comparative analyses of methylome and transcriptome of genetic males and genetic females before gonadal differentiation to provide insights into the mechanisms of sex determination. Differentially methylated CpG sites (DMCs) were predominantly identified on the sex chromosome, most notably within the sex determination region (SDR), although the overall methylation profiles across the entire genome were similar between genetic males and females. The drastic differences in methylation were located within the SDR at nucleotide position 14.0-20.3 Mb of the sex chromosome, making this region an epigenetically marked locus within the sex determination region. Most of the differentially methylated CpG sites were hypermethylated in females and hypomethylated in males, suggesting potential involvement of methylation modification in sex determination in channel catfish. Along with the differential methylation in the SDR, a number of differentially expressed genes within the SDR were also identified between genetic males and females, making them potential candidate genes for sex determination and differentiation in channel catfish."

Epigenome engineering techniques enable direct testing of the effect of induced DNA methylation on endogenous promoters; however, the downstream effects have not yet been comprehensively assessed.Here, we simultaneously induce methylation at thousands of promoters in human cells using an engineered zinc finger-DNMT3A fusion protein, enabling us to test the effect of forced DNA methylation upon transcription, chromatin accessibility, histone modifications, and DNA methylation persistence after the removal of the fusion protein. We find that transcriptional responses to DNA methylation are highly context-specific, including lack of repression, as well as cases of increased gene expression, which appears to be driven by the eviction of methyl-sensitive transcriptional repressors. Furthermore, we find that some regulatory networks can override DNA methylation and that promoter methylation can cause alternative promoter usage. DNA methylation deposited at promoter and distal regulatory regions is rapidly erased after removal of the zinc finger-DNMT3A fusion protein, in a process combining passive and TET-mediated demethylation. Finally, we demonstrate that induced DNA methylation can exist simultaneously on promoter nucleosomes that possess the active histone modification H3K4me3, or DNA bound by the initiated form of RNA polymerase II.These findings have important implications for epigenome engineering and demonstrate that the response of promoters to DNA methylation is more complex than previously appreciated.© 2022.

Pyrosequencing was performed to detect the changes in VIPR1 promoter methylation level in HCC cells treated with a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DAC). Chromatin immunoprecipitation was used to evaluate the binding ability of AP-2αto VIPR1 promoter. Western blotting was used to assess the effect of AP-2αknockdown on VIPR1 expression and examine the differential expression of VIPR1 in the two cell lines. The effects of VIPR1 overexpression and knockdown on the proliferation, cell cycle and apoptosis of HCC cells were analyzed using CCK8 assay and flow cytometry. We also observed the growth of HCC xenograft with lentivirus-mediated over-expression of VIPR1 in nude mice.Compared with the wild-type VIPR1 promoter group, co-transfection with the vector carrying two promoter mutations and the AP-2α-over-expressing plasmid obviously restored the luciferase activity in HCC cells (P< 0.05). DAC treatment of the cells significantly decreased the methylation level of VIPR1 promoter and inhibited the binding of AP-2αto VIPR1 promoter (P< 0.01). The HCC cells with AP-2αknockdown showed increased VIPR1 expression, which was lower in Huh7 cells than in Hep3B cells. VIPR1 overexpression in HCC cells caused significant cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase (P< 0.01), promoted cell apoptosis (P< 0.001), and inhibited cell proliferation (P< 0.001), while VIPR1 knockdown produced the opposite effects. In the tumor-bearing nude mice, VIPR1 overexpression in the HCC cells significantly suppressed the increase of tumor volume (P< 0.001) and weight (P< 0.05).VIPR1 promoter methylation in HCC promotes the binding of AP-2αand inhibits VIPR1 expression, while VIPR1 overexpression causes cell cycle arrest, promotes cell apoptosis, and inhibits cell proliferation and tumor growth."

"35812421","3D Genome Organization as an Epigenetic Determinant of Transcription Regulation in T Cells.","Front Immunol","In the heart of innate and adaptive immunity lies the proper spatiotemporal development of several immune cell lineages. Multiple studies have highlighted the necessity of epigenetic and transcriptional regulation in cell lineage specification. This mode of regulation is mediated by transcription factors and chromatin remodelers, controlling developmentally essential gene sets. The core of transcription and epigenetic regulation is formulated by different epigenetic modifications determining gene expression. Apart from ""classic"" epigenetic modifications, 3D chromatin architecture is also purported to exert fundamental roles in gene regulation. Chromatin conformation both facilitates cell-specific factor binding at specified regions and is in turn modified as such, acting synergistically. The interplay between global and tissue-specific protein factors dictates the epigenetic landscape of T and innate lymphoid cell (ILC) lineages. The expression of global genome organizers such as CTCF, YY1, and the cohesin complexes, closely cooperate with tissue-specific factors to exert cell type-specific gene regulation. Special AT-rich binding protein 1 (SATB1) is an important tissue-specific genome organizer and regulator controlling both long- and short-range chromatin interactions. Recent indications point to SATB1's cooperation with the aforementioned factors, linking global to tissue-specific gene regulation. Changes in 3D genome organization are of vital importance for proper cell development and function, while disruption of this mechanism can lead to severe immuno-developmental defects. Newly emerging data have inextricably linked chromatin architecture deregulation to tissue-specific pathophysiological phenotypes.

"35799193","Toward a base-resolution panorama of the in vivo impact of cytosine methylation on transcription factor binding.","Genome Biol","While methylation of CpG dinucleotides is traditionally considered antagonistic to the DNA-binding activity of most transcription factors (TFs), recent in vitro studies have revealed a more complex picture, suggesting that over a third of TFs may preferentially bind to methylated sequences. Expanding these in vitro observations to in vivo TF binding preferences is challenging since the effect of methylation of individual CpG sites cannot be easily isolated from the confounding effects of DNA accessibility and regional DNA methylation. Thus, in vivo methylation preferences of most TFs remain uncharacterized.We introduce joint accessibility-methylation-sequence (JAMS) models, which connect the strength of the binding signal observed in ChIP-seq to the DNA accessibility of the binding site, regional methylation level, DNA sequence, and base-resolution cytosine methylation. We show that JAMS models quantitatively explain TF occupancy, recapitulate cell type-specific TF binding, and have high positive predictive value for identification of TFs affected by intra-motif methylation. Analysis of 2209 ChIP-seq experiments results in high-confidence JAMS models for 260 TFs, revealing a negative association between in vivo TF occupancy and intra-motif methylation for 45% of studied TFs, as well as 16 TFs that are predicted to bind to methylated sites, including 11 novel methyl-binding TFs mostly from the multi-zinc finger family.Our study substantially expands the repertoire of in vivo methyl-binding TFs, but also suggests that most TFs that prefer methylated CpGs in vitro present themselves as methylation agnostic in vivo, potentially due to the balancing effect of competition with other methyl-binding proteins.© 2022.

In this study, we report the development of a recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA)-based CpG methylation level sensing system on G-quadruplex (G4) and intercalated motif (i-motif)-forming regions, which are stabilized by CpG methylation. This detection system is based on the principle that DNA polymerase is stalled at the methylated G4 and i-motif-forming region, which results in a decrease in the initial elongation efficiency of RPA. This reduction in turn affects the onset of amplification depending on the extent of CpG methylation; therefore, the methylation level is quantified by RPA. We demonstrate that the onset of amplification was delayed by CpG methylation when PCR products containing the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) G4 and i-motif-forming region were used as the template. Furthermore, onset of amplification was delayed with the increase in CpG methylation of the VEGF region on genomic DNA. These results demonstrate that the sensing system is capable of directly detecting the methylation level at a constant temperature (39 °C) within 30 min without performing bisulfite conversion or affinity capture of methylated DNA.© 2022.

Chalcone isomerase (CHI) gene encodes a key enzyme in theLithocarpus polystachyusRehd flavonoid pathway, and the expression ofL. polystachyus CHI(LpCHI) is closely related to the synthesis of flavonoid metabolites. In this study, we analyzed the DNA methylation site of theLpCHIpromoter and its effect on gene expression and metabolite accumulation. The proportions of three types ofLpCHIpromoter DNA methylation are 7.5%, 68.75%, 18.75%, determined by bisulfite sequencing. Transcriptome sequencing shows thatLpCHIis strongly up-regulated inLpCHIpromoter methylation Type A but down-regulated inLpCHIpromoter methylation Type B and Type C. The expression ofLpCHIshows no significant difference between Type B and Type C. Moreover, nine kinds of differentially expressed transcription factors (DETFs) bind to seven CpG-sites of theLpCHIpromoter region to regulateLpCHIexpression. The results of metabolomics show that differentially accumulated flavonoids are higher inLpCHIpromoter methylation Type A than inLpCHIpromoter methylation Type B and Type C. Additionally, a positive correlation was found between theLpCHIexpression and flavonoids accumulation. These results show that the effect of CpG site-specificity on gene transcription is great than that of overall promoter DNA methylation on gene transcription.

In cooperative TF-TF binding, two transcription factors bind onto a shared DNA binding site as a pair. Previous work has demonstrated pairwise TF-TF-DNA interactions with position weight matrices (PWMs), which may however not sufficiently take into account the complexity and flexibility of pairwise binding.We propose two random forest (RF) methods for joint TF-TF binding site prediction: ComBind and JointRF. We train models with previously published large-scale CAP-SELEX DNA libraries, which comprise DNA sequences enriched for binding of a selected TF pair. JointRF builds a random forest with sub-sequences selected from CAP-SELEX DNA reads with previously proposed pairwise PWM. JointRF outperforms (area under receiver operating characteristics curve, AUROC, 0.75) the current state-of-the-art method i.e. orientation and spacing specific pairwise PWMs (AUROC 0.59). Thus, JointRF may be utilized to improve prediction accuracy for pre-determined binding preferences. However, pairwise TF binding is currently considered flexible; a pair may bind DNA with different orientations and amounts of dinucleotide gaps or overlap between the two motifs. Thus, we developed ComBind, which utilizes random forests by considering simultaneously multiple orientations and spacings of the two factors. Our approach outperforms (AUROC 0.78) PWMs, as well as JointRF (p<0.00195). ComBind provides an approach for predicting TF-TF binding sites without prior knowledge on pairwise binding preferences. However, more research is needed to assess ComBind eligibility for practical applications.Random forest is well suited for modeling pairwise TF-TF-DNA binding specificities, and ComBind provides an improvement to pairwise binding site prediction accuracy.© 2022.

The mean global methylation in five MDS patients showed no significant difference compared with the four controls. In depth, a total of 1,459 differentially methylated fragments, including 759 hypermethylated and 700 hypomethylated fragments, were identified between MDS patients and controls.

Modifications to the epigenome are potentially reversible, making them a promising therapeutic approach to mitigate environmental exposure effects on human health. This review details currently available genome and epigenome editing technologies and highlights ncRNA, including piRNA, as potential tools for targeted epigenome editing. RECENT FINDINGS: Zinc finger nuclease (ZFN), transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN), and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) associated nuclease (CRISPR/Cas) research has significantly advanced genome editing technology, with broad promise in genetic research and targeted therapies. Initial epigenome-directed therapies relied on global modification and suffered from limited specificity. Adapted from current genome editing tools, zinc finger protein (ZFP), TALE, and CRISPR/nuclease-deactivated Cas (dCas) systems now confer locus-specific epigenome editing, with promising applicability in the field of environmental health sciences. However, high incidence of off-target effects and time taken for screening limit their use. FUTURE DEVELOPMENT: ncRNA serve as a versatile biomarker with well-characterized regulatory mechanisms that can easily be adapted to edit the epigenome. For instance, the transposon silencing mechanism of germline PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNA) could be engineered to specifically methylate a given gene, overcoming pitfalls of current global modifiers. Future developments in epigenome editing technologies will inform risk assessment through mechanistic investigation and serve as potential modes of intervention to mitigate environmentally induced adverse health outcomes later in life.© 2022.

The neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), a simple indicator, has been shown to be a novel inflammatory marker. The objective of our study was to determine whether the NLR could be a potential indicator for discriminating spinal tuberculosis (STB) from pyogenic spinal infection (PSI).We compared the clinical and laboratory characteristics of 146 patients diagnosed with STB and 60 participants with PSI from the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University. The NLR's diagnostic ability for differential diagnosis was assessed and compared to other hematological indicators, including the platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR).The NLR in STB patients was considerably lower than that in PSI patients [3.85 (2.70-5.71) vs. 10.82 (6.79-17.62), P < 0.001]. An NLR of 6.742 was proposed as an optimal cutoff value for distinguishing patients with STB from those with PSI (sensitivity 78.33%, specificity 83.56%).

Applying appropriate ventilation strategies based on patients' individual situations has a direct impact upon patients' outcome. The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) has been shown to predict the early requirement of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Our study aimed to investigate the relationship between baseline NLR and IMV in ARDS.A retrospective study was performed on patients who were diagnosed with ARDS using the Berlin definition and admitted to the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University from 2017 to 2022. Clinical data within 24 h after the ARDS diagnosis were collected from the medical record system. Based on the ventilation strategies during hospitalization, patients were divided into three groups and their clinical characteristics were compared. Furthermore, logistic regression analysis was used to screen the independent risk factors for IMV. STROBE checklist was used for this manuscript.520 ARDS patients were included and the median NLR value in IMV group was significantly higher than that of other groups (P< 0.001). NLR was significantly associated with the requirement of IMV in ARDS patients (OR, 1.042; 95% CI, 1.025-1.060;P< 0.001), other independent risk factors included PaO2/FiO2, Hb, lactate, and use of vasoactive drugs (allP< 0.05). Moreover, we found that the duration of IMV was longer in patients with high NLR (8[IQR, 3-13], 10[IQR, 6-16], respectively,P=0.025).Our results revealed that high baseline NLR level was significantly correlated with an increased risk of IMV in patients with ARDS. Furthermore, higher NLR was associated with prolonged duration of IMV in patients with ARDS.Copyright © 2022 Lijuan Yang et al."

Barriers to broad clinical application.","Int Urol Nephrol","Hospital-acquired acute kidney injury is a heterogeneous clinical syndrome that has multiple aetiologies, widely differing pathogeneses, variable clinical manifestations, and diverse outcomes. There is a persistent unmet need for novel biomarkers that offer timely diagnosis and accurate prediction of the short- and long-term sequelae of acute kidney injury (AKI). AKI is associated with systemic and intrarenal inflammation. The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), a readily available marker of inflammation and physiologic stress, has gained increasing attention as universal marker in AKI patients. Numerous retrospective cross-sectional studies assessed the clinical usefulness of this test in high-risk patients with a known time point of the renal injury (surgery, radiological procedures). Strong associations have been demonstrated between high NLR and early onset, progression or recovery of AKI, and the in-hospital and post-discharge mortality of these patients. However, the results were contradictory. The huge heterogeneity of reporting concerning the timing and numbers of blood samples, calculation of the optimal cut-off and the demographic and clinical features of the patient cohorts were confounders. Uncertainty in the optimal cut-off values defining high NLR, the lack of prospective validation of this test and limited understanding of the strengths of associations between NLR and clinical outcomes were further barriers for the clinical adoption of NLR as a valid diagnostic and prognostic test in AKI patients.© 2022.

We present our perspectives for the therapeutic management of sepsis through a four-way approach: (1) infection control through immune enhancement; (2) immune suppression during the initial hyper-inflammatory phase; (3) balanced immune-modulation to counter the later immune-paralysis phase; and (4) advantageous effects on metabolic and coagulation parameters throughout. COVID-19 is a virus-triggered, accelerated sepsis-like reaction that is associated with the rapid progress of an inflammatory cascade involving a cytokine storm and multiorgan failure. Here, we discuss the potential of the biological response modifiers, β-glucans (BRMGs), in the management of sepsis based on their beneficial effects on inflammatory-immune events in COVID-19 clinical studies. In COVID-19 patients, apart from metabolic regulation, BRMGs, derived from a black yeast,Aureobasidium pullulansstrain AFO-202, have been reported to stimulate immune responses. BRMGs, produced by another strain (N-163) ofA. pullulans, have been implicated in the beneficial regulation of inflammatory markers and immunity, namely IL-6, C-reactive protein (CRP), D-Dimer, ferritin, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), lymphocyte-to-C-reactive protein ratio (LCR), leucocyte-to-C-reactive protein ratio (LeCR), and leukocyte-to-IL-6 ratio (LeIR). Agents such as these β-glucans, which are safe as they have been widely consumed by humans for decades, have potential as adjuncts for the prevention and management of sepsis as they exert their beneficial effects across the spectrum of processes and factors involved in sepsis pathology, including, but not limited to, metabolism, infection, inflammation, immune modulation, immune enhancement, and gut microbiota.Copyright © 2022 Preethy, Raghavan, Dedeepiya, Surya Prakash, Ikewaki, Ikeue, Nagataki, Iwasaki, Senthilkumar and Abraham."

The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) are used as markers for systemic inflammation. In this study, the primary aim was to determine the NLR and PLR ratios in smokers. Secondly, we aimed to evaluate the relationship between the level of addiction and carbon monoxide (CO) level in the expiratory air, with these ratios.This study was designed as a single-center, cross-sectional study. It was conducted with chronic smokers aged 18-40 years, without known health problems, visiting the smoking cessation outpatient clinic of a tertiary hospital. Sociodemographic data and smoking characteristics were collected, and exhaled CO levels were measured. Complete blood count (CBC) results were recorded, including NLR and PLR.The mean age of 247 patients was 31.2±6.1 years, with the majority of patients (68.4%) being male. While the mean value of CO was 11.6±5.6 ppm, 42.1% of cases had a high level of addiction. A statistically significant relationship was found between NLR and addiction levels, the CO level, and the amount of smoking in cigarettes/day and packs/year (all p=0.000). A statistically significant relationship was also found between PLR and addiction levels, CO level, cigarettes/day and packs/year (p=0.000, p=0.03, p=0.000, p=0.003, respectively).We found that as the level of addiction, cigarette use, and exhaled CO levels increased in smokers, NLR and PLR increased.

Patients with prior antibiotics treatment (156), with hematological diseases (15), with negative computerized tomography scan (CTS) for stone disease (473) or with no available laboratory findings (1750) were excluded. A ureteral double J stent (DJS) was inserted in case of ongoing pain, fever, sepsis, single kidney and elevated blood creatinine levels concomitant with hydronephrosis. A cut-off value of 2.1 NLR was determined to stratify and to compare patients using multivariable logistic regression models. A locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOWESS) plot was also applied to show the relationship between NLR and predicted probability for DJS insertion.Thirteen-thousand and 493 patients with a mean age of 42.7 years (30% females and 70% males) were included in the study. Five-hundred and 57 patients (4.1%) underwent early DJS insertion: 5.3% vs. 1.5% of patients with high vs. low NLR, respectively, (p<0.001). High NLR was significantly associated with longer hospitalization time, admission to the intensive care unit and overall mortality within a month from admission (p<0.05). LOWESS plot showed that NLR value >2.1 escalates progressively the probability for DJS insertion.A high NLR is associated with the need for early internal DJS insertion due to urolithiasis. The NLR is easily calculated from simple blood tests and based on our results can be used for clinical decision making in patients with renal colic needing renal decompression."

History included diabetes duration, insulin dose and frequency of hypoglycemic attacks. Fundus examination and the simple rapid neuropathy disability score were done. HbA1C, fasting lipids, urinary albumin excretion and complete blood count were measured with assessment of NLR and PLR.NLR was significantly higher (p = 0.008) and PLR was significantly lower (p = 0.007) in children with T1D than controls. NLR was positively correlated while PLR was negatively correlated with HbA1C, diabetes duration, fasting cholesterol, triglycerides and LDL. NLR was significantly higher (p < 0.001) and PLR was significantly lower (p = 0.005) in children with microvascular complications than those without. Moreover, multivariate logistic regression revealed that microvascular complications were independently associated with NLR (p = 0.013) and PLR (p = 0.004).Children with T1D had significantly higher NLR and lower PLR compared to controls. These changes were more evident in those with diabetic microvascular complications than those without. Furthermore, NLR was positively correlated and PLR was negatively correlated to HbA1C, diabetes duration and hyperlipidemia. Hence, NLR and PLR can be a potential indicator for the risk of development of diabetic microvascular complications in children with T1D.© The Japan Diabetes Society 2022."

Stem cell properties result from the complex integration of intrinsic, extrinsic, and systemic factors. In this context, diet-induced metabolic changes can have a profound impact on stem cell fate determination, lineage specification and differentiation. The purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive description of the multiple ""non-metabolic"" effects of diet on stem cell functions, including little-known effects such as those on liquid-liquid phase separation and on non-random chromosome segregation (asymmetric division).

Although nowadays people on average live almost as twice as long, we still (and perhaps more than ever) look for new ways to extend our lifespan. During this seemingly endless journey of discovering efficient methods to prolong life, humans were enthusiastic regarding several approaches, one of which is caloric restriction (CR). Where does CR, initially considered universally beneficial for extending both lifespan and health span, stand today? Does a lifelong decrease in food consumption represent one of the secrets of centenarians' long and healthy life? Do we still believe that if we eat less, we will live longer? This review aims to summarize the current literature on CR as a potential life-prolonging intervention in humans and discusses metabolic pathways that underlie this effect."
"35663942","Intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> Signaling and Calcium Release-Activated Calcium Modulator ORAI1 Are Associated With CD4<sup>+</sup> T Lymphocytes in Dairy Cows.","Front Immunol","The nutritional status of dairy cows and the metabolism of specific nutrients are critical regulators of immune cell function. Around the time of parturition, mobilization of body lipid and muscle helps compensate for the decrease in nutrient intake and the increased requirements of the mammary gland for lactation. An end-result of these processes is the marked increase in circulating concentrations of fatty acids (FA), which are a major risk factor for immune dysfunction. In food animal species such as dairy cows, any disturbance in nutritional or immunological homeostasis leads to deleterious feedback loops that can further risk health, efficiency of nutrient use, and compromise availability of safe and nutritious dairy foods for humans. Despite substantial progress with respect to regulation of innate immunity, such knowledge for adaptive immunity is scarce. To help bridge this gap in knowledge, we sought to study the role of calcium release-activated calcium modulator ORAI1 activation in T cells systemic immune functionin vivo. CD4+T cells were isolated from peripheral blood of dairy cows diagnosed as healthy or with ketosis, a common metabolic disorder of FA metabolism. Results revealed that levels of intracellular Ca2+and reactive oxygen species (ROS) along with the abundance of store-operated Ca2+entry (SOCE) moiety increased during ketosis. Further, plasma concentrations of inflammatory cytokines were elevated, the balance of Th17/Treg cells was disrupted, mitochondrial function impaired, and the abundance of mitophagy-related proteins in CD4+T cells altered during ketosis. Molecular characterization of the direct effects of FA was evaluated in CD4+T cells isolated from the spleen of 1-day-old calves. Enhanced supply of FA increased intracellular Ca2+and ROS concentrations, upregulated the abundance of proteins associated with mitochondrial dynamics and ORAI1. Intermediates of mitophagy accumulated and the balance of Th17/Treg cells also was affected by the supply of FA. These negative effects were attenuated by silencing or inhibition of ORAI1 in CD4+T cells. Together, data indicated that physiological states that lead to increases in systemic concentrations of FA could impact adaptive immunity negatively through ORAI1 regulated intracellular Ca2+, ROS balance, and increased effector functions of Th17 cells.Copyright © 2022 Li, Zhang, Yin, Wen, Wang, He, Jiang, Loor, Wang, Yang and Xu."

The molecular mechanisms affected by BTZ in neuronal cells, which result in neuropathy, remain unknown. However, BTZ is unlikely to lead to permanent morphological nerve damage, because neuropathy reverses after discontinuation of treatment, and nerve cells have very limited renewal capacity. We have previously shown that BTZ induces methylation changes in SH-SY5Y cells, which take part in the development of treatment resistance. Here, we hypothesized that BTZ affects the methylomes of mature neurons, and these changes are associated with BTZ neurotoxicity. Thus, we studied methylomes of neuronal cells, differentiated from the LUHMES cell line, after cycles of treatment with BTZ. Our results show that BTZ induces specific methylation changes in mature neurons, which are not present in SH-SY5Y cells after BTZ treatment. These changes appear to affect genes involved in morphogenesis, neurogenesis, and neurotransmission. Furthermore, identified methylation changes are significantly enriched within binding sites of transcription factors previously linked to neuron physiology, including EBF, PAX, DLX, LHX, and HNF family members. Altogether, our results indicate that methylation changes are likely to be involved in BTZ neurotoxicity."

However, it is unclear which family members are essential for cancer progression, and their diverse expression patterns and prognostic values are rarely reported. In this work, we found that the expression levels of hnRNPs were all upregulated in colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) and rectal adenocarcinoma (READ) tissues. Immunohistochemical staining revealed that hnRNPA1, hnRNPA2B1, hnRNPC, hnRNPK, hnRNPR, and hnRNPU are overexpressed in colorectal adenocarcinoma. Additionally, the promoter methylation levels of hnRNPs were significantly elevated or decreased, and multiple genetic alterations of hnRNPs were found in colorectal adenocarcinoma patients. Correlation analysis showed that the expression levels of hnRNPs were positively correlated with each other. Furthermore, we demonstrated that high expressions of hnRNPA1, hnRNPK, hnRNPR, and hnRNPU were associated with better overall survival rates for colorectal adenocarcinoma patients. The co-expression network and functional prediction analysis indicated that hnRNPK/A1/R/U was involved in cellular gene transcription and translation. Moreover, hnRNPK/A1/R/U complex was identified and confirmed by mass spectrometry and co-immunoprecipitation. RNA sequencing analysis revealed that the transcription factor hnRNPK regulated transcription and translation of related genes. Finally, through establishment of stable cell linesin vitro, we verified that hnRNPK was a favorable factor in human colorectal adenocarcinoma which promoted immune cell infiltration and inhibited tumor growth. Our findings illustrate that the hnRNPK/A1/R/U complex is a favorable prognostic biomarker for human colorectal adenocarcinoma. Targeting hnRNPK during transcription and translation could be a promising therapeutic strategy for colorectal adenocarcinoma treatment.Copyright © 2022 Li, Wang, Wan, Ma, Qi and Gu."

However, the molecules and mechanisms regulating DNA methylation remain unclear.The expression of miR-26a-5p in NSCLC cell lines was detected by qPCR and verified in NSCLC tissues from TCGA using Limma R package. CCK-8 assay, plate clone formation assay, flow cytometry, and sphere formation assay were used to detect the cell proliferation, colony formation, cell cycle, and cancer stem cell- (CSC-) like property in NSCLC cell lines. The immunoblotting was used to detect the protein levels of DNMT3A, SFRP1, and Ki67. Global DNA methylation levels and DNA methylation levels of SFRP1 promoter were examined using ELISA and MSP-PCR assay, respectively. The distribution ofβ-catenin was examined using immunofluorescence (IF). Besides, xenograft mouse model was used to investigate the antitumor effects of miR-26a-5p in vivo. The pathology and protein levels were, respectively, detected by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and immunocytochemistry (IHC).The expression of miR-26a-5p was downregulated in the tumor tissues comparted to adjacent normal tissues as well as NSCLC cell lines compared to normal lung epithelial cell (BEAS2B). The overexpression of miR-26a-5p inhibited cell proliferation, colony formation, CSC-like property, and arrested cell cycle at G1 phase. DNMT3A was a target of miR-26a-5p and upregulated DNA methylation on SFRP1 promoter. Mechanistically, miR-26a-5p repressed cell proliferation, colony formation, CSC-like property, and arrested cell cycle at G1 phase by binding DNMT3A to reduce DNA methylation levels of SFRP1 then upregulated SFRP1 expression.

"35661267","SETD2: from chromatin modifier to multipronged regulator of the genome and beyond.","Cell Mol Life Sci","Histone modifying enzymes play critical roles in many key cellular processes and are appealing proteins for targeting by small molecules in disease. However, while the functions of histone modifying enzymes are often linked to epigenetic regulation of the genome, an emerging theme is that these enzymes often also act by non-catalytic and/or non-epigenetic mechanisms. SETD2 (Set2 in yeast) is best known for associating with the transcription machinery and methylating histone H3 on lysine 36 (H3K36) during transcription. This well-characterized molecular function of SETD2 plays a role in fine-tuning transcription, maintaining chromatin integrity, and mRNA processing. Here we give an overview of the various molecular functions and mechanisms of regulation of H3K36 methylation by Set2/SETD2. These fundamental insights are important to understand SETD2's role in disease, most notably in cancer in which SETD2 is frequently inactivated. SETD2 also methylates non-histone substrates such as α-tubulin which may promote genome stability and contribute to the tumor-suppressor function of SETD2. Thus, to understand its role in disease, it is important to understand and dissect the multiple roles of SETD2 within the cell. In this review we discuss how histone methylation by Set2/SETD2 has led the way in connecting histone modifications in active regions of the genome to chromatin functions and how SETD2 is leading the way to showing that we also have to look beyond histones to truly understand the physiological role of an 'epigenetic' writer enzyme in normal cells and in disease.© 2022.

"35544277","The 'Alu-ome' shapes the epigenetic environment of regulatory elements controlling cellular defense.","Nucleic Acids Res","Promoters and enhancers are sites of transcription initiation (TSSs) and carry specific histone modifications, including H3K4me1, H3K4me3, and H3K27ac. Yet, the principles governing the boundaries of such regulatory elements are still poorly characterized. Alu elements are good candidates for a boundary function, being highly abundant in gene-rich regions, while essentially excluded from regulatory elements. Here, we show that the interval ranging from TSS to first upstream Alu, accommodates all H3K4me3 and most H3K27ac marks, while excluding DNA methylation. Remarkably, the average length of these intervals greatly varies in-between tissues, being longer in stem- and shorter in immune-cells. The very shortest TSS-to-first-Alu intervals were observed at promoters active in T-cells, particularly at immune genes, where first-Alus were traversed by RNA polymerase II transcription, while accumulating H3K4me1 signal. Finally, DNA methylation at first-Alus was found to evolve with age, regressing from young to middle-aged, then recovering later in life. Thus, the first-Alus upstream of TSSs appear as dynamic boundaries marking the transition from DNA methylation to active histone modifications at regulatory elements, while also participating in the recording of immune gene transcriptional events by positioning H3K4me1-modified nucleosomes.© The Author(s) 2022.

In fact, currently, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has drawn more attention to this underdiagnosed condition, besides the importance of the nutritional status in shaping immunomodulation, in which minerals, vitamins, or omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (ω-3 PUFA) play an important role. The awareness of nutritional assessment is greater and greater in the patients with depression since antidepressant treatments have such a significant probability of failing. As diet is considered a crucial environmental factor, underlying epigenetic mechanisms that experience an adaptation or consequence on their signaling and expression mechanisms are reviewed.

We examined use of prenatal vitamins in the first month of pregnancy in relation to cord blood and placenta DNA methylation in two prospective pregnancy cohorts: the Early Autism Risk Longitudinal Investigation (EARLI) and Markers of Autism Risk Learning Early Signs (MARBLES) studies.In placenta, prenatal vitamin intake was marginally associated with -0.52% (95% CI -1.04, 0.01) lower mean array-wide DNA methylation in EARLI, and associated with -0.60% (-1.08, -0.13) lower mean array-wide DNA methylation in MARBLES. There was little consistency in the associations between prenatal vitamin intake and single DNA methylation site effect estimates across cohorts and tissues, with only a few overlapping sites with correlated effect estimates. However, the single DNA methylation sites with p-value < 0.01 (EARLI cord nCpGs = 4068, EARLI placenta nCpGs = 3647, MARBLES cord nCpGs = 4068, MARBLES placenta nCpGs = 9563) were consistently enriched in neuronal developmental pathways.Together, our findings suggest that prenatal vitamin intake in the first month of pregnancy may be related to lower placental global DNA methylation and related to DNA methylation in brain-related pathways in both placenta and cord blood.© 2022.

Here, we aim to investigate the genes edited by AS which show differential expression in patients with mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR)/microsatellite instability (MSI).We applied long-read nanopore sequencing to determine the mRNA profiles and screen AS genes using Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) method in ten paired CRC tissues. CRC tissue and plasma samples were used to validate the differential genes with AS using real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR, immunohistochemistry, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.ONT sequencing identified 404 genes were downregulated, and 348 genes were upregulated in MSI cancer tissues compared with microsatellite stability (MSS) cancer tissues. In total, 6,200 AS events were identified in 2,728 mRNA transcripts. WGCNA revealed dMMR/MSI-correlated gene modules, including INHBA and RPL22L1, which were upregulated; conversely, HMGCS2 was downregulated in MSI cancer. Overexpression of RPL22L1, INHBA, and CAPZA1 was further confirmed in CRC tissues. INHBA was found to be associated with tumor lymphatic metastasis. Importantly, the levels of INHBA in CRC plasma were significantly increased compared with those in noncancer plasma. INHBA showed a higher level in dMMR/MSI CRC than in MSS CRC, indicating that INHBA is a useful biomarker.Our results showed that ONT-identified genes provide a pool to explore AS-associated markers for dMMR/MSI CRC. We demonstrated INHBA as a promising signature for clinical application in predicting tumor lymphatic metastasis and screening dMMR/MSI candidates.Copyright © 2022 Hao Qu et al."
"35864305","Peripheral blood DNA methylation profiles predict future development of B-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma.","NPJ Precis Oncol","Lack of accurate methods for early lymphoma detection limits the ability to cure patients. Since patients with Non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) who present with advanced disease have worse outcomes, accurate and sensitive methods for early detection are needed to improve patient care. We developed a DNA methylation-based prediction tool for NHL, based on blood samples collected prospectively from 278 apparently healthy patients who were followed for up to 16 years to monitor for NHL development. A predictive score was developed using machine learning methods in a robust training/validation framework. Our predictive score incorporates CpG DNA methylation at 135 genomic positions, with higher scores predicting higher risk. It was 85% and 78% accurate for identifying patients at risk of developing future NHL, in patients with high or low epigenetic mitotic clock respectively, in a validation cohort. It was also sensitive at detecting active NHL (96.3% accuracy) and healthy status (95.6% accuracy) in additional independent cohorts. Scores optimized for specific NHL subtypes showed significant but lower accuracy for predicting other subtypes. Our score incorporates hyper-methylation of Polycomb and HOX genes, which have roles in NHL development, as well as PAX5 - a master transcriptional regulator of B-cell fate. Subjects with higher risk scores showed higher regulatory T-cells, memory B-cells, but lower naïve T helper lymphocytes fractions in the blood. Future prospective studies will be required to confirm the utility of our signature for managing patients who are at high risk for developing future NHL.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35794707","Systematic evaluation of cell-type deconvolution pipelines for sequencing-based bulk DNA methylomes.","Brief Bioinform","DNA methylation analysis by sequencing is becoming increasingly popular, yielding methylomes at single-base pair and single-molecule resolution. It has tremendous potential for cell-type heterogeneity analysis using intrinsic read-level information. Although diverse deconvolution methods were developed to infer cell-type composition based on bulk sequencing-based methylomes, systematic evaluation has not been performed yet. Here, we thoroughly benchmark six previously published methods: Bayesian epiallele detection, DXM, PRISM, csmFinder+coMethy, ClubCpG and MethylPurify, together with two array-based methods, MeDeCom and Houseman, as a comparison group. Sequencing-based deconvolution methods consist of two main steps, informative region selection and cell-type composition estimation, thus each was individually assessed. With this elaborate evaluation, we aimed to establish which method achieves the highest performance in different scenarios of synthetic bulk samples. We found that cell-type deconvolution performance is influenced by different factors depending on the number of cell types within the mixture. Finally, we propose a best-practice deconvolution strategy for sequencing data and point out limitations that need to be handled. Array-based methods-both reference-based and reference-free-generally outperformed sequencing-based methods, despite the absence of read-level information. This implies that the current sequencing-based methods still struggle with correctly identifying cell-type-specific signals and eliminating confounding methylation patterns, which needs to be handled in future studies.© The Author(s) 2022.

Some of these outcomes have also been shown to be influenced by the use of different IVF culture media and this effect is hypothesised to be mediated epigenetically, e.g. through the methylome. As such, we profiled the umbilical cord blood methylome of IVF neonates that underwent preimplantation embryo development in two different IVF culture media (G5 or HTF), using the Infinium Human Methylation EPIC BeadChip. We found no significant methylation differences between the two groups in terms of: (i) systematic differences at CpG sites or regions, (ii) imprinted sites/genes or birth weight-associated sites, (iii) stochastic differences presenting as DNA methylation outliers or differentially variable sites, and (iv) epigenetic gestational age acceleration.© 2022.

We divided the patients into different complications groups and corresponding non-complication groups. Clinical and biochemical parameters were compared between the two groups. The level of genomic DNA methylation in leukocytes was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.(1) Age, duration of diabetes, creatinine (Cr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), genomic DNA methylation, 24- hour urine total protein (24-hUTP), and intima-media thickness (IMT) were significantly higher in the carotid plaque (CP) group. Waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), body mass index (BMI), estimated glomerular- filtration rate (eGFR), and albumin (Alb) were significantly lower in the CP group. Gender, age and BMI were the influencing factors of CP. (2) Age, duration, Cr, BUN, urinary microalbumin creatinine ratio (UACR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), TCSS, and 24- hUTP were significantly higher in the diabetic retinopathy (DR) group. eGFR, 2h postprandial C- peptide, and Alb were lower in the DR group. Age, duration, Cr, Alb, SBP, and the presence of DN were the influencing factors of DR. (3) Age, duration, HbA1c, BUN, TCSS, SBP, and IMT(R) were significantly higher in the diabetic nephropathy (DN) group. 2h postprandial C-peptide, and Alb were lower in the DN group. HbA1c, BUN, DR, and HBP were the influencing factors of DN. (4) Age, duration, total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein (LDL-C), triglyceride (TG), Cr, BUN, uric acid (UA), and SBP were significantly higher in the diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) group. The level of genomic DNA methylation and eGFR were significantly lower in the DPN group. Age, duration, LDL-C, UA, the presence of DR, and the genomic DNA methylation level were the influencing factors for DPN. Incorporating the level of genomic DNA methylation into the prediction model could improve the ability to predict DPN on the basis of conventional risk factors.Low level of genomic DNA methylation is a relatively specific risk factor for DPN in patients with T2DM and not a contributing factor to the other chronic complications.Copyright © 2022 Wang, Yang, Zhu, Zhang, Jiang, Hu and Zhang."

Study 1: A total of 354 young male participants, including current athletes, underwent blood pressure assessment. Study 2: The prevalence of hypertension in 1269 male former athletes was compared with that in the Japanese general population. Current and former athletes were divided into three groups: endurance-, mixed-, and sprint/power-group. Study 3: We analyzed the effect of aerobic- or resistance-training on DNA methylation patterns using publicly available datasets to explore the possible underlying mechanisms. In young, current athletes, the mixed- and sprint/power-group exhibited higher systolic blood pressure, and all groups exhibited higher pulse pressure than non-athletes. In contrast, the prevalence of hypertension in former athletes was significantly lower in all groups than in the general population. Compared to endurance-group (reference), adjusted-hazard ratios for the incidence of hypertension among mixed- and sprint/power-group were 1.24 (0.87-1.84) and 1.50 (1.04-2.23), respectively. Moreover, aerobic- and resistance-training commonly modified over 3000 DNA methylation sites in skeletal muscle, and these were suggested to be associated with cardiovascular function-related pathways. These findings suggest that the high blood pressure induced by exercise training at a young age does not influence the development of future hypertension. Furthermore, previous exercise training experiences at a young age could decrease the risk of future hypertension.© 2022 The Authors.

Due to growing prevalence of obesity across the world, it seems that nutritional advice alone is not able to combat this health problem. The present overview aimed to summarize the roles of personalized nutrition (PN) in obesity and diabetes management.Scopus, PubMed and Google scholar were searched up to February 2021 to find relevant studies with English language in which the roles of PN in obesity and diabetes management were examined.Recent evidence revealed the importance of gene-environment interactions for management of diabetes mellitus and obesity. Moreover, microbiome research showed that personalized diet based on a combination of clinical and microbial features is likely to improve responses to therapeutic interventions. Epigenetics as well as genetic and environmental factors can also contribute to the treatment. In addition, articles showed significant roles of epigenetics and gut microbiome on providing an individualized diet for obese and diabetic patients.PN compare to conventional diet can better improve metabolic status in obese and diabetic patients. Considering genetic differences and microbiome patterns along with environmental factors and their interactions are recommended for obesity and diabetes management.

"35822021","Biological Age Prediction From Wearable Device Movement Data Identifies Nutritional and Pharmacological Interventions for Healthy Aging.","Front Aging","Intervening in aging processes is hypothesized to extend healthy years of life and treat age-related disease, thereby providing great benefit to society. However, the ability to measure the biological aging process in individuals, which is necessary to test for efficacy of these interventions, remains largely inaccessible to the general public. Here we used NHANES physical activity accelerometer data from a wearable device and machine-learning algorithms to derive biological age predictions for individuals based on their movement patterns. We found that accelerated biological aging from our ""MoveAge"" predictor is associated with higher all-cause mortality. We further searched for nutritional or pharmacological compounds that associate with decelerated aging according to our model. A number of nutritional components peak in their association to decelerated aging later in life, including fiber, magnesium, and vitamin E. We additionally identified one FDA-approved drug associated with decelerated biological aging: the alpha-blocker doxazosin. We show that doxazosin extends healthspan and lifespan inC. elegans. Our work demonstrates how a biological aging score based on relative mobility can be accessible to the wider public and can potentially be used to identify and determine efficacy of geroprotective interventions.Copyright © 2021 McIntyre, Rahman, Vanapalli, Houtkooper and Janssens."
"35622681","Individual and Combined Effects of Paternal Deprivation and Developmental Exposure to Firemaster 550 on Socio-Emotional Behavior in Prairie Voles.","Toxics","The prevalence of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) is rapidly rising, suggesting a confluence of environmental factors that are likely contributing, including developmental exposure to environmental contaminants. Unfortunately, chemical exposures and social stressors frequently occur simultaneously in many communities, yet very few studies have sought to establish the combined effects on neurodevelopment or behavior. Social deficits are common to many NDDs, and we and others have shown that exposure to the chemical flame retardant mixture, Firemaster 550 (FM 550), or paternal deprivation impairs social behavior and neural function. Here, we used a spontaneously prosocial animal model, the prairie vole (Microtus ochrogaster), to explore the effects of perinatal chemical (FM 550) exposure alone or in combination with an early life stressor (paternal absence) on prosocial behavior. Dams were exposed to vehicle (sesame oil) or 1000 µg FM 550 orally via food treats from conception through weaning and the paternal absence groups were generated by removing the sires the day after birth. Adult offspring of both sexes were then subjected to open-field, sociability, and a partner preference test. Paternal deprivation (PD)-related effects included increased anxiety, decreased sociability, and impaired pair-bonding in both sexes. FM 550 effects include heightened anxiety and partner preference in females but reduced partner preference in males. The combination of FM 550 exposure and PD did not exacerbate any behaviors in either sex except for distance traveled by females in the partner preference test and, to a lesser extent, time spent with, and the number of visits to the non-social stimulus by males in the sociability test. FM 550 ameliorated the impacts of parental deprivation on partner preference behaviors in both sexes. This study is significant because it provides evidence that chemical and social stressors can have unique behavioral effects that differ by sex but may not produce worse outcomes in combination."

However, the underlying mechanisms are still required to be explored. Here, we conduct univariable and multivariable MR analyses using large-scale educational attainment, cognitive performance, intelligence and AD GWAS datasets. In stage 1, we found significant causal effects of educational attainment on cognitive performance (beta = 0.907, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.884-0.930, P < 1.145E-299), and vice versa (beta = 0.571, 95% CI: 0.557-0.585, P < 1.145E-299). In stage 2, we found that both increase in educational attainment (odds ratio (OR) = 0.72, 95% CI: 0.66-0.78, P = 1.39E-14) and cognitive performance (OR = 0.69, 95% CI: 0.64-0.75, P = 1.78E-20) could reduce the risk of AD. In stage 3, we found that educational attainment may protect against AD dependently of cognitive performance (OR = 1.07, 95% CI: 0.90-1.28, P = 4.48E-01), and cognitive performance may protect against AD independently of educational attainment (OR = 0.69, 95% CI: 0.53-0.89, P = 5.00E-03). In stage 4, we found significant causal effects of cognitive performance on intelligence (beta = 0.907, 95% CI: 0.877-0.938, P < 1.145E-299), and vice versa (beta = 0.957, 95% CI: 0.937-0.978, P < 1.145E-299). In stage 5, we identified that cognitive performance may protect against AD independently of intelligence (OR = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.61-0.90, P = 2.00E-03), and intelligence may protect against AD dependently of cognitive performance (OR = 1.17, 95% CI: 0.40-3.43, P = 4.48E-01). Collectively, our univariable and multivariable MR analyses highlight the protective role of cognitive performance in AD independently of educational attainment and intelligence.

"35771864","Integration of multidimensional splicing data and GWAS summary statistics for risk gene discovery.","PLoS Genet","A common strategy for the functional interpretation of genome-wide association study (GWAS) findings has been the integrative analysis of GWAS and expression data. Using this strategy, many association methods (e.g., PrediXcan and FUSION) have been successful in identifying trait-associated genes via mediating effects on RNA expression. However, these approaches often ignore the effects of splicing, which can carry as much disease risk as expression. Compared to expression data, one challenge to detect associations using splicing data is the large multiple testing burden due to multidimensional splicing events within genes. Here, we introduce a multidimensional splicing gene (MSG) approach, which consists of two stages: 1) we use sparse canonical correlation analysis (sCCA) to construct latent canonical vectors (CVs) by identifying sparse linear combinations of genetic variants and splicing events that are maximally correlated with each other; and 2) we test for the association between the genetically regulated splicing CVs and the trait of interest using GWAS summary statistics. Simulations show that MSG has proper type I error control and substantial power gains over existing multidimensional expression analysis methods (i.e., S-MultiXcan, UTMOST, and sCCA+ACAT) under diverse scenarios. When applied to the Genotype-Tissue Expression Project data and GWAS summary statistics of 14 complex human traits, MSG identified on average 83%, 115%, and 223% more significant genes than sCCA+ACAT, S-MultiXcan, and UTMOST, respectively. We highlight MSG's applications to Alzheimer's disease, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and schizophrenia, and found that the majority of MSG-identified genes would have been missed from expression-based analyses. Our results demonstrate that aggregating splicing data through MSG can improve power in identifying gene-trait associations and help better understand the genetic risk of complex traits."

In the present study, we aimed to stratify lower-grade glioma (LGG) patients based on the DNAm associated with metabolic reprogramming. Four data sets of LGGs from three databases (TCGA/CGGA/GEO) were used in this study. By screening the Kendall's correlation of DNAm with 87 metabolic processes from KEGG, we identified 391 CpGs with a strong correlation with metabolism. Based on these metabolism-associated CpGs, we performed consensus clustering and identified three distinct subgroups of LGGs. These three subgroups were characterized by distinct molecular features and clinical outcomes. We also constructed a subgroup-related, quantifiable CpG signature with strong prognostic power to stratify LGGs. It also serves as a potential biomarker to predict the response to immunotherapy. Overall, our findings provide new perspectives for the stratification of LGGs and for understanding the mechanisms driving malignancy.Copyright © 2022 Yang, Shan, Zhao and Li."

However, relevant pan-cancer analysis of Reptin is lacking. This study first investigated the potential oncogenic roles of Reptin and revealed a relationship between Reptin with clinicopathological characteristics and immune infiltration based on big data. Here, we showed that Reptin is overexpressed in many cancers. A significant association exists between the expression of Reptin and the prognosis of cancer cases. Reptin had a meaningful interaction with the immune infiltration of CD4+Th1 cells and immune modulator genes in multiple cancer types. And negative correlation exists between Reptin and cancer-associated fibroblasts in BRCA, PRAD, TGCT, and THYM. A significant negative association exists between Reptin and regulatory T cells in TGCT and THCA. Moreover, Reptin is significantly associated with genomic heterogeneity, DNA mismatch repair genes, methyltransferase, and RNA modification genes in specific cancer types. Spliceosome, Hippo signaling pathway, DNA replication pathway, and acetyltransferase activity-associated functions were observed in the effect of Reptin on the tumor.

Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to evaluate significant independent prognostic factors. Based on those factors, nomograms and Web-based probability calculators were constructed to evaluate the overall survival (OS) and the cancer-specific survival (CSS) at 3, 5, and 8 years. The concordance index (C-index), receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, calibration curve, and decision curve analysis (DCA) were used to evaluate the nomogram in the training set and validation set. Moreover, biochemistries from the validation set were retrospectively analyzed in different groups of stage by Kruskal-Wallis test.Age, marital status, tumor size, stage, lymph node status, and radiation were identified as prognostic factors of OS. In contrast, only tumor size and stage were predictive for CSS. The nomogram was developed based on these independent factors. The C-index, ROC curve, calibration curve, and DCA of the nomogram in both training and validation sets showed that the nomogram had good predictive value, stability, and clinical benefit in predicting 3-, 5-, and 8-year OS and CSS in PC patients. Among the 59 PC patients from our hospital, lower albumin (ALB) levels and higher postoperative parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels were found in patients with distant metastasis (Distant vs. Regional ALB levels:p= 0.037; Distant vs. Local ALB levels:p= 0.046; Distant vs. Regional postoperative PTH levels:p= 0.002; Distant vs. Local postoperative PTH:p= 0.002).The established nomogram application can provide accurate prognostics for patients with PC in the Chinese population, but it must be validated on prospectively collected real-world data.Copyright © 2022 Tao, Luo, Wang, Jia and Lu."

In mouse oocytes, high levels of DNA methylation occur exclusively in the transcriptionally active regions, with moderate to low levels of methylation in other regions. Histone H3K36me3 mediates the high levels of methylation in the transcribed regions; however, it is unknown which histone mark guides the methylation in the other regions. Here, we show that, in mouse oocytes, H3K36me2 is highly enriched in the X chromosome and is broadly distributed across all autosomes. Upon H3K36me2 depletion, DNA methylation in moderately methylated regions is selectively affected, and a methylation pattern unique to the X chromosome is switched to an autosome-like pattern. Furthermore, we find that simultaneous depletion of H3K36me2 and H3K36me3 results in global hypomethylation, comparable to that of DNMT3A depletion. Therefore, the two histone marks jointly provide the chromatin platform essential for guiding DNMT3A-dependent DNA methylation in mouse oocytes.© 2022. The Author(s)."

Using previously published data we compared 67 hypopharyngeal cancers to 595 HNSCC from other sites and found no prominent differences in mutational frequency except forCASP8andHRASgenes. Since we observed relatively frequent mutations ofKTM2C (MLL3)in our dataset, we analyzed their role,in vitro, by generating aKMT2C-mutant hypopharyngeal cancer cell line FaDu with CRISPR-Cas9. We demonstrated thatKMT2Closs-of-function mutations resulted in increased colony formation and proliferation, in concordance with previously published results. In summary, our results show that the mutational profile of hypopharyngeal cancers might be similar to the one observed for other head and neck cancers with respect to minor differences and includes multiple candidate actionable and prognostic genetic alterations. We also demonstrated, for the first time, that theKMT2Cgene may play a role of tumor suppressor in HNSCC, which opens new possibilities in the search for new targeted treatment approaches.Copyright © 2022 Machnicki, Rzepakowska, Janowska, Pepek, Krop, Pruszczyk, Stawinski, Rydzanicz, Grzybowski, Gornicka, Wnuk, Ploski, Osuch-Wojcikiewicz and Stoklosa."
"35769265","Epigenetic DNA Methylation Signatures Associated With the Severity of Paget's Disease of Bone.","Front Cell Dev Biol","Background:Paget's disease of bone (PDB) is characterized by focal areas of dysregulated bone turnover resulting in increased bone loss and abnormal bone formation with variable severity. PDB has a complex etiology and both genetics and environmental factors have been implicated. A recent study has identified many differentially methylated loci in PDB compared to healthy subjects. However, associations between DNA methylation profiles and disease severity of PDB have not been investigated.Objectives:To investigate the association between DNA methylation signals and PDB severity.Methods:Using 232 well-characterized PDB subjects from the PRISM trial, a disease severity score was devised based on the clinical features of PDB. DNA methylation profiling was performed using Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation 450K array.Results:We identified 100 CpG methylation sites significantly associated with PDB severity at FDR <0.05. Additionally, methylation profiles in 11 regions showed Bonferroni-significant association with disease severity including six islands (located inVCL,TBX5,CASZ1,ULBP2,NUDT15andSQSTM1), two gene bodies (CXCR6andDENND1A), and 3 promoter regions (RPL27,LINC00301andVPS29). Moreover, FDR-significant effects from region analysis implicated genes with genetic variants previously associated with PDB severity, includingRIN3andCSF1. A multivariate predictor model featuring the top severity-associated CpG sites revealed a significant correlation (R = 0.71,p= 6.9 × 10-16) between observed and predicted PDB severity scores. On dichotomizing the severity scores into low and high severity, the model featured an area under curve (AUC) of 0.80, a sensitivity of 0.74 and a specificity of 0.68.Conclusion:We identified several CpG methylation markers that are associated with PDB severity in this pioneering study while also highlighting the novel molecular pathways associated with disease progression. Further work is warranted to affirm the suitability of our model to predict the severity of PDB in newly diagnosed patients or patients with family history of PDB.Copyright © 2022 Diboun, Wani, Ralston and Albagha."

Genetically defined by somatic mutations of the X-linked gene UBA1 in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, VEXAS typically manifests in males during the fifth/sixth decade of life. Since its discovery, several groups have documented pleomorphic clinical phenotypes, in addition to a plethora of therapeutic options (e.g., JAK inhibitors, hypomethylating agents, and allogeneic stem cell transplant, allo-HCT) in retrospective case series. However, no treatment guidelines have been validated to date, VEXAS patients are typically steroid-dependent and may manifest life-threatening inflammatory symptoms refractory to multiple lines of therapy. To date, the only curative option appears to be allo-HCT in suitable individuals. Nonetheless, this procedure carries an inherent risk of morbidity and mortality that must be judiciously evaluated against a phenotypically diverse disorder where the optimal therapeutic algorithm remains ill-defined. Herein, we provide an overview of the current VEXAS data/ therapeutic evidence and discuss the curative potential of allo-HCT whilst highlighting the efforts required for generation of robust data able to inform therapeutic decisions.© 2022.

Here, we explain how sex - specifically sex chromosomes and sex hormones - drives differential adaptive immunity across immune-related disease states including cancer, and why males are consequently more predisposed to tumor development. We highlight emerging data on the roles of cell-intrinsic androgen receptors in driving CD8+T cell dysfunction or exhaustion in the tumor microenvironment and summarize ongoing clinical efforts to determine the impact of androgen blockade on cancer immunotherapy. Finally, we outline a framework for future research in cancer biology and immuno-oncology, underscoring the importance of a holistic research approach to understanding the mechanisms of sex dimorphisms in cancer, so sex will be considered as an imperative factor for guiding treatment decisions in the future.© 2022."

Sex disparities in TB prevalence, pathophysiology, and clinical manifestations are widely reported, but the underlying biological mechanisms remain largely undefined. This review assesses epidemiological data on sex disparity in TB, as well as possible underlying hormonal and genetic mechanisms that might differentially modulate innate and adaptive immune responses in males and females, leading to sex differences in disease susceptibility. We consider whether this sex disparity can be extended to the efficacy of vaccines and discuss novel animal models which may offer mechanistic insights.

"35805040","Diverse Functions of KDM5 in Cancer: Transcriptional Repressor or Activator?","Cancers (Basel)","Epigenetic modifications are crucial for chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. Post-translational modifications of histones are epigenetic processes that are fine-tuned by writer and eraser enzymes, and the disorganization of these enzymes alters the cellular state, resulting in human diseases. The KDM5 family is an enzymatic family that removes di- and tri-methyl groups (me2 and me3) from lysine 4 of histone H3 (H3K4), and its dysregulation has been implicated in cancer. Although H3K4me3 is an active chromatin marker, KDM5 proteins serve as not only transcriptional repressors but also transcriptional activators in a demethylase-dependent or -independent manner in different contexts. Notably, KDM5 proteins regulate the H3K4 methylation cycle required for active transcription. Here, we review the recent findings regarding the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation mediated by KDM5 in various contexts, with a focus on cancer, and further shed light on the potential of targeting KDM5 for cancer therapy."
"35705742","X chromosome agents of sexual differentiation.","Nat Rev Endocrinol","Understanding sex differences in physiology and disease requires the identification of the molecular agents that cause phenotypic sex differences. Two groups of such agents are genes located on the sex chromosomes, and gonadal hormones. The former have coherent linkage to chromosomes that form differently in the two sexes under the influence of genomic forces that are not related to reproductive function, whereas the latter have a direct or indirect relationship to reproduction. Evidence published in the past 5 years supports the identification of several agents of sexual differentiation encoded by the X chromosome in mice, including Kdm5c, Kdm6a, Ogt and Xist. These X chromosome agents have wide pleiotropic effects, potentially influencing sex differences in many different tissues, a characteristic shared with the gonadal hormones. The identification of X chromosome agents of sexual differentiation will facilitate understanding of complex intersecting gene pathways underlying sex differences in disease.© 2022.

"35740242","Immunomodulatory Properties of Human Breast Milk: MicroRNA Contents and Potential Epigenetic Effects.","Biomedicines","Infants who are exclusively breastfed in the first six months of age receive adequate nutrients, achieving optimal immune protection and growth. In addition to the known nutritional components of human breast milk (HBM), i.e., water, carbohydrates, fats and proteins, it is also a rich source of microRNAs, which impact epigenetic mechanisms. This comprehensive work presents an up-to-date overview of the immunomodulatory constituents of HBM, highlighting its content of circulating microRNAs. The epigenetic effects of HBM are discussed, especially those regulated by miRNAs. HBM contains more than 1400 microRNAs. The majority of these microRNAs originate from the lactating gland and are based on the remodeling of cells in the gland during breastfeeding. These miRNAs can affect epigenetic patterns by several mechanisms, including DNA methylation, histone modifications and RNA regulation, which could ultimately result in alterations in gene expressions. Therefore, the unique microRNA profile of HBM, including exosomal microRNAs, is implicated in the regulation of the genes responsible for a variety of immunological and physiological functions, such asFTO,INS,IGF1,NRF2,GLUT1andFOXP3genes. Hence, studying the HBM miRNA composition is important for improving the nutritional approaches for pregnancy and infant's early life and preventing diseases that could occur in the future. Interestingly, the composition of miRNAs in HBM is affected by multiple factors, including diet, environmental and genetic factors."

We performed an up-to-date meta-analysis of prospective studies to assess observational association, and then conducted MR analysis to make causal inference based on the genetic predisposition to alcohol consumption (""drinks per week"") and pathological drinking behaviours (""alcohol use disorder"" and ""problematic alcohol use""), as well as genetically predicted DNA methylation at by alcohol-related CpG sites in blood. We found an observational dose-response association between alcohol intake and breast cancer incidence with an additional risk of 4% for per 10 g/day increase in alcohol consumption. Genetic predisposition to alcohol consumption (""drinks per week"") was not causally associated with breast cancer incidence at the OR of 1.01 (95% CI 0.84, 1.23), but problematic alcohol use (PAU) was linked to a higher breast cancer risk at the OR of 1.76 (95% CI 1.04, 2.99) when conditioning on alcohol consumption. Epigenetic MR analysis identified four CpG sites, cg03260624 near CDC7 gene, cg10816169 near ZNF318 gene, cg03345232 near RIN3 gene, and cg26312998 near RP11-867G23.13 gene, where genetically predicted epigenetic modifications were associated with an increased breast cancer incidence risk. Our findings re-affirmed that alcohol consumption is of high risk for breast cancer incidence even at a very low dose, and the pathogenic effect of alcohol on breast cancer could be due to pathological drinking behaviour and epigenetic modification at several CpG sites, which could be potential intervention targets for breast cancer prevention.© 2022.

To estimate the independent effect of body size and SES on the clinical manifestations of COVID-19, we conducted a Mendelian randomization (MR) study.Applying two-sample MR approaches, we evaluated the effects of body mass index (BMI, n = 322 154), waist circumference (WC, n = 234 069), hip circumference (n = 213 019) and waist-hip ratio (n = 210 088) with respect to three COVID-19 outcomes: severe respiratory COVID-19 (cases = 8779, controls = 1 000 875), hospitalized COVID-19 (cases = 17 992, controls = 1 810 493) and COVID-19 infection (cases = 87 870, controls = 2 210 804). Applying a multivariable MR (MVMR) approach, we estimated the effect of these anthropometric traits on COVID-19 outcomes accounting for the effect of SES assessed as household income (n = 286 301).BMI and WC were associated with severe respiratory COVID-19 [BMI: odds ratio (OR) = 1.51, CI = 1.24-1.84, P = 3.01e-05; WC: OR = 1.48, 95% CI = 1.15-1.91, P = 0.0019] and hospitalized COVID-19 (BMI: OR = 1.50, 95% CI = 1.32-1.72, P = 8.83e-10; WC: OR = 1.41, 95% CI = 1.20-1.67, P = 3.72e-05). Conversely, income was associated with lower odds of severe respiratory (OR = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.53-0.93, P = 0.015) and hospitalized COVID-19 (OR = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.66-0.92, P = 0.003). MVMR analyses showed that the effect of these obesity-related traits on increasing the odds of COVID-19 negative outcomes becomes null when accounting for income. Conversely, the association of income with lower odds of COVID-19 negative outcomes is not affected when including the anthropometric traits in the multivariable model.Our findings indicate that SES contributes to the effect of obesity-related traits on COVID-19 severity and hospitalization.© The Author(s) 2022; all rights reserved.

Our embedding in the societal fabric resonates with habitus, world view, opportunity, and health disparity. It remains obscure how distinct facets of SES are reflected in the architecture of the central nervous system. Here, we capitalized on multivariate multi-output learning algorithms to explore possible imprints of SES in gray and white matter structure in the wider population (n ≈ 10,000 UK Biobank participants). Individuals with higher SES, compared with those with lower SES, showed a pattern of increased region volumes in the left brain and decreased region volumes in the right brain. The analogous lateralization pattern emerged for the fiber structure of anatomical white matter tracts. Our multimodal findings suggest hemispheric asymmetry as an SES-related brain signature, which was consistent across six different indicators of SES: degree, education, income, job, neighborhood and vehicle count. Hence, hemispheric specialization may have evolved in human primates in a way that reveals crucial links to SES.© The Author(s) 2022. Published by Oxford University Press."

Dysregulation of 3R:4R ratio causes tauopathy, and human neurons that recapitulate tau isoforms in health and disease will provide a platform for elucidating pathogenic processes involving tau pathology. We carried out extensive characterizations of tau isoforms expressed in human neurons derived by microRNA-induced neuronal reprogramming of adult fibroblasts. Transcript and protein analyses showed that miR neurons expressed all six isoforms with the 3R:4R isoform ratio equivalent to that detected in human adult brains. Also, miR neurons derived from familial tauopathy patients with a 3R:4R ratio altering mutation showed increased 4R tau and the formation of insoluble tau with seeding activity.

"35895679","A quantification method of somatic mutations in normal tissues and their accumulation in pediatric patients with chemotherapy.","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","Somatic mutations are accumulated in normal human tissues with aging and exposure to carcinogens. If we can accurately count any passenger mutations in any single DNA molecule, since their quantity is much larger than driver mutations, we can sensitively detect mutation accumulation in polyclonal normal tissues. Duplex sequencing, which tags both DNA strands in one DNA molecule, enables accurate count of such mutations, but requires a very large number of sequencing reads for each single sample of human-genome size. Here, we reduced the genome size to 1/90 using theBamHI restriction enzyme and established a cost-effective pipeline. The enzymatically cleaved and optimal sequencing (EcoSeq) method was able to count somatic mutations in a single DNA molecule with a sensitivity of as low as 3 × 10-8per base pair (bp), as assessed by measuring artificially prepared mutations. Taking advantages of EcoSeq, we analyzed normal peripheral blood cells of pediatric sarcoma patients who received chemotherapy (n= 10) and those who did not (n= 10). The former had a mutation frequency of 31.2 ± 13.4 × 10-8per base pair while the latter had 9.0 ± 4.5 × 10-8per base pair (P< 0.001). The increase in mutation frequency was confirmed by analysis of the same patients before and after chemotherapy, and increased mutation frequencies persisted 46 to 64 mo after chemotherapy, indicating that the mutation accumulation constitutes a risk of secondary leukemia. EcoSeq has the potential to reveal accumulation of somatic mutations and exposure to environmental factors in any DNA samples and will contribute to cancer risk estimation."

Cellular processes are numerous, including inflammasome assembly and cell senescence which may involve mitochondrial dysfunction, autophagy, DNA damage response, dysbiosis, and many others. More recently, a series of noncoding RNAs, mainly microRNAs, have been described as possessing epigenetic actions on the regulation of inflammasome-related hypertension, emerging as a promising therapeutic strategy.

"35902734","The promise of new anti-obesity therapies arising from knowledge of genetic obesity traits.","Nat Rev Endocrinol","Obesity is a multifactorial and complex disease that often manifests in early childhood with a lifelong burden. Polygenic and monogenic obesity are driven by the interaction between genetic predisposition and environmental factors. Polygenic variants are frequent and confer small effect sizes. Rare monogenic obesity syndromes are caused by defined pathogenic variants in single genes with large effect sizes. Most of these genes are involved in the central nervous regulation of body weight; for example, genes of the leptin-melanocortin pathway. Clinically, patients with monogenic obesity present with impaired satiety, hyperphagia and pronounced food-seeking behaviour in early childhood, which leads to severe early-onset obesity. With the advent of novel pharmacological treatment options emerging for monogenic obesity syndromes that target the central melanocortin pathway, genetic testing is recommended for patients with rapid weight gain in infancy and additional clinical suggestive features. Likewise, patients with obesity associated with hypothalamic damage or other forms of syndromic obesity involving energy regulatory circuits could benefit from these novel pharmacological treatment options. Early identification of patients affected by syndromic obesity will lead to appropriate treatment, thereby preventing the development of obesity sequelae, avoiding failure of conservative treatment approaches and alleviating stigmatization of patients and their families.© 2022.

The most common substrate among these are alanine and glutamine, and members are present in a wide range of tissues with important functions for several biological processes, such as liver and brain function. Some of these transporters are better characterized than others and, in this paper, a behavioral characterization of SLC38A10-/-mice was carried out. A battery of tests for general activity, emotionality, motor function, and spatial memory was used. Among these tests, the elevated plus maze, Y-maze, marble burying and challenging beam walk have not been tested on the SLC38A10-/-mice previously, while the open field and the rotarod tests have been performed by the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC). Unlike the results from IMPC, the results from this study showed that SLC38A10-/-mice spend less time in the wall zone in the open field test than WT mice, implying that SLC38A10-deficient mice have an increased explorative behavior, which suggests an important function of SLC38A10 in brain. The present study also confirmed IMPC's data regarding rotarod performance and weight, showing that SLC38A10-/-mice do not have an affected motor coordination impairment and have a lower body weight than both SLC38A10+/-and SLC38A10+/+mice.

"35859169","Mechanisms of APOBEC3 mutagenesis in human cancer cells.","Nature","The APOBEC3 family of cytosine deaminases has been implicated in some of the most prevalent mutational signatures in cancer1-3. However, a causal link between endogenous APOBEC3 enzymes and mutational signatures in human cancer genomes has not been established, leaving the mechanisms of APOBEC3 mutagenesis poorly understood. Here, to investigate the mechanisms of APOBEC3 mutagenesis, we deleted implicated genes from human cancer cell lines that naturally generate APOBEC3-associated mutational signatures over time4. Analysis of non-clustered and clustered signatures across whole-genome sequences from 251 breast, bladder and lymphoma cancer cell line clones revealed that APOBEC3A deletion diminished APOBEC3-associated mutational signatures. Deletion of both APOBEC3A and APOBEC3B further decreased APOBEC3 mutation burdens, without eliminating them. Deletion of APOBEC3B increased APOBEC3A protein levels, activity and APOBEC3A-mediated mutagenesis in some cell lines. The uracil glycosylase UNG was required for APOBEC3-mediated transversions, whereas the loss of the translesion polymerase REV1 decreased overall mutation burdens. Together, these data represent direct evidence that endogenous APOBEC3 deaminases generate prevalent mutational signatures in human cancer cells. Our results identify APOBEC3A as the main driver of these mutations, indicate that APOBEC3B can restrain APOBEC3A-dependent mutagenesis while contributing its own smaller mutation burdens and dissect mechanisms that translate APOBEC3 activities into distinct mutational signatures.© 2022.

"35822044","The Dynamics of Somatic Mutagenesis During Life in Humans.","Front Aging","From conception to death, human cells accumulate somatic mutations in their genomes. These mutations can contribute to the development of cancer and non-malignant diseases and have also been associated with aging. Rapid technological developments in sequencing approaches in the last few years and their application to normal tissues have greatly advanced our knowledge about the accumulation of these mutations during healthy aging. Whole genome sequencing studies have revealed that there are significant differences in mutation burden and patterns across tissues, but also that the mutation rates within tissues are surprisingly constant during adult life. In contrast, recent lineage-tracing studies based on whole-genome sequencing have shown that the rate of mutation accumulation is strongly increased early in life before birth. These early mutations, which can be shared by many cells in the body, may have a large impact on development and the origin of somatic diseases. For example, cancer driver mutations can arise early in life, decades before the detection of the malignancy. Here, we review the recent insights in mutation accumulation and mutagenic processes in normal tissues. We compare mutagenesis early and later in life and discuss how mutation rates and patterns evolve during aging.

Inherited biallelic MUTYH mutations cause predisposition to colorectal adenomas and carcinoma. However, the mechanistic progression from germline MUTYH mutations to MUTYH-Associated Polyposis (MAP) is incompletely understood. Here, we sequence normal tissue DNAs from 10 individuals with MAP. Somatic base substitution mutation rates in intestinal epithelial cells were elevated 2 to 4-fold in all individuals, except for one showing a 31-fold increase, and were also increased in other tissues. The increased mutation burdens were of multiple mutational signatures characterised by C > A changes. Different mutation rates and signatures between individuals are likely due to different MUTYH mutations or additional inherited mutations in other BER pathway genes. The elevated base substitution rate in normal cells likely accounts for the predisposition to neoplasia in MAP. Despite ubiquitously elevated mutation rates, individuals with MAP do not display overt evidence of premature ageing. Thus, accumulation of somatic mutations may not be sufficient to cause the global organismal functional decline of ageing.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35732905","A phylogenetic approach to study the evolution of somatic mutational processes in cancer.","Commun Biol","Cancer cell genomes change continuously due to mutations, and mutational processes change over time in patients, leaving dynamic signatures in the accumulated genomic variation in tumors. Many computational methods detect the relative activities of known mutation signatures. However, these methods may produce erroneous signatures when applied to individual branches in cancer cell phylogenies. Here, we show that the inference of branch-specific mutational signatures can be improved through a joint analysis of the collections of mutations mapped on proximal branches of the cancer cell phylogeny. This approach reduces the false-positive discovery rate of branch-specific signatures and can sometimes detect faint signatures. An analysis of empirical data from 61 lung cancer patients supports trends based on computer-simulated datasets for which the correct signatures are known. In lung cancer somatic variation, we detect a decreasing trend of smoking-related mutational processes over time and an increasing influence of APOBEC mutational processes as the tumor evolution progresses. These analyses also reveal patterns of conservation and divergence of mutational processes in cell lineages within patients.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35686905","Complex mutation profiles in mismatch repair and ribonucleotide reductase mutants reveal novel repair substrate specificity of MutS homolog (MSH) complexes.","Genetics","Determining mutation signatures is standard for understanding the etiology of human tumors and informing cancer treatment. Multiple determinants of DNA replication fidelity prevent mutagenesis that leads to carcinogenesis, including the regulation of free deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate pools by ribonucleotide reductase and repair of replication errors by the mismatch repair system. We identified genetic interactions between rnr1 alleles that skew and/or elevate deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate levels and mismatch repair gene deletions. These defects indicate that the rnr1 alleles lead to increased mutation loads that are normally acted upon by mismatch repair. We then utilized a targeted deep-sequencing approach to determine mutational profiles associated with mismatch repair pathway defects. By combining rnr1 and msh mutations to alter and/or increase deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate levels and alter the mutational load, we uncovered previously unreported specificities of Msh2-Msh3 and Msh2-Msh6. Msh2-Msh3 is uniquely able to direct the repair of G/C single-base deletions in GC runs, while Msh2-Msh6 specifically directs the repair of substitutions that occur at G/C dinucleotides. We also identified broader sequence contexts that influence variant profiles in different genetic backgrounds. Finally, we observed that the mutation profiles in double mutants were not necessarily an additive relationship of mutation profiles in single mutants.

"35609203","Incident Cancer Risk and Signatures Among Older MUTYH Carriers: Analysis of Population-Based and Genomic Cohorts.","Cancer Prev Res (Phila)","MUTYH carriers have an increased colorectal cancer risk in case-control studies, with loss of heterozygosity (LOH) as the presumed mechanism. We evaluated cancer risk among carriers in a prospective, population-based cohort of older adults. In addition, we assessed if cancers from carriers demonstrated mutational signatures (G:C>T:A transversions) associated with early LOH. We calculated incident risk of cancer and colorectal cancer among 13,131 sequenced study participants of the ASPirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly cohort, stratified by sex and adjusting for age, smoking, alcohol use, BMI, polyp history, history of cancer, and aspirin use. MUTYH carriers were identified among 13,033 participants in The Cancer Genome Atlas and International Cancer Genome Consortium, and somatic signatures of cancers were analyzed. Male MUTYH carriers demonstrated an increased risk for overall cancer incidence [multivariable HR, 1.66; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03-2.68; P = 0.038] driven by increased colorectal cancer incidence (multivariable HR, 3.55; 95% CI, 1.42-8.78; P = 0.007), as opposed to extracolonic cancer incidence (multivariable HR, 1.40; 95% CI, 0.81-2.44; P = 0.229). Female carriers did not demonstrate increased risk of cancer, colorectal cancer, or extracolonic cancers. Analysis of mutation signatures from cancers of MUTYH carriers revealed no significant contribution toward early mutagenesis from widespread G:C>T:A transversions among gastrointestinal epithelial cancers. Among cancers from carriers, somatic transversions associated with base-excision repair deficiency are uncommon, suggestive of diverse mechanisms of carcinogenesis in carriers compared with those who inherit biallelic MUTYH mutations.Despite absence of loss of heterozygosity in colorectal cancers, elderly male MUTYH carriers appeared to be at increased of colorectal cancer.©2022 American Association for Cancer Research."
"35587635","Colon Tumors in Enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis (ETBF)-Colonized Mice Do Not Display a Unique Mutational Signature but Instead Possess Host-Dependent Alterations in the APC Gene.","Microbiol Spectr","Enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis (ETBF) is consistently found at higher frequency in individuals with sporadic and hereditary colorectal cancer (CRC) and induces tumorigenesis in several mouse models of CRC. However, whether specific mutations induced by ETBF lead to colon tumor formation has not been investigated. To determine if ETBF-induced mutations impact theApcgene, and other tumor suppressors or proto-oncogenes, we performed whole-exome sequencing and whole-genome sequencing on tumors isolated after ETBF and sham colonization ofApcmin/+andApcmin/+Msh2fl/flVC mice, as well as whole-genome sequencing of organoids cocultured with ETBF. Our results indicate that ETBF-induced tumor formation results from loss of heterozygosity (LOH) ofApc, unless the mismatch repair system is disrupted, in which case, tumor formation results from new acquisition of protein-truncating mutations inApc. In contrast to polyketide synthase-positive Escherichia coli (pks+ E. coli), ETBF does not produce a unique mutational signature; instead, ETBF-induced tumors arise from errors in DNA mismatch repair and homologous recombination DNA damage repair, established pathways of tumor formation in the colon, and the same genetic mechanism accounting for sham tumors in these mouse models. Our analysis informs how this procarcinogenic bacterium may promote tumor formation in individuals with inherited predispositions to CRC, such as Lynch syndrome or familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP).IMPORTANCEMany studies have shown that microbiome composition in both the mucosa and the stool differs in individuals with sporadic and hereditary colorectal cancer (CRC). Both human and mouse models have established a strong association between particular microbes and colon tumor induction. However, the genetic mechanisms underlying putative microbe-induced colon tumor formation are not well established. In this paper, we applied whole-exome sequencing and whole-genome sequencing to investigate the impact of ETBF-induced genetic changes on tumor formation. Additionally, we performed whole-genome sequencing of human colon organoids exposed to ETBF to validate the mutational patterns seen in our mouse models and begin to understand their relevance in human colon epithelial cells. The results of this study highlight the importance of ETBF colonization in the development of sporadic CRC and in individuals with hereditary tumor conditions, such as Lynch syndrome and familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP)."
"35903442","Habitual Fish Oil Supplementation and Risk of Incident Inflammatory Bowel Diseases: A Prospective Population-Based Study.","Front Nutr","Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBDs) have been emerging in recent years with the advance of global industrialization and diet pattern transformation. Marine n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs), enriched in fish oils, have well-known human health promotion. Evidence on the association of fish oil supplementation with the risk of developing IBDs was scarce. This study aimed to examine the association between the use of fish oil supplements and the risk of developing inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) among the general population.We conducted a prospective cohort study of 447,890 participants aged 40-69 years from the UK Biobank. A touch screen questionnaire was used to get the data about fish oil intake at baseline. Incident diagnoses of IBDs were ascertained by the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9 and ICD-10) or self-report. Cox proportional hazards model was applied to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of developing IBDs and their subtypes.We documented 1,646 incident cases of IBDs, including 533 incident cases of Crohn's disease (CD) and 1,185 incident cases of ulcerative colitis (UC) during an average of 8 years of follow-up. After multivariate adjustment, the use of fish oil was associated with a 12% lower risk of IBDs (HR: 0.88, 95%CI: 0.78-0.99,p= 0.03) compared with non-consumers. For subtypes of IBDs, fish oil supplementation was inversely associated with a 15% lower risk of UC (HR: 0.85, 95%CI: 0.75-0.99,p= 0.02) but was not correlated with the risk of CD (p= 0.22). Besides, fish oil supplementation showed a significant inverse correlation with baseline CRP levels (β = -0.021,p< 0.001) and a positive association with baseline albumin levels (β = 0.135,p< 0.001) after adjustment for multiple variates.Habitual intake of fish oil supplements was associated with a lower risk of IBDs and UC. Fish oil users tended to have lower baseline C-reactive protein levels and higher baseline albumin levels compared with non-users. It was concluded that fish oil supplement use may be recommended for the prevention and control of IBDs.Copyright © 2022 Huang, Li, Zhuang, Liu, Zhang, Zhang and Jiao."

No research to date has directly examined whether SEP differences in health-based food choice motives or executive function explain why lower SEP is associated with higher BMI.We analysed observational data from large samples of UK (N = 4130) and US (N = 1898) adults which included measures of SEP (education level, household income and subjective social status) and self-reported BMI. Participants also completed validated self-report measures on the extent to which their day-to-day food choices were motivated by health and weight control, as well as completing computerized tasks measuring inhibitory control (Stroop task) and working memory (Digit span task).Across both UK and US adults, the relationship between indicators of lower SEP and higher BMI were consistently explained by participants from lower SEP backgrounds reporting being less motivated by health when making food choices, which accounted for 18-28% of the association between lower SEP and higher BMI. There was no evidence that measures of executive function explained associations between SEP and BMI or moderated relations between food choice motives and higher BMI.SEP differences in health-based food choice motives may play an important role in explaining why lower SEP is associated with an increased risk of higher BMI.© 2022.

"35831902","Your height affects your health: genetic determinants and health-related outcomes in Taiwan.","BMC Med","Height is an important anthropometric measurement and is associated with many health-related outcomes. Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified hundreds of genetic loci associated with height, mainly in individuals of European ancestry.We performed genome-wide association analyses and replicated previously reported GWAS-determined single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the Taiwanese Han population (Taiwan Biobank; n = 67,452). A genetic instrument composed of 251 SNPs was selected from our GWAS, based on height and replication results as the best-fit polygenic risk score (PRS), in accordance with the clumping and p-value threshold method. We also examined the association between genetically determined height (PRS251) and measured height (phenotype). We performed observational (phenotype) and genetic PRS251association analyses of height and health-related outcomes.GWAS identified 6843 SNPs in 89 genomic regions with genome-wide significance, including 18 novel loci. These were the most strongly associated genetic loci (EFEMP1, DIS3L2, ZBTB38, LCORL, HMGA1, CS, and GDF5) previously reported to play a role in height. There was a positive association between PRS251and measured height (p < 0.001). Of the 14 traits and 49 diseases analyzed, we observed significant associations of measured and genetically determined height with only eight traits (p < 0.05/[14 + 49]). Height was positively associated with body weight, waist circumference, and hip circumference but negatively associated with body mass index, waist-hip ratio, body fat, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p < 0.05/[14 + 49]).This study contributes to the understanding of the genetic features of height and health-related outcomes in individuals of Han Chinese ancestry in Taiwan.© 2022.

"35787050","Mendelian randomization for causal inference accounting for pleiotropy and sample structure using genome-wide summary statistics.","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","Mendelian randomization (MR) is a valuable tool for inferring causal relationships among a wide range of traits using summary statistics from genome-wide association studies (GWASs). Existing summary-level MR methods often rely on strong assumptions, resulting in many false-positive findings. To relax MR assumptions, ongoing research has been primarily focused on accounting for confounding due to pleiotropy. Here, we show that sample structure is another major confounding factor, including population stratification, cryptic relatedness, and sample overlap. We propose a unified MR approach, MR-APSS, which 1) accounts for pleiotropy and sample structure simultaneously by leveraging genome-wide information; and 2) allows the inclusion of more genetic variants with moderate effects as instrument variables (IVs) to improve statistical power without inflating type I errors. We first evaluated MR-APSS using comprehensive simulations and negative controls and then applied MR-APSS to study the causal relationships among a collection of diverse complex traits. The results suggest that MR-APSS can better identify plausible causal relationships with high reliability. In particular, MR-APSS can perform well for highly polygenic traits, where the IV strengths tend to be relatively weak and existing summary-level MR methods for causal inference are vulnerable to confounding effects."
"35677640","General and abdominal obesity operate differently as influencing factors of fracture risk in old adults.","iScience","To infer the causality between obesity and fracture and the difference between general and abdominal obesity, a prospective study was performed in 456,921 participants, and 10,142 participants developed an incident fracture with follow-up period of 7.96 years. A U-shape relationship was observed between BMI and fracture, with the lowest risk of fracture in overweight participants. The obesity individuals had higher fracture risk when BMD was adjusted, and the protective effect of moderate-high BMI on fracture was mostly mediated by bone mineral density (BMD). However, for abdominal obesity, the higher WCadjBMI (linear) and HCadjBMI (J-shape) were found to be related to higher fracture risk, and less than 30% of the effect was mediated by BMD. By leveraging genetic instrumental variables, it provided additional evidences to support the aforementioned findings. In conclusion, keeping moderate-high BMI might be of benefit to old people in terms of fracture risk, whereas abdominal adiposity might increase risk of fracture.© 2022 The Author(s)."
"35653334","A multi-population phenome-wide association study of genetically-predicted height in the Million Veteran Program.","PLoS Genet","Height has been associated with many clinical traits but whether such associations are causal versus secondary to confounding remains unclear in many cases. To systematically examine this question, we performed a Mendelian Randomization-Phenome-wide association study (MR-PheWAS) using clinical and genetic data from a national healthcare system biobank.Analyses were performed using data from the US Veterans Affairs (VA) Million Veteran Program in non-Hispanic White (EA, n = 222,300) and non-Hispanic Black (AA, n = 58,151) adults in the US. We estimated height genetic risk based on 3290 height-associated variants from a recent European-ancestry genome-wide meta-analysis. We compared associations of measured and genetically-predicted height with phenome-wide traits derived from the VA electronic health record, adjusting for age, sex, and genetic principal components. We found 345 clinical traits associated with measured height in EA and an additional 17 in AA. Of these, 127 were associated with genetically-predicted height at phenome-wide significance in EA and 2 in AA. These associations were largely independent from body mass index. We confirmed several previously described MR associations between height and cardiovascular disease traits such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary heart disease (CHD), and atrial fibrillation, and further uncovered MR associations with venous circulatory disorders and peripheral neuropathy in the presence and absence of diabetes. As a number of traits associated with genetically-predicted height frequently co-occur with CHD, we evaluated effect modification by CHD status of genetically-predicted height associations with risk factors for and complications of CHD. We found modification of effects of MR associations by CHD status for atrial fibrillation/flutter but not for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, or venous circulatory disorders.We conclude that height may be an unrecognized but biologically plausible risk factor for several common conditions in adults. However, more studies are needed to reliably exclude horizontal pleiotropy as a driving force behind at least some of the MR associations observed in this study."

We aim to explore the shared etiology, via lifecourse adiposity, between T2D and depression.We used data from birth until 46years from Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966 (n = 6,372; 53.8% females). We conducted multivariate analyses on three outcomes: T2D (4.2%), depression (19.2%) and as comorbidity (1.8%). We conducted (i) Path analysis to clarify time-dependent body mass index (BMI) related pathways, including BMI polygenic risk scores (PRS); and (ii) Cox regression models to assess whether reduction of overweight between 7years and 31years influence T2D, depression and/or comorbidity. The models were tested for covariation with sex, education, smoking, physical activity, and diet score.The odd ratios (OR) of T2D in individuals with depression was 1.68 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.34-2.11], and no change in estimate was observed when adjusted for covariates. T2D and comorbidity showed similar patterns of relationships in the path analyses (P < 0.001). The genetic risk for obesity (PRS BMI) did not show direct effect on T2D or comorbidity in adulthood but indirectly through measures of adiposity in early childhood and mid-adulthood in the path analysis (P < 0.001). Having early-onset of overweight at 7years and 31years showed highest risk of T2D (OR 3.8, 95%CI 2.4-6.1) and comorbidity (OR 5.0, 95%CI 2.7-9.5), with mild-to-moderate attenuation with adjustments. Depression showed no significant associations.We found evidence for overweight since childhood as a risk factor for T2D and co-morbidity between T2D and depression, influenced moderately by lifestyle factors in later life. However, no shared early life adiposity related risk factors were observed between T2D and depression when assessed independently in this Finnish setting.© 2022. The Author(s)."

Although evidence exists on molecular mechanisms involved in heterochromatin formation, a detailed structural mechanism of heterochromatin formation needs a better understanding. We made use of a simple Monte Carlo simulation model with explicit representation of key molecular events to observe molecular self-organization leading to heterochromatin formation. Our simulations provide a structural interpretation of several important traits of the heterochromatinization process. In particular, this study provides a depiction of how small amounts of HP1 are able to induce a highly condensed chromatin state through HP1 dimerization and bridging of sequence-remote nucleosomes. It also elucidates structural roots of a yet poorly understood phenomenon of a nondeterministic nature of heterochromatin formation and subsequent gene repression. Experimental chromatinin vivoassay provides an unbiased estimate of time scale of repressive response to a heterochromatin-triggering event.© 2022 The Author(s)."
"35732114","Dynamics and functional roles of splicing factor autoregulation.","Cell Rep","Non-core spliceosome components are essential, conserved regulators of alternative splicing. They provide concentration-dependent control of diverse pre-mRNAs. Many splicing factors direct unproductive splicing of their own pre-mRNAs through negative autoregulation. However, the impact of such feedback loops on splicing dynamics at the single-cell level remains unclear. Here, we developed a system to quantitatively analyze negative autoregulatory splicing dynamics by splicing factor SRSF1 in response to perturbations in single HEK293 cells. We show that negative autoregulatory splicing provides critical functions for gene regulation, establishing a ceiling of SRSF1 protein concentration, reducing cell-cell heterogeneity in SRSF1 levels, and buffering variation in transcription. Most important, it adapts SRSF1 splicing activity to variations in demand from other pre-mRNA substrates. A minimal mathematical model of autoregulatory splicing explains these experimentally observed features and provides values for effective biochemical parameters. These results reveal the unique functional roles that splicing negative autoregulation plays in homeostatically regulating transcriptional programs.Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).

"35678392","Dynamic spreading of chromatin-mediated gene silencing and reactivation between neighboring genes in single cells.","Elife","In mammalian cells genes that are in close proximity can be transcriptionally coupled: silencing or activating one gene can affect its neighbors. Understanding these dynamics is important for natural processes, such as heterochromatin spreading during development and aging, and when designing synthetic gene regulation circuits. Here, we systematically dissect this process in single cells by recruiting and releasing repressive chromatin regulators at dual-gene synthetic reporters, and measuring how fast gene silencing and reactivation spread as a function of intergenic distance and configuration of insulator elements. We find that silencing by KRAB, associated with histone methylation, spreads between two genes within hours, with a time delay that increases with distance. This fast KRAB-mediated spreading is not blocked by the classical cHS4 insulators. Silencing by histone deacetylase HDAC4 of the upstream gene can also facilitate background silencing of the downstream gene by PRC2, but with a days-long delay that does not change with distance. This slower silencing can sometimes be stopped by insulators. Gene reactivation of neighboring genes is also coupled, with strong promoters and insulators determining the order of reactivation. Our data can be described by a model of multi-gene regulation that builds upon previous knowledge of heterochromatin spreading, where both gene silencing and gene reactivation can act at a distance, allowing for coordinated dynamics via chromatin regulator recruitment.© 2022, Lensch et al."

Modern pathological and molecular technologies offer a powerful set of tools to profile tumor heterogeneities at multiple levels in large patient populations, from DNA to RNA, protein and epigenetics, and from tumor tissues to tumor microenvironment and liquid biopsy. When coupled with well-validated epidemiologic methodology and well-characterized epidemiologic resources, the rich tumor pathological and molecular tumor information provide new research opportunities at an unprecedented breadth and depth. This is the research space where Molecular Pathological Epidemiology (MPE) emerged over a decade ago and has been thriving since then. As a truly multidisciplinary field, MPE embraces collaborations from diverse fields including epidemiology, pathology, immunology, genetics, biostatistics, bioinformatics, and data science. Since first convened in 2013, the International MPE Meeting series has grown into a dynamic and dedicated platform for experts from these disciplines to communicate novel findings, discuss new research opportunities and challenges, build professional networks, and educate the next-generation scientists. Herein, we share the proceedings of the Fifth International MPE meeting, held virtually online, on May 24 and 25, 2021. The meeting consisted of 21 presentations organized into the three main themes, which were recent integrative MPE studies, novel cancer profiling technologies, and new statistical and data science approaches.

This report describes blood immune cell characteristics and associated variables prior to surgery among typical glioma patients seen at a large University practice.We analyzed pre-surgery blood samples from 139 glioma patients diagnosed with a new or recurrent grade II/III glioma (LrGG, n = 64) or new glioblastoma (GBM, n = 75) and 454 control participants without glioma. Relative cell fractions of CD4, CD8, B-cells, Natural Killer cells, monocytes, and neutrophils, were estimated via a validated deconvolution algorithm from blood DNA methylation measures from Illumina EPIC arrays.Dexamethasone use at time of blood draw varied by glioma type being highest among patients with IDH wild-type (wt) GBM (75%) and lowest for those with oligodendroglioma (14%). Compared to controls, glioma patients showed statistically significant lower cell fractions for all immune cell subsets except for neutrophils which were higher (all p-values < 0.001), in part because of the higher prevalence of dexamethasone use at time of blood draw for IDHwt GBM. Patients who were taking dexamethasone were more likely to have a low CD4 count (< 200, < 500), increased neutrophils, low absolute lymphocyte counts, higher total cell count and higher NLR.We show that pre-surgery blood immune profiles vary by glioma subtype, age, and more critically, by use of dexamethasone. Our results highlight the importance of considering dexamethasone exposures in all studies of immune profiles and of obtaining immune measures prior to use of dexamethasone, if possible.© 2022.

We conducted a proteome-wide association study (PWAS) in which we integrated human brain proteomes from discovery (Banner; N = 152) and validation (ROSMAP; N = 376) datasets with genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics for 4 SUTs. The 4 samples comprised GWAS of European-ancestry individuals for smoking initiation [Smk] (N = 1,232,091), alcohol use disorder [AUD] (N = 313,959), cannabis use disorder [CUD] (N = 384,032), and opioid use disorder [OUD] (N = 302,585). We conducted transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) with human brain transcriptomic data to examine the overlap of genetic effects at the proteomic and transcriptomic levels and characterize significant genes through conditional, colocalization, and fine-mapping analyses. We identified 27 genes (Smk = 21, AUD = 3, CUD = 2, OUD = 1) that were significantly associated with cis-regulated brain protein abundance. Of these, 7 showed evidence for causality (Smk: NT5C2, GMPPB, NQO1, RHOT2, SRR and ACTR1B; and AUD: CTNND1). Cis-regulated transcript levels for 8 genes (Smk = 6, CUD = 1, OUD = 1) were associated with SUTs, indicating that genetic loci could confer risk for these SUTs by modulating both gene expression and proteomic abundance.

"35933330","Network regression analysis in transcriptome-wide association studies.","BMC Genomics","Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWASs) have shown great promise in interpreting the findings from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) and exploring the disease mechanisms, by integrating GWAS and eQTL mapping studies. Almost all TWAS methods only focus on one gene at a time, with exception of only two published multiple-gene methods nevertheless failing to account for the inter-dependence as well as the network structure among multiple genes, which may lead to power loss in TWAS analysis as complex disease often owe to multiple genes that interact with each other as a biological network. We therefore developed a Network Regression method in a two-stage TWAS framework (NeRiT) to detect whether a given network is associated with the traits of interest. NeRiT adopts the flexible Bayesian Dirichlet process regression to obtain the gene expression prediction weights in the first stage, uses pointwise mutual information to represent the general between-node correlation in the second stage and can effectively take the network structure among different gene nodes into account.Comprehensive and realistic simulations indicated NeRiT had calibrated type I error control for testing both the node effect and edge effect, and yields higher power than the existed methods, especially in testing the edge effect. The results were consistent regardless of the GWAS sample size, the gene expression prediction model in the first step of TWAS, the network structure as well as the correlation pattern among different gene nodes. Real data applications through analyzing systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure from UK Biobank showed that NeRiT can simultaneously identify the trait-related nodes as well as the trait-related edges.NeRiT is a powerful and efficient network regression method in TWAS.© 2022.

However, whether these associations reflect causality remains largely unknown. To understand the genetic structure of the association between decaffeinated coffee consumption (DCC) and neuropsychiatric traits, we examined the genetic correlation, causality, and shared genetic structure between DCC and neuropsychiatric traits using linkage disequilibrium score regression, bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR), and genome-wide cross-trait meta-analysis in large GWAS Consortia for coffee consumption (N= 329,671) and 13 neuropsychiatric traits (sample size ranges from 36,052 to 500,199). We found strong positive genetic correlations between DCC and lifetime cannabis use (LCU; Rg = 0.48,P= 8.40 × 10-19), alcohol use disorder identification test (AUDIT) total score (AUDIT_T; Rg = 0.40,P= 4.63 × 10-13), AUDIT_C score (alcohol consumption component of the AUDIT; Rg = 0.40,P= 5.26 × 10-11), AUDIT_P score (dependence and hazardous-use component of the AUDIT; Rg = 0.28,P= 1.36 × 10-05), and strong negative genetic correlations between DCC and neuroticism (Rg = -0.15,P= 7.27 × 10-05), major depressed diseases (MDD; Rg = -0.15,P= 0.0010), and insomnia (Rg= -0.15,P= 0.0007). In the cross-trait meta-analysis, we identified 6, 5, 1, 1, 2, 31, and 27 shared loci between DCC and Insomnia, LCU, AUDIT_T, AUDIT_C, AUDIT_P, neuroticism, and MDD, respectively, which were mainly enriched in bone marrow, lymph node, cervix, uterine, lung, and thyroid gland tissues, T cell receptor signaling pathway, antigen receptor-mediated signaling pathway, and epigenetic pathways. A large of TWAS-significant associations were identified in tissues that are part of the nervous system, digestive system, and exo-/endocrine system. Our findings further indicated a causal influence of liability to DCC on LCU and low risk of MDD (odds ratio: 0.90,P= 9.06 × 10-5and 1.27,P= 7.63 × 10-4respectively). We also observed that AUDIT_T and AUDIT_C were causally related to DCC (odds ratio: 1.83 per 1-SD increase in AUDIT_T,P= 1.67 × 10-05, 1.80 per 1-SD increase in AUDIT_C,P= 5.09 × 10-04). Meanwhile, insomnia and MDD had a causal negative influence on DCC (OR: 0.91, 95% CI: 0.86-0.95,P= 1.51 × 10-04for Insomnia; OR: 0.93, 95% CI: 0.89-0.99,P= 6.02 × 10-04for MDD). These findings provided evidence for the shared genetic basis and causality between DCC and neuropsychiatric diseases, and advance our understanding of the shared genetic mechanisms underlying their associations, as well as assisting with making recommendations for clinical works or health education.Copyright © 2022 Yin, Wang, Huang and Jia."

The mechanism by which this locus modulates the disease pathology and etiology remains largely under-investigated. This is due to the assumption thatSNCAis the only driver of the functional aspects of several single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) risk-signals at this locus. Recent evidence has shown that the risk associated with the top GWAS-identified variant within this locus is independent ofSNCAexpression, calling into question the validity of assigning function to the nearest gene,SNCA. In this review, we examine additional genes and risk variants present at theSNCAlocus and how they may contribute to Parkinson's disease.

Further comparison of the PWAS and TWAS results in different populations detected the overlapping genes:MADD(pPWAS-Banner= 4.90 × 10-2,pTWAS-Splicing= 1.23 × 10-2) in the total population andGLO1(pPWAS-Banner= 4.89 × 10-3,pTWAS-Rnaseq= 1.41 × 10-3) in females. Brain imaging analysis revealed several different brain imaging phenotypes associated withMADDandGLO1genes. Our study identified multiple candidate genes associated with PTSD in the proteome and transcriptome levels, which may provide new clues to the pathogenesis of PTSD."

Here, we used RNA-seq to quantify gene expression in a collection ofG. arboreumseedlings and performed eGWAS on 28,382 expressed genes. We identified a total of 30,089 eQTLs in 10,485 genes, of which &gt;90% were trans-regulate target genes. Using luciferase assays, we confirmed that different cis-eQTL haplotypes could affect promoter activity. We found ~6600 genes associated with ~1300 eQTL hotspots. Moreover, hotspot 309 regulates the expression of 325 genes with roles in stem length, fresh weight, seed germination rate, and genes related to cell wall biosynthesis and salt stress. Transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) identified 19 candidate genes associated with the cotton growth and salt stress response. The variation in gene expression across the population played an essential role in population differentiation. Only a small number of the differentially expressed genes between South China, the Yangtze River region, and the Yellow River region sites were located in different chromosomal regions. The eQTLs found across the duplicated gene pairs showed conservative cis- or trans- regulation and that the expression levels of gene pairs were correlated. This study provides new insights into the evolution of gene expression regulation in cotton, and identifies eQTLs in stress-related genes for use in breeding improved cotton varieties."
"35885903","Gene-Based Association Tests Using New Polygenic Risk Scores and Incorporating Gene Expression Data.","Genes (Basel)","Recently, gene-based association studies have shown that integrating genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) data can boost statistical power and that the genetic liability of traits can be captured by polygenic risk scores (PRSs). In this paper, we propose a new gene-based statistical method that leverages gene-expression measurements and new PRSs to identify genes that are associated with phenotypes of interest. We used a generalized linear model to associate phenotypes with gene expression and PRSs and used a score-test statistic to test the association between phenotypes and genes. Our simulation studies show that the newly developed method has correct type I error rates and can boost statistical power compared with other methods that use either gene expression or PRS in association tests. A real data analysis figure based on UK Biobank data for asthma shows that the proposed method is applicable to GWAS."
"35882878","Shared mechanisms across the major psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases.","Nat Commun","Several common psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases share epidemiologic risk; however, whether they share pathophysiology is unclear and is the focus of our investigation. Using 25 GWAS results and LD score regression, we find eight significant genetic correlations between psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases. We integrate the GWAS results with human brain transcriptomes (n = 888) and proteomes (n = 722) to identify cis- and trans- transcripts and proteins that are consistent with a pleiotropic or causal role in each disease, referred to as causal proteins for brevity. Within each disease group, we find many distinct and shared causal proteins. Remarkably, 30% (13 of 42) of the neurodegenerative disease causal proteins are shared with psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, we find 2.6-fold more protein-protein interactions among the psychiatric and neurodegenerative causal proteins than expected by chance. Together, our findings suggest these psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases have shared genetic and molecular pathophysiology, which has important ramifications for early treatment and therapeutic development.© 2022.

"35882847","Transcriptomic and proteomic retinal pigment epithelium signatures of age-related macular degeneration.","Nat Commun","There are currently no treatments for geographic atrophy, the advanced form of age-related macular degeneration. Hence, innovative studies are needed to model this condition and prevent or delay its progression. Induced pluripotent stem cells generated from patients with geographic atrophy and healthy individuals were differentiated to retinal pigment epithelium. Integrating transcriptional profiles of 127,659 retinal pigment epithelium cells generated from 43 individuals with geographic atrophy and 36 controls with genotype data, we identify 445 expression quantitative trait loci in cis that are asssociated with disease status and specific to retinal pigment epithelium subpopulations. Transcriptomics and proteomics approaches identify molecular pathways significantly upregulated in geographic atrophy, including in mitochondrial functions, metabolic pathways and extracellular cellular matrix reorganization. Five significant protein quantitative trait loci that regulate protein expression in the retinal pigment epithelium and in geographic atrophy are identified - two of which share variants with cis- expression quantitative trait loci, including proteins involved in mitochondrial biology and neurodegeneration. Investigation of mitochondrial metabolism confirms mitochondrial dysfunction as a core constitutive difference of the retinal pigment epithelium from patients with geographic atrophy. This study uncovers important differences in retinal pigment epithelium homeostasis associated with geographic atrophy.© 2022. The Author(s)."

Here we perform expression quantitative trait locus mapping of negatively selected Natural Killer cells from a population of healthy Europeans (n = 245). We find a significant subset of genes demonstrate expression quantitative trait loci specific to Natural Killer cells and these are highly informative of human disease, in particular autoimmunity. A Natural Killer cell transcriptome-wide association study across five common autoimmune diseases identifies further novel associations at 27 genes. In addition to these cis observations, we find novel master-regulatory regions impacting expression of trans gene networks at regions including 19q13.4, the Killer cell Immunoglobulin-like Receptor region, GNLY, MC1R and UVSSA.

Although genome-wide association studies have effectively identified the genetic basis of CRC, there is still unexplained variability in genetic risk. Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) integrate summary statistics from CRC genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with gene expression data to prioritize these GWAS findings and uncover additional gene-trait correlations.First, we carried out a post-GWAS analysis using summary statistics from a large-scale GWAS of CRC (n= 4,562 cases,n= 382,756 controls). Second, combined with the expression weight sets from GTEx (v7), susceptibility genes were identified with the FUSION software. Colocalization, conditional and fine-mapping analyses, phenome-wide association study (pheWAS), and Mendelian randomization were employed to further characterize the observed correlations.In the post-GWAS analyses, we first identified new genome-wide significant associations: three genomic risk loci were identified at 8q24.21 (rs6983267,P= 6.98 × 10-12), 15q13.3 (rs58658771,P= 1.40 × 10-10), and 18q21.1 (rs6507874,P= 1.91 × 10-14). In addition, the TWAS also identified four loci statistically significantly associated with CRC risk, largely explained by expression regulation, including six candidate genes (DUSP10,POU5F1B,C11orf53,COLCA1,COLCA2, andGREM1-AS1). We further discovered evidence that low expression ofCOLCA2is correlated with CRC risk with Mendelian randomization.We discovered novel CRC risk loci and candidate functional genes by merging gene expression and GWAS summary data, offering new insight into the molecular processes underlying CRC development. This makes it easier to prioritize potential genes for follow-up functional research in CRC.Copyright © 2022 Ruimin Yin et al."
"35787630","Sex differences in heart mitochondria regulate diastolic dysfunction.","Nat Commun","Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) exhibits a sex bias, being more common in women than men, and we hypothesize that mitochondrial sex differences might underlie this bias. As part of genetic studies of heart failure in mice, we observe that heart mitochondrial DNA levels and function tend to be reduced in females as compared to males. We also observe that expression of genes encoding mitochondrial proteins are higher in males than females in human cohorts. We test our hypothesis in a panel of genetically diverse inbred strains of mice, termed the Hybrid Mouse Diversity Panel (HMDP). Indeed, we find that mitochondrial gene expression is highly correlated with diastolic function, a key trait in HFpEF. Consistent with this, studies of a ""two-hit"" mouse model of HFpEF confirm that mitochondrial function differs between sexes and is strongly associated with a number of HFpEF traits. By integrating data from human heart failure and the mouse HMDP cohort, we identify the mitochondrial gene Acsl6 as a genetic determinant of diastolic function. We validate its role in HFpEF using adenoviral over-expression in the heart. We conclude that sex differences in mitochondrial function underlie, in part, the sex bias in diastolic function.© 2022.

WhetherALPK3is also implicated in HCM in East Asia and the effect of missense variants inALPK3on HCM remains unresolved.We compared the frequency of rare deleterious variants inALPK3in a study cohort comprised of 793 HCM cases of East Asian descent to that in the controls subset of Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD). Gene burden test was used to assess this association. The involvement of these variants in HCM was further validated by independent cohort. The clinical characteristics and prognoses of these carriers were compared with sarcomere-positive and negative patients.Rare deleterious variants inALPK3were significantly enriched in HCM compared with gnomAD controls (truncating: 4/793 vs. 4/4523,P= 0.02; missense: 25/793 vs. 46/4523,P= 2.56e-5).

"35782115","Current State and Challenges of the Global Outcomes of Dental Caries Research in the Meta-Omics Era.","Front Cell Infect Microbiol","Despite significant healthcare advances in the 21stcentury, the exact etiology of dental caries remains unsolved. The past two decades have witnessed a tremendous growth in our understanding of dental caries amid the advent of revolutionary omics technologies. Accordingly, a consensus has been reached that dental caries is a community-scale metabolic disorder, and its etiology is beyond a single causative organism. This conclusion was based on a variety of microbiome studies following the flow of information along the central dogma of biology from genomic data to the end products of metabolism. These studies were facilitated by the unprecedented growth of the next- generation sequencing tools and omics techniques, such as metagenomics and metatranscriptomics, to estimate the community composition of oral microbiome and its functional potential. Furthermore, the rapidly evolving proteomics and metabolomics platforms, including nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and/or mass spectrometry coupled with chromatography, have enabled precise quantification of the translational outcomes. Although the majority supports 'conserved functional changes' as indicators of dysbiosis, it remains unclear how caries dynamics impact the microbiota functions and vice versa, over the course of disease onset and progression. What compounds the situation is the host-microbiota crosstalk. Genome-wide association studies have been undertaken to elucidate the interaction of host genetic variation with the microbiome. However, these studies are challenged by the complex interaction of host genetics and environmental factors. All these complementary approaches need to be orchestrated to capture the key players in this multifactorial disease. Herein, we critically review the milestones in caries research focusing on the state-of-art singular and integrative omics studies, supplemented with a bibliographic network analysis to address the oral microbiome, the host factors, and their interactions. Additionally, we highlight gaps in the dental literature and shed light on critical future research questions and study designs that could unravel the complexities of dental caries, the most globally widespread disease.Copyright © 2022 Moussa, Ahmad, Mansour and Siqueira."

However, difficulties remain in the extrication of important and biologically relevant data from genetic discoveries related to psychiatric disorders such as BIP. There is an urgent need for an integrated and comprehensive online database with unified access to genetic and multi-omics data for in-depth data mining. Here, we developed the dbBIP, a database for BIP genetic research based on published data. The dbBIP consists of several modules, i.e.: (i) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) module, containing large-scale GWAS genetic summary statistics and functional annotation information relevant to risk variants; (ii) gene module, containing BIP-related candidate risk genes from various sources and (iii) analysis module, providing a simple and user-friendly interface to analyze one's own data. We also conducted extensive analyses, including functional SNP annotation, integration (including summary-data-based Mendelian randomization and transcriptome-wide association studies), co-expression, gene expression, tissue expression, protein-protein interaction and brain expression quantitative trait loci analyses, thus shedding light on the genetic causes of BIP. Finally, we developed a graphical browser with powerful search tools to facilitate data navigation and access.

We aimed to clarify this association using a genome-wide cross-trait approach.Summary statistics from the hitherto largest genome-wide association studies conducted for type 2 diabetes, type 2 diabetes mellitus adjusted for BMI (T2DMadjBMI), fasting glucose, fasting insulin, 2h glucose after an oral glucose challenge (all adjusted for BMI), HbA1cand PCOS, all in populations of European ancestry, were used. We quantified overall and local genetic correlations, identified pleiotropic loci and expression-trait associations, and made causal inferences across traits.A positive overall genetic correlation between type 2 diabetes and PCOS was observed, largely influenced by BMI (rg=0.31, p=1.63×10-8) but also independent of BMI (T2DMadjBMI-PCOS: rg=0.12, p=0.03). Sixteen pleiotropic loci affecting type 2 diabetes, glycaemic traits and PCOS were identified, suggesting mechanisms of association that are independent of BMI. Two shared expression-trait associations were found for type 2 diabetes/T2DMadjBMI and PCOS targeting tissues of the cardiovascular, exocrine/endocrine and digestive systems. A putative causal effect of fasting insulin adjusted for BMI and type 2 diabetes on PCOS was demonstrated.We found a genetic link underlying type 2 diabetes, glycaemic traits and PCOS, driven by both biological pleiotropy and causal mediation, some of which is independent of BMI. Our findings highlight the importance of controlling fasting insulin levels to mitigate the risk of PCOS, as well as screening for and long-term monitoring of type 2 diabetes in all women with PCOS, irrespective of BMI.© 2022.

In this study, we use genome-wide meta-analysis of lifetime pneumonia diagnosis (N = 391,044) to identify four association signals outside of the previously implicated major histocompatibility complex region. Integrative analyses and finemapping of these signals support clinically tractable targets, including the mucin MUC5AC and tumour necrosis factor receptor superfamily member TNFRSF1A. Moreover, we demonstrate widespread evidence of genetic overlap with pneumonia susceptibility across the human phenome, including particularly significant correlations with psychiatric phenotypes that remain significant after testing differing phenotype definitions for pneumonia or genetically conditioning on smoking behaviour. Finally, we show how polygenic risk could be utilised for precision treatment formulation or drug repurposing through pneumonia risk scores constructed using variants mapped to pathways with known drug targets.

We employed an integrative analytical pipeline to efficiently transform genetic associations to identify novel proteins for lacunar stroke.We systematically integrated lacunar stroke genome-wide association study (GWAS) (N=7338) with human brain proteomes (N=376) to perform proteome-wide association studies (PWAS), Mendelian randomization (MR), and Bayesian colocalization. We also used an independent human brain proteomic dataset (N=152) to annotate the new genes.We found that the protein abundance of seven genes (ICA1L, CAND2, ALDH2, MADD, MRVI1, CSPG4, and PTPN11) in the brain was associated with lacunar stroke. These seven genes were mainly expressed on the surface of glutamatergic neurons, GABAergic neurons, and astrocytes. Three genes (ICA1L, CAND2, ALDH2) were causal in lacunar stroke (P < 0.05/proteins identified for PWAS; posterior probability of hypothesis 4 ≥ 75 % for Bayesian colocalization), and they were linked with lacunar stroke in confirmatory PWAS and independent MR. We also found that ICA1L is related to lacunar stroke at the brain transcriptome level.Our present proteomic findings have identified ICA1L, CAND2, and ALDH2 as compelling genes that may give key hints for future functional research and possible therapeutic targets for lacunar stroke.© 2022.

In addition, the genetic determinants underlying LBD and the shared genetic etiology with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) remain poorly understood.Using the largest GWAS summary statistics of LBD to date (2591 cases and 4027 controls), late-onset AD (86,531 cases and 676,386 controls), and PD (33,674 cases and 449,056 controls), we comprehensively investigated the genetic basis of LBD and shared genetic etiology among LBD, AD, and PD. We first conducted genetic correlation analysis using linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC), followed by multi-trait analysis of GWAS (MTAG) and association analysis based on SubSETs (ASSET) to identify the trait-specific SNPs. We then performed SNP-level functional annotation to identify significant genomic risk loci paired with Bayesian fine-mapping and colocalization analysis to identify potential causal variants. Parallel gene-level analysis including GCTA-fastBAT and transcriptome-wide association analysis (TWAS) was implemented to explore novel LBD-associated genes, followed by pathway enrichment analysis to understand underlying biological mechanisms.Pairwise LDSC analysis found positive genome-wide genetic correlations between LBD and AD (rg = 0.6603, se = 0.2001; P = 0.0010), between LBD and PD (rg = 0.6352, se = 0.1880; P = 0.0007), and between AD and PD (rg = 0.2136, se = 0.0860; P = 0.0130). We identified 13 significant loci for LBD, including 5 previously reported loci (1q22, 2q14.3, 4p16.3, 4q22.1, and 19q13.32) and 8 novel biologically plausible genetic associations (5q12.1, 5q33.3, 6p21.1, 8p23.1, 8p21.1, 16p11.2, 17p12, and 17q21.31), among which APOC1 (19q13.32), SNCA (4q22.1), TMEM175 (4p16.3), CLU (8p21.1), MAPT (17q21.31), and FBXL19 (16p11.2) were also validated by gene-level analysis. Pathway enrichment analysis of 40 common genes identified by GCTA-fastBAT and TWAS implicated significant role of neurofibrillary tangle assembly (GO:1902988, adjusted P = 1.55 × 10-2).Our findings provide novel insights into the genetic determinants of LBD and the shared genetic etiology and biological mechanisms of LBD, AD, and PD, which could benefit the understanding of the co-pathology as well as the potential treatment of these diseases simultaneously.© 2022.

This study performs the largest genetic analysis of prospectively assessed antidepressant response in major depressive disorder to gain insight into the underlying biology and enable out-of-sample prediction.Genome-wide analysis of remission (nremit = 1852,nnonremit = 3299) and percentage improvement (n = 5218) was performed. Single nucleotide polymorphism-based heritability was estimated using genome-wide complex trait analysis. Genetic covariance with eight mental health phenotypes was estimated using polygenic scores/AVENGEME. Out-of-sample prediction of antidepressant response polygenic scores was assessed. Gene-level association analysis was performed using MAGMA and transcriptome-wide association study. Tissue, pathway, and drug binding enrichment were estimated using MAGMA.Neither genome-wide association study identified genome-wide significant associations. Single nucleotide polymorphism-based heritability was significantly different from zero for remission (h2 = 0.132, SE = 0.056) but not for percentage improvement (h2 = -0.018, SE = 0.032). Better antidepressant response was negatively associated with genetic risk for schizophrenia and positively associated with genetic propensity for educational attainment. Leave-one-out validation of antidepressant response polygenic scores demonstrated significant evidence of out-of-sample prediction, though results varied in external cohorts. Gene-based analyses identifiedETV4andDHX8as significantly associated with antidepressant response.This study demonstrates that antidepressant response is influenced by common genetic variation, has a genetic overlap schizophrenia and educational attainment, and provides a useful resource for future research.

Then, we downloaded gene expression data of individuals with hepatocellular carcinoma from TCGA database to conduct differential expression analysis to validate these identified genes and explored their possible role in driving cirrhosis via functional enrichment and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA).Results:We identified 10 significant genes (SKIV2L,JPH4,UQCC2,RP11-91I8.3,MAU2,ERAP1,PUS3,ZNF677,ARHGAP40, andSHANK3) associated with cirrhosis at a Bonferroni-corrected threshold ofp< 0.01, among which two (SKIV2LandJPH4) were identified in the liver and five (SKIV2L,JPH4,MAU2,SHANK3, andUQCC2) were validated by differential expression analysis at an FDR-corrected threshold ofp< 0.01. The enrichment analysis showed that the degradation process of RNA, which is enriched by 58 genes, is significantly under-enriched in liver cancer tissues (p= 0.0268).Conclusion:We have identified several candidate genes for cirrhosis in multiple tissues and performed differential genetic analysis using the liver cancer database to verify the significant genes. We found that the genesSKIV2LandJPH4identified in the liver are of particular concern.

"35627314","Tissue-Specific Variations in Transcription Factors Elucidate Complex Immune System Regulation.","Genes (Basel)","Gene expression plays a key role in health and disease. Estimating the genetic components underlying gene expression can thus help understand disease etiology. Polygenic models termed ""transcriptome imputation"" are used to estimate the genetic component of gene expression, but these models typically consider only thecisregions of the gene. However, thesecis-based models miss large variability in expression for multiple genes. Transcription factors (TFs) that regulate gene expression are natural candidates for looking for additional sources of the missing variability. We developed a hypothesis-driven approach to identify second-tier regulation by variability in TFs. Our approach tested two models representing possible mechanisms by which variations in TFs can affect gene expression: variability in the expression of the TF and genetic variants within the TF that may affect the binding affinity of the TF to the TF-binding site. We tested our TF models in whole blood and skeletal muscle tissues and identified TF variability that can partially explain missing gene expression for 1035 genes, 76% of which explains more than thecis-based models. While the discovered regulation patterns were tissue-specific, they were both enriched for immune system functionality, elucidating complex regulation patterns. Our hypothesis-driven approach is useful for identifying tissue-specific genetic regulation patterns involving variations in TF expression or binding."

These include polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, arsenic, pesticides, maternal hyperthermia and antibiotics as well as pain and seizure medication. With an increase in understanding of teratogens leading to NTD formation, preventative and treatment approaches have witnessed great advances throughout the years. While the most common preventative approach includes folic acid food fortification as well as suggested inositol supplementation, treatment and management approaches differ greatly depending on the developmental stage and the site of the lesion and include prenatal surgery, stem cell transplantation and postnatal surgery. Because NTDs still represent a large health and financial burden for the patient and society as a whole, it is crucial to investigate potential risk factors and develop novel approaches in order to fully prevent this category of disorders."
"35864192","Hijacking of transcriptional condensates by endogenous retroviruses.","Nat Genet","Most endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) in mammals are incapable of retrotransposition; therefore, why ERV derepression is associated with lethality during early development has been a mystery. Here, we report that rapid and selective degradation of the heterochromatin adapter protein TRIM28 triggers dissociation of transcriptional condensates from loci encoding super-enhancer (SE)-driven pluripotency genes and their association with transcribed ERV loci in murine embryonic stem cells. Knockdown of ERV RNAs or forced expression of SE-enriched transcription factors rescued condensate localization at SEs in TRIM28-degraded cells. In a biochemical reconstitution system, ERV RNA facilitated partitioning of RNA polymerase II and the Mediator coactivator into phase-separated droplets. In TRIM28 knockout mouse embryos, single-cell RNA-seq analysis revealed specific depletion of pluripotent lineages. We propose that coding and noncoding nascent RNAs, including those produced by retrotransposons, may facilitate 'hijacking' of transcriptional condensates in various developmental and disease contexts.© 2022.

"35585611","Differentially methylated CpGs in response to growth hormone administration in children with idiopathic short stature.","Clin Epigenetics","Recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) has shown a great growth-promoting potential in children with idiopathic short stature (ISS). However, the response to rhGH differs across individuals, largely due to genetic and epigenetic heterogeneity. Since epigenetic marks on the methylome can be dynamically influenced by GH, we performed a comprehensive pharmacoepigenomics analysis of DNA methylation changes associated with long-term rhGH administration in children with ISS.We measured DNA methylation profiles before and after GH treatment (with a duration of ~ 18 months in average) on 47 healthy children using customized methylC-seq capture sequencing. Their changes were compared and associated with changes in plasma IGF1 by adjusting sex, age, treatment duration and estimated blood proportions. We observed a considerable inter-individual heterogeneity of DNA methylation changes responding to GH treatment. We identified 267 response-associated differentially methylated cytosines (DMCs) that were enriched in promoter regions, CpG islands and blood cell-type-specific regulatory elements. Furthermore, the genes associated with these DMCs were enriched in the biology process of ""cell development,"" ""neuron differentiation"" and ""developmental growth,"" and in the TGF-beta signaling pathway, PPAR Alpha pathway, endoderm differentiation pathway, adipocytokine signaling pathway as well as PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, and cAMP signaling pathway.Our study provides a first insight in DNA methylation changes associated with rhGH administration, which may help understand mechanisms of epigenetic regulation on GH-responsive genes.© 2022.

Here, we performed transcriptome and chromatin accessibility profiling in primary human microglia from 150 donors to identify genetically driven variation and cell-specific enhancer-promoter (E-P) interactions. Integrative fine-mapping analysis identified putative regulatory mechanisms for 21 AD risk loci, of which 18 were refined to a single gene, including 3 new candidate risk genes (KCNN4, FIBP and LRRC25). Transcription factor regulatory networks captured AD risk variation and identified SPI1 as a key putative regulator of microglia expression and AD risk. This comprehensive resource capturing variation in the human microglia regulome provides insights into the etiology of neurodegenerative disease.© 2022.

"35922514","RNA editing underlies genetic risk of common inflammatory diseases.","Nature","A major challenge in human genetics is to identify the molecular mechanisms of trait-associated and disease-associated variants. To achieve this, quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping of genetic variants with intermediate molecular phenotypes such as gene expression and splicing have been widely adopted1,2. However, despite successes, the molecular basis for a considerable fraction of trait-associated and disease-associated variants remains unclear3,4. Here we show that ADAR-mediated adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing, a post-transcriptional event vital for suppressing cellular double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-mediated innate immune interferon responses5-11, is an important potential mechanism underlying genetic variants associated with common inflammatory diseases. We identified and characterized 30,319 cis-RNA editing QTLs (edQTLs) across 49 human tissues. These edQTLs were significantly enriched in genome-wide association study signals for autoimmune and immune-mediated diseases. Colocalization analysis of edQTLs with disease risk loci further pinpointed key, putatively immunogenic dsRNAs formed by expected inverted repeat Alu elements as well as unexpected, highly over-represented cis-natural antisense transcripts. Furthermore, inflammatory disease risk variants, in aggregate, were associated with reduced editing of nearby dsRNAs and induced interferon responses in inflammatory diseases. This unique directional effect agrees with the established mechanism that lack of RNA editing by ADAR1 leads to the specific activation of the dsRNA sensor MDA5 and subsequent interferon responses and inflammation7-9. Our findings implicate cellular dsRNA editing and sensing as a previously underappreciated mechanism of common inflammatory diseases.© 2022.

We pinpoint the likely causal variants and those that have effects on amino acid sequence or cerebellar gene-expression. Additionally, 85 genome-wide significant genes were detected and tested for convergence onto biological pathways, cerebellar cell types, human evolutionary genes or developmental stages. Local genetic correlations between cerebellar volume and neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders reveal shared loci with Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia.

However, the extent of pleiotropic mechanisms across ocular diseases remains unclear. We aim to examine shared genetic etiology in age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic retinopathy (DR), glaucoma, retinal detachment (RD), and myopia.We analyzed genome-wide association analyses for the five ocular diseases in 43,877 cases and 44,373 controls of European ancestry from UK Biobank, estimated their genetic relationships (LDSC, GNOVA, and Genomic SEM), and identified pleiotropic loci (ASSET and METASOFT).The genetic correlation of common SNPs revealed a meaningful genetic structure within these diseases, identifying genetic correlations between AMD, DR, and glaucoma. Cross-trait meta-analysis identified 23 pleiotropic loci associated with at least two ocular diseases and 14 loci unique to individual disorders (non-pleiotropic). We found that the genes associated with these shared genetic loci are involved in neuron differentiation (P = 8.80 × 10-6) and eye development systems (P = 3.86 × 10-5), and single cell RNA sequencing data reveals their heightened gene expression from multipotent progenitors to other differentiated retinal cells during retina developmental process.These results highlighted the potential common genetic architectures among these ocular diseases and can deepen the understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the related diseases.The National Natural Science Foundation of China (61871294), Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China (LR19C060001), and the Scientific Research Foundation for Talents of Wenzhou Medical University (QTJ18023).Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

Previous genome-wide association studies with up to 1.3 million subjects identified over 200 associated loci. This extreme polygenicity suggested that many more loci remain to be discovered. The current study almost doubled the sample size to 593,724 cases and 1,771,286 controls, thereby increasing statistical power, and identified 554 risk loci (including 364 novel loci). To capitalize on this large number of loci, we propose a novel strategy to prioritize genes using external biological resources and functional interactions between genes across risk loci. Of all 3,898 genes naively implicated from the risk loci, we prioritize 289 and find brain-tissue expression specificity and enrichment in specific gene sets of synaptic signaling functions and neuronal differentiation. We show that this novel gene prioritization strategy yields specific hypotheses on underlying mechanisms of insomnia that would have been missed by traditional approaches.© 2022.

"35754110","Genetic trade-offs between complex diseases and longevity.","Aging Cell","Longevity was influenced by many complex diseases and traits. However, the relationships between human longevity and genetic risks of complex diseases were not broadly studied. Here, we constructed polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for 225 complex diseases/traits and evaluated their relationships with human longevity in a cohort with 2178 centenarians and 2299 middle-aged individuals. Lower genetic risks of stroke and hypotension were observed in centenarians, while higher genetic risks of schizophrenia (SCZ) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) were detected in long-lived individuals. We further stratified PRSs into cell-type groups and significance-level groups. The results showed that the immune component of SCZ genetic risk was positively linked to longevity, and the renal component of T2D genetic risk was the most deleterious. Additionally, SNPs with very small p-values (p ≤ 1x10-5) for SCZ and T2D were negatively correlated with longevity. While for the less significant SNPs (1x10-5 < p ≤ 0.05), their effects on disease and longevity were positively correlated. Overall, we identified genetically informed positive and negative factors for human longevity, gained more insights on the accumulation of disease risk alleles during evolution, and provided evidence for the theory of genetic trade-offs between complex diseases and longevity.© 2022 The Authors.

Here, we systematically delineate the acute innate immune response to endotoxin in terms of human macrophage enhancer activity and contrast with endotoxin tolerance, profiling the coding and non-coding transcriptome, chromatin accessibility and epigenetic modifications.We describe the spectrum of enhancers under acute and tolerance conditions and the regulatory networks between these enhancers and biological processes including gene expression, splicing regulation, transcription factor binding and enhancer RNA signatures. We demonstrate that the vast majority of differentially regulated enhancers on acute stimulation are subject to tolerance and that expression quantitative trait loci, disease-risk variants and eRNAs are enriched in these regulatory regions and related to context-specific gene expression. We find enrichment for context-specific eQTL involving endotoxin response and specific infections and delineate specific differential regions informative for GWAS variants in inflammatory bowel disease and multiple sclerosis, together with a context-specific enhancer involving a bacterial infection eQTL for KLF4. We show enrichment in differential enhancers for tolerance involving transcription factors NFκB-p65, STATs and IRFs and prioritize putative causal genes directly linking genetic variants and disease risk enhancers.

"35750789","Integrating variant functional annotation scores have varied abilities to improve power of genome-wide association studies.","Sci Rep","Functional annotations have the potential to increase power of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) by prioritizing variants according to their biological function, but this potential has not been well studied. We comprehensively evaluated all 1132 traits in the UK Biobank whose SNP-heritability estimates were given ""medium"" or ""high"" labels by Neale's lab. For each trait, we integrated GWAS summary statistics of close to 8 million common variants (minor allele frequency [Formula: see text]) with either their 75 individual functional scores or their meta-scores, using three different data-integration methods. Overall, the number of new genome-wide significant findings after data-integration increases as a trait SNP-heritability estimate increases. However, there is a trade-off between new findings and loss of baseline GWAS findings, resulting in similar total numbers of significant findings between using GWAS alone and integrating GWAS with functional scores, across all 1132 traits analyzed and all three data-integration methods considered. Our findings suggest that, even with the current biobank-level sample size, more informative functional scores and/or new data-integration methods are needed to further improve the power of GWAS of common variants. For example, studying variants in coding sequence and obtaining cell-type-specific scores are potential future directions.© 2022. The Author(s)."

We present a multiomic analysis using machine learning to characterize the genomic basis of COVID-19 severity. We use single-cell multiome profiling of human lungs to link genetic signals to cell-type-specific functions. We discover >1,000 risk genes across 19 cell types, which account for 77% of the SNP-based heritability for severe disease. Genetic risk is particularly focused within natural killer (NK) cells and T cells, placing the dysfunction of these cells upstream of severe disease. Mendelian randomization and single-cell profiling of human NK cells support the role of NK cells and further localize genetic risk to CD56brightNK cells, which are key cytokine producers during the innate immune response. Rare variant analysis confirms the enrichment of severe-disease-associated genetic variation within NK-cell risk genes.

"35663941","Lessons From Transcriptome Analysis of Autoimmune Diseases.","Front Immunol","Various immune cell types, including monocytes, macrophages, and adaptive immune T and B cells, play major roles in inflammation in systemic autoimmune diseases. However, the precise contribution of these cells to autoimmunity remains elusive. Transcriptome analysis has added a new dimension to biology and medicine. It enables us to observe the dynamics of gene expression in different cell types in patients with diverse diseases as well as in healthy individuals, which cannot be achieved with genomic information alone. In this review, we summarize how transcriptome analysis has improved our understanding of the pathological roles of immune cells in autoimmune diseases with a focus on the ImmuNexUT database we reported. We will also discuss the common experimental and analytical design of transcriptome analyses. Recently, single-cell RNA-seq analysis has provided atlases of infiltrating immune cells, such as pro-inflammatory monocytes and macrophages, peripheral helper T cells, and age or autoimmune-associated B cells in various autoimmune disease lesions. With the integration of genomic data, expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis can help identify candidate causal genes and immune cells. Finally, we also mention how the information obtained from these analyses can be used practically to predict patient prognosis.Copyright © 2022 Nagafuchi, Yanaoka and Fujio."
"35653391","Using genetic variation to disentangle the complex relationship between food intake and health outcomes.","PLoS Genet","Diet is considered as one of the most important modifiable factors influencing human health, but efforts to identify foods or dietary patterns associated with health outcomes often suffer from biases, confounding, and reverse causation. Applying Mendelian randomization in this context may provide evidence to strengthen causality in nutrition research. To this end, we first identified 283 genetic markers associated with dietary intake in 445,779 UK Biobank participants. We then converted these associations into direct genetic effects on food exposures by adjusting them for effects mediated via other traits. The SNPs which did not show evidence of mediation were then used for MR, assessing the association between genetically predicted food choices and other risk factors, health outcomes. We show that using all associated SNPs without omitting those which show evidence of mediation, leads to biases in downstream analyses (genetic correlations, causal inference), similar to those present in observational studies. However, MR analyses using SNPs which have only a direct effect on the exposure on food exposures provided unequivocal evidence of causal associations between specific eating patterns and obesity, blood lipid status, and several other risk factors and health outcomes."

However, most eQTL networks use binary edge weights based on thresholded FDR estimates: definitions that influence reproducibility and downstream analyses. We constructed twenty-nine tissue-specific eQTL networks using GTEx data and evaluated a comprehensive set of network specifications based on false discovery rates, test statistics, and p values, focusing on the degree centrality-a metric of an SNP or gene node's potential network influence. We found a thresholded Benjamini-Hochberg q value weighted by the Z-statistic balances metric reproducibility and computational efficiency. Our estimated gene degrees positively correlate with gene degrees in gene regulatory networks, demonstrating that these networks are complementary in understanding regulation. Gene degrees also correlate with genetic diversity, and heritability analyses show that highly connected nodes are enriched for tissue-relevant traits.© 2022 The Author(s)."

We identified four genome-wide significant loci for childhood ADHD and one for late-diagnosed ADHD. We found increased polygenic scores for ADHD in persistent ADHD compared with the other two groups. Childhood ADHD had higher genetic overlap with hyperactivity and autism compared with late-diagnosed ADHD and the highest burden of rare protein-truncating variants in evolutionarily constrained genes. Late-diagnosed ADHD had a larger genetic overlap with depression than childhood ADHD and no increased burden in rare protein-truncating variants. Overall, these results suggest a genetic influence on age at first ADHD diagnosis, persistence of ADHD and the different comorbidity patterns among the groups.© 2022.

"35923706","A Principal Component Informed Approach to Address Polygenic Risk Score Transferability Across European Cohorts.","Front Genet","One important confounder in genome-wide association studies (GWASs) is population genetic structure, which may generate spurious associations if not properly accounted for. This may ultimately result in a biased polygenic risk score (PRS) prediction, especially when applied to another population. To explore this matter, we focused on principal component analysis (PCA) and asked whether a population genetics informed strategy focused on PCs derived from an external reference population helps in mitigating this PRS transferability issue. Throughout the study, we used two complex model traits, height and body mass index, and samples from UK and Estonian Biobanks. We aimed to investigate 1) whether using a reference population (1000G) for computation of the PCs adjusted for in the discovery cohort improves the resulting PRS performance in a target set from another population and 2) whether adjusting the validation model for PCs is required at all. Our results showed that any other set of PCs performed worse than the one computed on samples from the same population as the discovery dataset. Furthermore, we show that PC correction in GWAS cannot prevent residual population structure information in the PRS, also for non-structured traits. Therefore, we confirm the utility of PC correction in the validation model when the investigated trait shows an actual correlation with population genetic structure, to account for the residual confounding effect when evaluating the predictive value of PRS.Copyright © 2022 Pärna, Nolte, Snieder, Fischer, Marnetto and Pagani."

We present genome-wide associations of ascending and descending aortic distensibility and area derived from cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data of up to 32,590 Caucasian individuals in UK Biobank. We identify 102 loci (including 27 novel associations) tagging genes related to cardiovascular development, extracellular matrix production, smooth muscle cell contraction and heritable aortic diseases. Functional analyses highlight four signalling pathways associated with aortic distensibility (TGF-β, IGF, VEGF and PDGF). We identify distinct sex-specific associations with aortic traits. We develop co-expression networks associated with aortic traits and apply phenome-wide Mendelian randomization (MR-PheWAS), generating evidence for a causal role for aortic distensibility in development of aortic aneurysms. Multivariable MR suggests a causal relationship between aortic distensibility and cerebral white matter hyperintensities, mechanistically linking aortic traits and brain small vessel disease.© 2022.

"35915156","Large-scale genome-wide association study of coronary artery disease in genetically diverse populations.","Nat Med","We report a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of coronary artery disease (CAD) incorporating nearly a quarter of a million cases, in which existing studies are integrated with data from cohorts of white, Black and Hispanic individuals from the Million Veteran Program. We document near equivalent heritability of CAD across multiple ancestral groups, identify 95 novel loci, including nine on the X chromosome, detect eight loci of genome-wide significance in Black and Hispanic individuals, and demonstrate that two common haplotypes at the 9p21 locus are responsible for risk stratification in all populations except those of African origin, in which these haplotypes are virtually absent. Moreover, in the largest GWAS for angiographically derived coronary atherosclerosis performed to date, we find 15 loci of genome-wide significance that robustly overlap with established loci for clinical CAD. Phenome-wide association analyses of novel loci and polygenic risk scores (PRSs) augment signals related to insulin resistance, extend pleiotropic associations of these loci to include smoking and family history, and precisely document the markedly reduced transferability of existing PRSs to Black individuals. Downstream integrative analyses reinforce the critical roles of vascular endothelial, fibroblast, and smooth muscle cells in CAD susceptibility, but also point to a shared biology between atherosclerosis and oncogenesis. This study highlights the value of diverse populations in further characterizing the genetic architecture of CAD.© 2022.

"35897312","Telomere Length and Hearing Loss: A Two-Sample Mendelian Randomization.","Int J Environ Res Public Health","Observational studies have suggested that there may be an association between telomere length (TL) and hearing loss (HL). However, inferring causality from observational studies is subject to residual confounding effects, reverse causation, and bias. This study adopted a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) approach to evaluate the causal relationship between TL and increased risk of HL.A total of 16 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with TL were identified from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis of 78,592 European participants and applied to our modeling as instrumental variables. Summary-level data for hearing loss (HL), age-related hearing loss (ARHL), and noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) were obtained from the recent largest available GWAS and five MR analyses were used to investigate the potential causal association of genetically predicted TL with increased risk for HL, including the inverse-variance-weighted (IVW), weighted median, MR-Egger regression, simple mode, and weighted mode. In addition, sensitivity analysis, pleiotropy, and heterogeneity tests were also used to evaluate the robustness of our findings.There was no causal association between genetically predicted TL and HL or its subtypes (by the IVW method, HL: odds ratio (OR) = 1.216,p= 0.382; ARHL: OR = 0.934,p= 0.928; NIHL: OR = 1.003,p= 0.776). Although heterogenous sites rs2736176, rs3219104, rs8105767, and rs2302588 were excluded for NIHL, the second MR analysis was consistent with the first analysis (OR = 1.003,p= 0.572).There was no clear causal relationship between shorter TLs and increased risk of HL or its subtypes in this dataset."
"35873490","Comparison of Methods Utilizing Sex-Specific PRSs Derived From GWAS Summary Statistics.","Front Genet","The polygenic risk score (PRS) is calculated as the weighted sum of an individual's genotypes and their estimated effect sizes, which is often used to estimate an individual's genetic susceptibility to complex traits and disorders. It is well known that some complex human traits or disorders have sex differences in trait distributions, disease onset, progression, and treatment response, although the underlying mechanisms causing these sex differences remain largely unknown. PRSs for these traits are often based on Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) data with both male and female samples included, ignoring sex differences. In this study, we present a benchmark study using both simulations with various combinations of genetic correlation and sample size ratios between sexes and real data to investigate whether combining sex-specific PRSs can outperform sex-agnostic PRSs on traits showing sex differences. We consider two types of PRS models in our study: single-population PRS models (PRScs, LDpred2) and multiple-population PRS models (PRScsx). For each trait or disorder, the candidate PRSs were calculated based on sex-specific GWAS data and sex-agnostic GWAS data. The simulation results show that applying LDpred2 or PRScsx to sex-specific GWAS data and then combining sex-specific PRSs leads to the highest prediction accuracy when the genetic correlation between sexes is low and the sample sizes for both sexes are balanced and large. Otherwise, the PRS generated by applying LDpred2 or PRScs to sex-agnostic GWAS data is more appropriate. If the sample sizes between sexes are not too small and very unbalanced, combining LDpred2-based sex-specific PRSs to predict on the sex with a larger sample size and combining PRScsx-based sex-specific PRSs to predict on the sex with a smaller size are the preferred strategies. For real data, we considered 19 traits from Genetic Investigation of ANthropometric Traits (GIANT) consortium studies and UK Biobank with both sex-specific GWAS data and sex-agnostic GWAS data. We found that for waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) related traits, accounting for sex differences and incorporating information from the opposite sex could help improve PRS prediction accuracy. Taken together, our findings in this study provide guidance on how to calculate the best PRS for sex-differentiated traits or disorders, especially as the sample size of GWASs grows in the future.Copyright © 2022 Zhang, Ye and Zhao."
"35859178","The sequences of 150,119 genomes in the UK Biobank.","Nature","Detailed knowledge of how diversity in the sequence of the human genome affects phenotypic diversity depends on a comprehensive and reliable characterization of both sequences and phenotypic variation. Over the past decade, insights into this relationship have been obtained from whole-exome sequencing or whole-genome sequencing of large cohorts with rich phenotypic data1,2. Here we describe the analysis of whole-genome sequencing of 150,119 individuals from the UK Biobank3. This constitutes a set of high-quality variants, including 585,040,410 single-nucleotide polymorphisms, representing 7.0% of all possible human single-nucleotide polymorphisms, and 58,707,036 indels. This large set of variants allows us to characterize selection based on sequence variation within a population through a depletion rank score of windows along the genome. Depletion rank analysis shows that coding exons represent a small fraction of regions in the genome subject to strong sequence conservation. We define three cohorts within the UK Biobank: a large British Irish cohort, a smaller African cohort and a South Asian cohort. A haplotype reference panel is provided that allows reliable imputation of most variants carried by three or more sequenced individuals. We identified 895,055 structural variants and 2,536,688 microsatellites, groups of variants typically excluded from large-scale whole-genome sequencing studies. Using this formidable new resource, we provide several examples of trait associations for rare variants with large effects not found previously through studies based on whole-exome sequencing and/or imputation.© 2022.

ME/CFS has no confirmed diagnostic test or effective treatment and we lack knowledge of its causes. Identification of genes and cellular processes whose disruption adds to ME/CFS risk is a necessary first step towards development of effective therapy.Here we describe DecodeME, an ongoing study co-produced by people with lived experience of ME/CFS and scientists. Together we designed the study and obtained funding and are now recruiting up to 25,000 people in the UK with a clinical diagnosis of ME/CFS. Those eligible for the study are at least 16 years old, pass international study criteria, and lack any alternative diagnoses that can result in chronic fatigue. These will include 5,000 people whose ME/CFS diagnosis was a consequence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Questionnaires are completed online or on paper. Participants' saliva DNA samples are acquired by post, which improves participation by more severely-affected individuals. Digital marketing and social media approaches resulted in 29,000 people with ME/CFS in the UK pre-registering their interest in participating. We will perform a genome-wide association study, comparing participants' genotypes with those from UK Biobank as controls. This should generate hypotheses regarding the genes, mechanisms and cell types contributing to ME/CFS disease aetiology.The DecodeME study has been reviewed and given a favourable opinion by the North West - Liverpool Central Research Ethics Committee (21/NW/0169).

Here, we analyse several genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary statistics (N = 34,652-456,327), to assess the relationship of AD with GIT disorders. Findings reveal a positive significant genetic overlap and correlation between AD and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), peptic ulcer disease (PUD), gastritis-duodenitis, irritable bowel syndrome and diverticulosis, but not inflammatory bowel disease. Cross-trait meta-analysis identifies several loci (Pmeta-analysis < 5 × 10-8) shared by AD and GIT disorders (GERD and PUD) including PDE4B, BRINP3, ATG16L1, SEMA3F, HLA-DRA, SCARA3, MTSS2, PHB, and TOMM40. Colocalization and gene-based analyses reinforce these loci. Pathway-based analyses demonstrate significant enrichment of lipid metabolism, autoimmunity, lipase inhibitors, PD-1 signalling, and statin mechanisms, among others, for AD and GIT traits. Our findings provide genetic insights into the gut-brain relationship, implicating shared but non-causal genetic susceptibility of GIT disorders with AD's risk. Genes and biological pathways identified are potential targets for further investigation in AD, GIT disorders, and their comorbidity.© 2022. The Author(s)."

We used a linear mixed model to quantify diet-dependent genetic contributions to body weight measured through adulthood in diversity outbred female mice under five diets. We observed that heritability of body weight declined with age under all diets, except the 40% calorie restriction diet. We identified 14 loci with age-dependent associations and 19 loci with age- and diet-dependent associations, with many diet-dependent loci previously linked to neurological function and behavior in mice or humans. We found their allelic effects to be dynamic with respect to genomic background, age, and diet, identifying several loci where distinct alleles affect body weight at different ages. These results enable us to more fully understand and predict the effectiveness of dietary intervention on overall health throughout age in distinct genetic backgrounds.© 2022, Wright et al."

These often induce differential phenotypic variance across genotypes; these variance-quantitative trait loci can be prioritized in a two-stage interaction detection strategy to greatly reduce the computational and statistical burden and enable testing of a broader range of exposures. We perform genome-wide variance-quantitative trait locus analysis for 20 serum cardiometabolic biomarkers by multi-ancestry meta-analysis of 350,016 unrelated participants in the UK Biobank, identifying 182 independent locus-biomarker pairs (p < 4.5×10-9). Most are concentrated in a small subset (4%) of loci with genome-wide significant main effects, and 44% replicate (p < 0.05) in the Women's Genome Health Study (N = 23,294). Next, we test each locus-biomarker pair for interaction across 2380 exposures, identifying 847 significant interactions (p < 2.4×10-7), of which 132 are independent (p < 0.05) after accounting for correlation between exposures. Specific examples demonstrate interaction of triglyceride-associated variants with distinct body mass- versus body fat-related exposures as well as genotype-specific associations between alcohol consumption and liver stress at the ADH1B gene.

The study aimed to explore the relationships between OP and dietary habits.This study used large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics from the UK Biobank to explore potential associations between OP and 143 dietary habits. The GWAS summary data of OP included 9434 self-reported OP cases and 444,941 controls, and the GWAS summary data of the dietary habits included 455,146 participants of European ancestry. Linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC) was used to detect the genetic correlations between OP and each of the 143 dietary habits, followed by Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to further assess the causal relationship between OP and candidate dietary habits identified by LDSC.The LDSC analysis identified seven candidate dietary habits that showed genetic associations with OP including cereal type such as biscuit cereal (coefficient = -0.1693,pvalue = 0.0183), servings of raw vegetables per day (coefficient = 0.0837,pvalue = 0.0379), and spirits measured per month (coefficient = 0.115,pvalue = 0.0353).

"35758773","PolarMorphism enables discovery of shared genetic variants across multiple traits from GWAS summary statistics.","Bioinformatics","Pleiotropic SNPs are associated with multiple traits. Such SNPs can help pinpoint biological processes with an effect on multiple traits or point to a shared etiology between traits. We present PolarMorphism, a new method for the identification of pleiotropic SNPs from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary statistics. PolarMorphism can be readily applied to more than two traits or whole trait domains. PolarMorphism makes use of the fact that trait-specific SNP effect sizes can be seen as Cartesian coordinates and can thus be converted to polar coordinates r (distance from the origin) and theta (angle with the Cartesian x-axis, in the case of two traits). r describes the overall effect of a SNP, while theta describes the extent to which a SNP is shared. r and theta are used to determine the significance of SNP sharedness, resulting in a P-value per SNP that can be used for further analysis.We apply PolarMorphism to a large collection of publicly available GWAS summary statistics enabling the construction of a pleiotropy network that shows the extent to which traits share SNPs. We show how PolarMorphism can be used to gain insight into relationships between traits and trait domains and contrast it with genetic correlation. Furthermore, pathway analysis of the newly discovered pleiotropic SNPs demonstrates that analysis of more than two traits simultaneously yields more biologically relevant results than the combined results of pairwise analysis of the same traits. Finally, we show that PolarMorphism is more efficient and more powerful than previously published methods.code: https://github.com/UMCUGenetics/PolarMorphism, results: 10.5281/zenodo.5844193.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.© The Author(s) 2022.

Reproductive phenotypes are moderately heritable and have genetic overlaps with risks for psychiatric disorders. However, the genetic and causal relationships between anxiety-related disorders or specific anxiety disorders and reproductive phenotypes remain unknown. We utilized large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) results (n = 9537-542,901) for five reproductive phenotypes [age at menarche, age at first sexual intercourse (AFS), age at first birth (AFB), number of children ever born (NEB), and age at menopause] and five anxiety-related disorders [panic disorder, anxiety disorders from the ANGST and the UK biobank (UKBB), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)]. To assess genetic correlations and causal associations, linkage disequilibrium score regression and Mendelian randomization analyses, respectively, were performed. We found that AFS and AFB were negatively correlated with anxiety disorders ANGST (AFS: rg ± SE = -0.28 ± 0.08, p = 6.00 × 10-4; AFB: -0.45 ± 0.11, p = 3.26 × 10-5), anxiety disorders UKBB (AFS: -0.18 ± 0.03, p = 9.64 × 10-9; AFB; -0.25 ± 0.03, p = 2.90 × 10-13) and PTSD (AFS: -0.42 ± 0.12, p = 4.00 × 10-4; AFB: -0.44 ± 0.12, p = 2.00 × 10-4) and positively correlated with OCD (AFS: 0.25 ± 0.05, p = 2.46 × 10-6; AFB: 0.25 ± 0.05, p = 3.92 × 10-7). Conversely, NEB was negatively correlated with OCD (-0.28 ± 0.08, p = 6.00 × 10-4). We revealed bidirectional effects between earlier AFS and AFB and anxiety disorders (odds ratios: ORearlier AFS→Anxiety = 1.64, p = 2.27 × 10-8; ORearlier AFB→Anxiety = 1.15, p = 2.28 × 10-3; ORAnxiety→earlier AFS = 1.02, p = 6.62 × 10-8; ORAnxiety→earlier AFB = 1.08, p = 1.60 × 10-4). In contrast, we observed unidirectional effects of later AFS and AFB on OCD (ORlater AFS→OCD = 2.18, p = 2.16 × 10-6; ORlater AFB→OCD = 1.22, p = 0.016). We suggest that those who have earlier sexual debut and childbirth are prone to risk for anxiety disorders and vice versa, while those who have later sexual debut and childbirth are genetically prone to risk for OCD. Our findings further support revising the diagnostic criteria (DSM-5) such that OCD is independent from anxiety disorders.© 2022. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited."

Understanding the molecular correlates of OUD may provide key insights into the pathophysiology of this syndrome. Using publicly available RNA-sequencing data, our study investigated the possible role of alternative mRNA splicing in human brain tissue (dorsal-lateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), nucleus accumbens (NAc), and midbrain) of 90 individuals with OUD or matched controls. We found a total of 788 differentially spliced genes across brain regions. Alternative mRNA splicing demonstrated mostly tissue-specific effects, but a functionally characterized splicing change in the clathrin and AP-2-binding (CLAP) domain of the Bridging Integrator 1 (BIN1) gene was significantly linked to OUD across all brain regions. We investigated two hypotheses that may underlie differential splicing in OUD. First, we tested whether spliceosome genes were disrupted in the brains of individuals with OUD. Pathway enrichment analyses indicated spliceosome perturbations in OUD across brain regions. Second, we tested whether alternative mRNA splicing regions were linked to genetic predisposition. Using a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of OUD, we found no evidence that DNA variants within or surrounding differentially spliced genes were implicated in the heritability of OUD. Altogether, our study contributes to the understanding of OUD pathophysiology by providing evidence of a possible role of alternative mRNA splicing in OUD."
"35741723","Assessment of Bidirectional Relationships between Leisure Sedentary Behaviors and Neuropsychiatric Disorders: A Two-Sample Mendelian Randomization Study.","Genes (Basel)","(1) Background: Increasing evidence shows that sedentary behaviors are associated with neuropsychiatric disorders (NPDs) and thus may be a modifiable factor to target for the prevention of NPDs. However, the direction and causality for the relationship remain unknown; sedentary behaviors could increase or decrease the risk of NPDs, and/or NPDs may increase or decrease engagement in sedentary behaviors. (2) Methods: This Mendelian randomization (MR) study with two samples included independent genetic variants related to sedentary behaviors (n= 408,815), Alzheimer's disease (AD;n= 63,926), schizophrenia (SCZ;n= 105,318), and major depressive disorder (MDD;n= 500,199), which were extracted from several of the largest non-overlapping genome-wide association studies (GWASs), as instrumental variables. The summarized MR effect sizes from each instrumental variable were combined in an IVW (inverse-variance-weighted) approach, with various approaches (e.g., MR-Egger, weighted median, MR-pleiotropy residual sum and outlier), and sensitivity analyses were performed to identify and remove outliers and assess the horizontal pleiotropy. (3) Results: The MR evidence and linkage disequilibrium score regression revealed a consistent directional association between television watching and MDD (odds ratio (OR), 1.13 for MDD per one standard deviation (SD) increase in mean television watching time; 95% CI, 1.06-1.20;p= 6.80 × 10-5) and a consistent relationship between computer use and a decrease in the risk of AD (OR, 0.52 for AD per one SD increase in mean computer use time; 95% CI, 0.32-0.84;p= 8.20 × 10-3). In the reverse direction, MR showed a causal association between a reduced risk of SCZ and an increase in driving time (β, -0.016; 95% CI, -0.027--0.004;p= 8.30 × 10-3). (4) Conclusions: Using genetic instrumental variables identified from large-scale GWASs, we found robust evidence for a causal relationship between long computer use time and a reduced risk of AD, and for a causal relationship between long television watching time and an increased risk of MDD. In reverse analyses, we found that SCZ was causally associated with reduced driving time. These findings fit in with our observations and prior knowledge as well as emphasizing the importance of distinguishing between different domains of sedentary behaviors in epidemiologic studies of NPDs."

We hypothesize that hormone-sensitive cancers share common genetic risk factors that have rarely been investigated by previous genomic studies of site-specific cancers. Here, we show that considering hormone-sensitive cancers as a single disease in the UK Biobank reveals shared genetic aetiology. We observe that a significant proportion of variance in disease liability is explained by the genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), i.e., SNP-based heritability on the liability scale is estimated as 10.06% (SE 0.70%). Moreover, we find 55 genome-wide significant SNPs for the disease, using a genome-wide association study. Pair-wise analysis also estimates positive genetic correlations between some pairs of hormone-sensitive cancers although they are not statistically significant. Our finding suggests that heritable genetic factors may be a key driver in the mechanism of carcinogenesis shared by hormone-sensitive cancers.© 2022. The Author(s)."

Here, we perform genome-wide association studies on four iron-related biomarkers (serum iron, serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, total iron-binding capacity) in the Trøndelag Health Study (HUNT), the Michigan Genomics Initiative (MGI), and the SardiNIA study, followed by their meta-analysis with publicly available summary statistics, analyzing up to 257,953 individuals. We identify 123 genetic loci associated with iron traits. Among 19 novel protein-altering variants, we observe a rare missense variant (rs367731784) in HUNT, which suggests a role for DNAJC13 in transferrin recycling. We further validate recently published results using genetic risk scores for each biomarker in HUNT (6% variance in serum iron explained) and present linear and non-linear Mendelian randomization analyses of the traits on all-cause mortality. We find evidence of a harmful effect of increased serum iron and transferrin saturation in linear analyses that estimate population-averaged effects. However, there was weak evidence of a protective effect of increasing serum iron at the very low end of its distribution.

"35680855","Comprehensive genome-wide association study of different forms of hernia identifies more than 80 associated loci.","Nat Commun","Hernias are characterized by protrusion of an organ or tissue through its surrounding cavity and often require surgical repair. In this study we identify 65,492 cases for five hernia types in the UK Biobank and perform genome-wide association study scans for these five types and two combined groups. Our results show associated variants in all scans. Inguinal hernia has the most associations and we conduct a follow-up study with 23,803 additional cases from four study groups giving 84 independently associated variants. Identified variants from all scans are collapsed into 81 independent loci. Further testing shows that 26 loci are associated with more than one hernia type, suggesting substantial overlap between the underlying genetic mechanisms. Pathway analyses identify several genes with a strong link to collagen and/or elastin (ADAMTS6, ADAMTS16, ADAMTSL3, LOX, ELN) in the vicinity of associated loci for inguinal hernia, which substantiates an essential role of connective tissue morphology.© 2022.

Inverse-variance weighted (IVW), median weighted, MR-Egger, and contamination mixture methods were used to estimate the causal association. Null and inconsistent associations in the IVW and sensitivity analyses were observed for SARS-CoV-2 infection and covid-19 hospitalization with platelet traits. For severe covid-19, significant associations with MPV and platelet count were observed in the IVW and sensitivity analyses, with the betaIVWof 0.01 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.005-0.016, p = 3.51 × 10-4) and -0.009 (95% CI: -0.015 to -0.002, p = 0.008) per doubling in odds of severe covid-19, respectively. Conversely, null associations were observed for platelet traits with covid-19 traits. In conclusion, host genetic liability to severe covid-19 was causally associated with increased MPV and reduced platelet count, which may provide insights into evaluating hypercoagulability and thromboembolic events in covid-19 patients.© 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC."
"35663382","Genome-wide association studies for Alzheimer's disease: bigger is not always better.","Brain Commun","As the size of genome-wide association studies increase, the number of associated trait loci identified inevitably increase. One welcomes this if it allows the better delineation of the pathways to disease and increases the accuracy of genetic prediction of disease risk through polygenic risk score analysis. However, there are several problems in the continuing increase in the genome-wide analysis of 'Alzheimer's disease'. In this review, we have systematically assessed the history of Alzheimer's disease genome-wide association studies, including their sample sizes, age and selection/assessment criteria of cases and controls and heritability explained by these disease genome-wide association studies. We observe that nearly all earlier disease genome-wide association studies are now part of all current disease genome-wide association studies. In addition, the latest disease genome-wide association studies include (i) only a small fraction (∼10%) of clinically screened controls, substituting for them population-based samples which are systematically younger than cases, and (ii) around 50% of Alzheimer's disease cases are in fact 'proxy dementia cases'. As a consequence, the more genes the field finds, the less the heritability they explain. We highlight potential caveats this situation creates and discuss some of the consequences occurring when translating the newest Alzheimer's disease genome-wide association study results into basic research and/or clinical practice.© The Author(s) 2022.

"35648832","Multiscale neural signatures of major depressive, anxiety, and stress-related disorders.","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","The extent of shared and distinct neural mechanisms underlying major depressive disorder (MDD), anxiety, and stress-related disorders is still unclear. We compared the neural signatures of these disorders in 5,405 UK Biobank patients and 21,727 healthy controls. We found the greatest case–control differences in resting-state functional connectivity and cortical thickness in MDD, followed by anxiety and stress-related disorders. Neural signatures for MDD and anxiety disorders were highly concordant, whereas stress-related disorders showed a distinct pattern. Controlling for cross-disorder genetic risk somewhat decreased the similarity between functional neural signatures of stress-related disorders and both MDD and anxiety disorders. Among cases and healthy controls, reduced within-network and increased between-network frontoparietal and default mode connectivity were associated with poorer cognitive performance (processing speed, attention, associative learning, and fluid intelligence). These results provide evidence for distinct neural circuit function impairments in MDD and anxiety disorders compared to stress disorders, yet cognitive impairment appears unrelated to diagnosis and varies with circuit function."
"35639796","Genetic characterization of outbred Sprague Dawley rats and utility for genome-wide association studies.","PLoS Genet","Sprague Dawley (SD) rats are among the most widely used outbred laboratory rat populations. Despite this, the genetic characteristics of SD rats have not been clearly described, and SD rats are rarely used for experiments aimed at exploring genotype-phenotype relationships. In order to use SD rats to perform a genome-wide association study (GWAS), we collected behavioral data from 4,625 SD rats that were predominantly obtained from two commercial vendors, Charles River Laboratories and Harlan Sprague Dawley Inc. Using double-digest genotyping-by-sequencing (ddGBS), we obtained dense, high-quality genotypes at 291,438 SNPs across 4,061 rats. This genetic data allowed us to characterize the variation present in Charles River vs. Harlan SD rats. We found that the two populations are highly diverged (FST > 0.4). Furthermore, even for rats obtained from the same vendor, there was strong population structure across breeding facilities and even between rooms at the same facility. We performed multiple separate GWAS by fitting a linear mixed model that accounted for population structure and using meta-analysis to jointly analyze all cohorts. Our study examined Pavlovian conditioned approach (PavCA) behavior, which assesses the propensity for rats to attribute incentive salience to reward-associated cues. We identified 46 significant associations for the various metrics used to define PavCA. The surprising degree of population structure among SD rats from different sources has important implications for their use in both genetic and non-genetic studies."

Insufficient statistical power is a limiting factor, especially in narrow genetic basis species, that conventional GWAS methods are suffering from. Using sophisticated mathematical methods such as machine learning (ML) algorithms may address this issue and advance the implication of this valuable genetic method in applied plant-breeding programs. In this study, we evaluated the potential use of two ML algorithms, support-vector machine (SVR) and random forest (RF), in a GWAS and compared them with two conventional methods of mixed linear models (MLM) and fixed and random model circulating probability unification (FarmCPU), for identifying MTAs for soybean-yield components. In this study, important soybean-yield component traits, including the number of reproductive nodes (RNP), non-reproductive nodes (NRNP), total nodes (NP), and total pods (PP) per plant along with yield and maturity, were assessed using a panel of 227 soybean genotypes evaluated at two locations over two years (four environments). Using the SVR-mediated GWAS method, we were able to discover MTAs colocalized with previously reported quantitative trait loci (QTL) with potential causal effects on the target traits, supported by the functional annotation of candidate gene analyses. This study demonstrated the potential benefit of using sophisticated mathematical approaches, such as SVR, in a GWAS to complement conventional GWAS methods for identifying MTAs that can improve the efficiency of genomic-based soybean-breeding programs."
"35621206","Genetic Architecture of Plasma Alpha-Aminoadipic Acid Reveals a Relationship With High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol.","J Am Heart Assoc","Background Elevated plasma levels of alpha-aminoadipic acid (2-AAA) have been associated with the development of type 2 diabetes and atherosclerosis. However, the nature of the association remains unknown. Methods and Results We identified genetic determinants of plasma 2-AAA through meta-analysis of genome-wide association study data in 5456 individuals of European, African, and Asian ancestry from the Framingham Heart Study, Diabetes Prevention Program, Jackson Heart Study, and Shanghai Women's and Men's Health Studies. No single nucleotide polymorphisms reached genome-wide significance across all samples. However, the top associations from the meta-analysis included single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the known 2-AAA pathway geneDHTKD1, and single-nucleotide polymorphisms in genes involved in mitochondrial respiration (NDUFS4) and macrophage function (MSR1). We used a Mendelian randomization instrumental variable approach to evaluate relationships between 2-AAA and cardiometabolic phenotypes in large disease genome-wide association studies. Mendelian randomization identified a suggestive inverse association between increased 2-AAA and lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P=0.005). We further characterized the genetically predicted relationship through measurement of plasma 2-AAA and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in 2 separate samples of individuals with and without cardiometabolic disease (N=98), and confirmed a significant negative correlation between 2-AAA and high-density lipoprotein (rs=-0.53,P<0.0001). Conclusions 2-AAA levels in plasma may be regulated, in part, by common variants in genes involved in mitochondrial and macrophage function. Elevated plasma 2-AAA associates with reduced levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Further mechanistic studies are required to probe this as a possible mechanism linking 2-AAA to future cardiometabolic risk."

Annotating those REs relies on costly and labor-intensive next-generation sequencing and RNA-guided editing technologies in many cellular contexts.We propose a systematic Gene Ontology Annotation method for Regulatory Elements (RE-GOA) by leveraging the powerful word embedding in natural language processing. We first assemble a heterogeneous network by integrating context specific regulations, protein-protein interactions and gene ontology (GO) terms. Then we perform network embedding and associate regulatory elements with GO terms by assessing their similarity in a low dimensional vector space. With three applications, we show that RE-GOA outperforms existing methods in annotating TFs' binding sites from ChIP-seq data, in functional enrichment analysis of differentially accessible peaks from ATAC-seq data, and in revealing genetic correlation among phenotypes from their GWAS summary statistics data.The source code and the systematic RE annotation for human and mouse are available at https://github.com/AMSSwanglab/RE-GOA.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.© The Author(s) 2022.

African Americans (AAs) have the highest prevalence of hypertension in the United States, and to alleviate the burden of hypertension in this population, better control of blood pressure (BP) is needed. Previous studies have shown considerable interpersonal differences in BP response to antihypertensive treatment, suggesting a genetic component. Utilizing data from 4297 AA participants randomized to chlorthalidone from the Genetics of Hypertension Associated Treatments (GenHAT) study, we aimed to identify variants associated with the efficacy of chlorthalidone. An additional aim was to find variants that contributed to changes in fasting glucose (FG) in these individuals. We performed genome-wide association analyses on the change of systolic and diastolic BP (SBP and DBP) over six months and FG levels over 24 months of treatment. We sought replication in the International Consortia of Pharmacogenomics Studies. We identified eight variants statistically associated with BP response and nine variants associated with FG response. One suggestiveLINC02211-CDH9intergenic variant was marginally replicated with the same direction of effect. Given the impact of hypertension in AAs, this study implies that understanding the genetic background for BP control and glucose changes during chlorthalidone treatment may help prevent adverse cardiovascular events in this population."

The relationship between fructose and a high-salt diet, leading to hypertension and other deleterious cardiovascular parameters, has also become more evident, especially in preclinical studies. However, these studies have been modeled primarily on Western diets. The purpose of this review is to evaluate the dietary habits of individuals from China, Japan, and Korea, in light of the existing preclinical studies, to assess the potential relevance of existing data to East Asian societies.

Herein, we applied three machine learning (ML) algorithms including deep learning (DL), support vector machine, and random forest for detecting high BP using DNA methylome data. Peripheral blood samples of 50 elderly individuals were collected three times at three visits for DNA methylome profiling. Participants who had a history of hypertension and/or current high BP measure were considered to have high BP. The whole dataset was randomly divided to conduct a nested five-group cross-validation for prediction performance. Data in each outer training set were independently normalized using a min-max scaler, reduced dimensionality using principal component analysis, then fed into three predictive algorithms. Of the three ML algorithms, DL achieved the best performance (AUPRC = 0.65, AUROC = 0.73, accuracy = 0.69, and F1-score = 0.73). To confirm the reliability of using DNA methylome as a biomarker for high BP, we constructed mixed-effects models and found that 61,694 methylation sites located in 15,523 intragenic regions and 16,754 intergenic regions were significantly associated with BP measures. Our proposed models pioneered the methodology of applying ML and DNA methylome data for early detection of high BP in clinical practices."
"35695771","hapCon: Estimating Contamination of Ancient Genomes by Copying from Reference Haplotypes.","Bioinformatics","Human ancient DNA (aDNA) studies have surged in recent years, revolutionizing the study of the human past. Typically, aDNA is preserved poorly, making such data prone to contamination from other human DNA. Therefore, it is important to rule out substantial contamination before proceeding to downstream analysis. As most aDNA samples can only be sequenced to low coverages (<1x average depth), computational methods that can robustly estimate contamination in the low coverage regime are needed. However, the ultra low-coverage regime (0.1x and below) remains a challenging task for existing approaches.We present a new method to estimate contamination in aDNA for male modern humans. It utilizes a Li&Stephens haplotype copying model for haploid X chromosomes, with mismatches modelled as errors or contamination. We assessed this new approach, hapCon, on simulated and down-sampled empirical aDNA data. Our experiments demonstrate that hapCon outperforms a commonly used tool for estimating male X contamination (ANGSD), with substantially lower variance and narrower confidence intervals, especially in the low coverage regime. We found that hapCon provides useful contamination estimates for coverages as low as 0.1x for SNP capture data (1240k) and 0.02x for whole genome sequencing data (WGS), substantially extending the coverage limit of previous male X chromosome based contamination estimation methods. Our experiments demonstrate that hapCon has little bias for contamination up to 25-30% as long as the contaminating source is specified within continental genetic variation, and that its application range extends to human aDNA as old as ∼45,000 and various global ancestries.We make hapCon available as part of a python package (hapROH), which is available at the Python Package Index (https://pypi.org/project/hapROH) and can be installed via pip. The documentation provides example use cases as blueprints for custom applications (https://haproh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/hapCon.html).

Radiocarbon dates and burial type are consistent with one of the earliest Islamic Arab burials in the Levant. Interestingly, we found genomic similarity to a genotyped group of modern-day Bedouins and Saudi rather than to most neighbouring Levantine groups. This study represents the genomic analysis of a secondary use site with characteristics consistent with an early Islamic burial in the Levant.

Clinical cancer sequencing also increasingly aims to detect SVs, leading to a widespread necessity to interpret their biological and clinical relevance. Recently, analyses of large whole-genome sequencing data sets revealed features that impact rates of SVs across the genome in different cancers. A striking feature has been the extent to which, in both their generation and their influence on the selective fitness of cancer cells, SVs are more specific to individual cancer types than other genetic alterations such as single-nucleotide variants. This Perspective discusses how the folding of the 3D genome, and differences in its folding across cell types, affect observed SV rates in different cancer types as well as how SVs can impact cancer cell fitness.© 2022.

Cancer biology is a complex system resulting from genetic alterations in key tumor oncogenes and suppressor genes for cell proliferation, DNA replication, cell differentiation, and homeostatic functions. Although scientific research in recent decades has revealed how the genome sequence is mutated in many cancers, high-order chromosomal structures involved in the development and fate of cancer cells represent a crucial but rarely explored aspect of cancer genomics. Hence, dissection of the 3D genome conformation of cancer helps understand the unique epigenetic patterns and gene regulation processes that distinguish cancer biology from normal physiological states. In recent years, research in tumor 3D genomics has grown quickly. With the rapid progress of 3D genomics technology, we can now better determine the relationship between cancer pathogenesis and the chromatin structure of cancer cells. It is becoming increasingly explicit that changes in 3D chromatin structure play a vital role in controlling oncogene transcription. This review focuses on the relationships between tumor gene expression regulation, tumor 3D chromatin structure, and cancer phenotypic plasticity. Furthermore, based on the functional consequences of spatial disorganization in the cancer genome, we look forward to the clinical application prospects of 3D genomic biomarkers.Copyright © 2022 Peng, Peng, Wang, Zhao, Yu and Sun."

Identifying hierarchical TADs on Hi-C data helps to understand the relationship between genome architectures and gene regulation. Herein we propose TADfit, a multivariate linear regression model for profiling hierarchical chromatin domains, which tries to fit the interaction frequencies in Hi-C contact matrix with and without replicates using all-possible hierarchical TADs, and the significant ones can be determined by the regression coefficients obtained with the help of an online learning solver called Follow-The-Regularized-Leader (FTRL). Beyond the existing methods, TADfit has an ability to handle multiple contact matrix replicates and find partially overlapping TADs on them, which helps to find the comprehensive underlying TADs across replicates from different experiments.

"35710823","The 3D architecture of the pepper genome and its relationship to function and evolution.","Nat Commun","The organization of chromatin into self-interacting domains is universal among eukaryotic genomes, though how and why they form varies considerably. Here we report a chromosome-scale reference genome assembly of pepper (Capsicum annuum) and explore its 3D organization through integrating high-resolution Hi-C maps with epigenomic, transcriptomic, and genetic variation data. Chromatin folding domains in pepper are as prominent as TADs in mammals but exhibit unique characteristics. They tend to coincide with heterochromatic regions enriched with retrotransposons and are frequently embedded in loops, which may correlate with transcription factories. Their boundaries are hotspots for chromosome rearrangements but are otherwise depleted for genetic variation. While chromatin conformation broadly affects transcription variance, it does not predict differential gene expression between tissues. Our results suggest that pepper genome organization is explained by a model of heterochromatin-driven folding promoted by transcription factories and that such spatial architecture is under structural and functional constraints.© 2022.

"35666736","Characterizing collaborative transcription regulation with a graph-based deep learning approach.","PLoS Comput Biol","Human epigenome and transcription activities have been characterized by a number of sequence-based deep learning approaches which only utilize the DNA sequences. However, transcription factors interact with each other, and their collaborative regulatory activities go beyond the linear DNA sequence. Therefore leveraging the informative 3D chromatin organization to investigate the collaborations among transcription factors is critical. We developed ECHO, a graph-based neural network, to predict chromatin features and characterize the collaboration among them by incorporating 3D chromatin organization from 200-bp high-resolution Micro-C contact maps. ECHO predicted 2,583 chromatin features with significantly higher average AUROC and AUPR than the best sequence-based model. We observed that chromatin contacts of different distances affected different types of chromatin features' prediction in diverse ways, suggesting complex and divergent collaborative regulatory mechanisms. Moreover, ECHO was interpretable via gradient-based attribution methods. The attributions on chromatin contacts identify important contacts relevant to chromatin features. The attributions on DNA sequences identify TF binding motifs and TF collaborative binding. Furthermore, combining the attributions on contacts and sequences reveals important sequence patterns in the neighborhood which are relevant to a target sequence's chromatin feature prediction."

Moreover, there is no dedicated promoter for each gene, resulting in polycistronic gene transcription, with posttranscriptional control playing a major role. Nonetheless, these parasites harbor epigenetic modifications at critical regulatory genome features that dynamically change among parasite stages, which are not fully understood.Here, we investigated the impact of chromatin changes in a scenario commanded by posttranscriptional control exploring the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi and its differentiation program using FAIRE-seq approach supported by transmission electron microscopy. We identified differences in T. cruzi genome compartments, putative transcriptional start regions, and virulence factors. In addition, we also detected a developmental chromatin regulation at tRNA loci (tDNA), which could be linked to the intense chromatin remodeling and/or the translation regulatory mechanism required for parasite differentiation. We further integrated the open chromatin profile with public transcriptomic and MNase-seq datasets. Strikingly, a positive correlation was observed between active chromatin and steady-state transcription levels.Taken together, our results indicate that chromatin changes reflect the unusual gene expression regulation of trypanosomes and the differences among parasite developmental stages, even in the context of a lack of canonical transcriptional control of protein-coding genes.© 2022.

We investigated the contribution of rare genetic variants to tobacco use with whole-genome sequences from up to 26,257 unrelated individuals of European ancestries and 11,743 individuals of African ancestries. Across four smoking traits, single-nucleotide-polymorphism-based heritability ([Formula: see text]) was estimated from 0.13 to 0.28 (s.e., 0.10-0.13) in European ancestries, with 35-74% of it attributable to rare variants with minor allele frequencies between 0.01% and 1%. These heritability estimates are 1.5-4 times higher than past estimates based on common variants alone and accounted for 60% to 100% of our pedigree-based estimates of narrow-sense heritability ([Formula: see text], 0.18-0.34). In the African ancestry samples, [Formula: see text] was estimated from 0.03 to 0.33 (s.e., 0.09-0.14) across the four smoking traits.

Here, we identified the longitudinal effects of genetic variants on lung function by determining single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) heritability and genetic correlations, and by analyzing interactions with smoking. Subject-specific means and annual change rates were calculated for eight spirometric measures obtained from 6622 Korean adults aged 40-69 years every two years for 14 years, and their heritabilities were estimated separately. Statistically significant (p&lt; 0.05) heritability for the subject-specific means of all spirometric measures (8~32%) and change rates of forced expiratory volume in 1 s to forced vital capacity ratio (FEV1/FVC; 16%) and post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC (17%) were detected. Significant genetic correlations of the change rate with the subject-specific mean were observed for FEV1/FVC (ρg = 0.64) and post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC (ρg = 0.47). Furthermore, post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC showed significant heritability of SNP-by-smoking interaction (hGXS2 = 0.4) for the annual change rate. The GWAS also detected genome-wide significant SNPs for FEV1(rs4793538), FEV1/FVC (rs2704589, rs62201158, and rs9391733), and post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC (rs2445936). We found statistically significant evidence of heritability role on the change in lung function, and this was shared with the effects on cross-sectional measurements. We also found some evidence of interaction with smoking for the change of lung function."

For 941 children in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children cohort, a joint predictor combining a polygenic risk score for height and mid-parental height was able to explain~55% of the total variance in sex-adjusted adult height z-scores, close to the estimated heritability.

However, existing PRSs estimate this likelihood with common genetic variants, excluding the impact of rare variants. Here, we report on a method to identify rare variants associated with outlier gene expression and integrate their impact into PRS predictions for body mass index (BMI), obesity, and bariatric surgery. Between the top and bottom 10%, we observed a 20.8% increase in risk for obesity (p = 3 × 10-14), 62.3% increase in risk for severe obesity (p = 1 × 10-6), and median 5.29 years earlier onset for bariatric surgery (p = 0.008), as a function of expression outlier-associated rare variant burden when controlling for common variant PRS. We show that these predictions were more significant than integrating the effects of rare protein-truncating variants (PTVs), observing a mean 19% increase in phenotypic variance explained with expression outlier-associated rare variants when compared with PTVs (p = 2 × 10-15). We replicated these findings by using data from the Million Veteran Program and demonstrated that PRSs across multiple traits and diseases can benefit from the inclusion of expression outlier-associated rare variants identified through population-scale transcriptome sequencing.Copyright © 2022 American Society of Human Genetics.

The mechanisms behind this arrest are unclear. Here, we show that the arrested embryos enter a senescent-like state, marked by cell cycle arrest, the down-regulation of ribosomes and histones and down-regulation of MYC and p53 activity. The arrested embryos can be divided into 3 types. Type I embryos fail to complete the maternal-zygotic transition, and Type II/III embryos have low levels of glycolysis and either high (Type II) or low (Type III) levels of oxidative phosphorylation.

"35886859","Early Gonadal Development and Sex Determination in Mammal.","Int J Mol Sci","Sex determination is crucial for the transmission of genetic information through generations. In mammal, this process is primarily regulated by an antagonistic network of sex-related genes beginning in embryonic development and continuing throughout life. Nonetheless, abnormal expression of these sex-related genes will lead to reproductive organ and germline abnormalities, resulting in disorders of sex development (DSD) and infertility. On the other hand, it is possible to predetermine the sex of animal offspring by artificially regulating sex-related gene expression, a recent research hotspot. In this paper, we reviewed recent research that has improved our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the development of the gonad and primordial germ cells (PGCs), progenitors of the germline, to provide new directions for the treatment of DSD and infertility, both of which involve manipulating the sex ratio of livestock offspring."
"35794482","Single-cell roadmap of human gonadal development.","Nature","Gonadal development is a complex process that involves sex determination followed by divergent maturation into either testes or ovaries1. Historically, limited tissue accessibility, a lack of reliable in vitro models and critical differences between humans and mice have hampered our knowledge of human gonadogenesis, despite its importance in gonadal conditions and infertility. Here, we generated a comprehensive map of first- and second-trimester human gonads using a combination of single-cell and spatial transcriptomics, chromatin accessibility assays and fluorescent microscopy. We extracted human-specific regulatory programmes that control the development of germline and somatic cell lineages by profiling equivalent developmental stages in mice. In both species, we define the somatic cell states present at the time of sex specification, including the bipotent early supporting population that, in males, upregulates the testis-determining factor SRY and sPAX8s, a gonadal lineage located at the gonadal-mesonephric interface. In females, we resolve the cellular and molecular events that give rise to the first and second waves of granulosa cells that compartmentalize the developing ovary to modulate germ cell differentiation. In males, we identify human SIGLEC15+and TREM2+fetal testicular macrophages, which signal to somatic cells outside and inside the developing testis cords, respectively. This study provides a comprehensive spatiotemporal map of human and mouse gonadal differentiation, which can guide in vitro gonadogenesis.© 2022. The Author(s)."

The aim of this study is to decipher the impact of endocrine variables, hyperandogenism, insulin resistance, oxidative stress, and dietary conditions in PCOS conditions, subsequently to depict the role of epigenetic factors relative to phenotypic manifestations in PCOS conditions. We have reviewed several metabolic milieus pertinent to PCOS conditions. Comparative efficacies of various PCOS therapies, and recent clinical recommendations for the effective management of PCOS and role of metabolic/endocrine variables in PCOS conditions were described. Comparative therapeutic effects were vividly delineated according to the variable pathophysiology and internal variables during PCOS syndrome on the female body through the formation of cascade of endocrine pathology, which affects working capacity and fosters redox stress-induced cardiovascular, neural, and liver abnormalities. GLP-1 agonists, insulin sensitizers (metformin), and diet and exercise regimens efficacy were explained in enhancing the fertility outcomes among the overweight or obese females with PCOS. Comprehensive appraisal of DNA methylation as epigenetic changes and the manifestations of methylated genes in PCOS conditions were discussed particularly to screen novel molecular targets for developing efficient diagnostic indicators for predicting PCOS risk or its progression. Due to the reversible nature of epigenetic modifications, it is possible to screen the ""druggable"" regions to target or to correct abnormalities in the gene expression subsequently to develop chromatin-modifying therapies against PCOS.© 2022.

"35704668","Genomic features underlie the co-option of SVA transposons as cis-regulatory elements in human pluripotent stem cells.","PLoS Genet","Domestication of transposable elements (TEs) into functional cis-regulatory elements is a widespread phenomenon. However, the mechanisms behind why some TEs are co-opted as functional enhancers while others are not are underappreciated. SINE-VNTR-Alus (SVAs) are the youngest group of transposons in the human genome, where ~3,700 copies are annotated, nearly half of which are human-specific. Many studies indicate that SVAs are among the most frequently co-opted TEs in human gene regulation, but the mechanisms underlying such processes have not yet been thoroughly investigated. Here, we leveraged CRISPR-interference (CRISPRi), computational and functional genomics to elucidate the genomic features that underlie SVA domestication into human stem-cell gene regulation. We found that ~750 SVAs are co-opted as functional cis-regulatory elements in human induced pluripotent stem cells. These SVAs are significantly closer to genes and harbor more transcription factor binding sites than non-co-opted SVAs. We show that a long DNA motif composed of flanking YY1/2 and OCT4 binding sites is enriched in the co-opted SVAs and that these two transcription factors bind consecutively on the TE sequence. We used CRISPRi to epigenetically repress active SVAs in stem cell-like NCCIT cells. Epigenetic perturbation of active SVAs strongly attenuated YY1/OCT4 binding and influenced neighboring gene expression. Ultimately, SVA repression resulted in ~3,000 differentially expressed genes, 131 of which were the nearest gene to an annotated SVA. In summary, we demonstrated that SVAs modulate human gene expression, and uncovered that location and sequence composition contribute to SVA domestication into gene regulatory networks."

Although the gene regulatory network controlling the development of germ cells such as PGCs is critical for ensuring gamete integrity, substantial differences exist in this network among mammalian species, suggesting that this network has been modified during mammalian evolution. Here, we show that a hominoid-specific group of endogenous retroviruses, LTR5_Hs, discloses enhancer-like signatures in human in vitro-induced PGCs, PGC-like cells (PGCLCs). Human PGCLCs exhibit a transcriptome signature similar to that of naïve-state pluripotent cells. LTR5_Hs are epigenetically activated in both PGCLCs and naïve pluripotent cells, and the expression of genes in the vicinity of LTR5_Hs is coordinately upregulated in these cell types, contributing to the establishment of the transcriptome similarity between these cell types. LTR5_Hs are preferentially bound by transcription factors that are highly expressed in both PGCLCs and naïve pluripotent cells (KLF4, TFAP2C, NANOG, and CBFA2T2), suggesting that these transcription factors contribute to the epigenetic activation of LTR5_Hs in these cells. Comparative transcriptome analysis between humans and macaques suggests that the expression of many genes in PGCLCs and naïve pluripotent cells is upregulated by LTR5_Hs insertions in the hominoid lineage. Together, this study suggests that LTR5_Hs insertions may have finetuned the gene regulatory network shared between PGCLCs and naïve pluripotent cells and coordinately altered the gene expression in these cells during hominoid evolution."

High degree of sparsity in biological high-throughput single-cell data is generally handled with imputation methods that complete the data, but specific methods for scChIP-seq are lacking. We present SIMPA, a scChIP-seq data imputation method leveraging predictive information within bulk data from the ENCODE project to impute missing protein-DNA interacting regions of target histone marks or transcription factors.Imputations using machine learning models trained for each single cell, each ChIP protein target, and each genomic region accurately preserve cell type clustering and improve pathway-related gene identification on real human data. Results on bulk data simulating single cells show that the imputations are single-cell specific as the imputed profiles are closer to the simulated cell than to other cells related to the same ChIP protein target and the same cell type. Simulations also show that 100 input genomic regions are already enough to train single-cell specific models for the imputation of thousands of undetected regions. Furthermore, SIMPA enables the interpretation of machine learning models by revealing interaction sites of a given single cell that are most important for the imputation model trained for a specific genomic region. The corresponding feature importance values derived from promoter-interaction profiles of H3K4me3, an activating histone mark, highly correlate with co-expression of genes that are present within the cell-type specific pathways in 2 real human and mouse datasets. The SIMPA's interpretable imputation method allows users to gain a deep understanding of individual cells and, consequently, of sparse scChIP-seq datasets.Our interpretable imputation algorithm was implemented in Python and is available at https://github.com/salbrec/SIMPA."

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) can assay occupancy genome-wide, but only one TF at a time, limiting our ability to comprehensively observe the TF occupancy landscape, let alone quantify how it changes across conditions. We developed TF occupancy profiler (TOP), a Bayesian hierarchical regression framework, to profile genome-wide quantitative occupancy of numerous TFs using data from a single chromatin accessibility experiment (DNase- or ATAC-seq). TOP is supervised, and its hierarchical structure allows it to predict the occupancy of any sequence-specific TF, even those never assayed with ChIP. We used TOP to profile the quantitative occupancy of hundreds of sequence-specific TFs at sites throughout the genome and examined how their occupancies changed in multiple contexts: in approximately 200 human cell types, through 12 h of exposure to different hormones, and across the genetic backgrounds of 70 individuals.

"35712593","<i>Pup1</i> QTL Regulates Gene Expression Through Epigenetic Modification of DNA Under Phosphate Starvation Stress in Rice.","Front Plant Sci","Cytosine methylation, epigenetic DNA modification, is well known to regulate gene expression. Among the epigenetic modifications, 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) has been one of the extensively studied epigenetic changes responsible for regulating gene expression in animals and plants. Though a dramatic change in 5-mC content is observed at the genome level, the variation in gene expression is generally less than that it is expected. Only less is understood about the significance of 5-mC in gene regulation under P-starvation stress in plants. Using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing of a pair of rice [Pusa-44 and its near-isogenic line (NIL)-23 harboringPup1QTL] genotypes, we could decipher the role ofPup1on DNA (de)methylation-mediated regulation of gene expression under P-starvation stress. We observed 13-15% of total cytosines to be methylated in the rice genome, which increased significantly under the stress. The number of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) for hypomethylation (6,068) was higher than those (5,279) for hypermethylated DMRs under the stress, particularly in root of NIL-23. Hypomethylation in CHH context caused upregulated expression of 489 genes in shoot and 382 genes in root of NIL-23 under the stress, wherein 387 genes in shoot and 240 genes in root were upregulated exclusively in NIL-23. Many of the genes for DNA methylation, a few for DNA demethylation, and RNA-directed DNA methylation were upregulated in root of NIL-23 under the stress. Methylation or demethylation of DNA in genic regions differentially affected gene expression. Correlation analysis for the distribution of DMRs and gene expression indicated the regulation of gene mainly through (de)methylation of promoter. Many of the P-responsive genes were hypomethylated or upregulated in roots of NIL-23 under the stress. Hypermethylation of gene body in CG, CHG, and CHH contexts caused up- or downregulated expression of transcription factors (TFs), P transporters, phosphoesterases, retrotransposon proteins, and other proteins. Our integrated transcriptome and methylome analyses revealed an important role of thePup1QTL in epigenetic regulation of the genes for transporters, TFs, phosphatases, carbohydrate metabolism, hormone-signaling, and chromatin architecture or epigenetic modifications in P-starvation tolerance. This provides insights into the molecular function ofPup1in modulating gene expression through DNA (de)methylation, which might be useful in improving P-use efficiency or productivity of rice in P-deficient soil.Copyright © 2022 Kumar, Seem, Kumar, Vinod, Chinnusamy and Mohapatra."

Pregnant women represent a high-risk population, considering that pregnancy is a period of heightened neuroplasticity and susceptibility to stress through epigenetic mechanisms. Previous studies showed that the methylation status of theBDNFgene is linked with prenatal stress exposure. The goals of this study were (a) to assess the association between pandemic-related stress and postnatal anxiety and (b) to investigate the potential role of maternalBDNFmethylation as a significant mediator of this association.In the present study, we report data on the association among pandemic-related stress during pregnancy, maternalBDNFmethylation, and postnatal anxiety symptoms. Pandemic-related stress and postnatal anxiety were assessed through self-report instruments.BDNFmethylation was estimated in 11 CpG sites in DNA from mothers' buccal cells. Complete data were available from 108 mothers.Results showed that pandemic-related stress was associated with an increased risk of postnatal anxiety,r= 0.20,p< 0.05. CpG-specificBDNFmethylation was significantly associated with both prenatal pandemic-related stress,r= 0.21,p< 0.05, and postnatal maternal anxious symptoms,r= 0.25,p= 0.01. Moreover, a complete mediation by theBDNFCpG6 methylation emerged between pandemic-related stress during pregnancy and postnatal maternal anxiety, ACME = 0.66,p< 0.05.These findings suggest that BDNF epigenetic regulation by pandemic-related stress might contribute to increase the risk of anxiety in mothers.

The development of indeterminate nodules, as in Medicago truncatula, involves successive waves of gene activation9-12, control of which raises interesting questions.

We found MtDME to be upregulated in the differentiation zone and required for nodule development, and we identified 474 differentially methylated regions hypomethylated in the nodule by analysing ~2% of the genome4. Here, we coupled LCM and whole-genome bisulfite sequencing for a comprehensive view of DNA methylation, integrated with gene expression at the tissue level.

Therefore, the dissection of PPI networks becomes decisive to model functional coordination and predict pathological de-regulation. Cellular networks are dynamic and proteins display varying roles depending on the tissue-interactomic context. Thus, the use of centrality measures in individual proteins fall short to dissect the functional properties of the cell. For this reason, there is a need for more comprehensive, relational, and context-specific ways to analyze the multiple actions of proteins in different cells and identify specific functional assemblies within global biomolecular networks. Under this framework, we defineBiological Interacting units(BioInt-U) as groups of proteins that interact physically and are enriched in a common Gene Ontology. A search strategy was applied on 33 tissue-specific (TS) PPI networks to generateBioIntlibraries associated with each particular human tissue. The cross-tissue comparison showed that housekeeping assemblies incorporate different proteins and exhibit distinct network properties depending on the tissue. Furthermore, disease genes (DGs) of tissue-associated pathologies preferentially accumulate in units in the expected tissues, which in turn were more central in the TS networks. Overall, the study reveals a tissue-specific functional diversification based on the identification of specific protein units and suggests vulnerabilities specific of each tissue network, which can be applied to refine protein-disease association methods.© 2022 The Author(s)."

Gene regulatory network, a key molecular mechanism linking transcription factors (TFs) and regulatory elements to govern gene expression, can change across cell types in the human brain and thus serve as a model for studying gene dysregulation in AD. However, AD-induced regulatory changes across brain cell types remains uncharted. To address this, we integrated single-cell multi-omics datasets to predict the gene regulatory networks of four major cell types, excitatory and inhibitory neurons, microglia and oligodendrocytes, in control and AD brains. Importantly, we analyzed and compared the structural and topological features of networks across cell types and examined changes in AD. Our analysis shows that hub TFs are largely common across cell types and AD-related changes are relatively more prominent in some cell types (e.g., microglia). The regulatory logics of enriched network motifs (e.g., feed-forward loops) further uncover cell type-specific TF-TF cooperativities in gene regulation. The cell type networks are also highly modular and several network modules with cell-type-specific expression changes in AD pathology are enriched with AD-risk genes. The further disease-module-drug association analysis suggests cell-type candidate drugs and their potential target genes. Finally, our network-based machine learning analysis systematically prioritized cell type risk genes likely involved in AD. Our strategy is validated using an independent dataset which showed that top ranked genes can predict clinical phenotypes (e.g., cognitive impairment) of AD with reasonable accuracy. Overall, this single-cell network biology analysis provides a comprehensive map linking genes, regulatory networks, cell types and drug targets and reveals cell-type gene dysregulation in AD."

The mothers and newborns were categorised into tertiles according to their 8-OHdG levels for further comparison. No relevant clinical differences were observed in each group. A strong correlation was observed in the mother-newborn binomial for 8-OHdG levels (Rho = 0.694,p&lt; 0.001). In the binomial, a lower level of 8-OHdG was associated with higher consumption of calories, carbohydrates, lipids, and vitamin A (p&lt; 0.05). In addition, the levels of 8-OHdG were only significantly lower in newborns from mothers with a higher consumption of vitamin A and E (p&lt; 0.01). These findings were confirmed by a significant negative correlation between the 8-OHdG levels of newborns and the maternal consumption of vitamins A and E, but not C (Rho = -0.445 (p&lt; 0.001), -0.281 (p= 0.007), and -0.120 (p= 0.257), respectively).

From January to December 2018, 34 patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC harboring EGFR T790M mutations were enrolled, and a total of 132 peripheral blood samples were collected. The fragment sizes of EGFR-mutated ctDNAs were significantly shorter than that of their corresponding normal fragments. Osimertinib treatment of patients with shorter EGFR-mutated ctDNA fragments resulted in shorter progression-free survival (PFS). The disappearance time of EGFR-mutated fragment fractions and clonal evolution patterns (new driver mutation group, additional mutation group vs. attenuation group) were each associated with the PFS achieved with osimertinib treatment; however,multivariate analysis revealed that only shorter EGFR-mutated ctDNA fragments were associated with the PFS resulting from osimertinib treatment.

The allelic changes are typically restricted to one or few SNPs, which potentially allow for the gradual adaptation and maturation of haplotypes. It is assumed to be a stochastic process but the analysis of archaic and modern human haplotypes revealed a striking variability in local NCO recombination rates.NCO recombination rates of 1.9 million archaic SNPs shared with Denisovan hominids were defined by a linkage study and correlated with functional and genomic annotations as well as ChIP-Seq data from modern humans.We detected a strong correlation between NCO recombination rates and the function of the respective region: low NCO rates were evident in introns and quiescent intergenic regions but high rates in splice sites, exons, 5'- and 3'-UTRs, as well as CpG islands. Correlations with ChIP-Seq data from ENCODE and other public sources further identified epigenetic modifications that associated directly with these recombination events. A particularly strong association was observed for 5-hydroxymethylcytosine marks (5hmC), which were enriched in virtually all of the functional regions associated with elevated NCO rates, including CpG islands and 'poised' bivalent regions.Our results suggest that 5hmC marks may guide the NCO machinery specifically towards functionally relevant regions and, as an intermediate of oxidative demethylation, may open a pathway for environmental influence by specifically targeting recently opened gene loci.© 2022.

We hypothesize that DSB toxicity may be variable depending on the chromatin environment in the targeted locus. Here, by analyzing isogenic cell line pair CRISPR experiments jointly with previous screening data from across ~900 cell lines, we show that TP53-associated break toxicity is higher in genomic regions that harbor active chromatin, such as gene regulatory elements or transcription elongation histone marks. DSB repair pathway choice and DNA sequence context also associate with toxicity. We also show that, due to noise introduced by differential toxicity of sgRNA-targeted sites, the power of genetic screens to detect conditional essentiality is reduced in TP53 wild-type cells. Understanding the determinants of Cas9 cut toxicity will help improve design of CRISPR reagents to avoid incidental selection of TP53-deficient and/or DNA repair deficient cells.© 2022.

We demonstrate that our framework outperforms other machine learning models in terms of predicting mRNA abundance using transcriptional and epigenetic profiles from six distinct cell lines/types chosen from the ENCODE. The analysis from the learned models also reveals that specific regions around promotors and transcription termination sites are most important for gene expression regulation. Using the method of Integrated Gradients, we identify narrow segments in these regions which are most likely to impact gene expression for a specific epigenetic modification.

"35887306","Bridging between Mouse and Human Enhancer-Promoter Long-Range Interactions in Neural Stem Cells, to Understand Enhancer Function in Neurodevelopmental Disease.","Int J Mol Sci","Non-coding variation in complex human disease has been well established by genome-wide association studies, and is thought to involve regulatory elements, such as enhancers, whose variation affects the expression of the gene responsible for the disease. The regulatory elements often lie far from the gene they regulate, or within introns of genes differing from the regulated gene, making it difficult to identify the gene whose function is affected by a given enhancer variation. Enhancers are connected to their target gene promoters via long-range physical interactions (loops). In our study, we re-mapped, onto the human genome, more than 10,000 enhancers connected to promoters via long-range interactions, that we had previously identified in mouse brain-derived neural stem cells by RNApolII-ChIA-PET analysis, coupled to ChIP-seq mapping of DNA/chromatin regions carrying epigenetic enhancer marks. These interactions are thought to be functionally relevant. We discovered, in the human genome, thousands of DNA regions syntenic with the interacting mouse DNA regions (enhancers and connected promoters). We further annotated these human regions regarding their overlap with sequence variants (single nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs; copy number variants, CNVs), that were previously associated with neurodevelopmental disease in humans. We document various cases in which the genetic variant, associated in humans to neurodevelopmental disease, affects an enhancer involved in long-range interactions: SNPs, previously identified by genome-wide association studies to be associated with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and intelligence, are located within our human syntenic enhancers, and alter transcription factor recognition sites. Similarly, CNVs associated to autism spectrum disease and other neurodevelopmental disorders overlap with our human syntenic enhancers. Some of these enhancers are connected (in mice) to homologs of genes already associated to the human disease, strengthening the hypothesis that the gene is indeed involved in the disease. Other enhancers are connected to genes not previously associated with the disease, pointing to their possible pathogenetic involvement. Our observations provide a resource for further exploration of neural disease, in parallel with the now widespread genome-wide identification of DNA variants in patients with neural disease."
"35879308","Extreme purifying selection against point mutations in the human genome.","Nat Commun","Large-scale genome sequencing has enabled the measurement of strong purifying selection in protein-coding genes. Here we describe a new method, called ExtRaINSIGHT, for measuring such selection in noncoding as well as coding regions of the human genome. ExtRaINSIGHT estimates the prevalence of ""ultraselection"" by the fractional depletion of rare single-nucleotide variants, after controlling for variation in mutation rates. Applying ExtRaINSIGHT to 71,702 whole genome sequences from gnomAD v3, we find abundant ultraselection in evolutionarily ancient miRNAs and neuronal protein-coding genes, as well as at splice sites. By contrast, we find much less ultraselection in other noncoding RNAs and transcription factor binding sites, and only modest levels in ultraconserved elements. We estimate that ~0.4-0.7% of the human genome is ultraselected, implying ~ 0.26-0.51 strongly deleterious mutations per generation. Overall, our study sheds new light on the genome-wide distribution of fitness effects by combining deep sequencing data and classical theory from population genetics.© 2022. The Author(s)."

Despite high expectations, toxicoepigenomic data and methods have yet to become significantly utilized in chemical risk assessment. This article draws on a social science framework to highlight hitherto overlooked structural barriers to the incorporation of toxicoepigenetics in risk assessment and to propose ways forward. The present barriers stem not only from the lack of maturity of the field but also from differences in constraints and standards between the data produced by toxicoepigenetics and the regulatory science data that risk assessment processes require. Criteria and strategies that frame the validation of knowledge used for regulatory purposes limit the application of basic research in toxicoepigenetics toward risk assessment. First, the need in regulatory toxicology for standardized methods that form a consensus between regulatory agencies, basic research, and the industry conflicts with the wealth of heterogeneous data in toxicoepigenetics. Second, molecular epigenetic data do not readily translate into typical toxicological endpoints. Third, toxicoepigenetics investigates new forms of toxicity, in particular low-dose and long-term effects, that do not align well with the traditional framework of regulatory toxicology. We propose that increasing the usefulness of epigenetic data for risk assessment will require deliberate efforts on the part of the toxicoepigenetics community in 4 areas: fostering the understanding of epigenetics among risk assessors, developing knowledge infrastructure to demonstrate applicability, facilitating the normalization and exchange of data, and opening the field to other stakeholders.© The Author(s) 2022."
"35858326","Sox9 directs divergent epigenomic states in brain tumor subtypes.","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","Epigenetic dysregulation is a universal feature of cancer that results in altered patterns of gene expression that drive malignancy. Brain tumors exhibit subtype-specific epigenetic alterations; however, the molecular mechanisms responsible for these diverse epigenetic states remain unclear. Here, we show that the developmental transcription factor Sox9 differentially regulates epigenomic states in high-grade glioma (HGG) and ependymoma (EPN). Using our autochthonous mouse models, we found that Sox9 suppresses HGG growth and expands associated H3K27ac states, while promoting ZFTA-RELA (ZRFUS) EPN growth and diminishing H3K27ac states. These contrasting roles for Sox9 correspond with protein interactions with histone deacetylating complexes in HGG and an association with the ZRFUSoncofusion in EPN. Mechanistic studies revealed extensive Sox9 and ZRFUSpromoter co-occupancy, indicating functional synergy in promoting EPN tumorigenesis. Together, our studies demonstrate how epigenomic states are differentially regulated in distinct subtypes of brain tumors, while revealing divergent roles for Sox9 in HGG and EPN tumorigenesis."

"35749574","MaxHiC: A robust background correction model to identify biologically relevant chromatin interactions in Hi-C and capture Hi-C experiments.","PLoS Comput Biol","Hi-C is a genome-wide chromosome conformation capture technology that detects interactions between pairs of genomic regions and exploits higher order chromatin structures. Conceptually Hi-C data counts interaction frequencies between every position in the genome and every other position. Biologically functional interactions are expected to occur more frequently than transient background and artefactual interactions. To identify biologically relevant interactions, several background models that take biases such as distance, GC content and mappability into account have been proposed. Here we introduce MaxHiC, a background correction tool that deals with these complex biases and robustly identifies statistically significant interactions in both Hi-C and capture Hi-C experiments. MaxHiC uses a negative binomial distribution model and a maximum likelihood technique to correct biases in both Hi-C and capture Hi-C libraries. We systematically benchmark MaxHiC against major Hi-C background correction tools including Hi-C significant interaction callers (SIC) and Hi-C loop callers using published Hi-C, capture Hi-C, and Micro-C datasets. Our results demonstrate that 1) Interacting regions identified by MaxHiC have significantly greater levels of overlap with known regulatory features (e.g. active chromatin histone marks, CTCF binding sites, DNase sensitivity) and also disease-associated genome-wide association SNPs than those identified by currently existing models, 2) the pairs of interacting regions are more likely to be linked by eQTL pairs and 3) more likely to link known regulatory features including known functional enhancer-promoter pairs validated by CRISPRi than any of the existing methods. We also demonstrate that interactions between different genomic region types have distinct distance distributions only revealed by MaxHiC. MaxHiC is publicly available as a python package for the analysis of Hi-C, capture Hi-C and Micro-C data."

Histone demethylase JMJD2D (also known as KDM4D), a member of the JMJD2 subfamily, promotes gene transcription by antagonizing H3K9 methylation. JMJD2D is an epigenetic factor coordinating androgen receptor activation, DNA damage repair, DNA replication, and cell cycle regulation. Recently, the oncogenic role of JMJD2D in colorectal cancer (CRC) and hepatocellular cancer (HCC) has been recognized. JMJD2D serves as a coactivator of β-catenin, Gli1/2, HIF1α, STAT3, IRF1, TCF4, and NICD or an antagonist of p53 to promote the progression of CRC and HCC. In this review, we summarize the molecular mechanisms of JMJD2D in promoting the progression of CRC and HCC as well as the constructive role of its targeting inhibitors in suppressing tumorigenesis and synergistically enhancing the efficacy of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy."

To better understand the impact of the host genome on somatically mutated genes and pathways, we assessed associations of germline variations with somatic events via two complementary approaches. We first analyzed the association between individual germline genetic variants and the presence of non-silent somatic mutations in genes in 1375 CRC cases with genome-wide SNPs data and a tumor sequencing panel targeting 205 genes. In the second analysis, we tested if germline variants located within previously identified regions of somatic allelic imbalance were associated with overall CRC risk using summary statistics from a recent large scale GWAS (n≃125 k CRC cases and controls). The first analysis revealed that a variant (rs78963230) located within a CNA region associated with TLR3 was also associated with a non-silent mutation within gene FBXW7. In the secondary analysis, the variant rs2302274 located in CDX1/PDGFRB frequently gained/lost in colorectal tumors was associated with overall CRC risk (OR = 0.96, p = 7.50e-7). In summary, we demonstrate that an integrative analysis of somatic and germline variation can lead to new insights about CRC.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35706127","Developmental Pathways Are Epigenetically Reprogrammed during Lung Cancer Brain Metastasis.","Cancer Res","Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is one of the most commonly diagnosed and deadliest cancers worldwide, with roughly half of all patients initially presenting with both primary and metastatic disease. While the major events in the metastatic cascade have been identified, a mechanistic understanding of how NSCLC routinely and successfully colonizes the brain is largely unknown. Recent studies have begun demonstrating the role of epigenetic misregulation during tumorigenesis and metastasis, including widespread changes in DNA methylation and histone modifications. To better understand the role of altered DNA methylation in NSCLC metastasis to the brain, we measured DNA methylation during disease progression for 12 patients, globally profiling the methylation status of normal lung, primary lung tumor, and brain metastasis samples. The variation in methylation was similar during metastatic spread and primary tumorigenesis but less coordinated across genomic features during metastasis. The greatest recurrent changes during metastatic progression were methylation gains in DNA methylation valleys (DMV) harboring the constitutive heterochromatin mark H3K9me3 as well as bivalent marks H3K27me3 and H3K4me1. In a lymph node-derived cancer cell line, EZH2 binding within DMVs was lost, accompanied by an increase in DNA methylation, exemplifying epigenetic switching. The vast majority of the differentially methylated region-associated DMVs harbored developmental genes, suggesting that altered epigenetic regulation of developmentally important genes may confer a selective advantage during metastatic progression. The characterization of epigenetic changes during NSCLC brain metastasis identified recurrent methylation patterns that may be prognostic biomarkers and contributors to disease progression.Altered DNA methylation in lung cancer brain metastases corresponds with loss of EZH2 occupancy at developmental genes, which could promote stem-like phenotypes permissive of dissemination and survival in different microenvironments.©2022 American Association for Cancer Research."

The lack of medical therapy results from an inadequate understanding of the etiopathogenesis of AAA. Many studies in animal and human models indicate a 'short-circuiting' of the regulation of the inflammatory-immune response as a major player in the AAA chronic process. In this regard, perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) has received increasing interest because its dysfunction affects large arteries primarily through immune cell infiltration. Consistently, we have recently produced evidence that innate and adaptive immune cells present in the PVAT of AAAs contribute to sustaining a damaging inflammatory loop. However, it is still unclear how the complex crosstalk between adaptive and innate immunity can be self-sustaining. From our perspective, trained immunity may play a role in this crosstalk. Trained immunity is defined as a form of innate immune memory resulting in enhanced responsiveness to repeated triggers. Specific innate stimuli and epigenetic and metabolic reprogramming events induce and shape trained immunity in myeloid progenitor cells improving host defense, but also contributing to the progression of immune-mediated and chronic inflammatory diseases. Here we present this hypothesis with data from the literature and our observations to support it.Copyright © 2022 Piacentini, Vavassori and Colombo."
"35693796","Impact of Human Genetic Variation on C-Reactive Protein Concentrations and Acute Appendicitis.","Front Immunol","Acute appendicitis is one of the most common abdominal emergencies worldwide. Both environmental and genetic factors contribute to the disease. C-reactive protein (CRP) is an important biomarker in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. CRP concentrations are significantly affected by genetic variation. However, whether such genetic variation is causally related to appendicitis risk remains unclear. In this study, the causal relationship between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with circulating CRP concentrations and the risk and severity of acute appendicitis was investigated.CRP concentrations in serum of appendicitis patients (n = 325) were measured. Appendicitis was categorized as complicated/uncomplicated and gangrenous/non-gangrenous. Imputed SNP data (n = 287) were generated. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) on CRP concentrations and appendicitis severity was performed. Intersection and colocalization of the GWAS results were performed with appendicitis and CRP-associated loci from the Pan-UKBB cohort. A functional-genomics approach to prioritize genes was employed.Thirteen percent of significant CRP quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that were previously identified in a large cohort of healthy individuals were replicated in our small patient cohort. Significant enrichment of CRP-QTLs in association with appendicitis was observed. Among these shared loci, the two top loci at chromosomes 1q41 and 8p23.1 were characterized. The top SNP at chromosome 1q41 is located within the promoter of H2.0 Like Homeobox (HLX) gene, which is involved in blood cell differentiation, and liver and gut organogeneses. The expression ofHLXis increased in the appendix of appendicitis patients compared to controls. The locus at 8p23.1 contains multiple genes, including cathepsin B (CTSB), which is overexpressed in appendix tissue from appendicitis patients. The risk allele of the top SNP in this locus also increasesCTSBexpression in the sigmoid colon of healthy individuals.CTSBis involved in collagen degradation, MHC class II antigen presentation, and neutrophil degranulation.The results of this study prioritizeHLXandCTSBas potential causal genes for appendicitis and suggest a shared genetic mechanism between appendicitis and CRP concentrations.Copyright © 2022 Ricaño-Ponce, Peeters, Matzaraki, Houben, Achten, Cools, Netea, Gyssens and Kumar."

The levels of regulation and the mechanisms involved are multiple. Transcription is the main control mechanism for most genes, being the downstream steps responsible for refining the transcription patterns. In turn, gene transcription is mainly controlled by regulatory events that occur at promoters and enhancers. Several studies are focused on analyzing the contribution of enhancers in the development of diseases and their possible use as therapeutic targets. The study of regulatory elements has advanced rapidly in recent years with the development and use of next generation sequencing techniques. All this information has generated a large volume of information that has been transferred to a growing number of public repositories that store this information. In this article, we analyze the content of those public repositories that contain information about human enhancers with the aim of detecting whether the knowledge generated by scientific research is contained in those databases in a way that could be computationally exploited. The analysis will be based on three main aspects identified in the literature: types of enhancers, type of evidence about the enhancers, and methods for detecting enhancer-promoter interactions. Our results show that no single database facilitates the optimal exploitation of enhancer data, most types of enhancers are not represented in the databases and there is need for a standardized model for enhancers. We have identified major gaps and challenges for the computational exploitation of enhancer data.© 2022 The Author(s)."

"35680026","Heterogeneity of enhancers embodies shared and representative functional groups underlying developmental and cell type-specific gene regulation.","Gene","While enhancers in a particular tissue coordinately fulfill regulatory functions, these functions are heterogeneous in nature and comprise of multiple enhancer subclasses and the associated regulatory mechanisms. In this work, we used multiple cell lines to identify enhancer subclasses linked to development, differentiation, and cellular identity. We found that enhancer functional heterogeneity during development encompasses subclasses of ubiquitous functions (11%), development specific regulatory activity (62%), and chromatin interactions (12%). In differentiated cell lines, ubiquitous enhancers (10%) stay active across multiple cell lines.They are accompanied by a large enhancer subclass (ranging from 33% to 63%) with functions specific to the corresponding lineage. The remaining enhancers (27-40%) establish regulatory chromatin structure and facilitate interactions of cell type-specific enhancers with their target promoters. In addition to specialized functions of cell type-specific enhancers, we show that proper accounting of enhancer heterogeneity leads to a 10% increase in accuracy of enhancer classification, which significantly improves the modeling of enhancers and identification of underlying regulatory mechanisms. In summary, our observations suggest that although cell type-specific enhancers are heterogeneous and coordinate different regulatory programs, enhancers from different cell lines maintain common categories of functional groups across developmental and differentiation stages, indicating a higher order rule followed by enhancer-gene regulation.Published by Elsevier B.V."
"35666184","Predicting which genes will respond to transcription factor perturbations.","G3 (Bethesda)","The ability to predict which genes will respond to the perturbation of a transcription factor serves as a benchmark for our systems-level understanding of transcriptional regulatory networks. In previous work, machine learning models have been trained to predict static gene expression levels in a biological sample by using data from the same or similar samples, including data on their transcription factor binding locations, histone marks, or DNA sequence. We report on a different challenge-training machine learning models to predict which genes will respond to the perturbation of a transcription factor without using any data from the perturbed cells. We find that existing transcription factor location data (ChIP-seq) from human cells have very little detectable utility for predicting which genes will respond to perturbation of a transcription factor. Features of genes, including their preperturbation expression level and expression variation, are very useful for predicting responses to perturbation of any transcription factor. This shows that some genes are poised to respond to transcription factor perturbations and others are resistant, shedding light on why it has been so difficult to predict responses from binding locations. Certain histone marks, including H3K4me1 and H3K4me3, have some predictive power when located downstream of the transcription start site. However, the predictive power of histone marks is much less than that of gene expression level and expression variation. Sequence-based or epigenetic properties of genes strongly influence their tendency to respond to direct transcription factor perturbations, partially explaining the oft-noted difficulty of predicting responsiveness from transcription factor binding location data. These molecular features are largely reflected in and summarized by the gene's expression level and expression variation.

Epigenetic mechanisms may mediate dysregulation. Hypotheses: (1) hypoxia-ischaemia dysregulates mRNA expression of these candidate genes; (2) expression changes inGlt1are mediated by DNA methylation changes; and (3) methylation values in brain and blood are correlated. Seven-day-old rat pups (n = 42) were assigned to nine groups based on treatment (for each timepoint: naïve (n = 3), sham (n = 3), hypoxia-ischaemia (n = 8) and timepoint for tissue collection (6, 12 and 24 h post-hypoxia). Moderate hypoxic-ischemic brain injury was induced via ligation of the left common carotid artery followed by 100 min hypoxia (8% O2, 36°C). mRNA was quantified in cortex and hippocampus for the candidate genes, myelin (Mbp), astrocytic (Gfap) and neuronal (Map2) markers (qPCR). DNA methylation was measured forGlt1in cortex and blood (bisulphite pyrosequencing). Hypoxia-ischaemia induced pro-inflammatory cytokine upregulation in both brain regions at 6 h. This was accompanied by gene expression changes potentially indicating onset of astrogliosis and myelin injury. There were no significant changes in expression or promoter DNA methylation ofGlt1. This pilot study supports accumulating evidence that hypoxia-ischaemia causes neuroinflammation in the newborn brain and prioritises further expression and DNA methylation analyses focusing on this pathway.

Both gene expression levels and amino acid variation contributed to risk. Our results from eQTL fine-mapping and amino acid visualization suggested that the HLA-DQA1*03:01 allele and variation associated with expression of the nonclassical HLA-DQA2 and HLA-DQB2 genes accounted entirely for the most significant association with AOA in GWAS.

Recent advances in single-cell genomics have led to the discovery of cell-specific chromatin landscapes that underlie transcription programs in animal models. However, the high equipment and reagent costs of commercial systems limit their applications for many laboratories. In this study, we developed a combinatorial index and dual PCR barcode strategy to profile the Arabidopsis thaliana root single-cell epigenome without any specialized equipment. We generated chromatin accessibility profiles for 13 576 root nuclei with an average of 12 784 unique Tn5 integrations per cell. Integration of the single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing and RNA sequencing data sets enabled the identification of 24 cell clusters with unique transcription, chromatin, and cis-regulatory signatures. Comparison with single-cell data generated using the commercial microfluidic platform from 10X Genomics revealed that this low-cost combinatorial index method is capable of unbiased identification of cell-type-specific chromatin accessibility. We anticipate that, by removing cost, instrumentation, and other technical obstacles, this method will be a valuable tool for routine investigation of single-cell epigenomes and provide new insights into plant growth and development and plant interactions with the environment.Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).

To help prioritize causal variants and interpret their functions, computational methods have been developed to predict regulatory effects of non-coding variants. An emerging approach to variant annotation is deep learning models that predict regulatory functions from DNA sequences alone. While such models have been trained on large publicly available dataset such as ENCODE, neuropsychiatric trait-related cell types are under-represented in these datasets, thus there is an urgent need of better tools and resources to annotate variant functions in such cellular contexts. To fill this gap, we collected a large collection of neurodevelopment-related cell/tissue types, and trained deep Convolutional Neural Networks (ResNet) using such data. Furthermore, our model, called MetaChrom, borrows information from public epigenomic consortium to improve the accuracy via transfer learning. We show that MetaChrom is substantially better in predicting experimentally determined chromatin accessibility variants than popular variant annotation tools such as CADD and delta-SVM. By combining GWAS data with MetaChrom predictions, we prioritized 31 SNPs for Schizophrenia, suggesting potential risk genes and the biological contexts where they act. In summary, MetaChrom provides functional annotations of any DNA variants in the neuro-development context and the general method of MetaChrom can also be extended to other disease-related cell or tissue types."

Here, we present Specific Nuclear-Anchored Independent Labeling (SNAIL), an improved virus-based strategy for cell labeling and nuclear isolation from heterogeneous tissue. SNAIL works by leveraging machine learning and other computational approaches to identify DNA sequence features that confer cell type-specific gene activation and then make a probe that drives an affinity purification-compatible reporter gene. As a proof of concept, we designed and validated two novel SNAIL probes that target parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) neurons. Nuclear isolation using SNAIL in wild-type mice is sufficient to capture characteristic open chromatin features of PV+ neurons in the cortex, striatum, and external globus pallidus. The SNAIL framework also has high utility for multispecies cell probe engineering; expression from a mouse PV+ SNAIL enhancer sequence was enriched in PV+ neurons of the macaque cortex.

Our findings of two distinct variants in the same gene may indicate a synergistic up-regulation of SLC15A4 as the underlying genetic cause and implicate this gene for the first time in genetic inheritance of familial CRC.© 2022.

"35560157","Shared genetic loci between depression and cardiometabolic traits.","PLoS Genet","Epidemiological and clinical studies have found associations between depression and cardiovascular disease risk factors, and coronary artery disease patients with depression have worse prognosis. The genetic relationship between depression and these cardiovascular phenotypes is not known. We here investigated overlap at the genome-wide level and in individual loci between depression, coronary artery disease and cardiovascular risk factors. We used the bivariate causal mixture model (MiXeR) to quantify genome-wide polygenic overlap and the conditional/conjunctional false discovery rate (pleioFDR) method to identify shared loci, based on genome-wide association study summary statistics on depression (n = 450,619), coronary artery disease (n = 502,713) and nine cardiovascular risk factors (n = 204,402-776,078). Genetic loci were functionally annotated using FUnctional Mapping and Annotation (FUMA). Of 13.9K variants influencing depression, 9.5K (SD 1.0K) were shared with body-mass index. Of 4.4K variants influencing systolic blood pressure, 2K were shared with depression. ConjFDR identified 79 unique loci associated with depression and coronary artery disease or cardiovascular risk factors. Six genomic loci were associated jointly with depression and coronary artery disease, 69 with blood pressure, 49 with lipids, 9 with type 2 diabetes and 8 with c-reactive protein at conjFDR < 0.05. Loci associated with increased risk for depression were also associated with increased risk of coronary artery disease and higher total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein and c-reactive protein levels, while there was a mixed pattern of effect direction for the other risk factors. Functional analyses of the shared loci implicated metabolism of alpha-linolenic acid pathway for type 2 diabetes. Our results showed polygenic overlap between depression, coronary artery disease and several cardiovascular risk factors and suggest molecular mechanisms underlying the association between depression and increased cardiovascular disease risk."

"35844554","Epigenetic Aspects and Prospects in Autoimmune Hepatitis.","Front Immunol","The observed risk of autoimmune hepatitis exceeds its genetic risk, and epigenetic factors that alter gene expression without changing nucleotide sequence may help explain the disparity. Key objectives of this review are to describe the epigenetic modifications that affect gene expression, discuss how they can affect autoimmune hepatitis, and indicate prospects for improved management. Multiple hypo-methylated genes have been described in the CD4+and CD19+T lymphocytes of patients with autoimmune hepatitis, and the circulating micro-ribonucleic acids, miR-21 and miR-122, have correlated with laboratory and histological features of liver inflammation. Both epigenetic agents have also correlated inversely with the stage of liver fibrosis. The reduced hepatic concentration of miR-122 in cirrhosis suggests that its deficiency may de-repress the pro-fibroticprolyl-4-hydroxylase subunit alpha-1 gene. Conversely, miR-155 is over-expressed in the liver tissue of patients with autoimmune hepatitis, and it may signify active immune-mediated liver injury. Different epigenetic findings have been described in diverse autoimmune and non-autoimmune liver diseases, and these changes may have disease-specificity. They may also be responses to environmental cues or heritable adaptations that distinguish the diseases. Advances in epigenetic editing and methods for blocking micro-ribonucleic acids have improved opportunities to prove causality and develop site-specific, therapeutic interventions. In conclusion, the role of epigenetics in affecting the risk, clinical phenotype, and outcome of autoimmune hepatitis is under-evaluated. Full definition of the epigenome of autoimmune hepatitis promises to enhance understanding of pathogenic mechanisms and satisfy the unmet clinical need to improve therapy for refractory disease.Copyright © 2022 Czaja."
"35941663","Integrated multi-omics analyses reveal that BCAM is associated with epigenetic modification and tumor microenvironment subtypes of clear cell renal cell carcinoma.","Clin Epigenetics","Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the most common and highly heterogeneous subtype of renal cell carcinoma. Dysregulated basal cell adhesion molecule (BCAM) gene is associated with poor prognosis in various cancers. However, the dysregulated functions and related multi-omics features of BCAM in ccRCC stay unclear.BCAM expression was aberrantly downregulated in ccRCC and correlated with adverse pathological parameters and poor prognosis. Low mRNA expression of BCAM was remarkably associated with its CpG methylation levels and BAP1 mutation status. Patients with lower-expressed BCAM concomitant with BAP1 mutation had a worse prognosis. Using RNA-seq data from The cancer genome atlas, we found that compared to the BCAM-high expression subgroup, ccRCC patients in the BCAM-low expression subgroup had significantly higher levels of immune infiltration, higher immune checkpoint expression levels and lower TIDE (tumor immune dysfunction and exclusion) score, indicating potential better response to immunotherapy. Data from the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium further validated the association between low BCAM expression and CD8 + inflamed phenotype at protein level. Meanwhile, our results suggested that the angiogenesis-related pathways were enriched in the BCAM-high expression subgroup. More importantly, according to the data from the GDSC database, we revealed that the BCAM-high expression subgroup should be more sensitive to anti-angiogenetic therapies, including sorafenib, pazopanib and axitinib.These results suggest that BCAM could serve as a biomarker distinguishing different tumor microenvironment phenotypes, predicting prognosis and helping therapeutic decision-making for patients with ccRCC.© 2022.

Distant metastasis is the leading cause of poor prognosis in ccRCC. However, ccRCC is found poorly responsitive to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Effective therapeutic strategies for its metastasis remain scarce. We analyzed clinical samples and public database, for differential expression of SLC27A2 and further explored its relationship with clinical prognosis. Biochemistry and functional experiments were carried out to study the potential mechanisms of SLC27A2, CDK3, and EMT. SLC27A2 was significantly downregulated in clinical specimens and renal cancer cell lines and predicted poor prognosis. We found that specific upregulation of SLC27A2 could significantly inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of renal cancer cell lines. SLC27A2 could also influence the Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) signaling pathway, linked to the progression and metastasis of renal cancer. Using whole transcriptome sequencing of SLC27A2, CDK3 was identified as a regulatory SLC27A2 target. In terms of mechanism, SLC27A2 may further inhibit the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition by negatively regulating CDK3. Our work suggests that functional inhibition of SLC27A2-CDK3-EMT axis may be an attractive therapeutic target for metastasis of ccRCC.© 2022. The Author(s)."

The tumor-immune crosstalk mediated by the epigenetic regulation of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification has been demonstrated in recent studies. Therefore, m6A modification-mediated immune cell infiltration characteristics may be helpful to guide immunotherapy for ccRCC.This study comprehensively analyzed m6A modifications using the clinical parameters, single-cell RNA sequencing data, and bulk RNA sequencing data from the TCGA-ccRC cohort and 13 external validation cohorts. A series of bioinformatic approaches were applied to construct an m6A regulator prognostic risk score (MRPRS) to predict survival and immunotherapy response in ccRCC patients. Immunological characteristics, enriched pathways, and mutation were evaluated in high- and low-MRPRS groups.The expressional alteration landscape of m6A regulators was profiled in ccRCC cell clusters and tissue. The 8 regulator genes with minimal lambda were integrated to build an MRPRS, and it was positively correlated with immunotherapeutic response in extent validation cohorts. The clinicopathological features and immune infiltration characteristics could be distinguished by the high- and low-MRPRS. Moreover, the MRPRS-mediated mutation pattern has an enhanced response to immune checkpoint blockade in the ccRCC and pan-cancer cohorts.The proposed MRPRS is a promising biomarker to predict clinical outcomes and therapeutic responses in ccRCC patients.Copyright © 2022 Yu, Liu, Xu, Shen, Wang, Chen, Li, Wang, Zuo and Zhao."
"35627236","A Novel Cuproptosis-Related Prognostic Gene Signature and Validation of Differential Expression in Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma.","Genes (Basel)","Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the most prevalent subtype of renal cell carcinoma, which is characterized by metabolic reprogramming. Cuproptosis, a novel form of cell death, is highly linked to mitochondrial metabolism and mediated by protein lipoylation. However, the clinical impacts of cuproptosis-related genes (CRGs) in ccRCC largely remain unclear. In the current study, we systematically evaluated the genetic alterations of cuproptosis-related genes in ccRCC. Our results revealed thatCDKN2A,DLAT,DLD,FDX1,GLS,PDHA1andPDHBexhibited differential expression between ccRCC and normal tissues (|log2(fold change)| &gt; 2/3 andp&lt; 0.05). Utilizing an iterative sure independence screening (SIS) method, we separately constructed the prognostic signature of CRGs for predicting the overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in ccRCC patients. The prognostic score of CRGs yielded an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.658 and 0.682 for the prediction of 5-year OS and PFS, respectively. In the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of OS, a higher risk score of cuproptosis-related gene signature was significantly correlated with worse overall survival (HR= 2.72 (2.01-3.68), log-rankp= 1.76 × 10-7). Patients with a higher risk had a significantly shorter PFS (HR= 2.83 (2.08-3.85), log-rankp= 3.66 × 10-7). Two independent validation datasets (GSE40435 (N= 101), GSE53757 (N= 72)) were collected for meta-analysis, suggesting that CDKN2A (log2(fold change) = 1.46, 95%CI: 1.75-2.35) showed significantly higher expression in ccRCC tissues while DLAT (log2(fold change) = -0.54, 95%CI: -0.93--0.15) and FDX1 (log2(fold change) = -1.01, 95%CI: -1.61--0.42) were lowly expressed. The expression ofCDKN2AandFDX1in ccRCC was also significantly associated with immune infiltration levels and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) expression (CDKN2A:r= 0.24,p= 2.14 × 10-8; FDX1:r= -0.17,p= 1.37 × 10-4).

Possible mechanisms involving environmental and individual factors in RA pathogenesis were analyzed, namely, infections, mental stress, sleep deprivation ecology, age, perinatal and gender factors, eating habits, obesity and smoking. The non-genetic factors modulate basic processes in the body with the impact of these factors being non-specific, but these common challenges may be decisive for advancement of the disease in the predisposed body at risk for RA. The provocation of this particular disease is associated with the presence of congenital loci minoris resistentia. The more frequent non-genetic factors form tangles of interdependent relationships and, thereby, several interdependent external factors hit one vulnerable basic process at once, either provoking or reinforcing each other. Understanding the specific mechanisms by which environmental and individual factors impact an individual under RA risk in the preclinical stages can contribute to early disease diagnosis and, if the factor is modifiable, might be useful for the prevention or delay of its development."
"35743294","Genomic Analysis of Waterpipe Smoke-Induced Lung Tumor Autophagy and Plasticity.","Int J Mol Sci","The role of autophagy in lung cancer cells exposed to waterpipe smoke (WPS) is not known. Because of the important role of autophagy in tumor resistance and progression, we investigated its relationship with WP smoking. We first showed that WPS activated autophagy, as reflected by LC3 processing, in lung cancer cell lines. The autophagy response in smokers with lung adenocarcinoma, as compared to non-smokers with lung adenocarcinoma, was investigated further using the TCGA lung adenocarcinoma bulk RNA-seq dataset with the available patient metadata on smoking status. The results, based on a machine learning classification model using Random Forest, indicate that smokers have an increase in autophagy-activating genes. Comparative analysis of lung adenocarcinoma molecular signatures in affected patients with a long-term active exposure to smoke compared to non-smoker patients indicates a higher tumor mutational burden, a higher CD8+ T-cell level and a lower dysfunction level in smokers. While the expression of the checkpoint genes tested-PD-1, PD-L1, PD-L2 and CTLA-4-remains unchanged between smokers and non-smokers, B7-1, B7-2, IDO1 and CD200R1 were found to be higher in non-smokers than smokers. Because multiple factors in the tumor microenvironment dictate the success of immunotherapy, in addition to the expression of immune checkpoint genes, our analysis explains why patients who are smokers with lung adenocarcinoma respond better to immunotherapy, even though there are no relative differences in immune checkpoint genes in the two groups. Therefore, targeting autophagy in lung adenocarcinoma patients, in combination with checkpoint inhibitor-targeted therapies or chemotherapy, should be considered in smoker patients with lung adenocarcinoma."

AhR is a ligand-activated transcription factor necessary for the launch of transcriptional responses important in health and disease. In past decades, evidence has accumulated that AhR is associated with the cellular response to oxidative stress, and this property of AhR must be taken into account during investigations into a mechanism of action of xenobiotics that is able to activate AhR or that is susceptible to metabolic activation by enzymes encoded by the genes that are under the control of AhR. In this review, we examine various mechanisms by which AhR takes part in the oxidative-stress response, including antioxidant and prooxidant enzymes and cytochrome P450. We also show that AhR, as a participant in the redox balance and as a modulator of redox signals, is being increasingly studied as a target for a new class of therapeutic compounds and as an explanation for the pathogenesis of some disorders."
"35736432","Colon Cancer: From Epidemiology to Prevention.","Metabolites","Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most prevalent cancers affecting humans, with a complex genetic and environmental aetiology. Unlike cancers with known environmental, heritable, or sex-linked causes, sporadic CRC is hard to foresee and has no molecular biomarkers of risk in clinical use. One in twenty CRC cases presents with an established heritable component. The remaining cases are sporadic and associated with partially obscure genetic, epigenetic, regenerative, microbiological, dietary, and lifestyle factors. To tackle this complexity, we should improve the practice of colonoscopy, which is recommended uniformly beyond a certain age, to include an assessment of biomarkers indicative of individual CRC risk. Ideally, such biomarkers will be causal to the disease and potentially modifiable upon dietary or therapeutic interventions. Multi-omics analysis, including transcriptional, epigenetic as well as metagenomic, and metabolomic profiles, are urgently required to provide data for risk analyses. The aim of this article is to provide a perspective on the multifactorial derailment of homeostasis leading to the initiation of CRC, which may be explored via multi-omics and Gut-on-Chip analysis to identify much-needed predictive biomarkers."
"35806113","Are Alterations in DNA Methylation Related to CKD Development?","Int J Mol Sci","The modifications in genomic DNA methylation are involved in the regulation of normal and pathological cellular processes. The epigenetic regulation stimulates biological plasticity as an adaptive response to variations in environmental factors. The role of epigenetic changes is vital for the development of some diseases, including atherogenesis, cancers, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The results of studies presented in this review have suggested that altered DNA methylation can modulate the expression of pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic genes, as well those essential for kidney development and function, thus stimulating renal disease progression. Abnormally increased homocysteine, hypoxia, and inflammation have been suggested to alter epigenetic regulation of gene expression in CKD. Studies of renal samples have demonstrated the relationship between variations in DNA methylation and fibrosis and variations in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in human CKD. The unravelling of the genetic-epigenetic profile would enhance our understanding of processes underlying the development of CKD. The understanding of multifaceted relationship between DNA methylation, genes expression, and disease development and progression could improve the ability to identify individuals at risk of CKD and enable the choice of appropriate disease management."

PDAC is often associated with poor prognosis, due to the late diagnosis that leads to metastasis development, and limited efficacy of available treatments. The tumor microenvironment (TME) represents a reliable source of novel targets for therapy, and even if many of the biological interactions among stromal, immune, and cancer cells that populate the TME have been studied, much more needs to be clarified. The great limitation in the efficacy of current standard chemoterapy is due to both the dense fibrotic inaccessible TME barrier surrounding cancer cells and the immunological evolution from a tumor-suppressor to an immunosuppressive environment. Nevertheless, combinatorial therapies may prove more effective at overcoming resistance mechanisms and achieving tumor cell killing. To achieve this result, a deeper understanding of the pathological mechanisms driving tumor progression and immune escape is required in order to design rationale-based therapeutic strategies. This review aims to summarize the present knowledge about cellular interactions in the TME, with much attention on immunosuppressive functioning and a specific focus on extracellular matrix (ECM) contribution.Copyright © 2022 Agostini, Orlacchio, Carbone and Guerriero."

Previous studies have suggested that ITPRs participate in tumorigenesis of multiple cancers. Nevertheless, the diverse expression profiles and prognostic significance of three ITPRs in pancreatic cancer have yet to be uncovered. In this work, we examined the expression levels and survival dates of ITPRs in patients with pancreatic cancer. As a result, we identified that ITPR1 and ITPR3 expression levels are significantly elevated in cancerous specimens. Survival data revealed that over-expression of ITPR2 and ITPR3 resulted in unfavourable overall survival and pathological stage. The multivariate Cox logistic regression analysis showed that ITPR3 could be an independent risk factor for PAAD patient survival. Moreover, to investigate how ITPRs work, co-expressed genes, alterations, protein-protein interaction, immune infiltration, methylation, and functional enrichment of ITPRs were also analyzed. Then, we evaluated these findings in clinical samples. Moreover, the gain and loss of function of ITPR3 were also conducted. The electron microscope assay was employed to explore the role of ITPR3 in pancreatic cancer cell lines' endoplasmic reticulum stress. In summary, our findings demonstrated that ITPR3 has the potential to be drug targets and biomarkers for human pancreatic cancer."

The ubiquitous expression of the AhR across mammalian tissues coupled with its role in diverse signaling pathways makes development of a ""clean"" AhR therapeutically challenging. Ligand promiscuity and diversity in context-specific AhR activation further complicates targeting the AhR for drug development due to limitations surrounding clinical translatability. Despite these concerns, several approaches to target the AhR have been explored such as small molecules, microbials, PROTACs, and oligonucleotide-based approaches. These various chemical modalities are not without safety liabilities and require unique de-risking strategies to parse out toxicities. Collectively, these programs can benefit from in silico and in vitro methodologies that investigate specific AhR pathway activation and have the potential to implement thresholding parameters to categorize AhR ligands as ""high"" or ""low"" risk for sustained AhR activation. Exploration into transcriptomic signatures for AhR safety assessment, incorporation of physiologically-relevant in vitro model systems, and investigation into chronic activation of the AhR by structurally diverse ligands will help address gaps in our understanding regarding AhR-dependent toxicities. Here, we review the role of the AhR within the GI tract, novel therapeutic modality approaches to target the AhR, key AhR-dependent safety liabilities, and relevant strategies that can be implemented to address drug safety concerns. Together, this review discusses the emerging therapeutic landscape of modalities targeting the AhR for inflammatory GI indications and offers a safety roadmap for AhR drug development."

A growing body of evidence indicates that environmental factors significantly affect the neural development and function of the central nervous system and then induce psychiatric disorders. Early life stress (ELS) affects brain development and has been identified as a major cause of depression. It could promote susceptibility to stress in adulthood. Recent studies have found that ELS induces epigenetic changes that subsequently affect transcriptional rates of differentially expressed genes. The epigenetic modifications involved in ELS include histone modifications, DNA methylation, and non-coding RNA. Understanding of these genetic modifications may identify mechanisms that may lead to new interventions for the treatment of depression. Many reports indicate that different types of ELS induce epigenetic modifications of genes involved in the neurotransmitter systems, such as the dopaminergic system, the serotonergic system, the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic system, and the glutamatergic system, which further regulate gene expression and ultimately induce depression-like behaviors.

While this phenomenon has been observed in adherent cell models, whether/how contractile forces regulate the function of suspension cells like natural killer (NK) cells during cancer surveillance, is unknown. Here, we demonstrated in coculture settings that the evolutionarily conserved NK cell transcription factor, Eomes, undergoes nuclear shuttling during lung cancer cell surveillance. Biophysical and biochemical analyses revealed mechanistic enhancement of NK cell actomyosin-mediated contractility, which is associated with nuclear flattening, thus enabling nuclear entry of Eomes associated with enhanced NK cytotoxicity. We found that NK cells responded to the presumed immunosuppressive TGFβ in the NK-lung cancer coculture medium to sustain its intracellular contractility through myosin light chain phosphorylation, thereby promoting Eomes nuclear localization. Therefore, our results demonstrate that lung cancer cells provoke NK cell contractility as an early phase activation mechanism and that Eomes is a plausible mechano-responsive protein for increased NK cytotoxicity.

Abnormalities in these processes underlie various neurodevelopmental, neuropsychiatric, and neurodegenerative disorders. Neural development and maintenance are regulated by many proteins. Among them are Par3, Par6 (partitioning defective 3 and 6), and aPKC (atypical protein kinase C) families of evolutionarily conserved polarity proteins. These proteins perform versatile functions by forming tripartite or other combinations of protein complexes, which hereafter are collectively referred to as ""Par complexes."" In this review, we summarize the major findings on their biophysical and biochemical properties in cell polarization and signaling pathways. We next summarize their expression and localization in the nervous system as well as their versatile functions in various aspects of neurodevelopment, including neuroepithelial polarity, neurogenesis, neuronal migration, neurite differentiation, synaptic plasticity, and memory. These versatile functions rely on the fundamental roles of Par complexes in cell polarity in distinct cellular contexts. We also discuss how cell polarization may correlate with subcellular polarization in neurons. Finally, we review the involvement of Par complexes in neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders, such as schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease. While emerging evidence indicates that Par complexes are essential for proper neural development and maintenance, many questions on theirin vivofunctions have yet to be answered.

Despite the pathological processing of genes such asAmyloid Precursor Protein(APP) into Amyloid-β andMicrotubule Associated Protein Tau(MAPT) gene, into hyperphosphorylated Tau tangles being known for decades, there remains no treatments to halt disease progression. One population with increased risk of AD are people with Down syndrome (DS), who have a 90% lifetime incidence of AD, due to trisomy of human chromosome 21 (HSA21) resulting in three copies ofAPPand other AD-associated genes, such asDYRK1A(Dual specificity tyrosine-phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1A) overexpression. This suggests that blocking DYRK1A might have therapeutic potential. However, it is still not clear to what extent DYRK1A overexpression by itself leads to AD-like phenotypes and how these compare to Tau and Amyloid-β mediated pathology. Likewise, it is still not known how effective a DYRK1A antagonist may be at preventing or improving any Tau, Amyloid-β and DYRK1a mediated phenotype. To address these outstanding questions, we characterisedDrosophilamodels with targeted overexpression of humanTau, humanAmyloid-βor the fly orthologue ofDYRK1A, calledminibrain(mnb). We found targeted overexpression of these AD-associated genes caused degeneration of photoreceptor neurons, shortened lifespan, as well as causing loss of locomotor performance, sleep, and memory. Treatment with the experimental DYRK1A inhibitor PST-001 decreased pathological phosphorylation of human Tau [at serine (S) 262].

"35893045","Epigenetic Peripheral Biomarkers for Early Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease.","Genes (Basel)","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder and represents the leading cause of cognitive impairment and dementia in older individuals throughout the world. The main hallmarks of AD include brain atrophy, extracellular deposition of insoluble amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques, and the intracellular aggregation of protein tau in neurofibrillary tangles. These pathological modifications start many years prior to clinical manifestations of disease and thespectrumof AD progresses along acontinuumfrom preclinical to clinical phases. Therefore, identifying specific biomarkers for detecting AD at early stages greatly improves clinical management. However, stable and non-invasive biomarkers are not currently available for the early detection of the disease. In the search for more reliable biomarkers, epigenetic mechanisms, able to mediate the interaction between the genome and the environment, are emerging as important players in AD pathogenesis. Herein, we discuss altered epigenetic signatures in blood as potential peripheral biomarkers for the early detection of AD in order to help diagnosis and improve therapy."
"35839250","Explainable deep transfer learning model for disease risk prediction using high-dimensional genomic data.","PLoS Comput Biol","Building an accurate disease risk prediction model is an essential step in the modern quest for precision medicine. While high-dimensional genomic data provides valuable data resources for the investigations of disease risk, their huge amount of noise and complex relationships between predictors and outcomes have brought tremendous analytical challenges. Deep learning model is the state-of-the-art methods for many prediction tasks, and it is a promising framework for the analysis of genomic data. However, deep learning models generally suffer from the curse of dimensionality and the lack of biological interpretability, both of which have greatly limited their applications. In this work, we have developed a deep neural network (DNN) based prediction modeling framework. We first proposed a group-wise feature importance score for feature selection, where genes harboring genetic variants with both linear and non-linear effects are efficiently detected. We then designed an explainable transfer-learning based DNN method, which can directly incorporate information from feature selection and accurately capture complex predictive effects. The proposed DNN-framework is biologically interpretable, as it is built based on the selected predictive genes. It is also computationally efficient and can be applied to genome-wide data. Through extensive simulations and real data analyses, we have demonstrated that our proposed method can not only efficiently detect predictive features, but also accurately predict disease risk, as compared to many existing methods."

Still, they differ in their ultimate manifestation, the affected brain region, and the kind of proteinopathy. In the last decades, a vast number of processes have been described as associated with neurodegenerative diseases, making it increasingly harder to keep an overview of the big picture forming from all those data. In this meta-study, we analyzed genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and epigenomic data of the aforementioned diseases using the data of 234 studies in a network-based approach to study significant general coherences but also specific processes in individual diseases or omics levels. In the analysis part, we focus on only some of the emerging findings, but trust that the meta-study provided here will be a valuable resource for various other researchers focusing on specific processes or genes contributing to the development of neurodegeneration.Copyright © 2022 Ruffini, Klingenberg, Heese, Schweiger and Gerber."
"35774552","Alzheimer's Disease-Related Genes Identified by Linking Spatial Patterns of Pathology and Gene Expression.","Front Neurosci","Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disease with a poorly understood etiology, shown to be partly genetic. Glucose hypometabolism, extracellular Amyloid-beta (Aβ) deposition, and intracellular Tau deposition are cardinal features of AD and display characteristic spatial patterns in the brain. We hypothesize that regional differences in underlying gene expression confer either resistance or susceptibility to AD pathogenic processes and are associated with these spatial patterns. Data-driven methods for the identification of genes involved in AD pathogenesis complement hypothesis-driven approaches that reflect current theories about the disease. Here we present a data driven method for the identification of genes involved in AD pathogenesis based on comparing spatial patterns of normal gene expression to Positron Emission Tomography (PET) images of glucose hypometabolism, Aβ deposition, and Tau deposition.We performed correlations between the cerebral cortex microarray samples from the six cognitively normal (CN) post-mortem Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA) specimens and PET FDG-18, AV-45, and AV-1451 tracer images from AD and CN participants in the Alzheimer's Disease and Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Correlation coefficients for each gene by each ADNI subject were then entered into a partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) to determine sets that best classified the AD and CN groups. Pathway analysisviaBioPlanet 2019 was then used to infer the function of implicated genes.We identified distinct sets of genes strongly associated with each PET modality. Pathway analyses implicated novel genes involved in mitochondrial function, and Notch signaling, as well as genes previously associated with AD.Using an unbiased approach, we derived sets of genes with expression patterns spatially associated with FDG hypometabolism, Aβ deposition, and Tau deposition in AD.

"35902735","Fetoplacental oxygen homeostasis in pregnancies with maternal diabetes mellitus and obesity.","Nat Rev Endocrinol","Despite improvements in clinical management, pregnancies complicated by pre-existing diabetes mellitus, gestational diabetes mellitus or obesity carry substantial risks for parent and offspring. Some of the endocrine and metabolic changes in parent and fetus in diabetes mellitus and obesity lead to fetal oxygen deficit, mostly due to insulin-induced accelerated fetal metabolism. The human fetus deals with reduced oxygenation through a wide range of adaptive responses that act at various levels in the placenta as well as the fetus. These responses ensure adequate oxygen delivery to the fetus, increase the oxygen transport capacity of fetal blood and redistribute oxygen-rich blood to vital organs such as the brain and heart. The liver has a central role in adapting to reduced oxygenation by increasing its oxygen extraction and stimulating erythropoietin synthesis to increase haematocrit. The type of adaptive response depends on the onset and duration of hypoxia and the severity of the metabolic disturbance. In pregnancies characterized by diabetes mellitus or obesity, these adaptive systems come under additional strain owing to the increased maternal supply of glucose and resultant fetal hyperinsulinaemia, both of which stimulate oxidative metabolism. In the rare situation that the adaptive responses are overwhelmed, stillbirth can ensue.© 2022. Springer Nature Limited."

Linking DNA methylation to CCU-extent could help to understand cannabis associated changes in cognitive performance. We analyzed cognitive task performances, CpG methylation in peripheral whole-blood samples and self-reported past-year CCU-extent of n = 18 adolescents (n = 9 psychiatric outpatients with chronic cannabis use (CCU), n = 9 without) who were matched for age, gender and psychiatric disorders. Patients with CCU were at least 24 h abstinent when cognitive tasks were performed. A Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was carried out to identify group differences in whole genome DNA methylation. Mediation analyses were performed between CCU-extent associated CpG sites and CCU-extent associated variables of cognitive tasks. PCA results indicated large differences in whole genome DNA methylation levels between the groups that did not reach statistical significance. Six CpG sites revealed reduced methylation associated with CCU-extent. Furthermore, CCU-extent was associated with lower scores in verbal learning. All six CpG sites mediated the effects between CCU-extent and verbal learning free recall. Our results indicate that CCU is associated with certain patterns in the methylome. Furthermore, CCU-extent associated impairments in memory function are mediated via differential methylation of the six CCU-associated CpG sits. Six identified CpG are located in genes previously described in the context of neurodegeneration, hippocampus-dependent learning and neurogenesis. However, these results have to be carefully interpreted due to a small sample size. Replication studies are warranted.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35693821","Asthma and the Missing Heritability Problem: Necessity for Multiomics Approaches in Determining Accurate Risk Profiles.","Front Immunol","Asthma is ranked among the most common chronic conditions and has become a significant public health issue due to the recent and rapid increase in its prevalence. Investigations into the underlying genetic factors predict a heritable component for its incidence, estimated between 35% and 90% of causation. Despite the application of large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and admixture mapping approaches, the proportion of variants identified accounts for less than 15% of the observed heritability of the disease. The discrepancy between the predicted heritable component of disease and the proportion of heritability mapped to the currently identified susceptibility loci has been termed the 'missing heritability problem.' Here, we examine recent studies involving both the analysis of genetically encoded features that contribute to asthma and also the role of non-encoded heritable characteristics, including epigenetic, environmental, and developmental aspects of disease. The importance of vertical maternal microbiome transfer and the influence of maternal immune factors on fetal conditioning in the inheritance of disease are also discussed. In order to highlight the broad array of biological inputs that contribute to the sum of heritable risk factors associated with allergic disease incidence that, together, contribute to the induction of a pro-atopic state. Currently, there is a need to develop in-depth models of asthma risk factors to overcome the limitations encountered in the interpretation of GWAS results in isolation, which have resulted in the missing heritability problem. Hence, multiomics analyses need to be established considering genetic, epigenetic, and functional data to create a true systems biology-based approach for analyzing the regulatory pathways that underlie the inheritance of asthma and to develop accurate risk profiles for disease.Copyright © 2022 Augustine, Al-Aghbar, Al-Kowari, Espino-Guarch and van Panhuys."

However, overexpression of YAP alone in multiple normal tissue cells has failed to induce tumor formation and the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. Herein, we show that YAP activation directly induces transcription of its negative regulator, SAV1, to constitute a negative feedback loop, which plays a vital role in maintaining lung epithelial cell homeostasis and was dysregulated in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Notably, smoking promotes the hypermethylation of theSAV1promoter region, which disrupts YAP negative feedback by inactivating the Hippo pathway. Besides, exogenous overexpression of SAV1 can act as a traffic protein, activating the Hippo signaling and concurrently inhibiting the WNT pathway to decrease cancer cell growth. Furthermore, using the lung cancer organoids, we found that lentivirus-mediated SAV1 gene transfer combined with methylation inhibitor and YAP-TEAD inhibitor is a potential feasible clinical medication regimen for the lung cancer patient, especially among the smoking population. Thus, this SAV1 mediated feedback loop provides an efficient mechanism to establish the robustness and homeostasis of YAP regulation and as a potential target of gene therapy for the smoking NSCLC population.© The author(s)."

The prognosis of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is determined by the degree of invasiveness of the primary tumor and by the extent of metastatic spread into regional and distant lymph nodes. Moreover, the level of the perineural invasion itself associates with tumor localization, invasion's extent, and the presence of nodal metastases. Here, we summarize the current knowledge about different aspects of epigenetic changes, which can be associated with HNSCC while focusing on perineural invasion (PNI). We review epigenetic modifications of the genes involved in the PNI process in HNSCC from the omics perspective and specific epigenetic modifications in OSCC or other neurotropic cancers associated with perineural invasion. Moreover, we summarize DNA methylation status of tumor-suppressor genes, methylation and demethylation enzymes and histone post-translational modifications associated with PNI. The influence of other epigenetic factors on the HNSCC incidence and perineural invasion such as tobacco, alcohol and oral microbiome is overviewed and HPV infection is discussed as an epigenetic factor associated with OSCC and related perineural invasion.

The aim of our study is evaluation of the methylation status of 33 CpG islands located in theDAT1gene promoter region related to nicotine dependency. We investigated 142 nicotine-dependent subjects and 238 controls. Our results show that as many as 14 of the 33 CpG islands tested had statistically significantly higher methylation in the nicotine-dependent group compared to the control group. After applying Bonferroni correction, the total number of methylation sites was also significantly higher in the dependent subjects group. The analysis of the methylation status of particular CpG sites revealed a new direction of research regarding the biological aspects of nicotine addiction."

The objectives of this study were to estimate the heritability and age effects of site-specific DNAm (DNAm level) and cumulative DNAm across all sites (DNAm load) in beef cattle. Blood samples were collected from cows ranging from 217 to 3,192 days (0.6 to 8.7 years) of age (n = 136). All animals were genotyped, and DNAm was obtained using the Infinium array HorvathMammalMethylChip40. Genetic parameters for DNAm were obtained from an animal model based on the genomic relationship matrix, including the fixed effects of age and breed composition. Heritability estimates of DNAm levels ranged from 0.18 to 0.72, with a similar average across all regions and chromosomes. Heritability estimate of DNAm load was 0.45. The average age effect on DNAm level varied among genomic regions. The DNAm level across the genome increased with age in the promoter and 5' UTR and decreased in the exonic, intronic, 3' UTR, and intergenic regions. In addition, DNAm level increased with age in regions enriched in CpG and decreased in regions deficient in CpG. Results suggest DNAm profiles are influenced by both genetics and the environmental effect of age in beef cattle.© 2022. The Author(s)."

Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based analysis was performed by logistic regression models, controlling for age, gender, body mass index, and the first 3 genetic principal components. Gene-based analysis was conducted by combining SNP-based p values using effective Chi-square test method. Promising SNPs (p < 1×10-5) and genes (p < 1×10-4) were further evaluated for replication among 514 White participants of the Framingham Heart Study (FHS). To accommodate familial correlations, generalized estimation equation models were applied for SNP-based analyses in the FHS.

Epigenetics refers to reversible changes in gene expression that are not accompanied by changes in gene sequence. In breast cancer (BC), dysregulated epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation and histone modifications, are accompanied by epitranscriptomic changes, in particular adenine to inosine modifications within RNA molecules. Factors that trigger these phenomena are largely unknown, but there is evidence for widespread participation of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that already have been linked to virtually any aspect of BC biology, making them promising biomarkers and therapeutic targets in BC patients.

Additionally, NOS2 expression results in aggressive cancer cell phenotypes and is correlated with poor outcomes in patients with breast cancer. DNA hypomethylation, especially of noncoding repeat elements, is an early event in carcinogenesis and is a common feature of cancer cells. In addition to altered gene expression, DNA hypomethylation results in genomic instability via retrotransposon activation. Here, we show that NOS2 expression and associated NO signaling results in substantial DNA hypomethylation in human cell lines by inducing the degradation of DNA (cytosine-5)–methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) protein. Similarly, NOS2 expression levels were correlated with decreased DNA methylation in human breast tumors. NOS2 expression and NO signaling also resulted in long interspersed noncoding element 1 (LINE-1) retrotransposon hypomethylation, expression, and DNA damage. DNMT1 degradation was mediated by an NO/p38-MAPK/lysine acetyltransferase 5–dependent mechanism. Furthermore, we show that this mechanism is required for NO-mediated epithelial transformation. Therefore, we conclude that NOS2 and NO signaling results in DNA damage and malignant cellular transformation via an epigenetic mechanism."
"35679362","Illuminating the Mechanisms Underlying Sex Differences in Cardiovascular Disease.","Circ Res","Sex is a key risk factor for many types of cardiovascular disease. It is imperative to understand the mechanisms underlying sex differences to devise optimal preventive and therapeutic approaches for all individuals. Both biological sex (determined by sex chromosomes and gonadal hormones) and gender (social and cultural behaviors associated with femininity or masculinity) influence differences between men and women in disease susceptibility and pathology. Here, we focus on the application of experimental mouse models that elucidate the influence of 2 components of biological sex-sex chromosome complement (XX or XY) and gonad type (ovaries or testes). These models have revealed that in addition to well-known effects of gonadal hormones, sex chromosome complement influences cardiovascular risk factors, such as plasma cholesterol levels and adiposity, as well as the development of atherosclerosis and pulmonary hypertension. One mechanism by which sex chromosome dosage influences cardiometabolic traits is through sex-biased expression of X chromosome genes that escape X inactivation. These include chromatin-modifying enzymes that regulate gene expression throughout the genome. The identification of factors that determine sex-biased gene expression and cardiometabolic traits will expand our mechanistic understanding of cardiovascular disease processes and provide insight into sex differences that remain throughout the lifespan as gonadal hormone levels alter with age."

PM2.5and ambient temperature were matched to participants' addresses and confirmed by GPS tracker. Using linear mixed-effects models, we examined the association between 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month average PM2.5and ambient temperature with repeated log-transformed HbA1c values. All models included a random intercept for each woman and were adjusted for calendar year, season, and individual-level confounders (age, marital status, smoking, alcohol consumption level, and education level).We analyzed 1,265 HbA1c measurements of 484 women. Per 1 µg/m3increase in 3-month and 6-month PM2.5, HbA1c levels increased by 0.28% (95% confidence interval (95 %CI): 0.14, 0.42%) and 0.28% (95 %CI: 0.04, 0.52%) respectively. No association was seen for 12-month average PM2.5. Per 1 °C increase in ambient temperature, HbA1c levels decreased by 0.63% (95 %CI: -1.06, -0.21%) and 0.61% (95 %CI: -1.08, -0.13%), while the 12-month average again is not associated with HbA1c.Intermediate-term exposure to PM2.5and ambient temperature are associated with opposing changes in HbA1c levels, in this region of high PM2.5and moderate temperature fluctuation.

The alternation of DNA methylation levels has been implicated in regulating the expression of theEYA4gene. Thus, in this study, we have shown the effect of CS on the DNA methylation level of theEYA4promoter region as well as the methylation level onEYA4expression. To determine the level of DNA methylation on the promoter region of theEYA4gene, we have employed the bisulfite conversion treatment followed by the Sanger Sequence for 100 DNA samples taken from Saudi people (50 smokers and 50 nonsmokers). We found that 26% of DNA extracted from smoker samples is methylated, while there was no methylation identified in nonsmoker samples. Also, using the demethylating agents such as AZA on LoVo and Caco-2 cancer cell lines causes induction of transcription level ofEYA4, implying the possible mechanism of DNA methylation in the upregulation ofEYA4. These findings suggest the possible mechanism of CS in controlling the expression ofEYA4via changing the status of DNA methylation.Copyright © 2022 Bader O. Almutairi et al."

By 1:2 propensity score matching, a total of 2123 treated patients and 4246 untreated patients were subjected to analysis. The incidence rates and risks of SS and death were evaluated through to the end of 2012. In a total follow-up of 36,906 person-years, 177 (2.8%) patients developed SS, and 522 (8.2%) died during the study period. The incidence rates of SS for the treated and untreated cohorts were 5.3 vs. 4.7/1000 person-years, and those of death for the treated and untreated cohorts were 10.0 vs. 14.8/1000 person-years. A lower risk of death (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.53-0.87) was present in HCV-infected patients receiving anti-HCV therapy in multivariable Cox regression, and this remained consistent in multivariable stratified analysis. However, there were no relationships between anti-HCV therapy and its therapeutic duration, and SS risk in multivariable Cox regression. In conclusion, anti-HCV intervention therapy was not associated with lower SS risk in HCV-infected patients, but associated with lower death risk."

The immunopathogenesis of SjS is caused by the sequential infiltration of T and B cells into exocrine glands, including salivary and lacrimal glands. Effector cytokines produced by these immunocytes, such as interferons (IFNs), IL-17, IL-22, IL-21, IL-4, TNF-α, BAFF and APRIL, play critical roles in promoting autoimmune responses and inducing tissue damages. Epigenetic regulations, including DNA methylation, histone modification and non-coding RNAs, have recently been comprehensively studied during the activation of various immunocytes. The deficiency of key epigenetic enzymes usually leads to aberrant immune activation. Epigenetic modifications in T and B cells are usually found to be altered during the immunopathogenesis of SjS, and they are closely correlated with autoimmune responses. In particular, the important role of methylation in activating IFN pathways during SjS progression has been revealed. Thus, according to the involvement of epigenetic regulations in SjS, target therapies to reverse the altered epigenetic modifications in auto-responsive T and B cells are worthy of being considered as a potential therapeutic strategy for SjS."

There is a 30-40 percent higher risk of developing T2D in active smokers. Moreover, T2D patients with active smoking may gradually develop many complications. However, there is still no significant research conducted to solve the issue. Hence, we have proposed a highthroughput network-based quantitative pipeline employing statistical methods. Transcriptomic and GWAS data were analysed and obtained from type 2 diabetes patients and active smokers. Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) resulted by comparing T2D patients' and smokers' tissue samples to those of healthy controls of gene expression transcriptomic datasets. We have found 55 dysregulated genes shared in people with type 2 diabetes and those who smoked, 27 of which were upregulated and 28 of which were downregulated. These identified DEGs were functionally annotated to reveal the involvement of cell-associated molecular pathways and GO terms. Moreover, protein-protein interaction analysis was conducted to discover hub proteins in the pathways. We have also identified transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulators associated with T2D and smoking. Moreover, we have analysed GWAS data and found 57 common biomarker genes between T2D and smokers. Then, Transcriptomic and GWAS analyses are compared for more robust outcomes and identified 1 significant common gene, 19 shared significant pathways and 12 shared significant GOs. Finally, we have discovered protein-drug interactions for our identified biomarkers."
"35799249","Seasonal differences in breastfeeding in the United States: a secondary analysis of longitudinal survey data.","Int Breastfeed J","Both the consumption of breastmilk in infancy and a person's season of birth influences his or her health, educational, professional, and behavioral outcomes. Further, season of birth effects differ by sex. However, current research, for the most part, neglects to examine if season of birth and breastfeeding are related. This paper examines the impact of sex-based variations in season of birth on breastfeeding likelihood and duration in the U.S.Using data from children born to female respondents of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (born between 1970 and 2012), this study examines with Probit, Negative Binomial, and Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regressions if a child's season of birth and sex are correlated with breastfeeding incidence and duration. The breastfeeding incidence and duration data are self-reported by the mother.Season of birth has a small but statistically significant impact on the incidence and duration of breastfeeding, which varies depending on the sex of the infant. Mothers giving birth to sons in the spring are 13.5% less likely to breastfeed than those giving birth to sons in the winter (with a p - value of 0.0269). Mothers with daughters born in the summer or fall (autumn) breastfeed slightly longer than mothers with daughters born in the spring. On average, mothers of summer-born daughters breastfeed 4.1% longer (with a 95% confidence interval of 0.3 - 7.8) and those with fall-born daughters 3.8% longer (with a 95% confidence interval of 0 - 7.5). Mothers giving birth to daughters in the spring are also significantly less likely to reach the breastfeeding six-week duration target (compared to fall and winter births) and the one-year duration target (compared to fall births).These findings suggest that the costs and benefits of breastfeeding an infant vary with the season of birth and the sex of the child. This finding could explain some of the season of birth effects previously identified in the literature. Further, policymakers seeking to increase breastfeeding rates should consider the reduced breastfeeding rates and durations for children born in the spring.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35802167","Glucose-mediated insulin secretion is improved in FHL2-deficient mice and elevated FHL2 expression in humans is associated with type 2 diabetes.","Diabetologia","The general population is ageing, involving an enhanced incidence of chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes. With ageing, DNA methylation of FHL2 increases, as well as expression of the four and a half LIM domains 2 (FHL2) protein in human pancreatic islets. We hypothesised that FHL2 is actively involved in glucose metabolism.Publicly available microarray datasets from human pancreatic islets were analysed for FHL2 expression. In FHL2-deficient mice, we studied glucose clearance and insulin secretion. Gene expression analysis and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) were determined in isolated murine FHL2-deficient islets to evaluate insulin-secretory capacity. Moreover, knockdown and overexpression of FHL2 were accomplished in MIN6 cells to delineate the underlying mechanism of FHL2 function.Transcriptomics of human pancreatic islets revealed that individuals with elevated levels of HbA1cdisplayed increased FHL2 expression, which correlated negatively with insulin secretion pathways. In line with this observation, FHL2-deficient mice cleared glucose more efficiently than wild-type littermates through increased plasma insulin levels. Insulin sensitivity was comparable between these genotypes. Interestingly, pancreatic islets isolated from FHL2-deficient mice secreted more insulin in GSIS assays than wild-type mouse islets even though insulin content and islet size was similar. To support this observation, we demonstrated increased expression of the transcription factor crucial in insulin secretion, MAF BZIP transcription factor A (MafA), higher expression of GLUT2 and reduced expression of the adverse factor c-Jun in FHL2-deficient islets. The underlying mechanism of FHL2 was further delineated in MIN6 cells. FHL2-knockdown led to enhanced activation of forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1) and its downstream genes such as Mafa and Pdx1 (encoding pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1), as well as increased glucose uptake. On the other hand, FHL2 overexpression in MIN6 cells blocked GSIS, increased the formation of reactive oxygen species and increased c-Jun activity.Our data demonstrate that FHL2 deficiency improves insulin secretion from beta cells and improves glucose tolerance in mice. Given that FHL2 expression in humans increases with age and that high expression levels of FHL2 are associated with beta cell dysfunction, we propose that enhanced FHL2 expression in elderly individuals contributes to glucose intolerance and the development of type 2 diabetes.The human islet microarray datasets used are publicly available and can be found on https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/ .© 2022.

"35653832","Prenatal exposure to particulate matter and placental gene expression.","Environ Int","While strong evidence supports adverse maternal and offspring consequences of air pollution, mechanisms that involve the placenta, a key part of the intrauterine environment, are largely unknown. Previous studies of air pollution and placental gene expression were small candidate gene studies that rarely considered prenatal windows of exposure or the potential role of offspring sex. We examined overall and sex-specific associations of prenatal exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) with genome-wide placental gene expression.Participants with placenta samples, collected at birth, and childhood health outcomes from CANDLE (Memphis, TN) (n = 776) and GAPPS (Seattle, WA) (n = 205) cohorts of the ECHO-PATHWAYS Consortium were included in this study. PM2.5exposures during trimesters 1, 2, 3, and the first and last months of pregnancy, were estimated using a spatiotemporal model. Cohort-specific linear adjusted models were fit for each exposure window and expression of >11,000 protein coding genes from paired end RNA sequencing data. Models with interaction terms were used to examine PM2.5-offspring sex interactions. False discovery rate (FDR < 0.10) was used to correct for multiple testing.Mean PM2.5estimate was 10.5-10.7 μg/m3for CANDLE and 6.0-6.3 μg/m3for GAPPS participants. In CANDLE, expression of 13 (11 upregulated and 2 downregulated), 20 (11 upregulated and 9 downregulated) and 3 (2 upregulated and 1 downregulated) genes was associated with PM2.5in the first trimester, second trimester, and first month, respectively. While we did not find any statistically significant association, overall, between PM2.5and gene expression in GAPPS, we found offspring sex and first month PM2.5interaction for DDHD1 expression (positive association among males and inverse association among females). We did not observe PM2.5and offspring sex interactions in CANDLE.In CANDLE, but not GAPPS, we found that prenatal PM2.5exposure during the first half of pregnancy is associated with placental gene expression.Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

"35883450","Pitfalls of Antiretroviral Therapy: Current Status and Long-Term CNS Toxicity.","Biomolecules","HIV can traverse the BBB using a Trojan horse-like mechanism. Hidden within infected immune cells, HIV can infiltrate the highly safeguarded CNS and propagate disease. Once integrated within the host genome, HIV becomes a stable provirus, which can remain dormant, evade detection by the immune system or antiretroviral therapy (ART), and result in rebound viraemia. As ART targets actively replicating HIV, has low BBB penetrance, and exposes patients to long-term toxicity, further investigation into novel therapeutic approaches is required. Viral proteins can be produced by latent HIV, which may play a synergistic role alongside ART in promoting neuroinflammatory pathophysiology. It is believed that the ability to specifically target these proviral reservoirs would be a vital driving force towards a cure for HIV infection. A novel drug design platform, using the in-tandem administration of several therapeutic approaches, can be used to precisely target the various components of HIV infection, ultimately leading to the eradication of active and latent HIV and a functional cure for HIV. The aim of this review is to explore the pitfalls of ART and potential novel therapeutic alternatives."
"35813878","Signatures of somatosensory cortical dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease and HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder.","Brain Commun","Alzheimer's disease is the most common type of dementia in the general population, while HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder is the most common neurological comorbidity in those infected with HIV and affects between 40 and 70% of this population. Both conditions are associated with cognitive impairment and have been associated with aberrant functioning in sensory cortices, but far less is known about their disparate effects on neural activity. Identifying such disparate effects is important because it may provide critical data on the similarities and differences in the neuropathology underlying cognitive decline in each condition. In the current study, we utilized magnetoencephalography, extensive neuropsychological testing and a paired-pulse somatosensory gating paradigm to probe differences in somatosensory processing in participants from two ongoing magnetoencephalography studies. The resulting participant groups included 27 cognitively normal controls, 26 participants with HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder and 21 amyloid biomarker-confirmed patients with Alzheimer's disease. The data were imaged using a beamformer and voxel time series were extracted to identify the oscillatory dynamics serving somatosensory processing, as well as the amplitude of spontaneous cortical activity preceding stimulation onset. Our findings indicated that people with Alzheimer's disease and HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder exhibit normal somatosensory gating but have distinct aberrations in other elements of somatosensory cortical function. Essentially, those with Alzheimer's disease exhibited accentuated neural responses to somatosensory stimulation, along with spontaneous gamma activity preceding stimulus onset. In contrast, those with HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder exhibited normal responses to somatosensory stimulation but had sharply elevated spontaneous gamma activity prior to stimulus onset. These distinct aberrations may reflect the impact of different neuropathological mechanisms underlying each condition. Further, given the differential pattern of deficits in somatosensory cortical function, these measures may function as unique biomarkers in each condition and be useful in identifying persons with HIV who may go on to develop Alzheimer's disease.© The Author(s) 2022.

"35764966","Defective HIV-1 genomes and their potential impact on HIV pathogenesis.","Retrovirology","Defective HIV-1 proviruses represent a population of viral genomes that are selected for by immune pressures, and clonally expanded to dominate the persistent HIV-1 proviral genome landscape. There are examples of RNA and protein expression from these compromised genomes which are generated by a variety of mechanisms. Despite the evidence that these proviruses are transcribed and translated, their role in HIV pathogenesis has not been fully explored. The potential for these genomes to participate in immune stimulation is particularly relevant considering the accumulation of cells harboring these defective proviruses over the course of antiretroviral therapy in people living with HIV. The expression of defective proviruses in different cells and tissues could drive innate sensing mechanisms and inflammation. They may also alter antiviral T cell responses and myeloid cell functions that directly contribute to HIV-1 associated chronic comorbidities. Understanding the impact of these defective proviruses needs to be considered as we advance cure strategies that focus on targeting the diverse population of HIV-1 proviral genomes.© 2022.

Pyroptosis is related to tumor immune infiltration and tumor microenvironment (TME) and has been confirmed to be related to the progression of a variety of tumors. However, the relationship between prostate cancer and pyroptosis, as well as TME and tumor immune infiltration, has not been discussed yet. We obtained and combined the RNA-seq data of prostate cancer from TCGA and GEO databases, analyzed the differential expression of pyroptosis-related genes (PRGs), and divided them into two groups according to the PRG expression level. The relationship between pyroptosis subtypes and the TME of prostate cancer was further verified, and the differential expression genes (DEGs) in the two subtypes were identified. The relationship between the DEGs and clinicopathology was explored and KEGG and GO enrichment analysis was conducted; it was found that most DEGs were enriched in immune-related pathways. Then, we randomly divided datasets into training and testing sets, performed the LASSO and multicox progression analysis, selected eight genes as prognostic signatures and used the eight genes, calculated the risk score, and then separated the entire cohort into high- and low-risk groups. The prognosis between two groups and the 1-, 3-, and 5-year ROC curves of biochemical relapse (BCR) were verified in training, testing, and the entire cohort, respectively.

We performed random-effects meta-analysis to estimate pooled effects and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). All statistical tests were 2-sided.A total of 15 studies covering 10 childhood solid tumor types (30 323 cases and 3 499 934 controls) were included in this analysis. A 5-year increase in maternal age was associated with an increased risk of combined central nervous system tumors (odds ratio [OR] = 1.07, 95% CI = 1.04 to 1.10), ependymoma (OR = 1.19, 95% CI = 1.09 to 1.31), astrocytoma (OR = 1.10, 95% CI = 1.05 to 1.15), rhabdomyosarcoma (OR = 1.14, 95% CI = 1.03 to 1.25), and germ cell tumors (OR = 1.06, 95% CI = 1.00 to 1.12). A 5-year increase in paternal age was associated with an increased risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (OR = 1.06, 95% CI = 1.00 to 1.12).This meta-analysis of registry-based analyses of parental age and childhood cancer supports the association between older maternal age and certain childhood solid cancers. There is also some evidence that paternal age may be associated with certain cancers such as non-Hodgkin lymphoma. However, as maternal and paternal age are highly correlated, disentangling potential independent causal effects of either factor will require large studies with extensive data on potential confounders.© The Author(s) 2022.

"35758820","MeConcord: a new metric to quantitatively characterize DNA methylation heterogeneity across reads and CpG sites.","Bioinformatics","Intermediately methylated regions occupy a significant fraction of the human genome and are closely associated with epigenetic regulations or cell-type deconvolution of bulk data. However, these regions show distinct methylation patterns, corresponding to different biological mechanisms. Although there have been some metrics developed for investigating these regions, the high noise sensitivity limits the utility for distinguishing distinct methylation patterns.We proposed a method named MeConcord to measure local methylation concordance across reads and CpG sites, respectively. MeConcord showed the most stable performance in distinguishing distinct methylation patterns ('identical', 'uniform' and 'disordered') compared with other metrics. Applying MeConcord to the whole genome data across 25 cell lines or primary cells or tissues, we found that distinct methylation patterns were associated with different genomic characteristics, such as CTCF binding or imprinted genes. Further, we showed the differences of CpG island hypermethylation patterns between senescence and tumorigenesis by using MeConcord.

Of note, tobacco smoking induces epigenetic modifications to promote pancreatic cancer development. Chromobox protein homolog 3 (CBX3) acts as an epigenetic regulator, modulating gene expression of downstream targets via chromatin modifications. To date, the relationship between CBX3 and smoking in pancreatic cancer remains unknown. This study aimed to uncover the specific role and underlying mechanism of CBX3 in smoking-related pancreatic cancer. The bioinformatics analyses were conducted to identify CBX3 as a key player in tobacco-induced pancreatic cancer. The abnormal upregulation of CBX3 was associated with poor prognosis in pancreatic cancer patients. Moreover, cigarette smoke extract (CSE) exposure promoted the overexpression of Y-box-binding protein 1 (YBX1), which consequently led to upregulated CBX3 in pancreatic cancer cells. We also revealed that CBX3 enhanced pancreatic cancer progression, likely by inhibiting the expression of SMAD specific E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 2 (SMURF2) and promoting the activation of TGF-β signaling. In summary, the YBX1/CBX3/SMURF2 signaling axis may be a promising therapeutic target in patients with smoking-related pancreatic cancer.© The author(s)."

TCGA-KIRC data were biometrically analyzed to identify new loci with age-dependent DNA methylation that may contribute to tumor risk in normal kidney tissue.ANKRD34BandZIC1were evaluated as candidate genes by pyrosequencing of 539 tissues, including 239 normal autopsy, 157 histopathologically tumor-adjacent normal, and 143 paired tumor kidney samples. All candidate CpG loci demonstrated a strong correlation between relative methylation levels and age (R = 0.70-0.88,p&lt; 2 × 10-16) and seven out of 10 loci were capable of predicting chronological age in normal kidney tissues, explaining 84% of the variance (R = 0.92). Moreover, significantly increased age-independent methylation was found for 9 out of 10 CpG loci in tumor-adjacent tissues, compared to normal autopsy tissues (p= 0.001-0.028). Comparing tumor and paired tumor-adjacent tissues revealed two patient clusters showing hypermethylation, one cluster without significant changes in methylation, and a smaller cluster demonstrating hypomethylation in the tumors (p&lt; 1 × 10-10). Taken together, our results show the presence of additional methylation risk factors besides age for renal cancer in normal kidney tissue. Concurrent tumor-specific hypermethylation suggests a subset of these loci are candidates for epigenetic renal cancer susceptibility."

This observational study aimed to profile the epigenetic signature in the saliva of Obese (OB) and Normal-Weight (NW) pregnant women. Sixteen NW and sixteen OB Caucasian women with singleton spontaneous pregnancies were enrolled. microRNAs were quantified by the OpenArray Platform. The promoter region methylation of Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 (SOCS3) and Transforming Growth Factor Beta 1 (TGF-Beta1) was assessed by pyrosequencing. There were 754 microRNAs evaluated: 20 microRNAs resulted in being differentially expressed between OB and NW. microRNA pathway enrichment analysis showed a significant association with the TGF-Beta signaling pathway (miTALOS) and with fatty acids biosynthesis/metabolism, lysine degradation, and ECM-receptor interaction pathways (DIANA-miRPath). BothSOCS3andTGF-Beta1were significantly down-methylated in OB vs. NW. These results help to clarify impaired mechanisms involved in obesity and pave the way for the understanding of specific damaged pathways. The characterization of the epigenetic profile in saliva of pregnant women can represent a promising tool for the identification of obesity-related altered mechanisms and of possible biomarkers for early diagnosis and treatment of pregnancy-adverse conditions."

Coexistence of obesity has clinical implications for all stages of diabetes course. It is confirmed that obesity is the risk factor for autoimmune diabetes, and is connected with the earlier onset of diabetes in predisposed patients. Many diabetic patients with obesity present additional risk factors for macroangiopathy, and are recognised to present metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, and typical for diabetes type 2 - polycystic ovary syndrome, or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. The prevalence of obesity rises dramatically in adolescence of diabetic child, more often in girls. It has negative impact on metabolic control, glycaemic variability and insulin demand. The risk for microangiopathic complications increases as well. The treatment is difficult and includes not only insulinotherapy and non-pharmacological trials.

Genetic studies have identified associations with AF, but no molecular diagnostic exists to predict POAF based on pre-operative measurements. Such a tool would be of great value for perioperative planning to improve patient care and reduce healthcare costs. In this pilot study of epigenetic precision medicine in the perioperative period, we carried out bisulfite sequencing to measure DNA methylation status in blood collected from patients prior to cardiac surgery to identify biosignatures of POAF.We enrolled 221 patients undergoing cardiac surgery in this prospective observational study. DNA methylation measurements were obtained from blood samples drawn from awake patients prior to surgery. After controlling for clinical and methylation covariates, we analyzed DNA methylation loci in the discovery cohort of 110 patients for association with POAF. We also constructed predictive models for POAF using clinical and DNA methylation data. We subsequently performed targeted analyses of a separate cohort of 101 cardiac surgical patients to measure the methylation status solely of significant methylation loci in the discovery cohort.A total of 47 patients in the discovery cohort (42.7%) and 43 patients in the validation cohort (42.6%) developed POAF. We identified 12 CpGs that were statistically significant in the discovery cohort after correcting for multiple hypothesis testing. Of these sites, 6 were amenable to targeted bisulfite sequencing and chr16:24640902 was statistically significant in the validation cohort. In addition, the methylation POAF prediction model had an AUC of 0.79 in the validation cohort.We have identified DNA methylation biomarkers that can predict future occurrence of POAF associated with cardiac surgery.

Impaired autophagy has been implicated in the development of NAFLD. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are also reported to play a role in the pathogenesis of NAFLD. However, the role of autophagy-related lncRNAs in NAFLD disease has not been elucidated. Here, we mined GSE135251, GSE160016, GSE130970 and GSE185062 datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus database (GEO) and obtained the human autophagy-related gene list from the Human Autophagy Database (HADb) for in-depth bioinformatic analysis. Following differential expression analysis and intersection of the datasets, Pearson correlation analysis was performed on DElncRNAs and autophagy-related DEmRNAs to obtain autophagy-related lncRNAs, and then Starbase3.0 and TargetScan7.2 were used to construct competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNA) regulatory networks. We constructed four lncRNA-dominated ceRNA regulatory networks (PSMG3-AS1, MIRLET7BHG, RP11-136K7.2, LINC00925), and visualized with Cytoscape. Then we performed co-expression analysis of the ceRNA networks and autophagy-related genes, and functionally annotated them with Metascape. Finally, we performed receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis on lncRNAs and mRNAs within the ceRNA networks.

Pollutant exposure during the earliest stages of life may determine chronic disease susceptibility in adulthood because of genetic or epigenetic changes. The objective of this review was to identify the association between prenatal and early postnatal exposure to potentially toxic metals (PTMs) and their adverse effects on the genetic material of offspring. A systematic review was carried out following the Cochrane methodology in four databases: PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library. Eligible papers were those conducted in humans and published in English between 2010/01/01 and 2021/04/30. A total of 57 articles were included, most of which evaluated prenatal exposure. Most commonly evaluated PTMs were As, Cd, and Pb. Main adverse effects on the genetic material of newborns associated with PTM prenatal exposure were alterations in telomere length, gene or protein expression, mitochondrial DNA content, metabolomics, DNA damage, and epigenetic modifications. Many of these effects were sex-specific, being predominant in boys. One article reported a synergistic interaction between As and Hg, and two articles observed antagonistic interactions between PTMs and essential metals, such as Cu, Se, and Zn. The findings in this review highlight that the problem of PTM exposure persists, affecting the most susceptible populations, such as newborns. Some of these associations were observed at low concentrations of PTMs. Most of the studies have focused on single exposures; however, three interactions between essential and nonessential metals were observed, highlighting that metal mixtures need more attention.© 2022.

We identify strengths of each approach and challenges in accommodating the full range of trauma-related psychopathology and the clinical implications thereof. We discuss several potential approaches for improving the representation of traumatic stress, including the use of PTSD subtypes, trauma-related specifiers for psychiatric diagnoses, and the development of a dimension that we call the traumatic stress spectrum, which spans both adaptive and adverse reactions to trauma. These approaches to representing traumatic stress can be evaluated empirically and further refined. We also discuss how the use of an integrated RDoC-HiTOP approach to reconceptualize traumatic stress might maximize the ability to model valid and reliable trauma-related phenotypes, which would aid in the investigation of clinically relevant biological correlates.Published by Elsevier Ltd."

Growing evidence indicates that the immune system may contribute to the etiology of PTSD, suggesting the inflammatory dysregulation as a hallmark feature of PTSD. However, the potential interplay between the central and peripheral immune system, as well as the biological mechanisms underlying this dysregulation remain poorly understood. The activation of the HPA axis after trauma exposure and the subsequent activation of the inflammatory system mediated by glucocorticoids is the most common mechanism that orchestrates an exacerbated immunological response in PTSD. Recent high-throughput analyses in peripheral and brain tissue from both humans with and animal models of PTSD have found that changes in gene regulation via epigenetic alterations may participate in the impaired inflammatory signaling in PTSD. The goal of this review is to assess the role of the inflammatory system in PTSD across tissue and species, with a particular focus on the genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, and proteomics domains. We conducted an integrative multi-omics approach identifying TNF (Tumor Necrosis Factor) signaling, interleukins, chemokines, Toll-like receptors and glucocorticoids among the common dysregulated pathways in both central and peripheral immune systems in PTSD and propose potential novel drug targets for PTSD treatment."
"35794589","Sex-limited chromosomes and non-reproductive traits.","BMC Biol","Sex chromosomes are typically viewed as having originated from a pair of autosomes, and differentiated as the sex-limited chromosome (e.g. Y) has degenerated by losing most genes through cessation of recombination. While often thought that degenerated sex-limited chromosomes primarily affect traits involved in sex determination and sex cell production, accumulating evidence suggests they also influence traits not sex-limited or directly involved in reproduction. Here, we provide an overview of the effects of sex-limited chromosomes on non-reproductive traits in XY, ZW or UV sex determination systems, and discuss evolutionary processes maintaining variation at sex-limited chromosomes and molecular mechanisms affecting non-reproductive traits.© 2022.

"35644878","Satellite DNAs and human sex chromosome variation.","Semin Cell Dev Biol","Satellite DNAs are present on every chromosome in the cell and are typically enriched in repetitive, heterochromatic parts of the human genome. Sex chromosomes represent a unique genomic and epigenetic context. In this review, we first report what is known about satellite DNA biology on human X and Y chromosomes, including repeat content and organization, as well as satellite variation in typical euploid individuals. Then, we review sex chromosome aneuploidies that are among the most common types of aneuploidies in the general population, and are better tolerated than autosomal aneuploidies. This is demonstrated also by the fact that aging is associated with the loss of the X, and especially the Y chromosome. In addition, supernumerary sex chromosomes enable us to study general processes in a cell, such as analyzing heterochromatin dosage (i.e. additional Barr bodies and long heterochromatin arrays on Yq) and their downstream consequences. Finally, genomic and epigenetic organization and regulation of satellite DNA could influence chromosome stability and lead to aneuploidy. In this review, we argue that the complete annotation of satellite DNA on sex chromosomes in human, and especially in centromeric regions, will aid in explaining the prevalence and the consequences of sex chromosome aneuploidies.Copyright © 2022.

Whereas SDH screening typically addresses a 12-month span, we sought to compare the prevalence of exposure to present (within the past year) as compared to recent (2-4 years ago) hardship among children in the United States.We analyzed the 2014 Survey of Income and Program Participation, a nationally representative survey that interviewed participating households annually between 2014 and 2017. We included data from households with children in all waves. As of 2017, households were categorized as (1) experiencing present hardship (within the last year); (2) experiencing recent but not present hardship (any year between 2014 and 2016); and (3) experiencing no hardship over the 4-year period.Of 2422 households, 27% experienced present hardship and 29% experienced recent but not present hardship. Households presently experiencing hardship were more likely to have Medicaid insurance, less likely to be married, and had more children than families who had experienced recent hardship. However, these groups were similar on caregivers' educational attainment, race/ethnicity, language spoken in the home, and age of the youngest child.Our results suggest that clinical screening tools for SDH that use a 12-month time frame risk missing many children who have recently (within the past 4 years) experienced material hardship and may benefit from interventions to improve social support; a longer time frame could provide clinicians with valuable information for understanding social factors that impact child health and development.© 2022.

"35887150","Role of Transposable Elements in Genome Stability: Implications for Health and Disease.","Int J Mol Sci","Most living organisms have in their genome a sizable proportion of DNA sequences capable of mobilization; these sequences are commonly referred to as transposons, transposable elements (TEs), or jumping genes. Although long thought to have no biological significance, advances in DNA sequencing and analytical technologies have enabled precise characterization of TEs and confirmed their ubiquitous presence across all forms of life. These findings have ignited intense debates over their biological significance. The available evidence now supports the notion that TEs exert major influence over many biological aspects of organismal life. Transposable elements contribute significantly to the evolution of the genome by giving rise to genetic variations in both active and passive modes. Due to their intrinsic nature of mobility within the genome, TEs primarily cause gene disruption and large-scale genomic alterations including inversions, deletions, and duplications. Besides genomic instability, growing evidence also points to many physiologically important functions of TEs, such as gene regulation through cis-acting control elements and modulation of the transcriptome through epigenetic control. In this review, we discuss the latest evidence demonstrating the impact of TEs on genome stability and the underling mechanisms, including those developed to mitigate the deleterious impact of TEs on genomic stability and human health. We have also highlighted the potential therapeutic application of TEs."

Of great interest, this disease phenotype appears heritable as it can persist across multiple generations even in the absence of persistent exposure to smoking in subsequent generations. Although the molecular mechanisms underlying childhood asthma induced by perinatal exposure to smoking or nicotine remain elusive, an epigenetic mechanism has been proposed, which is supported by the data from our earlier analyses on germline DNA methylation (5mC) and histone marks (H3 and H4 acetylation). To further investigate the potential epigenetic inheritance of childhood asthma induced by perinatal nicotine exposure, we profiled both large and small RNAs in the sperm of F1 male rats. Our data revealed that perinatal exposure to nicotine leads to alterations in the profiles of sperm-borne RNAs, including mRNAs and small RNAs, and that rosiglitazone, a PPARγ agonist, can attenuate the effect of nicotine and reverse the sperm-borne RNA profiles of F1 male rats to close to placebo control levels.Copyright © 2022 Wang, Liu, Gao, Yan and Rehan."

However, the molecular etiology is not fully understood, andJARID2-neurodevelopmental syndrome may vary in its typical clinical phenotype. In addition, the detection of variants of uncertain significance (VUSs) often results in a delay of final diagnosis which could hamper the appropriate care. In this study we aim to detect a specific and sensitive DNA methylation signature forJARID2-neurodevelopmental syndrome. Peripheral blood DNA methylation profiles from 56 control subjects, 8 patients with (likely) pathogenicJARID2variants and 3 patients withJARID2VUSs were analyzed. DNA methylation analysis indicated a clear and robust separation between patients with (likely) pathogenic variants and controls. A binary model capable of classifying patients with theJARID2-neurodevelopmental syndrome was constructed on the basis of the identified episignature. Patients carrying VUSs clustered with the control group. We identified a distinct DNA methylation signature associated withJARID2-neurodevelopmental syndrome, establishing its utility as a biomarker for this syndrome and expanding the EpiSign diagnostic test."

Cutting-edge technologies are contributing to understanding genetic underpinnings in ASD. The reported patient is a 32-year-old male and as an infant was noted to have microcephaly, hypospadias, pulmonary vascular anomaly, and small stature. He was diagnosed with Cornelia De Lange Syndrome (CDLS) at that time based on the clinical features. As a child, he had autistic features and intellectual disabilities and as diagnoses with autism and intellectual disability. He was referred as an adult to our neurodiversity clinic and a full exome trio sequencing with reflex to mitochondrial genes identified a de novo variant of uncertain significance in a candidate gene,DCAF1. The specific variant was c.137 C &gt; T (p.Thr46Ile) in exon 4 in theDCAF1gene. In silico analysis supports a deleterious effect on protein structure/function.DCAF1participates with DDB1 and CUL4 as a part of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. The E3 ligase complex has been associated with a syndromic form of X-linked intellectual disability. The DDB1/CUL4 E3 ubiquitination complex plays a role in methylation-dependent ubiquitination. Next, a methylation study identified a signature similar to the methylation pattern found in X- linked intellectual disability type 93. This is associated with variants of theBRWD3gene, which is linked with the functioning of the DDB1/CUL4 E3 ubiquitination complex. Taken together, this suggests that thede novo DCAF1variant may be a newly identified molecular cause of autism and intellectual disability."

Previous findings from our laboratory using the Illumina Infinium Human Methylation450 BeadChip suggested that methylation at the promoter ofSSTR4was one of the major form of DNA modification in alcohol-dependent populations. To investigate whether DNA methylation levels of theSSTR4promoter influence alcohol-dependent behaviors, genomic DNA was extracted from the peripheral blood sample of 63 subjects with AD and 65 healthy controls, and pyrosequencing was used to verify the results of BeadChip array. Linear regression was used to analyze the correlation between the methylation levels ofSSTR4promoter and the scores of alcohol dependence scales. Gene expression ofSSTR4in brain tissue was obtained from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project and Human Brain Transcriptome database (HBT). We found the methylation levels ofSSTR4in AD group were significantly lower than healthy controls (two-tailedt-test,t =14.723,p< 0.001). In addition, only weak to moderate correlations between the methylation levels of theSSTR4promoter region and scale scores of Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), Life Events Scale (LES) and Wheatley Stress Profile (WSS) based on linear regression analyses (AUDIT:R2=0.35,p< 0.001; LES:R2= 0.27,p< 0.001; WSS:R2= 0.49,p< 0.001).

The accumulation of DNA damage is believed to contribute to ageing by inducing cell death, senescence and tissue dysfunction. However, emerging evidence shows that inflammation is another major consequence of DNA damage. Inflammation is a hallmark of ageing and the driver of multiple age-related diseases. Here, we review the evidence linking DNA damage, inflammation and ageing, highlighting how premature ageing syndromes are associated with inflammation. We discuss the mechanisms by which DNA damage induces inflammation, such as through activation of the cGAS-STING axis and NF-κB activation by ATM. The triggers for activation of these signalling cascades are the age-related accumulation of DNA damage, activation of transposons, cellular senescence and the accumulation of persistent R-loops. We also discuss how epigenetic changes triggered by DNA damage can lead to inflammation and ageing via redistribution of heterochromatin factors. Finally, we discuss potential interventions against age-related inflammation.© 2022. Springer Nature Limited."

"35748903","Photoaging: UV radiation-induced inflammation and immunosuppression accelerate the aging process in the skin.","Inflamm Res","Excessive exposure of the skin to UV radiation (UVR) triggers a remodeling of the immune system and leads to the photoaging state which is reminiscent of chronological aging. Over 30 years ago, it was observed that UVR induced an immunosuppressive state which inhibited skin contact hypersensitivity.Original and review articles encompassing inflammation and immunosuppression in the photoaging and chronological aging processes were examined from major databases including PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar.Currently it is known that UVR treatment can trigger a cellular senescence and inflammatory state in the skin. Chronic low-grade inflammation stimulates a counteracting immunosuppression involving an expansion of immunosuppressive cells, e.g., regulatory T cells (Treg), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC), and regulatory dendritic cells (DCreg). This increased immunosuppressive activity not only suppresses the function of effector immune cells, a state called immunosenescence, but it also induces bystander degeneration of neighboring cells. Interestingly, the chronological aging process also involves an accumulation of pro-inflammatory senescent cells and signs of chronic low-grade inflammation, called inflammaging. There is also clear evidence that inflammaging is associated with an increase in anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive activities which promote immunosenescence.It seems that photoaging and normal aging evoke similar processes driven by the remodeling of the immune system. However, it is likely that there are different molecular mechanisms inducing inflammation and immunosuppression in the accelerated photoaging and the chronological aging processes.© 2022.

These mouse tumors represent major histopathological types of human PLCs and could be divided into three human-matched molecular subtypes based on transcriptomic and proteomic profiles. Phenotypical characterization identified subtype- or genotype-specific alterations in immune microenvironment, metabolic reprogramming, cell proliferation, and expression of drug targets. Furthermore, single-cell analysis and expression tracing revealed spatial and temporal dynamics in expression ofpyruvate kinase M2(Pkm2). Tumor-specific knockdown ofPkm2by multiplexed genome editing reversed the Warburg effect and suppressed tumorigenesis in a genotype-specific manner.

"35705880","Mechanisms that regulate the activities of TET proteins.","Cell Mol Life Sci","The ten-eleven translocation (TET) family of dioxygenases consists of three members, TET1, TET2, and TET3. All three TET enzymes have Fe+2and α-ketoglutarate (α-KG)-dependent dioxygenase activities, catalyzing the 1st step of DNA demethylation by converting 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), and further oxidize 5hmC to 5-formylcytosine (5fC) and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC). Gene knockout studies demonstrated that all three TET proteins are involved in the regulation of fetal organ generation during embryonic development and normal tissue generation postnatally. TET proteins play such roles by regulating the expression of key differentiation and fate-determining genes via (1) enzymatic activity-dependent DNA methylation of the promoters and enhancers of target genes; and (2) enzymatic activity-independent regulation of histone modification. Interacting partner proteins and post-translational regulatory mechanisms regulate the activities of TET proteins. Mutations and dysregulation of TET proteins are involved in the pathogenesis of human diseases, specifically cancers. Here, we summarize the research on the interaction partners and post-translational modifications of TET proteins. We also discuss the molecular mechanisms by which these partner proteins and modifications regulate TET functioning and target gene expression. Such information will help in the design of medications useful for targeted therapy of TET-mutant-related diseases.© 2022. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

The molecular mechanism underlying sexual dimorphism accumulation of TTX in ovary and testis, and the relationship between TTX accumulation with sex related genes expression remain largely unknown. The present study investigated the effects of exogenous TTX treatment on Takifugu flavidus. The results demonstrated that exogenous TTX administration significantly incresed level of TTX concentration in kidney, cholecyst, skin, liver, heart, muscle, ovary and testis of the treatment group (TG) than that of the control group (CG). Transcriptome sequencing and analysis were performed to study differential expression profiles of mRNA and piRNA after TTX administration of the ovary and testis. The results showed that compared with female control group (FCG) and male control group (MCG), TTX administration resulted in 80 and 23 piRNAs, 126 and 223 genes up and down regulated expression in female TTX-treated group (FTG), meanwhile, 286 and 223 piRNAs, 2 and 443 genes up and down regulated expression in male TTX-treated group (MTG). The female dominant genes cyp19a1, gdf9 and foxl2 were found to be up-regulated in MTG. The cyp19a1, whose corresponding target piRNA uniq_554482 was identified as down-regulated in the MTG, indicating the gene expression feminization in testis after exogenous TTX administration. The KEGG enrichment analysis revealed that differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and piRNAs (DEpiRNAs) in MTG vs MCG group were more enriched in metabolism pathways, indicating that the testis produced more metabolic pathways in response to exogenous TTX, which might be a reason for the sexual dimorphism of TTX distribution in gonads. In addition, TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling staining showed that significant apoptosis was detected in the MTG testis, and the role of the cell apoptotic pathways was further confirmed. Overall, our research revealed that the response of the ovary and testis to TTX administration was largely different, the ovary is more tolerant whereas the testis is more sensitive to TTX. These data will deepen our understanding on the accumulation of TTX sexual dimorphism in Takifugu.© 2022. The Author(s)."

We leverage next-generation sequencing data obtained from mouse primordial germ cells and somatic cells purified from early-differentiating embryonic ovaries and testis from 11.5 to 13.5 days postcoitum. Using bioinformatic tools, we elucidate (i) the origins of piRNAs as transcribed from mitochondrial DNA fragments inserted in the nucleus or from the mitochondrial genome; (ii) their levels of expression; and (iii) their potential roles, as well as their association with genomic regions encoding other sncRNAs (such as tRNAs and rRNAs) and the mitochondrial regulatory region (D-loop).

However, rRNAs and RNAs shorter than 16 nt are often depleted from library preparations/sequencing analyses, although they may be functional. Here, we sought to obtain a complete repertoire of small RNAs by sequencing the total RNA from 11 samples of 6 different eukaryotic organisms, from yeasts to human, in an extended 8- to 30-nt window of RNA length. The 8- to 15-nt window essentially contained fragments of longer non-coding RNAs, such as microRNAs, PIWI-associated RNAs (piRNAs), small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), tRNAs and rRNAs. Notably, unusually short RNAs &lt; 16 nt were more abundant than those &gt;16 nt in bilaterian organisms. A new RT-qPCR method confirmed that two unusually short rRFs of 12 and 13 nt were more overly abundant (~3-log difference) than two microRNAs. We propose to not deplete rRNA and to reduce the lower threshold of RNA length to include unusually short RNAs in sRNA-Seq analyses and datasets, as their abundance and diversity support their potential role and importance as biomarkers of disease and/or mediators of cellular function."

Recent studies demonstrate that small RNAs secreted from epididymal epithelium modulate embryo development and offspring phenotypesviasperm transmission, and the resulting modifications may lead to transgenerational inheritance. However, to date, the genome-wide analysis of small RNA together with the transcriptomic expression profiles of human epididymis and CE is still lacking. In this study, we facilitated next-generation sequencing and bioinformatics to comprehensively analyze the small RNA and mRNA in an integrative way and identified signatures associated with CE. Both of the small RNA and mRNA expression data demonstrated relatively larger molecular differences among the segmental region of the epididymides, including caput, corpus, and cauda, than that of the inflammatory conditions. By comparing the inflamed caputs to the controls, a total of 1727 genes (1220 upregulated and 507 downregulated; 42 most significant genes, adjustedP <0.05) and 34 miRNAs (23 upregulated and 11 downregulated) were identified as differentially expressed. In silico functional enrichment analysis showed their roles in regulating different biological activities, including leukocyte chemotaxis, extracellular milieu reconstruction, ion channel and transporter-related processes, and nervous system development. Integrative analysis of miRNA and mRNA identified a regulatory network consisting of 22 miRNAs and 31 genes (miRNA-mRNA) which are strong candidates for CE. In addition, analysis about other species of small RNA, including (miRNA), piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA), tRNA-derived small RNA (tsRNA), Y RNA, and rsRNA identified the distinct expression pattern of tsRNA in CE. In summary, our study performed small RNA and miRNA profiling and integrative analysis in human CE. The findings will help to understand the role of miRNA-mRNA in the pathogenesis of CE and provide molecular candidates for the development of potential biomarkers for human CE.Copyright © 2022 Gong, Wang, Liu, Li, Zeng, Yang, Li, Yu, Cao and Duan."

Genetic, epigenetic factors, and subcutaneous insulin administration are implicated in the pathogenesis of this coexistence. Accumulating evidence implies that the concomitant presence of obesity and IR is an independent predictor of worse CVD outcomes. The prevalence of obesity and IR has increased in patients with T1DM. This increase can be partly attributed to general population trends but, additionally, to iatrogenic weight gain caused by insulin treatment.

DNA methylation, as a mechanism of epigenetic regulation, may be involved in DNA methylation of various genes, thereby participating in biological behaviors of various cells. Emerging evidence suggests that increased DNA methylation levels are associated with activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of the diabetic environment on the osteogenic potential of ASCs, to explore the role of DNA methylation on osteogenic differentiation of DOP-ASCs via Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, and to improve the osteogenic differentiation ability of ASCs with DOP.DOP-ASCs and control ASCs were isolated from DOP C57BL/6 and control mice, respectively. The multipotency of DOP-ASCs was confirmed by Alizarin Red-S, Oil Red-O, and Alcian blue staining. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), immunofluorescence, and western blotting were used to analyze changes in markers of osteogenic differentiation, DNA methylation, and Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Alizarin Red-S staining was also used to confirm changes in the osteogenic ability. DNMT small interfering RNA (siRNA), shRNA-Dnmt3a, and LVRNA-Dnmt3a were used to assess the role of Dnmt3a in osteogenic differentiation of control ASCs and DOP-ASCs. Micro-computed tomography, hematoxylin and eosin staining, and Masson staining were used to analyze changes in the osteogenic capability while downregulating Dnmt3a with lentivirus in DOP mice in vivo.The proliferative ability of DOP-ASCs was lower than that of control ASCs. DOP-ASCs showed a decrease in osteogenic differentiation capacity, lower Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway activity, and a higher level of Dnmt3a than control ASCs. When Dnmt3a was downregulated by siRNA and shRNA, osteogenic-related factors Runt-related transcription factor 2 and osteopontin, and activity of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway were increased, which rescued the poor osteogenic potential of DOP-ASCs. When Dnmt3a was upregulated by LVRNA-Dnmt3a, the osteogenic ability was inhibited. The same results were obtained in vivo.Dnmt3a silencing rescues the negative effects of DOP on ASCs and provides a possible approach for bone tissue regeneration in patients with diabetic osteoporosis.© 2022.

Mesenchymal stem cells-derived extracellular matrix (MSCs-ECM) could guide intricate cellular and tissue processes such as homeostasis, healing and regeneration.The purpose of this study is to explore the effect and mechanism of ECM derived from decellularized Wharton's Jelly-derived mesenchymal stem cells (WJ-MSCs) on endothelial cell viability and angiogenesis. The human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were pretreated with WJ-MSCs ECM for 2d/7d/14d, respectively. After pretreatment, the angiogenesis ability of HUVECs was detected.In this study, we found for the first time that WJ-MSCs ECM could improve the angiogenesis ability of HUVECs with a time-dependent manner in vitro. Mechanically, WJ-MSCs ECM activated the focal adhesion kinase (FAK)/P38 signaling pathway via integrin αVβ3, which further promoted the expression of the cellular (c)-Myc. Further, c-Myc increased histone acetylation levels of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) promoter by recruiting P300, which ultimately promoting VEGF expression.ECM derived from Wharton's Jelly-derived mesenchymal stem cells promotes angiogenesis via integrin αVβ3/c-Myc/P300/VEGF.

"35794109","Trends in insulin resistance: insights into mechanisms and therapeutic strategy.","Signal Transduct Target Ther","The centenary of insulin discovery represents an important opportunity to transform diabetes from a fatal diagnosis into a medically manageable chronic condition. Insulin is a key peptide hormone and mediates the systemic glucose metabolism in different tissues. Insulin resistance (IR) is a disordered biological response for insulin stimulation through the disruption of different molecular pathways in target tissues. Acquired conditions and genetic factors have been implicated in IR. Recent genetic and biochemical studies suggest that the dysregulated metabolic mediators released by adipose tissue including adipokines, cytokines, chemokines, excess lipids and toxic lipid metabolites promote IR in other tissues. IR is associated with several groups of abnormal syndromes that include obesity, diabetes, metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), cardiovascular disease, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and other abnormalities. Although no medication is specifically approved to treat IR, we summarized the lifestyle changes and pharmacological medications that have been used as efficient intervention to improve insulin sensitivity. Ultimately, the systematic discussion of complex mechanism will help to identify potential new targets and treat the closely associated metabolic syndrome of IR.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35673580","Diabetes impairs cardioprotective function of endothelial progenitor cell-derived extracellular vesicles via H3K9Ac inhibition.","Theranostics","Background and Purpose:Myocardial infarction (MI) in diabetic patients results in higher mortality and morbidity. We and others have previously shown that bone marrow-endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) promote cardiac neovascularization and attenuate ischemic injury. Lately, small extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as major paracrine effectors mediating the benefits of stem cell therapy. Modest clinical outcomes of autologous cell-based therapies suggest diabetes-induced EPC dysfunction and may also reflect their EV derivatives. Moreover, studies suggest that post-translational histone modifications promote diabetes-induced vascular dysfunctions. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that diabetic EPC-EVs may lose their post-injury cardiac reparative function by modulating histone modification in endothelial cells (ECs).Methods:We collected EVs from the culture medium of EPCs isolated from non-diabetic (db/+) and diabetic (db/db) mice and examined their effects on recipient ECs and cardiomyocytesin vitro,and their reparative function in permanent ligation of left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery and ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) myocardial ischemic injuriesin vivo.Results:Compared to db/+ EPC-EVs, db/db EPC-EVs promoted EC and cardiomyocyte apoptosis and repressed tube-forming capacity of ECs.In vivo, db/db EPC-EVs depressed cardiac function, reduced capillary density, and increased fibrosis compared to db/+ EPC-EV treatments after MI. Moreover, in the I/R MI model, db/+ EPC-EV-mediated acute cardio-protection was lost with db/db EPC-EVs, and db/db EPC-EVs increased immune cell infiltration, infarct area, and plasma cardiac troponin-I. Mechanistically, histone 3 lysine 9 acetylation (H3K9Ac) was significantly decreased in cardiac ECs treated with db/db EPC-EVs compared to db/+ EPC-EVs. The H3K9Ac chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) results further revealed that db/db EPC-EVs reduced H3K9Ac level on angiogenic, cell survival, and proliferative genes in cardiac ECs. We found that the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, valproic acid (VPA), partly restored diabetic EPC-EV-impaired H3K9Ac levels, tube formation and viability of ECs, and enhanced cell survival and proliferative genes,PdgfdandSox12, expression. Moreover, we observed that VPA treatment improved db/db EPC-mediated post-MI cardiac repair and functions.Conclusions:Our findings unravel that diabetes impairs EPC-EV reparative function in the ischemic heart, at least partially, through HDACs-mediated H3K9Ac downregulation leading to transcriptional suppression of angiogenic, proliferative and cell survival genes in recipient cardiac ECs. Thus, HDAC inhibitors may potentially be used to restore the function of diabetic EPC and other stem cells for autologous cell therapy applications.© The author(s)."
"35627181","Recent Advances in Epigenetics of Age-Related Kidney Diseases.","Genes (Basel)","Renal aging has attracted increasing attention in today's aging society, as elderly people with advanced age are more susceptible to various kidney disorders such as acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). There is no clear-cut universal mechanism for identifying age-related kidney diseases, and therefore, they pose a considerable medical and public health challenge. Epigenetics refers to the study of heritable modifications in the regulation of gene expression that do not require changes in the underlying genomic DNA sequence. A variety of epigenetic modifiers such as histone deacetylases (HDAC) inhibitors and DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors have been proposed as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets in numerous fields including cardiovascular diseases, immune system disease, nervous system diseases, and neoplasms. Accumulating evidence in recent years indicates that epigenetic modifications have been implicated in renal aging. However, no previous systematic review has been performed to systematically generalize the relationship between epigenetics and age-related kidney diseases. In this review, we aim to summarize the recent advances in epigenetic mechanisms of age-related kidney diseases as well as discuss the application of epigenetic modifiers as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets in the field of age-related kidney diseases. In summary, the main types of epigenetic processes including DNA methylation, histone modifications, non-coding RNA (ncRNA) modulation have all been implicated in the progression of age-related kidney diseases, and therapeutic targeting of these processes will yield novel therapeutic strategies for the prevention and/or treatment of age-related kidney diseases."

In addition, information on Se's role in male physiology, specifically in obesity, is scarce. We conducted this study to evaluate the efficacy of Se supplementation, specifically during puberty until young adulthood, against obesity-induced deregulation of metabolic, cellular, and epigenetic parameters in epididymal fat and/or sperm cells in a rat model. High-fat-diet consumption by male rats during puberty and young adulthood significantly increased body weight, adipocyte size, oxidative stress, deregulated expression of genes associated with inflammation (Adiponectin, IL-6, TNF-α), adipogenesis (CEBPα), estrogen biosynthesis (CYP19) and epigenetic processes in epididymal adipose tissue (Dnmt3a), as well as altered microRNA expression vital for spermatogenesis in sperm cells (miR-15b and miR-497). On the other hand, Se supplementation significantly decreased oxidative stress and mitigated these molecular/epigenetic alterations in epididymal adipose tissue or sperm cells. Our results indicate that selenium supplementation during puberty/young adulthood could improve male physiology in the context of obesity. In addition, it suggests that Se could potentially positively affect offspring health."

"35552683","Novel Noninvasive Approaches to the Treatment of Obesity: From Pharmacotherapy to Gene Therapy.","Endocr Rev","Recent insights into the pathophysiologic underlying mechanisms of obesity have led to the discovery of several promising drug targets and novel therapeutic strategies to address the global obesity epidemic and its comorbidities. Current pharmacologic options for obesity management are largely limited in number and of modest efficacy/safety profile. Therefore, the need for safe and more efficacious new agents is urgent. Drugs that are currently under investigation modulate targets across a broad range of systems and tissues, including the central nervous system, gastrointestinal hormones, adipose tissue, kidney, liver, and skeletal muscle. Beyond pharmacotherapeutics, other potential antiobesity strategies are being explored, including novel drug delivery systems, vaccines, modulation of the gut microbiome, and gene therapy. The present review summarizes the pathophysiology of energy homeostasis and highlights pathways being explored in the effort to develop novel antiobesity medications and interventions but does not cover devices and bariatric methods. Emerging pharmacologic agents and alternative approaches targeting these pathways and relevant research in both animals and humans are presented in detail. Special emphasis is given to treatment options at the end of the development pipeline and closer to the clinic (ie, compounds that have a higher chance to be added to our therapeutic armamentarium in the near future). Ultimately, advancements in our understanding of the pathophysiology and interindividual variation of obesity may lead to multimodal and personalized approaches to obesity treatment that will result in safe, effective, and sustainable weight loss until the root causes of the problem are identified and addressed.© The Author(s) 2021.

"35804914","Radon and Lung Cancer: Current Trends and Future Perspectives.","Cancers (Basel)","Lung cancer is a public health problem and the first cause of cancer death worldwide. Radon is a radioactive gas that tends to accumulate inside homes, and it is the second lung cancer risk factor after smoking, and the first one in non-smokers. In Europe, there are several radon-prone areas, and although the 2013/59 EURATOM directive is aimed to regulate indoor radon exposition, regulating measures can vary between countries. Radon emits alpha-ionizing radiation that has been linked to a wide variety of cytotoxic and genotoxic effects; however, the link between lung cancer and radon from the genomic point of view remains poorly described. Driver molecular alterations have been recently identified in non-small lung cancer (NSCLC), such as somatic mutations (EGFR,BRAF,HER2, MET) or chromosomal rearrangements (ALK,ROS1,RET,NTRK), mainly in the non-smoking population, where no risk factor has been identified yet. An association between radon exposure and oncogenic NSCLC in non-smokers has been hypothesised. This paper provides a practical, concise and updated review on the implications of indoor radon in lung cancer carcinogenesis, and especially of its potential relation with NSCLC with driver genomic alterations."

As an important part of vascular structure, the vascular endothelium, uniquely sensitive to mechanical force, plays a pivotal role in coordinating vascular functions. Our study found that simulated microgravity induced PINK1-dependent mitophagy in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Here, we explored the underlying mechanism of mitophagy induction. The ER stress induced by proteostasis failure in HUVECs promoted the Ca2+transfer from ER to mitochondria, resulting in mitochondria Ca2+overload, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, mitochondria fission, and accumulation of Parkin and p62 in mitochondria and mitophagy under simulated microgravity. Moreover, we assumed that mitophagy played a vital role in functional changes in endothelial cells under simulated microgravity. Using mdivi-1 and PINK1 knockdown, we found that NLRP3 inflammasome activation was enhanced after mitophagy was inhibited. The NLRP3 inflammasome contributed to endothelial hyperpermeability and cellular migration by releasing IL-1β. Thus, mitophagy inhibited cell migration ability and hyperpermeability in HUVECs exposed to clinostat-simulated microgravity. Collectively, we here clarify the mechanism of mitophagy induction by simulated microgravityin vitroand demonstrate the relationship between mitophagy and vascular endothelial functional changes including cellular migration and permeability.

"35860550","Telomere Length Regulation.","Front Oncol","The number of (TTAGGG)nrepeats at the ends of chromosomes is highly variable between individual chromosomes, between different cells and between species. Progressive loss of telomere repeats limits the proliferation of pre-malignant human cells but also contributes to aging by inducing apoptosis and senescence in normal cells. Despite enormous progress in understanding distinct pathways that result in loss and gain of telomeric DNA in different cell types, many questions remain. Further studies are needed to delineate the role of damage to telomeric DNA, replication errors, chromatin structure, liquid-liquid phase transition, telomeric transcripts (TERRA) and secondary DNA structures such as guanine quadruplex structures, R-loops and T-loops in inducing gains and losses of telomere repeats in different cell types. Limitations of current telomere length measurements techniques and differences in telomere biology between species and different cell types complicate generalizations about the role of telomeres in aging and cancer. Here some of the factors regulating the telomere length in embryonic and adult cells in mammals are discussed from a mechanistic and evolutionary perspective.Copyright © 2022 Lansdorp."

The infraslow oscillation (ISO, 0.01-0.10 Hz) coordinating brain dynamics via thalamic astrocytes plays a key role in the adaptation to novel environments. We investigate the adaptive process of a healthy astronaut during a 12-month-long spaceflight by analyzing heart rate variability (HRV) in the LF (0.01-0.05 Hz) and MF1 (0.05-0.10 Hz) bands for two consecutive days on four occasions: before launch, at 1-month (ISS01) and 11-month (ISS02) in space, and after return to Earth. Alteration of β during ISS01 improved during ISS02 (P = 0.0167). During ISS01, LF and MF1 bands, reflecting default mode network (DMN) activity, started to increase at night (by 43.1% and 32.0%, respectively), when suprachiasmatic astrocytes are most active, followed by a 25.9% increase in MF1-band throughout the entire day during ISS02, larger at night (47.4%) than during daytime. Magnetic declination correlated positively with β during ISS01 (r = 0.6706, P < 0.0001) and ISS02 (r = 0.3958, P = 0.0095). Magnetic fluctuations may affect suprachiasmatic astrocytes, and the DMN involving ISOs and thalamic astrocytes may then be activated, first at night, then during the entire day, a mechanism that could perhaps promote an anti-aging effect noted in other investigations.© 2022.

Here, we used a fast-rotating 2-D clinostat to investigate the sµg effect on proliferation, self-renewal, and cell cycle regulation of hPSCs. We observed significant upregulation of protein translation of pluripotent transcription factors in hPSC cultured in sµg compared to cells cultured in 1g conditions. In addition to a significant increase in expression of telomere elongation genes. Differentiation experiments showed that hPSC cultured in sµg condition were less susceptible to differentiation compared to cells in 1g conditions. These results suggest that sµg enhances hPSC self-renewal. Our study revealed that sµg enhanced the cell proliferation of hPSCs by regulating the expression of cell cycle-associated kinases. RNA-seq analysis indicated that in sµg condition the expression of differentiation and development pathways are downregulated, while multiple components of the ubiquitin proteasome system are upregulated, contributing to an enhanced self-renewal of hPSCs. These effects of sµg were not replicated in human fibroblasts. Taken together, our results highlight pathways and mechanisms in hPSCs vulnerable to microgravity that imposes significant impacts on human health and performance, physiology, and cellular and molecular processes.© 2022.

Exposure to such stressors may be associated with adverse effects on astronauts' health, including increased cancer and cardiovascular disease risks. Small extracellular vesicles (sEVs, i.e., exosomes) play a vital role in intercellular communication and regulate various biological processes contributing to their role in disease pathogenesis. To assess whether spaceflight alters sEVs transcriptome profile, sEVs were isolated from the blood plasma of 3 astronauts at two different time points: 10 days before launch (L-10) and 3 days after return (R+3) from the Shuttle mission. AC16 cells (human cardiomyocyte cell line) were treated with L-10 and R+3 astronauts-derived exosomes for 24 h. Total RNA was isolated and analyzed for gene expression profiling using Affymetrix microarrays. Enrichment analysis was performed using Enrichr. Transcription factor (TF) enrichment analysis using the ENCODE/ChEA Consensus TF database identified gene sets related to the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) and Vitamin D receptor (VDR) in AC16 cells treated with R+3 compared to cells treated with L-10 astronauts-derived exosomes. Further analysis of the histone modifications using datasets from the Roadmap Epigenomics Project confirmed enrichment in gene sets related to the H3K27me3 repressive mark. Interestingly, analysis of previously published H3K27me3-chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) ENCODE datasets showed enrichment of H3K27me3 in the VDR promoter. Collectively, our results suggest that astronaut-derived sEVs may epigenetically repress the expression of the VDR in human adult cardiomyocytes by promoting the activation of the PRC2 complex and H3K27me3 levels.Copyright © 2022 Bisserier, Brojakowska, Saffran, Rai, Lee, Coleman, Sebastian, Evans, Mills, Addya, Arakelyan, Garikipati, Hadri and Goukassian."

In this review/commentary, the current state of medicines provision in space is explored, accompanied by a forward look on the future of pharmaceutical manufacturing in outer space. The hazards associated with spaceflight, and their corresponding medical problems, are first briefly discussed. Subsequently, the infeasibility of present-day medicines provision systems for supporting deep space exploration is examined. The existing knowledge gaps on the altered clinical effects of medicines in space are evaluated, and suggestions are provided on how clinical trials in space might be conducted. An envisioned model of on-site production and delivery of medicines in space is proposed, referencing emerging technologies (e.g. Chemputing, synthetic biology, and 3D printing) being developed on Earth that may be adapted for extra-terrestrial use. This review concludes with a critical analysis on the regulatory considerations necessary to facilitate the adoption of these technologies and proposes a framework by which these may be enforced. In doing so, this commentary aims to instigate discussions on the pharmaceutical needs of deep space exploration, and strategies on how these may be met.© 2022 The Authors."

The exposure to microgravity environment leads to several health risks such as those affecting red blood cells. In this work, we investigated the changes that occur in the structure and function of red blood cells under simulated microgravity, compared to terrestrial conditions, at different time points using biochemical and biophysical techniques. Erythrocytes exposed to simulated microgravity showed morphological changes, a constant increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS), a significant reduction in total antioxidant capacity (TAC), a remarkable and constant decrease in total glutathione (GSH) concentration, and an augmentation in malondialdehyde (MDA) at increasing times. Moreover, experiments were performed to evaluate the lipid profile of erythrocyte membranes which showed an upregulation in the following membrane phosphocholines (PC): PC16:0_16:0, PC 33:5, PC18:2_18:2, PC 15:1_20:4 and SM d42:1. Thus, remarkable changes in erythrocyte cytoskeletal architecture and membrane stiffness due to oxidative damage have been found under microgravity conditions, in addition to factors that contribute to the plasticity of the red blood cells (RBCs) including shape, size, cell viscosity and membrane rigidity. This study represents our first investigation into the effects of microgravity on erythrocytes and will be followed by other experiments towards understanding the behaviour of different human cell types in microgravity."

However, our mechanistic understanding of how these environments regulate host-pathogen interactions in humans is poorly understood. Using a spaceflight analogue low fluid shear culture system, we investigated the effect of Low Shear Modeled Microgravity (LSMMG) culture on the colonization ofSalmonellaTyphimurium in a 3-D biomimetic model of human colonic epithelium containing macrophages. RNA-seq profiling of stationary phase wild type and Δhfqmutant bacteria alone indicated that LSMMG culture induced global changes in gene expression in both strains and that the RNA binding protein Hfq played a significant role in regulating the transcriptional response of the pathogen to LSMMG culture. However, a core set of genes important for adhesion, invasion, and motility were commonly induced in both strains. LSMMG culture enhanced the colonization (adherence, invasion and intracellular survival) ofSalmonellain this advanced model of intestinal epithelium using a mechanism that was independent of Hfq. AlthoughS. Typhimurium Δhfqmutants are normally defective for invasion when grown as conventional shaking cultures, LSMMG conditions unexpectedly enabled high levels of colonization by an isogenic Δhfqmutant. In response to infection with either the wild type or mutant, host cells upregulated transcripts involved in inflammation, tissue remodeling, and wound healing during intracellular survival. Interestingly, infection by the Δhfqmutant led to fewer transcriptional differences between LSMMG- and control-infected host cells relative to infection with the wild type strain. This is the first study to investigate the effect of LSMMG culture on the interaction betweenS. Typhimurium and a 3-D model of human intestinal tissue. These findings advance our understanding of how physical forces can impact the early stages of human enteric salmonellosis.Copyright © 2022 Barrila, Yang, Franco Meléndez, Yang, Buss, Davis, Aronow, Bean, Davis, Forsyth, Ott, Gangaraju, Kang, Hanratty, Nydam, Nauman, Kong, Steel and Nickerson."

"35836659","Where Sex Meets Gender: How Sex and Gender Come Together to Cause Sex Differences in Mental Illness.","Front Psychiatry","Sex differences are prevalent in multiple mental disorders. Internalizing disorders are more commonly diagnosed in women, whereas externalizing and neurodevelopmental disorders are more often diagnosed in men. Significant sex/gender differences are reported in prevalence, symptom profile, age of onset, comorbidities, functional impairment, prognosis, as well as in responses to various treatments. In this conceptual article, we discuss theories and empirical studies of sex- and gender-related influences in mental health, by focusing on three examples: autism spectrum disorder (ASD), acknowledged as a disorder whose roots are mainly biological; eating disorders, whose origins are considered to be mainly psychosocial, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), an environmentally caused disorder with both psychosocial and biological underpinnings. We examine the ways in which sex differences emerge, from conception through adulthood. We also examine how gender dichotomies in exposures, expectations, role assumptions, and cultural traditions impact the expression of our three selected mental illnesses. We are especially interested in how sex-based influences and gender-based influences interact with one another to affect mental illness. We suggest that sex and gender are multi-faceted and complex phenomena that result in variations, not only between men and women, but also within each sex and gender through alterations in genes, hormone levels, self-perceptions, trauma experiences, and interpersonal relationships. Finally, we propose a conceptual diatheses-stress model, depicting how sex and gender come together to result in multiple sex/gender differences across mental disorders. In our model, we categorize diatheses into several categories: biological, intrapersonal, interpersonal, and environmental. These diatheses interact with exposure to stressors, ranging from relatively minor to traumatic, which allows for the sometimes bidirectional influences of acute and long-term stress responses. Sex and gender are discussed at every level of the model, thereby providing a framework for understanding and predicting sex/gender differences in expression, prevalence and treatment response of mental disorders. We encourage more research into this important field of study.Copyright © 2022 Christiansen, McCarthy and Seeman."

However, the biological characteristics of ucfDNA are not well understood. We explored the roles of deoxyribonuclease 1 (DNASE1) and deoxyribonuclease 1-like 3 (DNASE1L3) in the fragmentation of ucfDNA using mouse models. The deletion of Dnase1 in mice (Dnase1-/-) caused aberrations in ucfDNA fragmentation, including a 24-fold increase in DNA concentration, and a 3-fold enrichment of long DNA molecules, with a relative decrease of fragments with thymine ends and reduction of jaggedness (i.e., the presence of single-stranded protruding ends). In contrast, such changes were not observed in mice with Dnase1l3 deletion (Dnase1l3-/-). These results suggested that DNASE1 was an important nuclease contributing to the ucfDNA fragmentation. Western blot analysis revealed that the concentration of DNASE1 protein was higher in urine than DNASE1L3. The native-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis zymogram showed that DNASE1 activity in urine was higher than that in plasma. Furthermore, the proportion of ucfDNA fragment ends within DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs) was significantly increased in Dnase1-deficient mice. In humans, patients with bladder cancer had lower proportions of ucfDNA fragment ends within the DHSs when compared with participants without bladder cancer. The area under the curve (AUC) for differentiating patients with and without bladder cancer was 0.83, suggesting the analysis of ucfDNA fragmentation in the DHSs may have potential for bladder cancer detection. This work revealed the intrinsic links between the nucleases in urine and ucfDNA fragmentomics."

Elucidating the mechanisms underlying DNA methylation coupled with determining its biological function is imperative to the effective development of treatment and prevention strategies for breast cancer.We retrieved transcriptome and DNA methylation profiles of BRCA patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, then applied the ""limma"" package in R software to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and aberrantly methylated genes. Next, we used the ""MethylMix"" package to screen for methylation-driven genes, and performed univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses to determine the prognostic value of the methylation-driven genes and clinical characteristics. We validated these findings in 51 breast cancer tissues alongside 51 corresponding normal tissues. Furthermore, we used cell experiments to clarify the biological function and underlying molecular mechanisms ofHOTAIRM1in vitro.A total of 25 methylation-driven genes were identified in the dataset. Results from univariate and multivariate Cox regression showed thatSYN2,HOTAIRM1,BCAS1, andALDOCwere significantly associated with patient prognosis. Immunohistochemistry and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) results showed that the expression levels ofSYN2andHOTAIRM1were negatively correlated with BRCA stage, whereas those ofBCAS1andALDOCwere positively correlated with BRCA stage. Results fromin vitroexperiments showed that knockdownHOTAIRM1expression promoted breast cancer cells proliferation, clone formation, and invasion. Up-regulation ofHOTAIRM1inhibited breast cancer cells proliferation, clone formation, and invasion.In summary, lowHOTAIRM1expression is a significant prognostic factor for the survival of BRCA patients and thus could be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of BRCA.2022 Gland Surgery.

"35878261","Forskolin Induces Endocrine Disturbance in Human JEG-3 Placental Cells.","Toxics","Forskolin, used in folk medicine since ancient times, is now available as a dietary supplement, with an indication as a fat burner and appetite suppressant. However, the safety of forskolin is poorly documented especially for pregnant women. The question that we raised is what about the safety of forskolin in pregnant women? As the placenta, an endocrine organ, is the key organ of pregnancy, we evaluated the in vitro placental toxicity of forskolin. We focused first on the activation of a P2X7 degenerative receptor as a key biomarker for placental toxicity, and second on steroid and peptide hormonal secretion. We observed that forskolin activated P2X7 receptors and disturbed estradiol, progesterone, hPL and hyperglycosylated hCG secretion in human placental JEG-Tox cells. To the best of our knowledge, we highlighted, for the first time, that forskolin induced endocrine disturbance in placental cells. Forskolin does not appear to be a safe product for pregnant women and restrictions should be taken."

We investigated the relations between these defective placentation syndromes and the incidence of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in offspring. We conducted a population-based cohort study of 1,645,455 non-malformed singleton infants born in Sweden 2000-2016 who were followed for up to 17 years using national registers. We compared ASD rates for children prenatally exposed and unexposed to defective placentation syndromes with use of adjusted hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) from Cox regression. We also conducted sibling-controlled analyses among 1,092,132 full siblings. The association of the syndromes with ASD independent of preterm birth was estimated in mediation analyses. There were 23,810 cases of ASD. In both general cohort and sibling analyses, adjusted HRs (95% CI) of ASD were increased in children of mothers with term preeclampsia combined with SGA [1.5 (1.3, 1.9) and 1.9 (1.1, 3.3), respectively], preterm preeclampsia < 34 weeks [1.8 (1.4, 2.2) and 4.2 (2.1, 8.5), respectively], and spontaneous very or extremely preterm birth (≤ 31 weeks) [2.6 (2.2, 3.0) and 2.4 (1.5, 3.8), respectively]. Placental abruption was associated with increased HR of ASD in general cohort analysis only. The association between preeclampsia and ASD was not fully explained by preterm birth. In conclusion, syndromes linked to defective placentation are associated with increased incidence of ASD in the offspring.© 2022. Springer Nature B.V."

Despite more than twenty years of research, we still lack critical understanding of the biological underpinnings of language. This review provides an overview of the genetic landscape of developmental language disorders (DLD), with an emphasis on the importance of defining the specific features (the phenotype) of DLD to inform gene discovery. We review the specific phenotype of DLD in the genetic literature, and the influence of historic variation in diagnostic inclusion criteria on researchers' ability to compare and replicate genotype-phenotype studies. This review provides an overview of the recently identified gene pathways in populations with DLD and explores current state-of-the-art approaches to genetic analysis based on the hypothesised architecture of DLD. We will show how recent global efforts to unify diagnostic criteria have vastly increased sample size and allow for large multi-cohort metanalyses, leading the identification of a growing number of contributory loci. We emphasise the important role of estimating the genetic architecture of DLD to decipher underlying genetic associations. Finally, we explore the potential for epigenetics and environmental interactions to further unravel the biological basis of language disorders."

In healthy populations, the intestinal flora shares a degree of similarity and stability, and they have a role in the metabolism, immunological response, and physiological function of key organs. With the rapid advent of high-throughput sequencing in recent years, several researchers have found that dysbiosis of the human gut microflora potentially cause physical problems and gynecological malignancies among postmenopausal women. Besides, dysbiosis hinders tumor treatment. Nonetheless, the importance of maintaining homeostatic gut microbiota and the effective use of probiotics in the treatment of gynecological malignancies should not be disregarded. Moreover, intestinal flora regulation and the involvement of probiotics as well as associated biologically active substances in gynecological malignancies could be an adjuvant treatment modality related to surgery and chemoradiotherapy in the future. Herein, this article aims to review the potential relationship between gut microorganisms and postmenopausal status as well as gynecologic malignancies; then the relationship between gut microbes and early screening as well as therapeutic aspects. Also, we describe the role of probiotics in the prevention, treatment, and prognosis of gynecologic malignancies.Copyright © 2022 Han, Wang, Han, Ban, Sun and Xu."

However, there are not enough studies that examine the biomarkers relevant to CIS development. Omics experiments generate data with tens of thousands of descriptive variables, e.g., gene expression levels. Often, many of these descriptive variables are identified as somehow relevant, resulting in hundreds or thousands of relevant variables for building models or for further data analysis. We analyze one such dataset describing patients with bladder cancer, mostly non-muscle-invasive (NMIBC), and propose a novel approach to feature selection. This approach returns high-quality features for prediction and yet allows interpretability as well as a certain level of insight into the analyzed data. As a result, we obtain a small set of seven of the most-useful biomarkers for diagnostics. They can also be used to build tests that avoid the costly and time-consuming existing methods. We summarize the current biological knowledge of the chosen biomarkers and contrast it with our findings."

Nevertheless, the features of ferroptosis in gastric cancer (GC) remain poorly understood. This study conducted a systematic analysis of ferroptosis regulators in GC.Methods:We gathered five GC cohorts, namely, TCGA-STAD, GSE84437, GSE62254, GSE26901, and GSE15459. Unsupervised clustering analysis was adopted to cluster GC patients into different ferroptosis subtypes based on ferroptosis regulators. Immune cell infiltration and hallmark pathway activity were estimatedviassGSEA. The ferroptosis index was developed with the PCA computational method. Response to chemotherapy agents and small molecular compounds was inferredviaGDSC, CTRP, and PRISM projects. Two anti-PD-1 therapy cohorts were gathered and the potential of FPI in predicting immune response was assessed.Results:Expression profiles, genetic mutations, DNA methylation, prognostic implications, and drug sensitivity of ferroptosis regulators were characterized in GC. Three ferroptosis subtypes were clustered with distinct prognosis, hallmark pathway activity, and tumor-infiltrating immune cells. Ferroptosis levels were quantified based on the expression of prognostic ferroptosis-related signatures. The significant relationships between FPI and clinicopathological characteristics were observed. Furthermore, high FPI was in relation to poor prognosis, inflamed tumor microenvironment (TME) as well as high sensitivity to chemotherapy agents (docetaxel and cisplatin), and CTRP- and PRISM-derived compounds. Also, FPI acted as a promising predictor of immune response.Conclusion:Collectively, our findings identified a novel ferroptosis-based subtype classification of GC, and revealed the potential of ferroptosis in forming TME diversity and complexity, and guiding individualized treatment.Copyright © 2022 Xiao, Zheng and Liu."

Previously, we successfully developed a monoclonal antibody against multi-pass membrane protein TMEM180 by exosome immunization in rats. This approach yielded antibodies that recognized cancer-specific antigens on the exosome. In this study, we performed immunoprecipitation using magnetic beads to identify the antigen of one of the rat antibody clones, 0614, as CD73. We then converted antibody 0614 to human chimeric antibody 0614-5. Glioblastoma (GB) was the cancer type with the highest expression of CD73 in the tumor relative to healthy tissue. An antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) of 0614-5 exerted an antitumor effect on GB cell lines according to expression of CD73. The 0614-5-ADC has potential to be used to treat cancers with high CD73 expression. In addition, our strategy could be used to determine the antigen of any antibody produced by exosome immunization, which may allow the antibody to advance to new antibody therapies."

This study aimed to identify prognostic genes associated with CAFs that lead to high morbidity and mortality in ovarian cancer (OC) patients. We performed bioinformatics analysis in 16 multicenter studies (2,742 patients) and identified CAF-associated hub genes using the weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). A machine learning methodology was used to identify COL16A1, COL5A2, GREM1, LUM, SRPX, and TIMP3 and construct a prognostic signature. Subsequently, a series of bioinformatics algorithms indicated risk stratification based on the above signature, suggesting that high-risk patients have a worse prognosis, weaker immune response, and lower tumor mutational burden (TMB) status but may be more sensitive to routine chemotherapeutic agents. Finally, we characterized prognostic markers using cell lines, immunohistochemistry, and single-cell sequencing. In conclusion, these results suggest that the CAF-related signature may be a novel pretreatment guide for anti-CAFs, and prognostic markers in CAFs may be potential therapeutic targets to inhibit OC progression.Copyright © 2022 Feng, Xu, Dai, Yin, Zhang and Shen."

The associations of DCC mutation with chromosomal instability and immunotherapeutic efficacy in melanoma are largely uncharacterised.We performed an integrated study based on biological experiments and multi-dimensional data types, including genomic, transcriptomic and clinical immune checkpoint blockade (ICB)-treated melanoma cohorts from public databases.DCC mutation was significantly correlated with the tumour mutational burden (TMB) in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) and ICB-treated melanoma cohorts. DCC expression levels were correlated with DNA damage response and repair (DDR) pathways responsive to irradiation (IR) in the Malme-3M and SK-MEL-2 cell lines. In the TCGA cohort, DCC-mutated samples presented more neoantigens, higher proportions of infiltrating antitumour immunocytes and lower proportions of infiltrating pro-tumour immunocytes than DCC wild-type samples. DCC-mutated samples were significantly enriched in activated immune response and DDR pathways. Furthermore, patients harbouring mutated DCC treated with ICB showed remarkable clinical benefits in terms of the response rate and overall survival.Somatic mutations in DCC are associated with improved clinical outcomes in ICB-treated melanoma patients. Once further validated, the DCC mutational status can improve patient selection for clinical practice and future study enrolment.© 2022.

In this paper, we explore the data available in databases concerning genomic and transcriptomic features of these two genes: the NCBI dbSNP database was used to explore the presence and roles of constitutional SNPs, and the NCI, Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) and TCGA databases were used to explore somatic mutations and copy number variations (CNVs), as well as mRNA expression of these genes in human cancer cell lines and tumours. Relationships ofAGR2/3expression with whole-genome mRNA expression and cancer features (i.e. mutations and CNVs of oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes (TSG)) were established using the CCLE and TCGA databases. In addition, the CCLE data concerning CRISPR gene extinction screens (Achilles project) of these two genes and a panel of oncogenes and TSG were explored. We observed that no functional polymorphism or recurrent mutation could be detected inAGR2orAGR3. The expression of these genes was positively correlated with the expression of epithelial genes and inversely correlated with that of mesenchymal genes. It was also significantly associated with several cancer features, such asTP53orSMAD4mutations, depending on the gene and the cancer type. In addition, the CRISPR screens revealed the absence of cell fitness modification upon gene extinction, in contrast with oncogenes (cell fitness decrease) and TSG (cell fitness increase). Overall, these explorations revealed that AGR2 and AGR3 proteins appear as common non-genetic evolutionary factors in the process of human tumorigenesis."

Here, we identified a novel mitotic phosphorylation site on CHK2 Tyr156, and its responsible kinase JAK2. Expression of a phospho-deficient mutant CHK2 Y156F or treatment with JAK2 inhibitor IV compromised mitotic spindle assembly, leading to genome instability. In contrast, a phospho-mimicking mutant CHK2 Y156E restored mitotic normalcy in JAK2-inhibited cells. Mechanistically, we show that this phosphorylation is required for CHK2 interaction with and phosphorylation of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) kinase Mps1, and failure of which results in impaired Mps1 kinetochore localization and defective SAC. Concordantly, analysis of clinical cancer datasets revealed that deletion of JAK2 is associated with increased genome alteration; and alteration in CHEK2 and JAK2 is linked to preferential deletion or amplification of cancer-related genes. Thus, our findings not only reveal a novel JAK2-CHK2 signaling axis that maintains genome integrity through SAC but also highlight the potential impact on genomic stability with clinical JAK2 inhibition.© 2022.

Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate3 (RAC3), which is overexpressed in several malignancies and promotes tumor progression, has been identified as an oncogene. However, RAC3 has important but not fully understood biological functions in cancer. Our research aims to reveal the new functions and potential mechanisms of RAC3 involved in BCa progression.We explored the expression level of RAC3 and its relationship with prognosis by publicly accessible BCa datasets, while the correlation of RAC3 expression with clinicopathological variables of patients was analyzed.In vitroandin vivoproliferation, migration, autophagy, and other phenotypic changes were examined by constructing knockdown(KD)/overexpression(OE) RAC3 cells and their association with PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway was explored by adding autophagy-related compounds.Compared with non-tumor samples, RAC3 was highly expressed in BCa and negatively correlated with prognosis. KD/OE RAC3 inhibited/promoted the proliferation and migration of BCa cells. Knockdown RAC3 caused cell cycle arrest and decreased adhesion without affecting apoptosis. Inhibition of RAC3 activates PI3K/AKT/mTOR mediated autophagy and inhibits proliferation and migration of BCa cellsin vivoandin vitro.

But data sources, analysis contents and criteria are not same. Here, we focused on SOXF genes to analyze the regulatory mechanisms and diagnostic value at the same standards.This study analyzed functions, expressions, methylations, and mutations of SOXF genes through public databases including Metascape, Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA), cBioPortal, Tumor IMmune Estimation Resource (TIMER), and Kaplan-Meier Plotter. TIMER applies a deconvolution method to infer the abundance of tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TIICs) from gene expression profiles. Metascape combines several biological functions and over 40 independent knowledge bases within one integrated portal. GEPIA analyses RNA sequencing expression data from the The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) projects. The cBioPortal visualizes and analyses genetic data from cancer studies.This study found that SOXF genes had low expressions in multiple types of cancer, such as lung cancer and breast cancer (ANOVA differential methods, |log2FC| cutoff: 1, q value cutoff: 0.01). The lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients with high expression of SOX7 [HR =0.72 (0.61-0.85), logrank P=8.1e-05) and SOX17 [HR =0.54 (0.45-0.64), logrank P=1.7e-12] had a higher overall survival (OS) rate. Expression of SOX7 was significantly related to the copy number variation (CNV) (P=3.02e-8) and promoter methylation level (P=5.33e-14), while SOX17 was only related to the promoter methylation level (P=3.32e-12). The expression of SOXF genes was positively correlated with CD4+T cell infiltration (SOX7: P=8.32e-07, SOX17: P=4.93e-06, SOX18: P=1.61e-11). The AUC for cg07660671 site of SOX7, cg15377283 site of SOX17, and cg24199599 site of SOX18 in distinguishing between normal and tumor in LUAD, intestinal cancer, and breast cancer reached 0.9. SOXF genes were mainly involved in transcriptional regulation, and the Wnt signaling pathway and low expression of SOXF genes in tumor tissue had a strong negative correlation with tumor hypoxia (correlation: -0.35, P≤0.001).This study implied that the expression of SOX7 and SOX17 are potential prognosis markers for patients with Lung cancer and the SOXF genes methylation is potential biomarkers for pan-cancer screening. The SOX7 and SOX17 might modulate the Wnt signaling pathway and the expression of SOXF family genes was significantly negatively correlated with tumor hypoxia.2022 Annals of Translational Medicine.

We engineer proof-of-principle chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells targeting CCR10 using its natural ligand CCL27. In myeloma models we identify proteins that could serve as markers of resistance to bortezomib and lenalidomide, including CD53, CD10, EVI2B, and CD33. We find that acute lenalidomide treatment increases activity of MUC1-targeting CAR-T cells through antigen upregulation.

The molecular mechanism and clinical implications of KRAS mutation in CRC remain unclear and show high heterogeneity within these tumors.Methods:We harnessed the multi-omics data (genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and phosphoproteomic etc.) of KRAS-mutant CRC tumors and performed unsupervised clustering to identify proteomics-based subgroups and molecular characterization.Results:In-depth analysis of the tumor microenvironment by single-cell transcriptomic revealed the cellular landscape of KRAS-mutant CRC tumors and identified the specific cell subsets with KRAS mutation. Integrated multi-omics analyses separated the KRAS-mutant tumors into two distinct molecular subtypes, termed KRAS-M1 (KM1) and KRAS-M2 (KM2). The two subtypes had a similar distribution of mutated residues in KRAS (G12D/V/C etc.) but were characterized by distinct features in terms of prognosis, genetic alterations, microenvironment dysregulation, biological phenotype, and potential therapeutic approaches. Proteogenomic analyses revealed that the EMT, TGF-β and angiogenesis pathways were enriched in the KM2 subtype and that the KM2 subtype was associated with the mesenchymal phenotype-related CMS4 subtype, which indicated stromal invasion and worse prognosis. The KM1 subtype was characterized predominantly by activation of the cell cycle, E2F and RNA transcription and was associated with the chromosomal instability (CIN)-related ProS-E proteomic subtype, which suggested cyclin-dependent features and better survival outcomes. Moreover, drug sensitivity analyses based on three compound databases revealed subgroup-specific agents for KM1 and KM2 tumors.Conclusions:This study clarifies the molecular heterogeneity of KRAS-mutant CRC and reveals new biological subtypes and therapeutic possibilities for these tumors.© The author(s)."

Pharmacogenomics data were generated from the profiling of relative inhibition simultaneously in mixtures (PRISM) and the genomics of drug sensitivity in cancer (GDSC) databases. Multiple bioinformatics approaches were performed to identify pharmacogenomics-based subtypes and find subtype-specific properties.Three reproducible molecular subtypes were found, which were independent prognostic factors and highly associated with stage, survival status, and accepted molecular subtypes. Pharmacogenomics-based subtypes had distinct molecular characteristics: S-Ⅰ was inflammatory, proliferative, and immune-evasion; S-Ⅱ was proliferative and genetics-driven; S-III was metabolic and methylation-driven. Finally, our study provided subtype-guided personalized treatment strategies: Immune checkpoint blockers (ICBs), doxorubicin, tipifarnib, AZ628, and AZD6244 were for S-Ⅰ; Cisplatin, camptothecin, roscovitine, and A.443654 were for S-Ⅱ; Docetaxel, paclitaxel, vinorelbine, and BIBW2992 were for S-III.We provided a novel molecular classification strategy and revealed three pharmacogenomics-based subtypes for LUAD patients, which uncovered potential subtype-related and patient-specific therapeutic strategies.© 2022 The Author(s)."

Pathogenic POLE/POLD1 mutations can cause hypermutation, yet how diverse mutations in POLE/POLD1 influence antitumor immunity following ICB is unclear. Here, we comprehensively determined the effect of POLE/POLD1 mutations in ICB and elucidated the mechanistic impact of these mutations on tumor immunity. Murine syngeneic tumors harboring Pole/Pold1 functional mutations displayed enhanced antitumor immunity and were sensitive to ICB. Patients with POLE/POLD1 mutated tumors harboring telltale mutational signatures respond better to ICB than patients harboring wild-type or signature-negative tumors. A mutant POLE/D1 function-associated signature-based model outperformed several traditional approaches for identifying POLE/POLD1 mutated patients that benefit from ICB. Strikingly, the spectrum of mutational signatures correlates with the biochemical features of neoantigens. Alterations that cause POLE/POLD1 function-associated signatures generate T cell receptor (TCR)-contact residues with increased hydrophobicity, potentially facilitating T cell recognition. Altogether, the functional landscapes of POLE/POLD1 mutations shape immunotherapy efficacy.© 2022. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc."

The processes underlying B-cell dysfunction, as well as their prognostic importance in NSCLC, are unknown. Tumor-specific B-cell gene co-expression networks were constructed by comparing the Boolean implication modeling of single-cell RNA sequencing of NSCLC tumor B cells and normal B cells. Proliferation genes were selected from the networks using in vitro CRISPR-Cas9/RNA interfering (RNAi) screening data in more than 92 human NSCLC epithelial cell lines. The prognostic and predictive evaluation was performed using public NSCLC transcriptome and proteome profiles. A B cell proliferation and prognostic gene co-expression network was present only in normal lung B cells and missing in NSCLC tumor B cells. A nine-gene signature was identified from this B cell network that provided accurate prognostic stratification using bulk NSCLC tumor transcriptome (n= 1313) and proteome profiles (n= 103). Multiple genes (HLA-DRA,HLA-DRB1,OAS1, andCD74) differentially expressed in NSCLC B cells, peripheral blood lymphocytes, and tumor T cells had concordant prognostic indications at the mRNA and protein expression levels.

Our data indicated that PD-1 proteins are not exclusive to immune cells and have unrecognized signal transduction cascades intrinsic to cancer cells. Building on this paradigm shift, we sought to further characterize PD-1 expression in PDAC. We utilized a phospho-explorer array to identify pathways upregulated by PD-1 signaling. We discovered PD-1-mediated activation of the proto-oncogene MET in PDAC cells, which was dependent on hepatocyte growth factor (MET ligand) and not secondary to direct protein interaction. We then discovered that the PD-1/MET axis in PDAC cells regulated growth, migration, and invasion. Importantly, the PD-1/MET axis induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a well-established early oncogenic process in PDAC. We observed that combined targeting of PDAC cell PD-1 and MET resulted in substantial direct tumor cell cytotoxicity and growth inhibition in PDAC cell lines, patient-derived organoids, and patient-derived xenografts independent of cytotoxic immune responses. This is the first report of PDAC-endogenous PD-1 expression regulating MET signaling, which builds upon our growing body of work showing the oncogenic phenotype of PD-1 expression in PDAC cells is distinct from its immunogenic role. These results highlight a paradigm shift that the tumor-specific PD-1 axis is a novel target to effectively kill PDAC cells by antagonizing previously unrecognized PD-1-dependent oncogenic pathways."

Topoisomerase 1 (TOP1) poisons are effective antitumor drugs with good efficacy against lung cancers.We used molecular, genetic and bioinformatic approaches to determine the mechanism of micronuclei formation induced by two TOP1 poisons in different human cancer cells, including SCLC cell lines.TOP1 poisons stimulate similar levels of micronuclei in all tested cell lines but downstream effects can vary markedly. TOP1 poisons increase micronuclei levels with a mechanism involving R-loops as overexpression of RNaseH1 markedly reduces or abolishes both H2AX phosphorylation and micronuclei formation. TOP1 poison-induced micronuclei activate the cGAS/STING pathway leading to increased expression of immune genes in HeLa cells, but not in human SCLC cell lines, mainly due to lack of STING and/or cGAS expression. Moreover, the expression of STING and antigen-presenting machinery genes is generally downregulated in patient tumours of human lung cancer datasets.Altogether, our data reveal an immune signalling mechanism activated by TOP1 poisons, which is often impaired in human SCLC tumours.© 2022.

Significantly, higher expression of ECM1 is associated with poor response to endocrine therapies in luminal B breast cancer patients. We found that ECM1 is upregulated in CAMA1 and MDA-MB-361 cells grown in long-term estrogen-deprived (LTED) conditions. Moreover, the ablation of ECM1 significantly inhibited the proliferation of CAMA1 LTED and MDA-MB-361 LTED cells. Finally, an interrogation of a dataset containing transcriptome and proteome of breast cancer cell lines revealed that the level ofECM1mRNA is positively correlated with that of phosphorylated Src. Based on these findings, we strongly suggest that ECM1 significantly contributes to the acquisition of endocrine resistance in ER+breast cancers by the activation of Src.© 2022 The Author(s).

Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is an aggressive, HLA-I-low, neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin often caused by the Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV). Through the characterization of 11 newly generated MCC patient-derived cell lines, we identified transcriptional suppression of several class I antigen presentation genes. To systematically identify regulators of HLA-I loss in MCC, we performed parallel, genome-scale, gain- and loss-of-function screens in a patient-derived MCPyV-positive cell line and identified MYCL and the non-canonical Polycomb repressive complex 1.1 (PRC1.1) as HLA-I repressors. We observed physical interaction of MYCL with the MCPyV small T viral antigen, supporting a mechanism of virally mediated HLA-I suppression. We further identify the PRC1.1 component USP7 as a pharmacologic target to restore HLA-I expression in MCC."

The conditions are believed to originate during foetal life, however, the mechanisms behind a common aetiology of TGCT and male subfertility remains unknown. Testis-expressed 101 (TEX101) is a glycoprotein that is related to male fertility, and downregulation of the TEX101 gene was shown in pre-diagnostic TGCT patients. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of TEX101 and its interactome related to fertility and TGCT development. We searched literature and compilation of data from curated databases. There are studies from both human and animals showing that disruption of TEX101 result in abnormal semen parameters and sperm function. Members of the TEX101 interactome, like SPATA19, Ly6k, PICK1, and ODF genes are important for normal sperm function. We found only two studies of TEX101 related to TGCT, however, several genes in its interactome may be associated with TGCT development, such as PLAUR, PRSS21, CD109, and ALP1. Some of the interactome members are related to both fertility and cancer. Of special interest is the presence of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchored proteins TEX101 and PRSS21 in basophils that may be coupled to the immune response preventing further development of TGCT precursor cells. The findings of this review indicate that members of the TEX101 interactome could be a part of the link between TGCT and male subfertility.Copyright © 2022 Burton, Wojewodzic, Rounge and Haugen."
"35768510","Mitochondrial RNA modifications shape metabolic plasticity in metastasis.","Nature","Aggressive and metastatic cancers show enhanced metabolic plasticity1, but the precise underlying mechanisms of this remain unclear. Here we show how two NOP2/Sun RNA methyltransferase 3 (NSUN3)-dependent RNA modifications-5-methylcytosine (m5C) and its derivative 5-formylcytosine (f5C) (refs.2-4)-drive the translation of mitochondrial mRNA to power metastasis. Translation of mitochondrially encoded subunits of the oxidative phosphorylation complex depends on the formation of m5C at position 34 in mitochondrial tRNAMet. m5C-deficient human oral cancer cells exhibit increased levels of glycolysis and changes in their mitochondrial function that do not affect cell viability or primary tumour growth in vivo; however, metabolic plasticity is severely impaired as mitochondrial m5C-deficient tumours do not metastasize efficiently. We discovered that CD36-dependent non-dividing, metastasis-initiating tumour cells require mitochondrial m5C to activate invasion and dissemination. Moreover, a mitochondria-driven gene signature in patients with head and neck cancer is predictive for metastasis and disease progression. Finally, we confirm that this metabolic switch that allows the metastasis of tumour cells can be pharmacologically targeted through the inhibition of mitochondrial mRNA translation in vivo. Together, our results reveal that site-specific mitochondrial RNA modifications could be therapeutic targets to combat metastasis.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35768509","GREM1 is required to maintain cellular heterogeneity in pancreatic cancer.","Nature","Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) shows pronounced epithelial and mesenchymal cancer cell populations1-4. Cellular heterogeneity in PDAC is an important feature in disease subtype specification3-5, but how distinct PDAC subpopulations interact, and the molecular mechanisms that underlie PDAC cell fate decisions, are incompletely understood. Here we identify the BMP inhibitor GREM16,7as a key regulator of cellular heterogeneity in pancreatic cancer in human and mouse. Grem1 inactivation in established PDAC in mice resulted in a direct conversion of epithelial into mesenchymal PDAC cells within days, suggesting that persistent GREM1 activity is required to maintain the epithelial PDAC subpopulations. By contrast, Grem1 overexpression caused an almost complete 'epithelialization' of highly mesenchymal PDAC, indicating that high GREM1 activity is sufficient to revert the mesenchymal fate of PDAC cells. Mechanistically, Grem1 was highly expressed in mesenchymal PDAC cells and inhibited the expression of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition transcription factors Snai1 (also known as Snail) and Snai2 (also known as Slug) in the epithelial cell compartment, therefore restricting epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity. Thus, constant suppression of BMP activity is essential to maintain epithelial PDAC cells, indicating that the maintenance of the cellular heterogeneity of pancreatic cancer requires continuous paracrine signalling elicited by a single soluble factor.© 2022.

"35761387","Widespread redundancy in -omics profiles of cancer mutation states.","Genome Biol","In studies of cellular function in cancer, researchers are increasingly able to choose from many -omics assays as functional readouts. Choosing the correct readout for a given study can be difficult, and which layer of cellular function is most suitable to capture the relevant signal remains unclear.We consider prediction of cancer mutation status (presence or absence) from functional -omics data as a representative problem that presents an opportunity to quantify and compare the ability of different -omics readouts to capture signals of dysregulation in cancer. From the TCGA Pan-Cancer Atlas that contains genetic alteration data, we focus on RNA sequencing, DNA methylation arrays, reverse phase protein arrays (RPPA), microRNA, and somatic mutational signatures as -omics readouts. Across a collection of genes recurrently mutated in cancer, RNA sequencing tends to be the most effective predictor of mutation state. We find that one or more other data types for many of the genes are approximately equally effective predictors. Performance is more variable between mutations than that between data types for the same mutation, and there is little difference between the top data types. We also find that combining data types into a single multi-omics model provides little or no improvement in predictive ability over the best individual data type.Based on our results, for the design of studies focused on the functional outcomes of cancer mutations, there are often multiple -omics types that can serve as effective readouts, although gene expression seems to be a reasonable default option.© 2022.

"35758651","Cystathionine-β-synthase is essential for AKT-induced senescence and suppresses the development of gastric cancers with PI3K/AKT activation.","Elife","Hyperactivation of oncogenic pathways downstream of RAS and PI3K/AKT in normal cells induces a senescence-like phenotype that acts as a tumor-suppressive mechanism that must be overcome during transformation. We previously demonstrated that AKT-induced senescence (AIS) is associated with profound transcriptional and metabolic changes. Here, we demonstrate that human fibroblasts undergoing AIS display upregulated cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS) expression and enhanced uptake of exogenous cysteine, which lead to increased hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and glutathione (GSH) production, consequently protecting senescent cells from oxidative stress-induced cell death. CBS depletion allows AIS cells to escape senescence and re-enter the cell cycle, indicating the importance of CBS activity in maintaining AIS. Mechanistically, we show this restoration of proliferation is mediated through suppressing mitochondrial respiration and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by reducing mitochondrial localized CBS while retaining antioxidant capacity of transsulfuration pathway. These findings implicate a potential tumor-suppressive role for CBS in cells with aberrant PI3K/AKT pathway activation. Consistent with this concept, in human gastric cancer cells with activated PI3K/AKT signaling, we demonstrate that CBS expression is suppressed due to promoter hypermethylation. CBS loss cooperates with activated PI3K/AKT signaling in promoting anchorage-independent growth of gastric epithelial cells, while CBS restoration suppresses the growth of gastric tumors in vivo. Taken together, we find that CBS is a novel regulator of AIS and a potential tumor suppressor in PI3K/AKT-driven gastric cancers, providing a new exploitable metabolic vulnerability in these cancers.© 2022, Zhu, Chan et al."

However, the widespread use of misidentified cell lines is a serious threat to scientific reproducibility. Based on the experiences of mandatory cell line authentication at the International Journal of Cancer (IJC), we provide an overview of the issues pertinent to misidentified cell lines and discuss available solutions. We also summarize the lessons learned, revealing that at least 5% of the human cell lines used in manuscripts considered for peer review are misidentified. About 4% of the considered manuscripts are rejected for severe cell line problems, and most are subsequently published in other journals. In order to diminish such malpractice and its consequences for the scientific record, we postulate that strict multi-layered quality control is essential. Besides journals and publishers, we encourage scientists, research institutions, and funders to take action on the matter and revise their respective policies. Hence, we provide concrete recommendations on introducing regular authentication schemes and staff training, and discuss future steps for enhancing good cell culture practices.© 2022 The Authors.

By comparative analysis we highlight commonly identified proteins and pathways that are key in establishing tumor-intrinsic immune susceptibility. Together, these screens demonstrated the importance of the antigen presentation, interferon-γ, tumor necrosis factor and autophagy pathways in governing sensitivity of tumor cells to immune attack. Moreover, they underline the complex interplay between tumor cells and their microenvironment, providing both fundamental and clinically relevant insights into the mechanisms of tumor immune resistance.© 2021 The Author(s)."
"35749559","A pipeline for the reconstruction and evaluation of context-specific human metabolic models at a large-scale.","PLoS Comput Biol","Constraint-based (CB) metabolic models provide a mathematical framework and scaffold for in silico cell metabolism analysis and manipulation. In the past decade, significant efforts have been done to model human metabolism, enabled by the increased availability of multi-omics datasets and curated genome-scale reconstructions, as well as the development of several algorithms for context-specific model (CSM) reconstruction. Although CSM reconstruction has revealed insights on the deregulated metabolism of several pathologies, the process of reconstructing representative models of human tissues still lacks benchmarks and appropriate integrated software frameworks, since many tools required for this process are still disperse across various software platforms, some of which are proprietary. In this work, we address this challenge by assembling a scalable CSM reconstruction pipeline capable of integrating transcriptomics data in CB models. We combined omics preprocessing methods inspired by previous efforts with in-house implementations of existing CSM algorithms and new model refinement and validation routines, all implemented in the Troppo Python-based open-source framework. The pipeline was validated with multi-omics datasets from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE), also including reference fluxomics measurements for the MCF7 cell line. We reconstructed over 6000 models based on the Human-GEM template model for 733 cell lines featured in the CCLE, using MCF7 models as reference to find the best parameter combinations. These reference models outperform earlier studies using the same template by comparing gene essentiality and fluxomics experiments. We also analysed the heterogeneity of breast cancer cell lines, identifying key changes in metabolism related to cancer aggressiveness. Despite the many challenges in CB modelling, we demonstrate using our pipeline that combining transcriptomics data in metabolic models can be used to investigate key metabolic shifts. Significant limitations were found on these models ability for reliable quantitative flux prediction, thus motivating further work in genome-wide phenotype prediction."

In this study, metabolomic analyses revealed that treatment of cancer cells with glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) inhibitors results in intracellular glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) depletion. We further showed that supplementation of cancer cells with G3P attenuates ferroptosis induced by GPX4 inhibitors in a G3P dehydrogenase 2 (GPD2)-dependent manner;GPD2deletion sensitizes cancer cells to GPX4 inhibition-induced mitochondrial lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis, and combined deletion ofGPX4andGPD2synergistically suppresses tumor growth by inducing ferroptosis in vivo. Mechanistically, inner mitochondrial membrane-localized GPD2 couples G3P oxidation with ubiquinone reduction to ubiquinol, which acts as a radical-trapping antioxidant to suppress ferroptosis in mitochondria. Taken together, these results reveal that GPD2 participates in ferroptosis defense in mitochondria by generating ubiquinol."

However, their identification is still challenging. Although mass spectrometry can directly identify human leukocyte antigen (HLA) binding peptides in tumor cells, it focuses on tumor-specific antigens derived from annotated protein-coding regions constituting only 1.5% of the genome. We developed a novel proteogenomic integration strategy to expand the breadth of tumor-specific epitopes derived from all genomic regions. Using the colorectal cancer cell line HCT116 as a model, we accurately identified 10,737 HLA-presented peptides, 1293 of which were non-canonical peptides that traditional database searches could not identify. Moreover, we found eight tumor neo-epitopes derived from somatic mutations, four of which were not previously reported. Our findings suggest that this new proteogenomic approach holds great promise for increasing the number of tumor-specific antigen candidates, potentially enlarging the tumor target pool and improving cancer immunotherapy."

Previously, we used the TCGA database for gene expression profiling of breast, ovary, and endometrial cancers, and identified a top-scoring network centered on theERBB2gene, which plays a crucial role in carcinogenesis in the three estrogen-dependent tumors. Here, we focused on microRNA expression signature similarity, asking whether they could target theERBBfamily. We applied an ML approach on integrated TCGA miRNA profiling of breast, endometrium, and ovarian cancer to identify common miRNA signatures differentiating tumor and normal conditions. Using the ML-based algorithm and the miRTarBase database, we found 205 features and 158 miRNAs targetingERBBisoforms, respectively. By merging the results of both databases and ranking each feature according to the weighted Support Vector Machine model, we prioritized 42 features, with accuracy (0.98), AUC (0.93-95% CI 0.917-0.94), sensitivity (0.85), and specificity (0.99), indicating their diagnostic capability to discriminate between the two conditions. In vitro validations by qRT-PCR experiments, using model and parental cell lines for each tumor type showed that five miRNAs (hsa-mir-323a-3p, hsa-mir-323b-3p, hsa-mir-331-3p, hsa-mir-381-3p, and hsa-mir-1301-3p) had expressed trend concordance between breast, ovarian, and endometrium cancer cell lines compared with normal lines, confirming our in silico predictions. This shows that an integrated computational approach combined with biological knowledge, could identify expression signatures as potential diagnostic biomarkers common to multiple tumors."

Tumor cell ferroptosis triggered by interferon (IFN)-γ that is derived from tumor-infiltrating CD8+T cells greatly contributes to the effect of immunotherapy. However, the molecular mechanism underlying IFN-γ-mediated ferroptosis and related potentially promising therapeutic strategy warrant further clarification. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) participate in ferroptosis execution and can be delivered systemically by multiple carriers, which have manifested obvious therapeutic effects on cancer.MiRNAs expression profile in IFN-γ-driven ferroptosis was obtained by RNA sequencing. Biochemical assays were used to clarify the role of miR-21-3p in IFN-γ-driven ferroptosis and the underlying mechanism. MiR-21-3p-loaded gold nanoparticles were constructed and systemically applied to analyze the role of miR-21-3p in anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in preclinical transplanted tumor model.MiRNAs expression profile of melanoma cells in IFN-γ-driven ferroptosis was first obtained. Then, upregulated miR-21-3p was proved to facilitate IFN-γ-mediated ferroptosis by potentiating lipid peroxidation. miR-21-3p increased the ferroptosis sensitivity by directly targeting thioredoxin reductase 1 (TXNRD1) to enhance lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Furthermore, miR-21-3p overexpression in tumor synergized with anti-PD-1 antibody by promoting tumor cell ferroptosis. More importantly, miR-21-3p-loaded gold nanoparticles were constructed, and the systemic delivery of them increased the efficacy of anti-PD-1 antibody without prominent side effects in preclinical mice model. Ultimately, ATF3 was found to promote miR-21-3p transcription in IFN-γ-driven ferroptosis.MiR-21-3 p upregulation contributes to IFN-γ-driven ferroptosis and synergizes with anti-PD-1 antibody. Nanoparticle delivery of miR-21-3 p is a promising therapeutic approach to increase immunotherapy efficacy without obvious systemic side effects.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022.

Although mostKMT2A-r are restricted to nine partner genes, we have recently revealed thatKMT2A-USP2fusions are often missed during FISH screening of these genetic alterations. Therefore, complementary methods are important for appropriate detection of anyKMT2A-r. Here we use a machine learning model to unravel the most appropriate markers for prediction ofKMT2A-r in various types of acute leukemia. A Random Forest and LightGBM classifier was trained to predictKMT2A-r in patients with acute leukemia. Our results revealed a set of 20 genes capable of accurately estimatingKMT2A-r. TheSKIDA1(AUC: 0.839; CI: 0.799-0.879) andLAMP5(AUC: 0.746; CI: 0.685-0.806) overexpression were the better markers associated withKMT2A-r compared toCSPG4(also namedNG2; AUC: 0.722; CI: 0.659-0.784), regardless of the type of acute leukemia. Of importance, high expression levels ofLAMP5estimated the occurrence of allKMT2A-USP2fusions. Also, we performed drug sensitivity analysis using IC50 data from 345 drugs available in the GDSC database to identify which ones could be used to treatKMT2A-r leukemia. We observed thatKMT2A-r cell lines were more sensitive to 5-Fluorouracil (5FU), Gemcitabine (both antimetabolite chemotherapy drugs), WHI-P97 (JAK-3 inhibitor), Foretinib (MET/VEGFR inhibitor), SNX-2112 (Hsp90 inhibitor), AZD6482 (PI3Kβ inhibitor), KU-60019 (ATM kinase inhibitor), and Pevonedistat (NEDD8-activating enzyme (NAE) inhibitor). Moreover, IC50 data from analyses ofex-vivodrug sensitivity to small-molecule inhibitors reveals that Foretinib is a promising drug option for AML patients carryingFLT3activating mutations.

We use deep neural networks to map cancer-specific mutation rates genome-wide at kilobase-scale resolution. These estimates are then refined to search for evidence of driver mutations under positive selection throughout the genome by comparing observed to expected mutation counts. We mapped mutation rates for 37 cancer types and applied these maps to identify putative drivers within intronic cryptic splice regions, 5' untranslated regions and infrequently mutated genes. Our high-resolution mutation rate maps, available for web-based exploration, are a resource to enable driver discovery genome-wide.© 2022. The Author(s)."

Ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC) responds poorly to conventional chemotherapies and shows poor prognosis. Thus, there is a need to develop new drugs for the treatment of OCCC. In this study, we performed CRISPR/Cas9 screens against OCCC cell lines and identified candidate genes important for their proliferation. We found that quite different genes are required for the growth of ARID1A and PIK3CA mutant and wild-type OCCC cell lines, respectively. Furthermore, we found that the epigenetic regulator KDM2A and the translation regulator PAIP1 may play important roles in the growth of ARID1A and PIK3CA mutant, but not wild-type, OCCC cells. The results of our CRISPR/Cas9 screening may be useful in elucidating the molecular mechanism of OCCC tumorigenesis and in developing OCCC-targeted drugs."

While the functional impacts of TE-derived sequences on early embryogenesis have been recognized, their roles in malignancy are only starting to emerge. Here we show that many TEs, especially the pluripotency-related human endogenous retrovirus H (HERVH), are abnormally activated in colorectal cancer (CRC) samples. Transcriptional upregulation of HERVH is associated with mutations of several tumor suppressors, particularly ARID1A. Knockout of ARID1A in CRC cells leads to increased transcription at several HERVH loci, which involves compensatory contribution by ARID1B. Suppression of HERVH in CRC cells and patient-derived organoids impairs tumor growth. Mechanistically, HERVH transcripts colocalize with nuclear BRD4 foci, modulating their dynamics and co-regulating many target genes. Altogether, we uncover a critical role for ARID1A in restraining HERVH, whose abnormal activation can promote tumorigenesis by stimulating BRD4-dependent transcription.© 2022. The Author(s)."

We scored the importance of the candidate genes by constructing a high-confidence co-expression-based edge-weighted PPI network, extracting protein regulatory sub-networks by random walk algorithm, constructing disease-specific networks based on known CAGs, and scoring the genes of the sub-networks with the PageRank algorithm. The results showed that our screened top-ranked genes were more critical in tumours relative to the known CAGs list and significantly differentiated the overall survival of PAAD patients. These results suggest that the PRNet method of ranking cancer-associated genes can identify new disease-associated genes and is more informative than the original CAGs list, which can help investigators to screen potential biomarkers for validation and molecular mechanism exploration.Copyright © 2022 Su, Liu, Guo, Zhang, Zhu and Wang."

The possible function of LMAN2 in breast cancer was investigated in the Human Cell Landscape (HCL) database, Gene Regulatory Network database (GRNdb), and CancerSEA database. Moreover, N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modifications were analyzed using the RMBase v2.0 and M6A2Target databases. Seven databases were then used to analyze the potential action mechanisms of LMAN2. Our findings suggest that LMAN2, which is expressed at a high level in breast cancer, is linked to an unfavorable prognosis. Therefore, LMAN2 has the potential to be utilized as a treatment target in breast cancer. Furthermore, the single-cell analysis illustrated that LMAN2 expression had a positive link to breast cancer stemness, proliferation, metastasis, and differentiation. Moreover, m6A modifications were found in the LMAN2 gene. Consequently, modifications to m6A methylation may influence LMAN2 expression, which is associated with the homologous recombination (HR) in its DNA damage repair pathway .Copyright © 2022 Di Zhang et al."

However, algorithms that can use Hi-C data for a full-range SV detection have been severely lacking. Current methods can only identify interchromosomal translocations and long-range intrachromosomal SVs (>1 Mb) at less-than-optimal resolution. Therefore, we develop EagleC, a framework that combines deep-learning and ensemble-learning strategies to predict a full range of SVs at high resolution. We show that EagleC can uniquely capture a set of fusion genes that are missed by whole-genome sequencing or nanopore. Furthermore, EagleC also effectively captures SVs in other chromatin interaction platforms, such as HiChIP, Chromatin interaction analysis with paired-end tag sequencing (ChIA-PET), and capture Hi-C. We apply EagleC in more than 100 cancer cell lines and primary tumors and identify a valuable set of high-quality SVs.

FOXA2 has essential roles in embryonic and uterine development. However, FOXA2's role in EC is incompletely understood. Functional investigations using human and mouse EC cell lines revealed that FOXA2 controls endometrial epithelial gene expression programs regulating cell proliferation, adhesion, and endometrial-epithelial transition. In live animals, conditional inactivation of Foxa2 or Pten alone in endometrial epithelium did not result in ECs, but simultaneous inactivation of both genes resulted in lethal ECs with complete penetrance, establishing potent synergism between Foxa2 and PI3K signaling. Studies in tumor-derived cell lines and organoids highlighted additional invasion and cell growth phenotypes associated with malignant transformation and identified key mediators, including Myc and Cdh1. Transcriptome and cistrome analyses revealed that FOXA2 broadly controls gene expression programs through modification of enhancer activity in addition to regulating specific target genes, rationalizing its tumor suppressor functions.

In contrast to protein-coding genes, robust CRISPR-based loss-of-function screens are lacking for long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), which are key regulators of many cellular processes, leaving many essential lncRNAs unidentified and uninvestigated. Integrating copy number, epigenetic, and transcriptomic data of >800 cancer cell lines with CRISPR-derived co-essential pathways, our method recapitulates known essential lncRNAs and predicts proliferation/growth dependency of 289 poorly characterized lncRNAs. Analyzing lncRNA dependencies across 10 cancer types and their expression alteration by diverse growth inhibitors across cell types, we prioritize 30 high-confidence pan-cancer proliferation/growth-regulating lncRNAs. Further evaluating two previously uncharacterized topproliferation-suppressivelncRNAs (PSLR-1,PSLR-2) showed they are transcriptionally regulated by p53, induced by multiple cancer treatments, and significantly correlate to increased cancer patient survival. These lncRNAs modulate G2 cell cycle-regulating genes within the FOXM1 transcriptional network, inducing a G2 arrest and inhibiting proliferation and colony formation. Collectively, our results serve as a powerful resource for exploring lncRNA-mediated regulation of cellular fitness in cancer, circumventing current limitations in lncRNA research.© 2022, Mitra et al."

Abnormal expression of NLRC4 and CASP1 is associated with multiple tumors. However, the expression differences, prognostic value and immune correlation of NLRC4 and CASP1 in colorectal cancer (CRC) remain to be determined.In this study, TCGA, CCLE, HPA, PrognoScan, STRING and GeneMANIA databases were used to analyze differences in expression, prognostic value, genetic alterations and immune cell infiltration of NLRC4 and CASP1 in CRC patients. Then, we further validated the expression of NLRC4 and CASP1 in CRC using immunohistochemistry (IHC).NLRC4 and CASP1 were expressed low in CRC tissues and CRC cell lines. The expression of NLRC4 was significantly related to the patient's gender and lymph node metastasis. NLRC4 and CASP1 down-regulated expression was observably correlated with poor survival and diverse immune cells infiltration in CRC patients. NLRC4 and CASP1 have a gene mutation alteration. NLRC4 and CASP1 had a significant positive correlation in CRC.This study will provide new ideas for the prognosis and treatment in CRC. NLRC4 and CASP1 are expected to be novel biomarkers and potential immunotherapy targets in CRC patients.© 2022 Peng et al."

Repression of the major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) represents a key mechanism driving resistance to T cell-based immunotherapies.We evaluated the role of the lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) as a determinant of MHC-I expression, functional antigen presentation, and immune activation in SCLC in vitro and in vivo through evaluation of both human SCLC cell lines and immunocompetent mouse models.We found that targeted inhibition of LSD1 in SCLC restores MHC-I cell surface expression and transcriptionally activates genes encoding the antigen presentation pathway. LSD1 inhibition further activates interferon signaling, induces tumor-intrinsic immunogenicity, and sensitizes SCLC cells to MHC-I-restricted T cell cytolysis. Combination of LSD1 inhibitor with ICB augments the antitumor immune response in refractory SCLC models. Together, these data define a role for LSD1 as a potent regulator of MHC-I antigen presentation and provide rationale for combinatory use of LSD1 inhibitors with ICB to improve therapeutic response in SCLC.Epigenetic silencing of MHC-I in SCLC contributes to its poor response to ICB. Our study identifies a previously uncharacterized role for LSD1 as a regulator of MHC-I antigen presentation in SCLC. LSD1 inhibition enables MHC-I-restricted T cell cytolysis, induces immune activation, and augments the antitumor immune response to ICB in SCLC.Copyright © 2022 International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer.

These small-molecule MGs are gradually being recognized for their potential application in treating human diseases, including cancer. Evidence suggests that small-molecule MG compounds could essentially target any proteins, which play critical roles in human disease etiology, where many of these protein targets were previously considered undruggable. Intriguingly, most MG compounds with high efficacy for cancer treatment can glue on and control multiple key protein targets. On the other hand, a single key protein target can also be glued by multiple MG compounds with distinct chemical structures. The high flexibility of MG-protein interaction profiles provides rich soil for the growth and development of small-molecule MG compounds that can be used as molecular tools to assist in unraveling disease mechanisms, and they can also facilitate drug development for the treatment of human disease, especially human cancer. In this review, we elucidate this concept by using various types of small-molecule MG compounds and their corresponding protein targets that have been documented in the literature."

During the period of the pandemic of COVID-19, cancer patients should be paid more attention as more severe events are found in cancer patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Basigin (BSG) is an essential factor for the infection and progression of COVID-19 and tumorigenesis of multiple tumors, which may serve as a novel target for the effective treatment against COVID-19 and multiple human cancers.Methods:A total of 19,020 samples from multiple centers were included in our research for the comprehensive investigation of the differences in BSG expression among human organs, cancer cells, cancer tissues, and normal tissues. Cox regression analysis and Kaplan-Meier curves were utilized to explore the prognosis factor ofBSGin cancers. Correlation analyses were used to determine associations ofBSGexpression with tumor mutational burden, the immune microenvironment, etc. Gene set enrichment analysis was applied to explore the underlying mechanisms ofBSGin cancers.Results:Compared with normal tissues,BSGexpression was high in 13 types of cancers (cholangiocarcinoma, etc.) and low in colon adenocarcinoma and rectum adenocarcinoma.BSGexpression was related to the prognosis of eight cancers (e.g., invasive breast carcinoma) (p< 0.05). The gene also demonstrated a pronounced effect in identifying 12 cancers (cholangiocarcinoma, etc.) from their control samples (AUC >0.7). TheBSGexpression was associated with DNA methyltransferases, mismatch repair genes, immune infiltration levels, tumor mutational burden, microsatellite instability, neoantigen, and immune checkpoints, suggesting the potential ofBSGas an exciting target for cancer treatment.BSGmay play its role in several cancers by affecting several signaling pathways such as drug cytochrome metabolism P450 and JAK-STAT.Conclusion:BSGmay be a novel biomarker for treating and identifying multiple human cancers.Copyright © 2022 Huang and He."

"35636967","MET∆14 promotes a ligand-dependent, AKT-driven invasive growth.","Life Sci Alliance","METis an oncogene encoding the tyrosine kinase receptor for hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). Upon ligand binding, MET activates multiple signal transducers, including PI3K/AKT, STAT3, and MAPK. When mutated or amplified,METbecomes a ""driver"" for the onset and progression of cancer. The most frequent mutations in theMETgene affect the splicing sites of exon 14, leading to the deletion of the receptor's juxtamembrane domain (MET∆14). It is currently believed that, as in gene amplification, MET∆14 kinase is constitutively active. Our analysis of MET in carcinoma cell lines showed that MET∆14 strictly depends on HGF for kinase activation. Compared with wt MET, ∆14 is sensitive to lower HGF concentrations, with more sustained kinase response. Using three different models, we have demonstrated that MET∆14 activation leads to robust phosphorylation of AKT, leading to a distinctive transcriptomic signature. Functional studies revealed that ∆14 activation is predominantly responsible for enhanced protection from apoptosis and cellular migration. Thus, the unique HGF-dependent ∆14 oncogenic activity suggests consideration of HGF in the tumour microenvironment to select patients for clinical trials.© 2022 Cerqua et al."
"35628590","Cancer Cells Haploinsufficient for ATM Are Sensitized to PARP Inhibitors by <i>MET</i> Inhibition.","Int J Mol Sci","TheMEToncogene encodes a tyrosine kinase (TK) receptor. Its activation protects cells from death but also stimulates DNA damage response by triggering excess replicative stress. Transcriptomic classification of cancer cell lines based onMETexpression showed that response to the PARP inhibitor (PARPi) olaparib is poorer inMEToverexpressing cell lines. Accordingly, a highMETexpressing lung carcinoma cell line was sensitized to PARPi byMETTK inhibition. This was not linked solely toMEToverexpression: otherMEToverexpressing cell lines were biochemically but not functionally responsive to combined inhibition. Moreover, exogenously inducedMEToverexpression was unable to induce resistance to PARPi. TheMEToverexpressing cell line, responsive to the combined PARP andMETinhibition, carried a heterozygous mutation of the ATM gene and showed an attenuated response of ATM to PARPi. Among the downstream targets of ATM activation, NuMA was phosphorylated only in response to the combined PARP andMETinhibition. Given the role played by NuMA in mitosis, data show that the latter is affected byMETand PARP inhibition in cells with haploinsufficient ATM. This is important as ATM heterozygous mutation is frequently found in human cancer and in lung carcinomas in particular."
"35609998","Hexokinase 2 is a transcriptional target and a positive modulator of AHR signalling.","Nucleic Acids Res","The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) regulates the expression of numerous genes in response to activation by agonists including xenobiotics. Although it is well appreciated that environmental signals and cell intrinsic features may modulate this transcriptional response, how it is mechanistically achieved remains poorly understood. We show that hexokinase 2 (HK2) a metabolic enzyme fuelling cancer cell growth, is a transcriptional target of AHR as well as a modulator of its activity. Expression of HK2 is positively regulated by AHR upon exposure to agonists both in human cells and in mice lung tissues. Conversely, over-expression of HK2 regulates the abundance of many proteins involved in the regulation of AHR signalling and these changes are linked with altered AHR expression levels and transcriptional activity. HK2 expression also shows a negative correlation with AHR promoter methylation in tumours, and these tumours with high HK2 expression and low AHR methylation are associated with a worse overall survival in patients. In sum, our study provides novel insights into how AHR signalling is regulated which may help our understanding of the context-specific effects of this pathway and may have implications in cancer.© The Author(s) 2022.

Dual-specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1) was identified as one of seven genes that may significantly affect prognosis in patients with HGSOC; however, the role of DUSP inhibition (DUSPi) in the treatment of HGSOC remains largely unknown. In this study, we show that DUSP1 is highly expressed in HGSOC and confers worse PFS and OS. Further, we corroborate data that show DUSP1 expression is directly associated with therapy resistance. Using a tissue microarray of 137 different serous ovarian carcinomas, we demonstrate the high expression of DUSP1 in primary and recurrent serous ovarian cancer. In both acquired and de novo therapy HGSOC-resistant models, DUSPi both inhibited cellular proliferation and promoted cell death. RPPA analysis of HGSOC cells revealed DUSPi led to the differential regulation of several pathways, including AMPK and mTORC. Further, in a patient-derived xenograft HGSOC model, DUSPi significantly inhibited tumor progression.©2022 American Association for Cancer Research."

Women who develop postpartum depression are suspected to be more sensitive to the rapid and large fluctuations in sex steroid hormones, particularly estradiol, during pregnancy and postpartum. This trial aims to evaluate the preventive effect of 3 weeks transdermal estradiol treatment immediately postpartum on depressive episodes in women at high risk for developing postpartum depression.The Maternal Mental Health Trial is a double-blind, randomised and placebo-controlled clinical trial. The trial involves three departments of obstetrics organised under Copenhagen University Hospital in Denmark. Women who are singleton pregnant with a history of perinatal depression are eligible to participate. Participants will be randomised to receive either transdermal estradiol patches (200 µg/day) or placebo patches for 3 weeks immediately postpartum. The primary outcome is clinical depression, according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-V criteria of Major Depressive Disorder with onset at any time between 0 and 6 months postpartum. Secondary outcomes include, but are not limited to, symptoms of depression postpartum, exclusive breastfeeding, cortisol dynamics, maternal distress sensitivity and cognitive function. The primary statistical analysis will be performed based on the intention-to-treat principle.

Leveraging these multi-omics data potentially provides a more comprehensive view of the disease mechanism or biological processes. Integrative multi-omics clustering is an unsupervised integrative method specifically used to find coherent groups of samples or features by utilizing information across multi-omics data. It aims to better stratify diseases and to suggest biological mechanisms and potential targeted therapies for the diseases. However, applying integrative multi-omics clustering is both statistically and computationally challenging due to various reasons such as high dimensionality and heterogeneity. In this review, we summarized integrative multi-omics clustering methods into three general categories:concatenated clustering,clustering of clusters, andinteractive clusteringbased on when and how the multi-omics data are processed for clustering. We further classified the methods into different approaches under each category based on the main statistical strategy used during clustering. In addition, we have provided recommended practices tailored to four real-life scenarios to help researchers to strategize their selection in integrative multi-omics clustering methods for their future studies."
"35908049","Novel adult cortical neuron processing and screening method illustrates sex- and age-dependent effects of pharmaceutical compounds.","Sci Rep","Neurodegenerative diseases and neurotraumatic injuries are typically age-associated disorders that can reduce neuron survival, neurite outgrowth, and synaptic plasticity leading to loss of cognitive capacity, executive function, and motor control. In pursuit of reducing the loss of said neurological functions, novel compounds are sought that promote neuron viability, neuritogenesis, and/or synaptic plasticity. Current high content in vitro screenings typically use cells that are iPSC-derived, embryonic, or originate from post-natal tissues; however, most patients suffering from neurodegenerative diseases and neurotrauma are of middle-age and older. The chasm in maturity between the neurons used in drug screens and those in a target population is a barrier for translational success of in vitro results. It has been historically challenging to culture adult neurons let alone conduct screenings; therefore, age-appropriate drug screenings have previously not been plausible. We have modified Miltenyi's protocol to increase neuronal yield, neuron purity, and neural viability at a reduced cost to expand our capacity to screen compounds directly in primary adult neurons. To our knowledge, we developed the first morphology-based screening system using adult cortical neurons and the first to incorporate age and sex as biological variables in a screen using adult cortical neurons. By using primary adult cortical neurons from mice that were 4 to 48 weeks old for screening pharmaceutical agents, we have demonstrated age- and sex-dependent effects on neuritogenesis and neuron survival in vitro. Utilizing age- and sex-appropriate in vitro models to find novel compounds increasing neuron survival and neurite outgrowth, made possible by our modified adult neuron processing method, will greatly increase the relevance of in vitro screening for finding neuroprotective compounds.© 2022.

Early life stress (ELS) is receiving more attention as a possible cause of depression. Many studies focused on the mechanisms underlying how ELS leads to changes in sex hormones, neurotransmitters, hypothalamic pituitary adrenocortical (HPA) axis function, and epigenetics. The adverse effects of ELS on adulthood are mainly dependent on the time window when stress occurs, sex and the developmental stage when evaluating the impacts. Therefore, with regard to the exact sex differences of adult depression, we found that ELS could lead to sex-differentiated depression through multiple mechanisms, including 5-HT, sex hormone, HPA axis, and epigenetics.Copyright © 2022 An, Guo, Wu, Fu, Li, Zhang, Li, Cui, Yang, Zhang and Zhao."

A better understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms is urgent. Here, we aimed to examine the role of DNA methylation of NP system genes in IS.DNA methylation at promoter regions of 4 core NP system genes, e.g.,CORIN,FURIN,NPPA, andNPPB, was measured by targeted bisulfite sequencing in 853 patients with IS and 918 controls. We first examined the association between DNA methylation at each single CpG and IS, followed by gene-based and gene set analyses to examine the joint associations of DNA methylation at multiple CpGs in a gene or all 4 genes as a pathway with IS.After control of covariates and multiple testing, DNA methylation at 19 of the 36 assayed CpGs was individually associated with IS atq< 0.05. Higher average methylation levels at the targeted regions ofCORIN(odds ratio [OR] = 0.64, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.56-0.73),FURIN(OR = 0.78, 95% CI: 0.69-0.88), andNPPA(OR = 0.78, 95% CI: 0.69-0.88) were associated with a lower odds of IS (allq< 0.05). The truncated product method revealed the same gene-based associations (allq< 0.05) and found that DNA methylation at all 4 NP system genes together was jointly associated with IS (p= 0.0001).DNA methylation at NP system genes was downregulated in patients with IS. Our results may unravel a molecular mechanism underlying the regulating effect of the NP system on IS and highlight the relevance of testing the joint effect of multiple CpGs in the epigenetic analysis.Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).

"35610986","Parsimonious model for mass-univariate vertexwise analysis.","J Med Imaging (Bellingham)","Purpose:Covariance between gray-matter measurements can reflect structural or functional brain networks though it has also been shown to be influenced by confounding factors (e.g., age, head size, and scanner), which could lead to lower mapping precision (increased size of associated clusters) and create distal false positives associations in mass-univariate vertexwise analyses.Approach:We evaluated this concern by performing state-of-the-art mass-univariate analyses (general linear model, GLM) on traits simulated from real vertex-wise gray matter data (including cortical and subcortical thickness and surface area). We contrasted the results with those from linear mixed models (LMMs), which have been shown to overcome similar issues in omics association studies.Results:We showed that when performed on a large sample (N=8662, UK Biobank), GLMs yielded greatly inflated false positive rate (cluster false discovery rate>0.6). We showed that LMMs resulted in more parsimonious results: smaller clusters and reduced false positive rate but at a cost of increased computation. Next, we performed mass-univariate association analyses on five real UKB traits (age, sex, BMI, fluid intelligence, and smoking status) and LMM yielded fewer and more localized associations. We identified 19 significant clusters displaying small associations with age, sex, and BMI, which suggest a complex architecture of at least dozens of associated areas with those phenotypes.Conclusions:The published literature could contain a large proportion of redundant (possibly confounded) associations that are largely prevented using LMMs. The parsimony of LMMs results from controlling for the joint effect of all vertices, which prevents local and distal redundant associations from reaching significance.© 2022 The Authors."

Peripheral blood samples were collected from two independent case-control studies with a total of 272 sporadic early-stage BC cases (76.5% at stage I&II) and 272 cancer-free female controls. Mass spectrometry was applied to quantitatively measure the levels of DNA methylation. The logistic regression and non-parametric tests were used for the statistical analyses. In contrast to the protective effects reported in European women, we reported the blood-based hypomethylation inCD160,ISYNA1andRAD51Bas risk factors for BC in the Chinese population (CD160_CpG_3, CD160_CpG_4/cg20975414, ISYNA1_CpG_2, RAD51B_CpG_3 and RAD51B_CpG_4; odds ratios (ORs) per -10% methylation ranging from 1.08 to 1.67,p< 0.05 for all). Moreover, hypomethylation ofCD160,ISYNA1andRAD51Bwas significantly correlated with age, BC subtypes including estrogen receptor (ER)-negative BC tumors, triple negative tumors, BC cases with larger size, advanced stages and more lymph node involvement. Our results supported the report in European women that BC is associated with altered methylation ofCD160,ISYNA1andRAD51Bin the peripheral blood, although the effects are opposite in the Chinese population.

While data on genotoxicity are collected through standardized guideline tests, data collected on epigenetic effects is far less uniform. In 2016, we conducted a systematic review of published studies of genotoxic carcinogens that reported epigenetic endpoints to better understand the evidence for epigenetic alterations of human carcinogens, and the potential association with genotoxic endpoints. Since then, the number of studies of epigenetic effects of chemicals has nearly doubled. This review stands as an update on epigenetic alterations induced by occupational and environmental human carcinogens that were previously and recently classified as Group 1 by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. We found that the evidence of epigenetic effects remains uneven across agents. Studies of DNA methylation are most abundant, while reports concerning effects on non-coding RNA have increased over the past 5 years. By contrast, mechanistic toxicology studies of histone modifications and chromatin state alterations remain few. We found that most publications of epigenetic effects of carcinogens were studies in exposed humans or human cells. Studies in rodents represent the second most common species used for epigenetic studies in toxicology, in vivo exposures being the most predominant. Future studies should incorporate dose- and time-dependent study designs and also investigate the persistence of effects following cessation of exposure, considering the dynamic nature of most epigenetic alterations.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

However, few studies have investigated the factors contributing to the prognosis of WT Bf-CM patients.In this paper, we proposed and validated a novel 7-RNA based signature to predict the prognosis of WT Bf-CM by analyzing the information from TCGA database.Dependence of this signature to other clinical factors were verified and a nomogram was also drawn to promote its application in clinical practice. Functional analysis suggested that the predictive function of this signature might attribute to the prediction of the up-regulation of RNA splicing, transcription, and cellular proliferation in the high-risk group, which have been demonstrated to be linked to malignancy of cancer. Moreover, functional analysis and therapy response analysis supported that the prognosis is highly related to PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway among WT Bf-CM patients.Collectively, this study will provide a preliminary bioinformatics evidence for the molecular mechanism and potential drug targets that could improving WT Bf-CM prognosis.© 2022.

"35593315","5‑Aza‑dC suppresses melanoma progression by inhibiting GAS5 hypermethylation.","Oncol Rep","The in‑depth study of melanoma pathogenesis has revealed that epigenetic modifications, particularly DNA methylation, is a universal inherent feature of the development and progression of melanoma. In the present study, the analysis of the tumor suppressor gene growth arrest‑specific transcript 5 (GAS5) demonstrated that its expression was downregulated in melanoma, and its expression level had a certain negative association with its methylation modification level. The promoter of GAS5 presented with detectable CpG islands, and methylation‑specific polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated that GAS5 was actually modified by methylation in melanoma tissues and cells; however, no methylation modification of GAS5 was detected in normal tissues. Following the treatment of melanoma cells with 5‑Aza‑2'‑deoxycytidine (5‑Aza‑dC), GAS5 methylation was significantly reversed. The analysis of melanoma cell proliferation revealed that 5‑Aza‑dC inhibited A375 and SK‑MEL‑110 cell proliferation in a time‑dependent manner. Further analysis of apoptosis demonstrated that 5‑Aza‑dC significantly increased the apoptosis level of the two cell lines. Moreover, migration analysis of melanoma cells revealed that 5‑Aza‑dC significantly reduced cell migration. Furthermore, 5‑Aza‑dC significantly decreased the invasive ability of the two cell lines. However, when the expression of GAS5 was silenced, the effects of 5‑Aza‑dC on cell proliferation, apoptosis, invasion and migration were not significant. Furthermore, the subcutaneous injection of A375 cells in nude mice successfully resulted in xenograft tumor formation. However, following an intraperitoneal injection of 5‑Aza‑dC, the volume and weight of xenograft tumors and Ki‑67 expression were significantly reduced, and caspase‑3 activity and GAS5 expression were enhanced; following the silencing of GAS5, the antitumor effect of 5‑Aza‑dC was significantly blocked. On the whole, the present study demonstrates that 5‑Aza‑dC inhibits the growth of melanoma, and its function may be related to the methylation modification of GAS5."

In the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, the role of the environmental microbial community on immune system maturation - and, importantly, protection from infectious disease - is still an open question.Here, we demonstrate that early life microbial exposure durably improves oyster survival when challenged with the pathogen causing Pacific oyster mortality syndrome (POMS), both in the exposed generation and in the subsequent one. Combining microbiota, transcriptomic, genetic, and epigenetic analyses, we show that the microbial exposure induced changes in epigenetic marks and a reprogramming of immune gene expression leading to long-term and intergenerational immune protection against POMS.We anticipate that this protection likely extends to additional pathogens and may prove to be an important new strategy for safeguarding oyster aquaculture efforts from infectious disease. tag the videobyte/videoabstract in this section Video Abstract.© 2022.

"35719395","Transposable Elements in Pluripotent Stem Cells and Human Disease.","Front Genet","Transposable elements (TEs) are mobile genetic elements that can randomly integrate into other genomic sites. They have successfully replicated and now occupy around 40% of the total DNA sequence in humans. TEs in the genome have a complex relationship with the host cell, being both potentially deleterious and advantageous at the same time. Only a tiny minority of TEs are still capable of transposition, yet their fossilized sequence fragments are thought to be involved in various molecular processes, such as gene transcriptional activity, RNA stability and subcellular localization, and chromosomal architecture. TEs have also been implicated in biological processes, although it is often hard to reveal cause from correlation due to formidable technical issues in analyzing TEs. In this review, we compare and contrast two views of TE activity: one in the pluripotent state, where TEs are broadly beneficial, or at least mechanistically useful, and a second state in human disease, where TEs are uniformly considered harmful.Copyright © 2022 Ma, Babarinde, Zhou and Hutchins."

TheT. ni piggyBactransposon can introduce exogenous fragments into a genome, constructing a transgenic organism. Nevertheless, the comprehensive analysis of endogenouspiggyBac-like elements (PLEs) is important before usingpiggyBac, because they may influence the genetic stability of transgenic lines.Herein, we conducted a genome-wide analysis ofPLEs in the brown planthopper (BPH)Nilaparvata lugens(Stål) (Hemiptera: Delphacidae), and identified a total of 28PLEsequences. AllN. lugens piggyBac-like elements (NlPLEs) were present as multiple copies in the genome of BPH. Among the identifiedNlPLEs,NlPLE25had the highest copy number and it was distributed on five chromosomes. The full length ofNlPLE25consisted of terminal inverted repeats and sub-terminal inverted repeats at both terminals, as well as a single open reading frame transposase encoding 546 amino acids. Furthermore,NlPLE25transposase caused precise excision and transposition in cultured insect cells and also restored the original TTAA target sequence after excision. A cross-recognition between theNlPLE25transposon and thepiggyBactransposon was also revealed in this study. These findings provide useful information for the construction of transgenic insect lines."

In recent years, the introduction of whole-genome and whole-transcriptome approaches, as well as single-cell resolution techniques, provided a breakthrough that uncovered TE involvement in host gene expression regulation underlying multiple normal and pathological processes. Of particular interest is increased TE activity in neuronal tissue, and specifically in the hippocampus, that was repeatedly demonstrated in multiple experiments. On the other hand, numerous neuropathologies are associated with TE dysregulation. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of literature about the role of TEs in neurons published over the last three decades. The first chapter of the present review describes known mechanisms of TE interaction with host genomes in general, with the focus on mammalian and human TEs; the second chapter provides examples of TE exaptation in normal neuronal tissue, including TE involvement in neuronal differentiation and plasticity; and the last chapter lists TE-related neuropathologies. We sought to provide specific molecular mechanisms of TE involvement in neuron-specific processes whenever possible; however, in many cases, only phenomenological reports were available.

"35627104","mRNA Vaccines: Why Is the Biology of Retroposition Ignored?","Genes (Basel)","The major advantage of mRNA vaccines over more conventional approaches is their potential for rapid development and large-scale deployment in pandemic situations. In the current COVID-19 crisis, two mRNA COVID-19 vaccines have been conditionally approved and broadly applied, while others are still in clinical trials. However, there is no previous experience with the use of mRNA vaccines on a large scale in the general population. This warrants a careful evaluation of mRNA vaccine safety properties by considering all available knowledge about mRNA molecular biology and evolution. Here, I discuss the pervasive claim that mRNA-based vaccines cannot alter genomes. Surprisingly, this notion is widely stated in the mRNA vaccine literature but never supported by referencing any primary scientific papers that would specifically address this question. This discrepancy becomes even more puzzling if one considers previous work on the molecular and evolutionary aspects of retroposition in murine and human populations that clearly documents the frequent integration of mRNA molecules into genomes, including clinical contexts. By performing basic comparisons, I show that the sequence features of mRNA vaccines meet all known requirements for retroposition using L1 elements-the most abundant autonomously active retrotransposons in the human genome. In fact, many factors associated with mRNA vaccines increase the possibility of their L1-mediated retroposition. I conclude that is unfounded to a priori assume that mRNA-based therapeutics do not impact genomes and that the route to genome integration of vaccine mRNAs via endogenous L1 retroelements is easily conceivable. This implies that we urgently need experimental studies that would rigorously test for the potential retroposition of vaccine mRNAs. At present, the insertional mutagenesis safety of mRNA-based vaccines should be considered unresolved."

This includes a step-by-step description on how to microdissect the border regions of the mouse brain, together with dissociation protocols tailored to each of these tissues. These combine a high yield with minimal dissociation-induced gene expression changes. Next, we outline the steps involved for high-dimensional flow cytometry and droplet-based single-cell RNA sequencing via the 10x Genomics platform, which can be combined with cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing (CITE-seq) and offers a higher throughput than plate-based methods. Importantly, we detail how to implement CITE-seq with large antibody panels to obtain unbiased protein-expression screening coupled to transcriptome analysis. Finally, we describe the main steps involved in the analysis and interpretation of the data. This optimized workflow allows for a detailed assessment of immune cell heterogeneity and activation in the whole brain or specific border regions, at RNA and protein level.

Currently there is a huge gap between fast-growing single-cell multi-omics data and effective methods for the integrative analysis of these inherent sparse and heterogeneous data. In this study, we have developed a novel method, Single-cell Multi-omics Gene co-Regulatory algorithm (SMGR), to detect coherent functional regulatory signals and target genes from the joint single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (scATAC-seq) data obtained from different samples. Given that scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data can be captured by zero-inflated Negative Binomial distribution, we utilize a generalized linear regression model to identify the latent representation of consistently expressed genes and peaks, thus enables the identification of co-regulatory programs and the elucidation of regulating mechanisms. Results from both simulation and experimental data demonstrate that SMGR outperforms the existing methods with considerably improved accuracy. To illustrate the biological insights of SMGR, we apply SMGR to mixed-phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL) and identify the MPAL-specific regulatory program with significant peak-gene links, which greatly enhance our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms and potential targets of this complex tumor.© The Author(s) 2022.

We developed a model of adaptive and fibrotic kidney regeneration by titrating ischemic injury dose. We performed detailed biochemical and histological analysis and profiled transcriptomic changes at bulk and single-cell level (> 110,000 cells) over time. Our analysis highlights kidney proximal tubule cells as key susceptible cells to injury. Adaptive proximal tubule repair correlated with fatty acid oxidation and oxidative phosphorylation. We identify a specific maladaptive/profibrotic proximal tubule cluster after long ischemia, which expresses proinflammatory and profibrotic cytokines and myeloid cell chemotactic factors. Druggability analysis highlights pyroptosis/ferroptosis as vulnerable pathways in these profibrotic cells. Pharmacological targeting of pyroptosis/ferroptosis in vivo pushed cells towards adaptive repair and ameliorates fibrosis.

Studies largely point to evolution in GRNs of cranial progenitor cell types such as neural crest cells, as the major driver underlying adaptive cranial shapes. However, this hypothesis requires further validation, particularly within suitable models amenable to manipulation. By utilizing comparative models between related species, we can begin to disentangle complex developmental systems and identify the origin of species-specific patterning. Mammals present excellent evolutionary examples to scrutinize how these differences arise, as sister clades of eutherians and marsupials possess suitable divergence times, conserved cranial anatomies, modular evolutionary patterns, and distinct developmental heterochrony in their NCC behaviours and craniofacial patterning. In this review, I lend perspectives into the current state of mammalian craniofacial biology and discuss the importance of establishing a new marsupial model, the fat-tailed dunnart, for comparative research. Through detailed comparisons with the mouse, we can begin to decipher mammalian conserved, and species-specific processes and their contribution to craniofacial patterning and shape disparity. Recent advances in single-cell multi-omics allow high-resolution investigations into the cellular and molecular basis of key developmental processes. As such, I discuss how comparative evolutionary application of these tools can provide detailed insights into complex cellular behaviours and expression dynamics underlying adaptive craniofacial evolution.

We identify spatial biomarkers of tumors and their surrounding stroma that reinforce the heterogeneity of each tissue type. Combining pseudotime, RNA velocity-PAGA, cellular entropy, and regulon analysis in stromal cells reveals a cancer-specific rewiring of fibroblasts, where STAT1, TGF-β, and inflammatory signals induce a noncanonical WNT5A program that maintains the stromal inflammatory state. Cell-cell communication modeling suggests that tumors respond to the sudden burst of fibroblast-specific inflammatory signaling pathways by producing heat shock proteins, whose expression we validated in situ. Last, dose-dependent treatment with an HSP70 inhibitor suppresses in vitro vismodegib-resistant BCC cell growth, Hedgehog signaling, and in vivo tumor growth in a BCC mouse model, validating HSP70's essential role in tumor growth and reinforcing the critical nature of tumor microenvironment cross-talk in BCC progression."

The intracellular aggregation of hyper-phosphorylated tau and the extracellular aggregation of amyloid beta plaques form the basis of Alzheimer's disease pathology. The major hallmark of Parkinson's disease is the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, following the formation of Lewy bodies, which consists primarily of alpha-synuclein aggregates. However, the discrete mechanisms that contribute to neurodegeneration in these disorders are still poorly understood. Both neuronal loss and impaired adult neurogenesis have been reported in animal models of these disorders. Yet these findings remain subject to frequent debate due to a lack of conclusive evidence in post mortem brain tissue from human patients. While some publications provide significant findings related to axonal regeneration in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, they also highlight the limitations and obstacles to the development of neuroregenerative therapies.

There are commonality and specificity in gene expression among different cell types of brains; hence, there may also be commonality and specificity in dysregulated gene expression affected by ASD among brain cells. Moreover, as genes interact together, it is important to identify shared and cell-type-specific ASD-related gene modules for studying the cell heterogeneity of ASD. To this end, we propose integrative regularized non-negative matrix factorization (iRNMF) by imposing a new regularization based on integrative non-negative matrix factorization. Using iRNMF, we analyze gene expression data of multiple cell types of the human brain to obtain shared and cell-type-specific gene modules. Based on ASD risk genes, we identify shared and cell-type-specific ASD-associated gene modules. By analyzing these gene modules, we study the commonality and specificity among different cell types in dysregulated gene expression affected by ASD. The shared ASD-associated gene modules are mostly relevant to the functioning of synapses, while in different cell types, different kinds of gene functions may be specifically dysregulated in ASD, such as inhibitory extracellular ligand-gated ion channel activity in GABAergic interneurons and excitatory postsynaptic potential and ionotropic glutamate receptor signaling pathway in glutamatergic neurons. Our results provide new insights into the molecular mechanism and pathogenesis of ASD.

"35556144","Maturation Delay of Human GABAergic Neurogenesis in Fragile X Syndrome Pluripotent Stem Cells.","Stem Cells Transl Med","Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), the leading monogenic cause of intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder, is caused by expansion of a CGG trinucleotide repeat in the 5'-UTR of the Fragile X Mental Retardation-1 (FMR1) gene. Epigenetic silencing of FMR1 results in loss of the Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP). Although most studies to date have focused on excitatory neurons, recent evidence suggests that GABAergic inhibitory networks are also affected. To investigate human GABAergic neurogenesis, we established a method to reproducibly derive inhibitory neurons from multiple FXS and control human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) lines. Electrophysiological analyses suggested that the developing FXS neurons had a delay in the GABA functional switch, a transition in fetal development that converts the GABAA channel's function from depolarization to hyperpolarization, with profound effects on the developing brain. To investigate the cause of this delay, we analyzed 14 400 single-cell transcriptomes from FXS and control cells at 2 stages of GABAergic neurogenesis. While control and FXS cells were similar at the earlier time point, the later-stage FXS cells retained expression of neuroblast proliferation-associated genes and had lower levels of genes associated with action potential regulation, synapses, and mitochondria compared with controls. Our analysis suggests that loss of FMRP prolongs the proliferative stage of progenitors, which may result in more neurons remaining immature during the later stages of neurogenesis. This could have profound implications for homeostatic excitatory-inhibitory circuit development in FXS, and suggests a novel direction for understanding disease mechanisms that may help to guide therapeutic interventions.© The Author(s) 2022.

Understanding the trends of epigenetic ageing in the atheroma may provide insights into mechanisms of atherogenesis or identify targets for molecular therapy. We surveyed DNA methylation age in two human artery samples: a set of donor-matched, paired atherosclerotic and healthy aortic portions, and a set of carotid artery atheromas. The well-characterized pan-tissue Horvath epigenetic clock was used, together with the Weidner whole-blood-specific clock as validation. For the first time, we document dynamic DNA methylation age mosaicism of the vascular wall that is atherosclerosis-related, switches from acceleration to deceleration with chronological ageing, and is consistent in human aorta and carotid atheroma. At CpG level, the Horvath epigenetic clock showed modest differential methylation between atherosclerotic and healthy aortic portions, weak association with atheroma histological grade and no clear evidence for participation in atherosclerosis-related cellular pathways. Our data suggest caution when assigning a unidirectional DNA methylation age change to the atherosclerotic arterial wall. Also, the results support previous conclusions that epigenetic ageing reflects non-disease-specific cellular alterations."

Interestingly, male but not female offspring exhibited an enhanced response to METH-induced behavioral sensitization. Additionally, the METH-exposed group of male mice underwent a more comprehensive wave of epigenome remodeling over all genomic elements compared with unexposed groups due to drug exposure history. 104,219 DMCs (METH-SAL vs.SAL-SAL) induced by prenatal METH-exposure were positively correlated with that of postnatal METH-exposure (38,570, SAL-METH vs.SAL-SAL). Moreover, 4,983 DMCs induced by pre- and postnatal METH exposure (METH-METH vs.SAL-METH) were negatively correlated with that of postnatal METH exposure, and 371 commonly changed DMCs between the two comparison groups also showed a significantly negative correlation and 86 annotated genes functionally enriched in the pathways of neurodevelopment and addiction. Key annotated genes includedKirrel3,Lrpprc, andPeg3, implicated in neurodevelopmental processes, were down-regulated in METH-METH group mice compared with the SAL-METH group. Taken together, we render novel insights into the epigenetic correlation of drug exposure and provide evidence for epigenetic characteristics that link maternal METH exposure to the intensity of the same drug-induced behavioral sensitization in adult offspring.Copyright © 2022 Dong, Zhu, Wang, Wang, Chen, Wang, Goh and Chen."

Recently, we determined that glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonism with either mifepristone or CORT113176 (a selective GR antagonist) reduced binge-like ethanol intake in the HDID-1 mice, but not in their founder line, HS/NPT. Here, we examined whether the selection process may have altered glucocorticoid functioning by measuring (1) plasma corticosterone levels and (2) expression of the genes encoding GR (Nr3c1) and two of its chaperone proteins FKBP51 and FKBP52 (Fkbp5andFkbp4) in the brains (nucleus accumbens, NAc) of HDID-1 and HS/NPT mice. We observed no genotype differences in baseline circulating corticosterone levels. However, HDID-1 mice exhibited a greater stimulated peak corticosterone response to an IP injection (of either ethanol or saline) relative to their founder line. We further observed reduced basal expression ofFkbp4andNr3c1in the NAc of HDID-1 mice relative to HS/NPT mice. Finally, HDID-1 mice exhibited reducedFkbp5expression in the NAc relative to HS/NPT mice following an injection of 2 g/kg ethanol. Together, these data suggest that selective breeding for high BALs may have altered stress signaling in the HDID-1 mice, which may contribute to the observed selective efficacy of GR antagonism in reducing binge-like ethanol intake in HDID-1, but not HS/NPT mice. These data have important implications for the role that stress signaling plays in the genetic risk for binge drinking.Copyright © 2022 Savarese, Grigsby, Jensen, Borrego, Finn, Crabbe and Ozburn."
"35851422","Shifts in the immunoepigenomic landscape of monocytes in response to a diabetes-specific social support intervention: a pilot study among Native Hawaiian adults with diabetes.","Clin Epigenetics","Native Hawaiians are disproportionately affected by type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), a chronic metabolic, non-communicable disease characterized by hyperglycemia and systemic inflammation. Unrelenting systemic inflammation  frequently leads to a cascade of multiple comorbidities associated with DM, including cardiovascular disease, microvascular complications, and renal dysfunction. Yet few studies have examined the link between chronic inflammation at a cellular level and its relationship to standard DM therapies such as diabetes-specific lifestyle and social support education, well recognized as the cornerstone of clinical standards of diabetes care. This pilot study was initiated to explore the association of monocyte inflammation using epigenetic, immunologic, and clinical measures following a 3-month diabetes-specific social support program among high-risk Native Hawaiian adults with DM.From a sample of 16 Native Hawaiian adults with DM, monocytes enriched from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 8 individuals were randomly selected for epigenomic analysis. Using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip microarray, 1,061 differentially methylated loci (DML) were identified in monocytes of participants at baseline and 3 months following a DM-specific social support program (DM-SSP). Gene ontology analysis showed that these DML were enriched within genes involved in immune, metabolic, and cardiometabolic pathways, a subset of which were also significantly differentially expressed. Ex vivo analysis of immune function showed improvement post-DM-SSP compared with baseline, characterized by attenuated interleukin 1β and IL-6 secretion from monocytes. Altered cytokine secretion in response to the DM-SSP was significantly associated with changes in the methylation and gene expression states of immune-related genes in monocytes between intervention time points.Our pilot study provides preliminary evidence of changes to inflammatory monocyte activity, potentially driven by epigenetic modifications, 3 months following a DM-specific SSP intervention. These novel alterations in the trajectory of monocyte inflammatory states were identified at loci that regulate transcription of immune and metabolic genes in high-risk Native Hawaiians with DM, suggesting a relationship between improvements in psychosocial behaviors and shifts in the immunoepigenetic patterns following a diabetes-specific SSP. Further research is warranted to investigate how social support influences systemic inflammation via immunoepigenetic modifications in chronic inflammatory diseases such as DM.© 2022. The Author(s)."

The candidate miRs were first taken from the GEO and TCGA databases. Then, the candidate network was constructed using the high-throughput sequencing data. The expression levels of candidate targets were finally measured using Real-Time PCR in luminal A breast cancer patients undergoing aspirin (80 mg daily for three months) and non-aspirin groups during chemotherapy after surgery. The expression levels of TGFβ, IL-17, IFNγ, and IL-β proteins were measured using the ELISA technique. 5 lncRNAs, 12 miRs, and 10 genes were obtained in the bioinformatic phase. A significant expression increase of the candidate tumor suppressor lncRNAs, miRs, and genes and a substantial expression decrease of the candidate onco-lncRNAs, oncomiRs, and oncogenes were achieved after the aspirin consumption. Unlike the non-aspirin group, the expression levels of TGFβ, IL-17, IFNγ, and IL-β proteins were significantly decreased following aspirin consumption. The Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated a longer overall survival rate in the patients after aspirin consumption. Our results showed that the lncRNA-miR-mRNA network might be a significant target for aspirin; their expression changes may be a new strategy with potential efficacy for cancer therapy or prevention.© 2022.

Despite the rapidly rising incidence of autism, little is known about its aetiology, risk factors, and disease progression. There are currently neither validated biomarkers for diagnostic screening nor specific medication for autism. Over the last two decades, there have been remarkable advances in genetics, with hundreds of genes identified and validated as being associated with a high risk for autism. The convergence of neuroscience methods is becoming more widely recognized for its significance in elucidating the pathological mechanisms of autism. Efforts have been devoted to exploring the behavioural functions, key pathological mechanisms and potential treatments of autism. Here, as we highlight in this review, emerging evidence shows that signal transduction molecular events are involved in pathological processes such as transcription, translation, synaptic transmission, epigenetics and immunoinflammatory responses. This involvement has important implications for the discovery of precise molecular targets for autism. Moreover, we review recent insights into the mechanisms and clinical implications of signal transduction in autism from molecular, cellular, neural circuit, and neurobehavioural aspects. Finally, the challenges and future perspectives are discussed with regard to novel strategies predicated on the biological features of autism.© 2022. The Author(s)."

In addition to disease-specific genetic mutations and chromosomal aberrations, epigenetic alterations in individuals can also be analyzed using genomics. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD) caused by genetic and/or environmental factors. More than a thousand genes associated with ASD have been identified which are known to be involved in brain development. However, it is difficult to decode the roles of ASD-associated genes withoutin vitroandin vivovalidations, particularly in the process of brain development.

For this purpose, we discuss ASD-associated genes and their functions, as well as analytical strategies and their strengths and weaknesses in cellular and animal models from a basic research perspective.Copyright © 2022 Doi, Li, Usui and Shimada."
"35805170","Impact of Exercise and Aging on Mitochondrial Homeostasis in Skeletal Muscle: Roles of ROS and Epigenetics.","Cells","Aging causes degenerative changes such as epigenetic changes and mitochondrial dysfunction in skeletal muscle. Exercise can upregulate muscle mitochondrial homeostasis and enhance antioxidant capacity and represents an effective treatment to prevent muscle aging. Epigenetic changes such as DNA methylation, histone posttranslational modifications, and microRNA expression are involved in the regulation of exercise-induced adaptive changes in muscle mitochondria. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play an important role in signaling molecules in exercise-induced muscle mitochondrial health benefits, and strong evidence emphasizes that exercise-induced ROS can regulate gene expression via epigenetic mechanisms. The majority of mitochondrial proteins are imported into mitochondria from the cytosol, so mitochondrial homeostasis is regulated by nuclear epigenetic mechanisms. Exercise can reverse aging-induced changes in myokine expression by modulating epigenetic mechanisms. In this review, we provide an overview of the role of exercise-generated ROS in the regulation of mitochondrial homeostasis mediated by epigenetic mechanisms. In addition, the potential epigenetic mechanisms involved in exercise-induced myokine expression are reviewed."
"35736835","Stubborn Exercise Responders-Where to Next?","Sports (Basel)","There is a wide variance in the magnitude of physiological adaptations after resistance or endurance training. The incidence of ""non"" or ""poor"" responders to training has been reported to represent as high as 40% of the project's sample. However, the incidence of poor responders to training can be ameliorated with manipulation of either the training frequency, intensity, type and duration. Additionally, global non-response to cardio-respiratory fitness training is eliminated when evaluating several health measures beyond just the target variables as at least one or more measure improves. More research is required to determine if altering resistance training variables results in a more favourable response in individuals with an initial poor response to resistance training. Moreover, we recommend abandoning the term ""poor"" responders, as ultimately the magnitude of change in cardiorespiratory fitness in response to endurance training is similar in ""poor"" and ""high"" responders if the training frequency is subsequently increased. Therefore, we propose ""stubborn"" responders as a more appropriate term. Future research should focus on developing viable physiological and lifestyle screening tests that identify likely stubborn responders to conventional exercise training guidelines before the individual engages with training. Exerkines, DNA damage, metabolomic responses in blood, saliva and breath, gene sequence, gene expression and epigenetics are candidate biomarkers that warrant investigation into their relationship with trainability. Crucially, viable biomarker screening tests should show good construct validity to distinguish between different exercise loads, and possess excellent sensitivity and reliability. Furthermore ""red flag"" tests of likely poor responders to training should be practical to assess in clinical settings and be affordable and non-invasive. Early identification of stubborn responders would enable optimization of training programs from the onset of training to maintain exercise motivation and optimize the impact on training adaptations and health."

Strategies to maintain functional mitochondria during aging include training; cardiovascular exercise has been suggested as the best method, but strength training has also been identified as essential to health and healthy aging. We therefore investigated the effects of concurrent exercise training and dietary habits on epigenetic mechanisms involved in mitochondrial (mt) functions and biogenesis. We analyzed epigenetic biomarkers that directly target the key regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis,PGC-1α, and mtDNA content. Thirty-six healthy, sedentary participants completed a 12-week concurrent training program. Before and after the intervention, dried blood spot samples and data on eating habits, lifestyle, and body composition were collected. MiR-23a, miR-30e expression, and mtDNA content were analyzed using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis.PGC-1αmethylation was analyzed using bisulfite pyrosequencing. MiR-23a, miR-30e expression, andPGC-1αmethylation decreased after the intervention (p&lt; 0.05).PGC-1αmethylation increased with the consumption of red and processed meat, and mtDNA content increased with the ingestion of cruciferous vegetables (p&lt; 0.05). Our results indicate that concurrent training could improve mitochondrial biogenesis and functions by altering the epigenetic regulation. These alterations can also be detected outside of the skeletal muscle and could potentially affect athletic performance."

Subsequent in vitro experiments were performed to validate the results of bioinformatic analysis. We first identified the correlation betweenLIMA1and tumor cell functional states according to single-cell sequencing data in HNSC. The potential downstream effects of LIMA1 were explored for gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways through functional enrichment analysis of the gene sets that correlated withLIMA1in HNSC. The prognostic role of LIMA1 was assessed using the log rank test to compare difference in survival between LIMA1Highand LIMA1Lowpatients. Univariate Cox regression and multivariate Cox regression were further carried out to identify the prognostic value of LIMA1 in HNSC.LIMA1 was identified as a prognostic biomarker and is associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) progress in HNSC. In vitro silencing ofLIMA1suppressed EMT and related pathways in HNSC.LIMA1 promotes EMT and further leads to tumor invasion and metastasis. Increased expression ofLIMA1indicates poor survival, identifying it as a prognostic biomarker in HNSC.© The Author(s) 2022."

Recently, multiple reports have shown that RNF8 could be used as an important therapeutic target for cancer chemo/radiotherapy. However, the understanding of RNF8 remains limited due to the lack of its interactome reference map and comprehensive analysis of RNF8 in diverse cancers, which underscores the need to map the interactome of RNF8 via high-throughput methods.A two-way identification method based on LC-MS was designed for the identification of the RNF8 interactome with high-specificity. By in silico analysis and in vitro validation, we identified a new reference map of the RNF8 interactome network containing many new targets, such as YBX1, DNMT1, and HDCA1, new biological functions and the gene-disease associations of RNF8. Our results revealed a close relationship between RNF8 and neurodegenerative diseases or tumor-infiltrating immune cells using bulk RNA-seq and scRNA-seq datasets. As a proof of concept of our interactome map, we validated the direct binding between RNF8 and YBX1 and showed that RNF8 catalyzed the ubiquitination of YBX1. These results demonstrated that RNF8 might be a crucial regulator of YBX1.Our work provides a unique framework for researchers and clinicians who seek to better explore or understand RNF8-regulated biological functions in cancers.

Although emerging experiment-based evidence indicates an association between hepcidin and such cancers, an integrated analysis is still lacking. For this reason, in this study, we determined the underlying oncogenic functions of hepcidin in common male genitourinary system tumors, including bladder urothelial carcinoma (BLCA), kidney chromophobe (KICH), kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma (KIRP), prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD), and testicular germ cell tumors (TGCT) according to the data from The Cancer Genome Atlas. We found that hepcidin was highly expressed in kidney and testicular cancers. Meanwhile, the expression level of hepcidin was distinctly associated with the prognosis and immune cell infiltration in male patients with certain genitourinary system cancers, especially in KIRC. Elevated hepcidin levels also present as a risk factor in male genitourinary system tumors. Moreover, enrichment analyses revealed that some of the principal associated signaling pathways involving hepcidin and its related genes are identified as tumorigenesis-related. Immunofluorescence staining confirmed the conclusion of our immune infiltration analysis in KIRC tissue.

It is crucial to investigate novel diagnostic and therapeutic targets for PTC and explore more detailed molecular mechanisms in the carcinogenesis and progression of PTC. Based on the TCGA and GEO databases, FAM111B is downregulated in PTC tissues and predicts better prognosis in PTC patients. FAM111B suppresses the growth, migration, invasion and glycolysis of PTC bothin vitroandin vivo. Furthermore, estrogen inhibits FAM111B expression by DNMT3B methylation via enhancing the recruitment of DNMT3B to FAM111B promoter. DNMT3B-mediated FAM111B methylation accelerates the growth, migration, invasion and glycolysis of PTC cells. In clinical TC patient specimens, the expression of FAM111B is inversely correlated with the expressions of DNMT3B and the glycolytic gene PGK1. Besides, the expression of FAM111B is inversely correlated while DNMT3B is positively correlated with glucose uptake in PTC patients. Our work established E2/DNMT3B/FAM111B as a crucial axis in regulating the growth and progression of PTC. Suppression of DNMT3B or promotion of FAM111B will be potential promising strategies in the estrogen induced PTC.© The author(s)."

Obese individuals predispose to OLF, whereas the underlying connections between obesity phenotype and OLF pathomechanism are not fully understood. Therefore, this study aims to explore distinct obesity-related genes and their functional signatures in OLF.The transcriptome sequencing data related to OLF were downloaded from the GSE106253 in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The obesity-related differentially expressed genes (ORDEGs) in OLF were screened, and functional and pathway enrichment analysis were applied for these genes. Furthermore, protein-protein interactions (PPI), module analysis, transcription factor enrichment analysis (TFEA), and experiment validation were used to identify hub ORDEGs. The immune infiltration landscape in OLF was depicted, and correlation analysis between core gene SOCS3 and OLF-related infiltrating immune cells (OIICs) as well as 5mC/m6A modifiers in OLF was constructed.Ninety-nine ORDEGs were preliminarily identified, and functional annotations showed these genes were mainly involved in metabolism, inflammation, and immune-related biological functions and pathways. Integrative bioinformatic algorithms determined a crucial gene cluster associated with inflammatory/immune responses, such as TNF signaling pathway, JAK-STAT signaling pathway, and regulation of interferon-gamma-mediated signaling. Eight hub ORDEGs were validated, including 6 down-regulated genes (SOCS3, PPARG, ICAM-1, CCL2, MYC, and NT5E) and 2 up-regulated genes (PTGS2 and VEGFA). Furthermore, 14 differential OIICs were identified by ssGSEA and xCell, and SOCS3 was overlapped to be the core gene, which was associated with multiple immune infiltrates (dendritic cells, macrophage, and T cells) and six m6A modifiers as well as four 5mC regulators in OLF. Reduced SOCS3 and FTO expression and up-regulated DNMT1 level in OLF were validated by Western blotting.This study deciphered immune/inflammatory signatures of obesity-related gene clusters for the first time, and defined SOCS3 as one core gene. The crosstalk between 5mC/m6A methylation may be a key mediator of SOCS3 expression and immune infiltration.

Herein, we designed a case-control study to evaluate the joint effects of smoking and green tea consumption, with miR-29b andDNMT3BmRNA expression, in lung cancer development. A total of 132 lung cancer patients and 132 healthy controls were recruited to measure miR-29b andDNMT3BmRNA expression in whole blood. Results revealed that lung cancer patients had lower miR-29b expression (57.2 vs. 81.6;p= 0.02) and higherDNMT3BmRNA expression (37.2 vs. 25.8;p&lt; 0.001) than healthy controls. Compared to non-smokers with both higher miR-29b and lowerDNMT3BmRNA expression, smokers with both low miR-29b and higherDNMT3BmRNA expression had an elevated risk of lung cancer development (OR 5.12, 95% CI 2.64-9.91). Interactions of smoking with miR-29b orDNMT3BmRNA expression in lung cancer were significant. Interaction of green tea consumption with miR-29b expression andDNMT3BmRNA expression in lung cancer was also significant.

It is characterized by attacks of moderate to severe headache pain, with associated symptoms. Receptor activity modifying protein (RAMP1) is part of the Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP) receptor, a pharmacological target for migraine. Epigenetic processes, such as DNA methylation, play a role in clinical presentation of various diseases. DNA methylation occurs mostly in the gene promoter and can control gene expression. We investigated the methylation state of theRAMP1promoter in 104 female blood DNA samples: 54 migraineurs and 50 controls. We treated DNA with sodium bisulfite and performed PCR, Sanger Sequencing, and Epigenetic Sequencing Methylation (ESME) software analysis. We identified 51 CpG dinucleotides, and 5 showed methylation variability. Migraineurs had a higher number of individuals with all five CpG methylated when compared to controls (26% vs. 16%), although non-significant (p= 0.216). We also found that CpG -284 bp, related to the transcription start site (TSS), showed higher methylation levels in cases (p= 0.011). This CpG may potentially play a role in migraine, affectingRAMP1transcription or receptor malfunctioning and/or altered CGRP binding. We hope to confirm this finding in a larger cohort and establish an epigenetic biomarker to predict female migraine risk."
"35580989","Expression regulation of genes is linked to their CpG density distributions around transcription start sites.","Life Sci Alliance","The CpG dinucleotide and its methylation behaviors play vital roles in gene regulation. Previous studies have divided genes into several categories based on the CpG intensity around transcription starting sites and found that housekeeping genes tend to possess high CpG density, whereas tissue-specific genes are generally characterized by low CpG density. In this study, we investigated how the CpG density distribution of a gene affects its transcription and regulation pattern. Based on the CpG density distribution around transcription starting site, by means of a semi-supervised neural network we designed, which took data augmentation into account, we divided the human genes into three categories, and genes within each cluster shared similar CpG density distribution. Not only sequence properties, these different clusters exhibited distinctly different structural features, regulatory mechanisms, correlation patterns between the expression level and CpG/TpG density, and expression and epigenetic mark variations during tumorigenesis. For instance, the activation of cluster 3 genes relies more on 3D genome reorganization, compared with cluster 1 and 2 genes, whereas cluster 2 genes showed the strongest correlation between gene expression and H3K27me3. Genes exhibiting uncoupled correlation between gene regulation and histone modifications are mainly in cluster 3. These results emphasized that the usage of epigenetic marks in gene regulation is partially rooted in the sequence property of genes such as their CpG density distribution and explained to some extent why the relation between epigenetic marks and gene expression is controversial.© 2022 Tian et al."

The Kaplan-Meier plotter and GEPIA2 database were used to analyze the correlation betweenGABRPexpression, overall survival, and disease-free survival in pancreatic cancer patients. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed with the Linked Omics database to explore the molecular mechanisms ofGABRPin pancreatic cancer. And the correlation betweenGABRPexpression and immune infiltration was explored using the TIMER database, CIBERSORT database and ESTIMATE algorithm.GABRPmRNA was significantly overexpressed in TCGA-PAAD cohorts (P<0.0001) and enhancedGABRPexpression predicted poorer overall survival according to Kaplan-Meier plotter database (P=0.0024) and GEPIA2 (P=0.038). Hypomethylation of promoter (P<0.01) and the regulation of hsa-miR-3655 may contribute to the overexpression ofGABRPin pancreatic cancer. GSEA analysis revealed thatGABRPplayed an important role in the immune response.GABRPexpression was also correlated with immune infiltration and immune cell markers. HigherGABRPexpression was significantly associated with greater infiltration of immune cells and stromal cells into pancreatic cancer microenvironments as well as higher expression of six important immune check point genes includingPDCD1(P<0.05),CD274(P<0.05),CTLA4(P<0.01),PDCD1LG2(P<0.01),TIGHT(P<0.01) andTIM3(P<0.01).GABRPis a potential prognostic biomarker and is correlated with immune infiltration and tumor microenvironment in pancreatic cancer.

"35857195","Angiogenesis in adipose tissue and obesity.","Angiogenesis","While most tissues exhibit their greatest growth during development, adipose tissue is capable of additional massive expansion in adults. Adipose tissue expandability is advantageous when temporarily storing fuel for use during fasting, but becomes pathological upon continuous food intake, leading to obesity and its many comorbidities. The dense vasculature of adipose tissue provides necessary oxygen and nutrients, and supports delivery of fuel to and from adipocytes under fed or fasting conditions. Moreover, the vasculature of adipose tissue comprises a major niche for multipotent progenitor cells, which give rise to new adipocytes and are necessary for tissue repair. Given the multiple, pivotal roles of the adipose tissue vasculature, impairments in angiogenic capacity may underlie obesity-associated diseases such as diabetes and cardiometabolic disease. Exciting new studies on the single-cell and single-nuclei composition of adipose tissues in mouse and humans are providing new insights into mechanisms of adipose tissue angiogenesis. Moreover, new modes of intercellular communication involving micro vesicle and exosome transfer of proteins, nucleic acids and organelles are also being recognized to play key roles. This review focuses on new insights on the cellular and signaling mechanisms underlying adipose tissue angiogenesis, and on their impact on obesity and its pathophysiological consequences.© 2022.

"35804409","Multi-omic characterization of pediatric ARDS via nasal brushings.","Respir Res","While nasal brushing transcriptomics can identify disease subtypes in chronic pulmonary diseases, it is unknown whether this is true in pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome (PARDS).Determine whether nasal transcriptomics and methylomics can identify clinically meaningful PARDS subgroups that reflect important pathobiological processes.Nasal brushings and serum were collected on days 1, 3, 7, and 14 from control and PARDS subjects from two centers. PARDS duration was the primary endpoint.Twenty-four control and 39 PARDS subjects were enrolled. Two nasal methylation patterns were identified. Compared to Methyl Subgroup 1, Subgroup 2 had hypomethylation of inflammatory genes and was enriched for immunocompromised subjects. Four transcriptomic patterns were identified with temporal patterns indicating injury, repair, and regeneration. Over time, both inflammatory (Subgroup B) and cell injury (Subgroup D) patterns transitioned to repair (Subgroup A) and eventually homeostasis (Subgroup C). When control specimens were included, they were largely Subgroup C. In comparison with 17 serum biomarkers, the nasal transcriptome was more predictive of prolonged PARDS. Subjects with initial Transcriptomic Subgroup B or D assignment had median PARDS duration of 8 days compared to 2 in A or C (p = 0.02). For predicting PARDS duration ≥ 3 days, nasal transcriptomics was more sensitive and serum biomarkers more specific.PARDS nasal transcriptome may reflect distal lung injury, repair, and regeneration. A combined nasal PCR and serum biomarker assay could be useful for predictive and diagnostic enrichment. Trial registration Clinicaltrials.gov NCT03539783 May 29, 2018.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35627266","Single-Cell RNA-Seq Analysis Reveals Lung Epithelial Cell Type-Specific Responses to HDM and Regulation by Tet1.","Genes (Basel)","Tet1 protects against house dust mite (HDM)-induced lung inflammation in mice and alters the lung methylome and transcriptome. In order to explore the role of Tet1 in individual lung epithelial cell types in HDM-induced inflammation, we established a model of HDM-induced lung inflammation in Tet1 knockout and littermate wild-type mice, then studied EpCAM+lung epithelial cells using single-cell RNA-seq analysis. We identified eight EpCAM+lung epithelial cell types, among which AT2 cells were the most abundant. HDM challenge altered the relative abundance of epithelial cell types and resulted in cell type-specific transcriptomic changes. Bulk and cell type-specific analysis also showed that loss of Tet1 led to the altered expression of genes linked to augmented HDM-induced lung inflammation, including alarms, detoxification enzymes, oxidative stress response genes, and tissue repair genes. The transcriptomic regulation was accompanied by alterations in TF activities. Trajectory analysis supports that HDM may enhance the differentiation of AP and BAS cells into AT2 cells, independent of Tet1. Collectively, our data showed that lung epithelial cells had common and unique transcriptomic signatures of allergic lung inflammation. Tet1 deletion altered transcriptomic networks in various lung epithelial cells, which may promote allergen-induced lung inflammation."

The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the prognostic potential of hematological inflammatory markers in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients. The clinical data of 99 patients with lower-grade gliomas and 88 patients with GBMs were retrospectively analyzed. The optimal cutoff values for peripheral markers were determined by X-tile. Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazard regression analyses were performed to identify markers with prognostic significance. Several scoring systems were constructed by combining these prognostic markers. The predictive accuracies of nomograms incorporating these scoring systems were evaluated by Harrell's concordance index and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. GBM patients exhibited higher neutrophil counts (p=0.001), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (p<0.001), and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) (p=0.001), as well as lower lymphocyte counts (p=0.023), lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR) (p=0.015), and albumin-to-globulin ratio (AGR) (p=0.003) than those with lower-grade gliomas. Multivariate analysis indicated that a high NLR (> 2.0) (Hazard ratio[HR]=2.519, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.220-5.204, p=0.013), low LMR (< 2.3) (HR=2.268, 95%CI: 1.172-4.386, p=0.015), or low AGR (< 1.7) (HR=2.924, 95%CI: 1.389-6.135, p=0.005) were associated with poor overall survival in GBM patients. The scoring systems of AGR-NLR, AGR-LMR, and LMR-NLR were associated with GBM survival. The nomogram integrating AGR-NLR score had the best efficacy in predicting GBM survival (c-index=0.874). Pretreatment scores of AGR-NLR, AGR-LMR, and LMR-NLR may serve as prognostic factors for GBM patients, and a nomogram integrating AGR-NLR may provide a reliable tool to facilitate personalized preoperative evaluations.Copyright © 2022 Yang, Lan, Wang, Huang, Li, Li, Li, Li, Wang and Li."
"35684498","Involvement of Phytochemical-Encapsulated Nanoparticles' Interaction with Cellular Signalling in the Amelioration of Benign and Malignant Brain Tumours.","Molecules","Brain tumours have unresolved challenges that include delay prognosis and lower patient survival rate. The increased understanding of the molecular pathways underlying cancer progression has aided in developing various anticancer medications. Brain cancer is the most malignant and invasive type of cancer, with several subtypes. According to the WHO, they are classified as ependymal tumours, chordomas, gangliocytomas, medulloblastomas, oligodendroglial tumours, diffuse astrocytomas, and other astrocytic tumours on the basis of their heterogeneity and molecular mechanisms. The present study is based on the most recent research trends, emphasising glioblastoma cells classified as astrocytoma. Brain cancer treatment is hindered by the failure of drugs to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which is highly impregnableto foreign molecule entry. Moreover, currently available medications frequently fail to cross the BBB, whereas chemotherapy and radiotherapy are too expensive to be afforded by an average incomeperson and have many associated side effects. When compared to our current understanding of molecularly targeted chemotherapeutic agents, it appears that investigating the efficacy of specific phytochemicals in cancer treatment may be beneficial. Plants and their derivatives are game changers because they are efficacious, affordable, environmentally friendly, faster, and less toxic for the treatment of benign and malignant tumours. Over the past few years, nanotechnology has made a steady progress in diagnosing and treating cancers, particularly brain tumours. This article discusses the effects of phytochemicals encapsulated in nanoparticles on molecular targets in brain tumours, along with their limitations and potential challenges."

Therefore, we further investigated this correlation through meta-analysis.We searched the PubMed, Metstr, and Cochrane databases in March 2022 for published literature related to high pre-treatment and pre-operative NLR and low survival in patients with GBM. The literature was rigorously searched according to inclusion and exclusion criteria to calculate the overall hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) corresponding to a high NLR using a random effects model.The total HR for the pre-treatment and pre-operative NLR was 1.46 (95% CI: 1.17-1.75,p= 0.000, I2= 76.5%), indicating a significant association between a high pre-treatment and pre-operative NLR, and low overall survival in patients with GBM. Sub-group analysis was performed because of the high heterogeneity. The results for the sub-group with a cut-off value of 4 showed an HR of 1.39 (95% CI: 1.12-1.65,p= 0.000, I2= 22.2%), with significantly low heterogeneity, whereas those for the sub-group without a cut-off value of 4 showed an HR of 1.45 (95% CI: 1.01-1.89,p= 0.000, I2= 83.3%).The results of this study demonstrate that a high pre-treatment and pre-operative NLR suggests low survival in patients with GBM based on data from a large sample. Furthermore, the meta-regression analysis results indicate that underlying data, such as age and extent of surgical resection, lead to a high degree of heterogeneity, providing a theoretical basis for further research."

With two well-developed aging measures (i.e., physiological dysregulation [PD] and frailty index [FI]), this study aimed to evaluate the relative contributions of life course circumstances (e.g., childhood and adulthood socioeconomic status) to variance in aging.We assembled data for 6224 middle-aged and older adults in China from the 2014 life course survey (June to December 2014), the 2015 biomarker collection (July 2015 to January 2016), and the 2015 main survey (July 2015 to January 2016) of the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study. Two aging measures (PD and FI) were calculated, with a higher value indicating more accelerated aging. Life course circumstances included childhood (i.e., socioeconomic status, war, health, trauma, relationship, and parents' health) and adulthood circumstances (i.e., socioeconomic status, adversity, and social support), demographics, and behaviours. The Shapley value decomposition, hierarchical clustering, and general linear regression models were performed.The Shapley value decomposition revealed that all included life course circumstances accounted for about 6·3% and 29·7% of variance in PD and FI, respectively. We identified six subpopulations who shared similar patterns in terms of childhood and adulthood circumstances. The most disadvantaged subpopulation (i.e., subpopulation 6 [more childhood trauma and adulthood adversity]) consistently exhibited accelerated aging indicated by the two aging measures. Relative to the most advantaged subpopulation (i.e., subpopulation 1 [less childhood trauma and adulthood adversity]), PD and FI in the most disadvantaged subpopulation were increased by an average of 0·14 (i.e., coefficient, by one-standard deviation, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0·06-0·21;p < 0·0001) and 0·10 (by one-point, 95% CI 0·09-0·11;p < 0·0001), respectively.Our findings highlight the different contributions of life course circumstances to phenotypic and functional aging.

"35721675","Data dimensionality reduction technique for clustering problem of metabolomics data.","Heliyon","In metabolomics studies, independent analyses or replicating the metabolite concentration measurements are often performed to anticipate errors. On the other hand, the size of the dataset is increasing. For clustering purposes, obtaining representative information chemically from independent analyses is needed. The objective of this study is to develop a data reduction method such that a dataset that represents chemical information is obtained. Overall a proper data reduction method would simplify the clustering of metabolite data. We propose the modified Weiszfeld algorithm (MWA) to reduce independent analyses. To obtain comprehensive results, we compare MWA with some other well-known reduction methods, including PCA, CMDS, LE, and LLE. Then reduced datasets are clustered using the fuzzy c-means (FCM) algorithm with the Tang Sun Sun (TSS) index and silhouette index as the cluster validity indices. The results show that MWA, together with PCA, present the optimal number of clusters, namely four clusters. This result aligns with the optimal number of clusters before dimensionality reduction. The present results show that MWA is robust to perform dimensionality reduction of independent analyses while maintaining chemical information on the reduced dataset. Therefore, we recommend the reliability of MWA as one of the chemometric techniques, and the present finding has enriched chemometric techniques in metabolomics studies.© 2022 The Author(s)."

BDNF and VEGF levels are generally decreased regionally in the brains of MDD subjects and in preclinical animal models of depression, changes that are associated with neuronal atrophy and reduced neurogenesis, and are reversed by conventional monoaminergic and novel ketamine-like antidepressants. Downstream of neurotrophins and their receptors, VGF was identified as a nerve growth factor (NGF)- and BDNF-inducible secreted protein and neuropeptide precursor that is produced and trafficked throughout the CNS, where its expression is greatly influenced by neuronal activity and exercise, and where several VGF-derived peptides modulate neuronal activity, function, proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Moreover, levels of VGF are reduced in the CSF of AD subjects, where it has been repetitively identified as a disease biomarker, and in the hippocampi of subjects with MDD, suggesting possible shared mechanisms by which reduced levels of VGF and other proteins that are similarly regulated by neurotrophin signaling pathways contribute to and potentially drive the pathogenesis and progression of co-morbid neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders, particularly MDD and AD, opening possible therapeutic windows.Copyright © 2022 Joshi and Salton."

However, to date, no study has shown their relation to Parkinson disease's phenotype. To explore the relevance of embryonic somatic mutations in sporadic Parkinson disease, we performed whole-exome sequencing in blood and four brain regions of ten patients. We identified 59 candidate somatic single nucleotide variants (sSNVs) through sensitive calling and a careful filtering strategy (COSMOS). We validated 27 of them with amplicon-based ultra-deep sequencing, with a 70% validation rate for the highest-confidence variants. The identified sSNVs are in genes with synaptic functions that are co-expressed with genes previously associated with Parkinson disease. Most of the sSNVs were only called in blood but were also found in the brain tissues with ultra-deep amplicon sequencing, demonstrating the strength of multi-tissue sampling designs.Copyright © 2022 Lobon, Solís-Moruno, Juan, Muhaisen, Abascal, Esteller-Cucala, García-Pérez, Martí, Tolosa, Ávila, Rahbari, Marques-Bonet, Casals and Soriano."

The wiring, morphology, survival, and death of each neuron are controlled by genes that encode intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Determining the function of these genes at a high spatiotemporal resolution is a critical step toward understanding brain development and function. Moreover, an increasing number of somatic mutations are being discovered in many brain disorders. However, neurons are embedded in complex networks, making it difficult to distinguish cell-autonomous from non-cell-autonomous function of any given gene in the brain. Here, I describe MADM (mosaic analysis with double markers), a genetic method that allows for labeling and manipulating gene function at the single-cell level within the mouse brain.

In this study, we employed CRISPR-Cas9-engineered technology to investigate the effects of a rare mutation (rs144662445) in the A kinase anchoring protein 9 (AKAP9) gene, which is associated with AD in African Americans (AA), on tau pathology and the tau interactome in SH-SY5Y P301L neuron-like cells. The mutation significantly increased the level of phosphorylated tau, specifically at the site Ser396/Ser404. Moreover, analyses of the tau interactome measured by affinity purification-mass spectrometry revealed that differentially expressed tau-interacting proteins in AKAP9 mutant cells were associated with RNA translation, RNA localization and oxidative activity, recapitulating the tau interactome signature previously reported with human AD brain samples. Importantly, these results were further validated by functional studies showing a significant reduction in protein synthesis activity and excessive oxidative stress in AKAP9 mutant compared with wild type cells in a tau-dependent manner, which are mirrored with pathological phenotype frequently seen in AD. Our results demonstrated specific effects of rs14462445 on mis-processing of tau and suggest a potential role of AKAP9 in AD pathogenesis.© 2022 The Authors.

Idiopathic scoliosis may run in families and the purpose of this systematic review was to describe the degree of heritability.We searched Medline, Web of Science and EMBASE for family and twin studies reporting heritability estimates for idiopathic scoliosis, or studies from which heritability estimates could be calculated. Reference lists were screened for additional papers. We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. The protocol was registered at PROSPERO (registration number: CRD42022307329).The literature search identified 1134 reports. After full-text screening, nine eligible reports were included for data extraction. Seven were twin studies containing between 5 and 526 pairs, and two were family studies with 1149 and 2732 individuals, respectively. Quality was 'good' in four studies and 'fair' in five studies. In general, studies with radiograph-confirmed diagnosis reported higher heritability estimates than studies with self-reported diagnosis. Population-based twin studies reported lower heritability estimates than clinic-based twin studies. Family-based studies reported higher heritability estimates than twin studies. Pairwise concordance for scoliosis ranged from 0.11 to 1.00 in monozygotic twins and from 0 to 1.0 in dizygotic twins. A meta-analysis of three studies resulted in a narrow sense heritability estimate of 0.57 (95% CI: 0.29-0.86).Twin and family studies indicate a hereditary component in idiopathic scoliosis, but study heterogeneity is large, and the degree of the heritability is uncertain. Nevertheless, known genetic variants associated with idiopathic scoliosis can still only explain a minor part of heritability."
"35571679","Improving polygenic prediction with genetically inferred ancestry.","HGG Adv","Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have demonstrated that most common diseases have a strong genetic component from many genetic variants each with a small effect size. GWAS summary statistics have allowed the construction of polygenic scores (PGSs) estimating part of the individual risk for common diseases. Here, we propose to improve PGS-based risk estimation by incorporating genetic ancestry derived from genome-wide genotyping data. Our method involves three cohorts: a base (or discovery) for association studies, a target for phenotype/risk prediction, and a map for ancestry mapping; successively, (1) it generates for each individual in the base and target cohorts a set of principal components based on the map cohort-called mapped PCs, (2) it associates in the base cohort the phenotype with the mapped-PCs, and (3) it uses the mapped PCs in the target cohort to generate a phenotypic predictor called the ancestry score. We evaluated the ancestry score by comparing a predictive model using a PGS with one combining a PGS and an ancestry score. First, we performed simulations and found that the ancestry score has a greater impact on traits that correlate with ancestry-specific variants. Second, we showed, using UK Biobank data, that the ancestry score improves genetic prediction for our nine phenotypes to very different degrees. Third, we performed simulations and found that the more heterogeneous the base and target cohorts, the more beneficial the ancestry score is. Finally, we validated our approach under realistic conditions with UK Biobank as the base cohort and Swiss individuals from the CoLaus|PsyCoLaus study as the target cohort.© 2022 The Authors."

However, less is known about health behaviours, ageing phenotypes and metabolic processes that lead to elevated cf-DNA levels. We sought to analyse the relationship of circulating cf-DNA level to age, sex, smoking, physical activity, vegetable consumption, ageing phenotypes (physical functioning, the number of diseases, frailty) and an extensive panel of biomarkers including blood and urine metabolites and inflammatory markers in three human cohorts (N = 5385; 17-82 years). The relationships were assessed using correlation statistics, and linear and penalised regressions (the Lasso), also stratified by sex.cf-DNA levels were significantly higher in men than in women, and especially in middle-aged men and women who smoke, and in older more frail individuals. Correlation statistics of biomarker data showed that cf-DNA level was higher with elevated inflammation (C-reactive protein, interleukin-6), and higher levels of homocysteine, and proportion of red blood cells and lower levels of ascorbic acid. Inflammation (C-reactive protein, glycoprotein acetylation), amino acids (isoleucine, leucine, tyrosine), and ketogenesis (3-hydroxybutyrate) were included in the cf-DNA level-related biomarker profiles in at least two of the cohorts.In conclusion, circulating cf-DNA level is different by sex, and related to health behaviour, health decline and metabolic processes common in health and disease.

Repair systems can restore DNA integrity. Depending on the duration or intensity of stress signals, cells may utilize various survival and adaptive mechanisms. ROS levels are kept in check through redundant detoxification processes controlled largely by antioxidant systems. This review covers and expands on the mechanisms available to cigarette smoke-exposed cancer cells for restoring the redox balance. These include multiple layers of transcriptional control, each of which is posited to be activated upon reaching a particular stress threshold, among them theNRF2pathway, theAP-1andNF-kBpathways, and, finally,TP53, which triggers apoptosis if extreme toxicity is reached. The review also discusses long noncoding RNAs, which have been implicated recently in regulating oxidative stress-with roles in ROS detoxification, the inflammatory response, oxidative stress-induced apoptosis, and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Lastly, the emerging roles of tunneling nanotubes in providing additional mechanisms for metabolic rescue and the regulation of redox imbalance are considered, further highlighting the expanded redox reset arsenal available to cells."

Type 2 diabetes, obesity, hypertension, and coronary heart disease are associated with increased incidence of diastolic dysfunction. The genetic drivers of G1DD are not defined. Methods and Results We curated genotyped European ancestry G1DD cases (n=668) and controls with normal diastolic function (n=1772) from Vanderbilt's biobank. G1DD status was explored through (1) an additive model genome-wide association study, (2) shared polygenic risk through logistic regression, and (3) instrumental variable analysis using 2-sample Mendelian randomization (the inverse-variance weighted method, Mendelian randomization-Egger, and median) to determine potential modifiable risk factors. There were no common single nucleotide polymorphisms significantly associated with G1DD status. A polygenic risk score for BMI was significantly associated with increased G1DD risk (odds ratio [OR], 1.20 for 1-SD increase in BMI [95% CI, 1.08-1.32];P=0.0003). The association was confirmed by the inverse-variance weighted method (OR, 1.89 [95% CI, 1.37-2.61]). Among the candidate mediators for BMI, only fasting glucose was significantly associated with G1DD status by the inverse-variance weighted method (OR, 4.14 for 1-SD increase in fasting glucose [95% CI, 1.55-11.02];P=0.005). Multivariable Mendelian randomization showed a modest attenuation of the BMI association (OR, 1.84 [95% CI, 1.35-2.52]) when adjusting for fasting glucose. Conclusions These data suggest that a genetic predisposition to elevated BMI increases the risk for G1DD. Part of this effect may be mediated through altered glucose homeostasis."

Studying individuals who are resilient to the cognitive consequences of Alzheimer's disease neuropathology may uncover novel therapeutic targets to treat Alzheimer's disease. It is well established that there are sex differences in response to Alzheimer's disease pathology, and growing evidence suggests that genetic factors may contribute to these differences. Taken together, we sought to elucidate sex-specific genetic drivers of resilience. We extended our recent large scale genomic analysis of resilience in which we harmonized cognitive data across four cohorts of cognitive ageing, in vivo amyloid PET across two cohorts, and autopsy measures of amyloid neuritic plaque burden across two cohorts. These data were leveraged to build robust, continuous resilience phenotypes. With these phenotypes, we performed sex-stratified [n (males) = 2093, n (females) = 2931] and sex-interaction [n (both sexes) = 5024] genome-wide association studies (GWAS), gene and pathway-based tests, and genetic correlation analyses to clarify the variants, genes and molecular pathways that relate to resilience in a sex-specific manner. Estimated among cognitively normal individuals of both sexes, resilience was 20-25% heritable, and when estimated in either sex among cognitively normal individuals, resilience was 15-44% heritable. In our GWAS, we identified a female-specific locus on chromosome 10 [rs827389, β (females) = 0.08, P (females) = 5.76 × 10-09, β (males) = -0.01, P(males) = 0.70, β (interaction) = 0.09, P (interaction) = 1.01 × 10-04] in which the minor allele was associated with higher resilience scores among females. This locus is located within chromatin loops that interact with promoters of genes involved in RNA processing, including GATA3. Finally, our genetic correlation analyses revealed shared genetic architecture between resilience phenotypes and other complex traits, including a female-specific association with frontotemporal dementia and male-specific associations with heart rate variability traits. We also observed opposing associations between sexes for multiple sclerosis, such that more resilient females had a lower genetic susceptibility to multiple sclerosis, and more resilient males had a higher genetic susceptibility to multiple sclerosis. Overall, we identified sex differences in the genetic architecture of resilience, identified a female-specific resilience locus and highlighted numerous sex-specific molecular pathways that may underly resilience to Alzheimer's disease pathology. This study illustrates the need to conduct sex-aware genomic analyses to identify novel targets that are unidentified in sex-agnostic models. Our findings support the theory that the most successful treatment for an individual with Alzheimer's disease may be personalized based on their biological sex and genetic context.© The Author(s) 2022.

"35886381","Assessment of the Feasibility of a Future Integrated Larger-Scale Epidemiological Study to Evaluate Health Risks of Air Pollution Episodes in Children.","Int J Environ Res Public Health","Air pollution exposure can lead to exacerbation of respiratory disorders in children. Using sensitive biomarkers helps to assess the impact of air pollution on children's respiratory health and combining protein, genetic and epigenetic biomarkers gives insights on their interrelatedness. Most studies do not contain such an integrated approach and investigate these biomarkers individually in blood, although its collection in children is challenging. Our study aimed at assessing the feasibility of conducting future integrated larger-scale studies evaluating respiratory health risks of air pollution episodes in children, based on a qualitative analysis of the technical and logistic aspects of a small-scale field study involving 42 children. This included the preparation, collection and storage of non-invasive samples (urine, saliva), the measurement of general and respiratory health parameters and the measurement of specific biomarkers (genetic, protein, epigenetic) of respiratory health and air pollution exposure. Bottlenecks were identified and modifications were proposed to expand this integrated study to a higher number of children, time points and locations. This would allow for non-invasive assessment of the impact of air pollution exposure on the respiratory health of children in future larger-scale studies, which is critical for the development of policies or measures at the population level."
"35902864","Multiplex Epstein-Barr virus BALF2 genotyping detects high-risk variants in plasma for population screening of nasopharyngeal carcinoma.","Mol Cancer","Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)-associated nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) exhibits unusual geographic restriction despite ubiquitous lifelong infection. Screening programs can detect most NPC cases at an early stage, but existing EBV diagnostics are limited by false positives and low positive predictive value (PPV), leading to excess screening endoscopies, MRIs, and repeated testing. Recent EBV genome-wide association studies (GWAS) suggest that EBV BALF2 variants account for more than 80% of attributable NPC risk. We therefore hypothesized that high-risk BALF2 variants could be readily detected in plasma for once-lifetime screening triage.We designed and validated a multiplex genotyping assay to detect EBV BALF2 polymorphisms in human plasma. Targeted next-generation sequencing was used to validate this assay, conduct association studies with clinical phenotype, and longitudinally genotype plasma to assess within-host haplotype stability. We examined the association between NPC and BALF2 haplotypes in a large non-endemic population and three prior EBV GWAS. Finally, we estimated NPC mortality reduction, resource utilization, and cost-effectiveness of BALF2 variant-informed screening using a previously-validated cohort model.Following analytical validation, the BALF2 genotyping assay had 99.3% concordance with sequencing in a cohort of 24 NPC cases and 155 non-NPC controls. BALF2 haplotype was highly associated with NPC in this non-endemic population (I613V: odds ratio [OR] 7.9; V317M: OR 178.8). No other candidate BALF2 polymorphisms were significantly associated with NPC or hematologic disorders. Longitudinal genotyping revealed 97.8% within-host haplotype concordance, indicative of lifelong latent infection. In a meta-analysis of 755 NPC cases and 981 non-NPC controls, BALF2 I613V and V317M were significantly associated with NPC in both endemic and non-endemic populations. Modeled variant-informed screening strategies achieved a 46% relative increase in PPV with 7% decrease in effective screening sensitivity, thereby averting nearly half of screening endoscopies/MRIs among endemic populations in east/southeast Asia.EBV BALF2 haplotypes are temporally stable within hosts and can be readily detected in plasma via an inexpensive multiplex genotyping assay that offers near-perfect sequencing concordance. In endemic and non-endemic populations, I613V and V317M were highly associated with NPC and could be leveraged to develop variant-informed screening programs that mitigate false positives with small reductions in screening sensitivity.© 2022.

"35763069","The roles of DNA methylation on the promotor of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) gene and the genome in patients with EBV-associated diseases.","Appl Microbiol Biotechnol","Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is an oncogenic virus that is closely associated with several malignant and lymphoproliferative diseases. Studies have shown that the typical characteristic of EBV-associated diseases is aberrant methylation of viral DNA and the host genome. EBV gene methylation helps EBV escape from immune monitoring and persist in host cells. EBV controls viral gene promoter methylation by hijacking host epigenetic machinery to regulate the expression of viral genes. EBV proteins also interact with host epigenetic regulatory factors to mediate the methylation of the host's important tumour suppressor gene promoters, thereby participating in the occurrence of tumorigenesis. Since epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation, are reversible in nature, drugs that target DNA methylation can be developed for epigenetic therapy against EBV-associated tumours. Various methylation modes in the host and EBV genomes may also be of diagnostic and prognostic value. This review summarizes the regulatory roles of DNA methylation on the promotor of EBV gene and host genome in EBV-associated diseases, proposes the application prospect of DNA methylation in early clinical diagnosis and treatment, and provides insight into methylation-based strategies against EBV-associated diseases. KEY POINTS: • Methylation of both the host and EBV genomes plays an important role in EBV-associated diseases. • The functions of methylation of the host and EBV genomes in the occurrence and development of EBV-associated diseases are diverse. • Methylation may be a therapeutic target or biomarker in EBV-associated diseases.© 2022.

Therefore, learning latent representations (bin-specific embeddings) of sparse single-cell Hi-C matrices would provide us with a novel way of mining valuable information hidden in the limited number of single-cell Hi-C contacts. We present scHiCEmbed, an unsupervised computational method for learning bin-specific embeddings of single-cell Hi-C data, and the computational system is applied to the tasks of 3D structure reconstruction of whole genomes and detection of topologically associating domains (TAD). The only input of scHiCEmbed is a raw or scHiCluster-imputed single-cell Hi-C matrix. The main process of scHiCEmbed is to embed each node/bin in a higher dimensional space using graph auto-encoders. The learned n-by-3 bin-specific embedding/latent matrix is considered the final reconstructed 3D genome structure. For TAD detection, we use constrained hierarchical clustering on the latent matrix to classify bins:S_Dbwis used to determine the optimal number of clusters, and each cluster is considered as one potential TAD. Our reconstructed 3D structures for individual chromatins at different cell stages reveal the expanding process of chromatins during the cell cycle. We observe that the TADs called from single-cell Hi-C data are not shared across individual cells and that the TAD boundaries called from raw or imputed single-cell Hi-C are significantly different from those called from bulk Hi-C, confirming the cell-to-cell variability in terms of TAD definitions.

We present single-cell gene associating domain (scGAD) scores as a dimension reduction and exploratory analysis tool for scHi-C data. scGAD enables summarization at the gene unit while accounting for inherent gene-level genomic biases. Low-dimensional projections with scGAD capture clustering of cells based on their 3D structures. Significant chromatin interactions within and between cell types can be identified with scGAD.

The aims of the study were to assess the association of the Mets with TyG index and TyG-related parameters in an urban Chinese population.The data were collected in 1992 and then again in 2007 from the same group of 590 individuals (363 males and 227 females) without Mets in 1992. The fasting lipid profile and blood glucose were measured. TyG index and related parameters were calculated, and Mets defined according to the harmonized criteria. The area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic curves was used to evaluate TyG index and related parameters for their diagnostic ability to identify people with Mets. Odd ratios (OR) for Mets prediction were calculated using stepwise logistic regression analyses.The incidence of Mets was 18.64% over the 15-year follow-up period.During 15 years' follow-up, TyG-waist to height ratio (TyG-WHtR) shows the largest AUC for Mets detection (0.686) followed by TyG-waist circumference (TyG-WC) (0.660), TyG-waist-to-hip ratio (TyG-WHpR) (0.564), and TyG index (0.556) in all participants. Gender analysis revealed that TyG-WHtR and TyG-WC have the largest AUC in both genders. TyG-WHtR significantly predicted Mets in all participants, with an unadjusted odds ratio of 5.63 (95% CI 3.23-9.83 P < 0.001). Associations remained significant after adjustment for smoking, drinking, physical exercise and components of Mets.TyG-WHtR might be a strong and independent predictor for Mets in all participants in an urban Chinese population.

However, whether age groups or women and men respond differently to lifestyle interventions is under debate. We aimed to examine age- and sex-specific effects of a low-energy diet (LED) followed by a long-term lifestyle intervention on body weight, body composition and cardiometabolic health markers in adults with prediabetes (i.e. impaired fasting glucose and/or impaired glucose tolerance).This observational study used longitudinal data from 2223 overweight participants with prediabetes in the multicentre diabetes prevention study PREVIEW. The participants underwent a LED-induced rapid weight loss (WL) period followed by a 3 year lifestyle-based weight maintenance (WM) intervention. Changes in outcomes of interest in prespecified age (younger: 25-45 years; middle-aged: 46-54 years; older: 55-70 years) or sex (women and men) groups were compared.In total, 783 younger, 319 middle-aged and 1121 older adults and 1503 women and 720 men were included in the analysis. In the available case and complete case analyses, multivariable-adjusted linear mixed models showed that younger and older adults had similar weight loss after the LED, whereas older adults had greater sustained weight loss after the WM intervention (adjusted difference for older vs younger adults -1.25% [95% CI -1.92, -0.58], p<0.001). After the WM intervention, older adults lost more fat-free mass and bone mass and had smaller improvements in 2 h plasma glucose (adjusted difference for older vs younger adults 0.65 mmol/l [95% CI 0.50, 0.80], p<0.001) and systolic blood pressure (adjusted difference for older vs younger adults 2.57 mmHg [95% CI 1.37, 3.77], p<0.001) than younger adults. Older adults had smaller decreases in fasting and 2 h glucose, HbA1cand systolic blood pressure after the WM intervention than middle-aged adults. In the complete case analysis, the above-mentioned differences between middle-aged and older adults disappeared, but the direction of the effect size did not change. After the WL period, compared with men, women had less weight loss (adjusted difference for women vs men 1.78% [95% CI 1.12, 2.43], p<0.001) with greater fat-free mass and bone mass loss and smaller improvements in HbA1c, LDL-cholesterol and diastolic blood pressure. After the WM intervention, women had greater fat-free mass and bone mass loss and smaller improvements in HbA1cand LDL-cholesterol, while they had greater improvements in fasting glucose, triacylglycerol (adjusted difference for women vs men -0.08 mmol/l [-0.11, -0.04], p<0.001) and HDL-cholesterol.Older adults benefited less from a lifestyle intervention in relation to body composition and cardiometabolic health markers than younger adults, despite greater sustained weight loss. Women benefited less from a LED followed by a lifestyle intervention in relation to body weight and body composition than men. Future interventions targeting older adults or women should take prevention of fat-free mass and bone mass loss into consideration.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01777893.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35656542","Sexually Dimorphic Accumulation of Persistent Organic Pollutants in Fetuses.","Front Toxicol","Living in an industrialized era, we are exposed to man-made chemicals including persistent organic pollutants (POPs). Previous studies have shown associations of POP exposure with adverse outcomes in humans, wildlife, and the environment, making it a global concern. Exposure during sensitive windows of susceptibility such as fetal development is of particular concern because of the potential increased risk of developing diseases in childhood and adulthood. However, there are limited studies on the sexual dimorphism of POP accumulation during the prenatal period. In this mini-review, we focus on differences in POP concentrations in the placenta and fetal tissues between males and females. We also show the sexually dimorphic adverse outcomes of prenatal exposure to POPs. Overall, our summary shows that males may accumulate higher concentrations of POPs in the placenta and fetal tissues compared to females, although studies are sparse and inconsistent. In addition, there are differences in adverse health outcomes associated to prenatal POP exposure according to sex. Hence, we highly urge researchers investigating the health effects of POP exposure to consider sexual dimorphism in their studies.Copyright © 2022 Björvang and Mamsen."

Twin and family studies suggest substantial variance in the MRSs could be explained by genetic factors. For 2559 women aged 30 to 80 years (mean 54 years), we measured the MRSs from digitized film mammograms and estimated the associations of the MRSs with a 313-SNP breast cancer polygenic risk score (PRS) and 202 individual SNPs associated with breast cancer risk.

There were MRS associations (Bonferroni-adjustedp&lt; 0.04) with one SNP in theATXN1gene and nominally with someESR1SNPs. Less than 1% of the variance of the MRSs is explained by the genetic markers currently known to be associated with breast cancer risk.

"35747691","The Consequences of Assisted Reproduction Technologies on the Offspring Health Throughout Life: A Placental Contribution.","Front Cell Dev Biol","The use of assisted reproductive technologies (ART) worldwide has led to the conception and birth of over eight million babies since being implemented in 1978. ART use is currently on the rise, given growing infertility and the increase in conception age among men and women in industrialized countries. Though obstetric and perinatal outcomes have improved over the years, pregnancies achieved by ART still bear increased risks for the mother and the unborn child. Moreover, given that the first generation of ART offspring is now only reaching their forties, the long-term effects of ART are currently unknown. This is important, as there is a wealth of data showing that life-long health can be predetermined by poor conditions during intrauterine development, including irregularities in the structure and functioning of the placenta. In the current review, we aim to summarize the latest available findings examining the effects of ART on the cardiometabolic, cognitive/neurodevelopmental, and behavioral outcomes in the perinatal period, childhood and adolescence/adulthood; and to examine placental intrinsic factors that may contribute to the developmental outcomes of ART offspring. Altogether, the latest knowledge about life outcomes beyond adolescence for those conceived by ART appears to suggest a better long-term outcome than previously predicted. There are also changes in placenta structure and functional capacity with ART. However, more work in this area is critically required, since the potential consequences of ART may still emerge as the offspring gets older. In addition, knowledge of the placenta may help to foresee and mitigate any adverse outcomes in the offspring.Copyright © 2022 Schroeder, Badini, Sferruzzi-Perri and Albrecht."
"35640037","Comparison of the cardiometabolic profiles of adolescents conceived through ART with those of a non-ART cohort.","Hum Reprod","Is the cardiometabolic health of adolescents conceived through ART worse than that of their counterparts conceived without ART?The majority of cardiometabolic and vascular health parameters of adolescents conceived through ART are similar or more favourable, than those of their counterparts of similar age and conceived without ART.It has been proposed that the cardiometabolic health of offspring conceived with ART may be unfavourable compared to that of their counterparts conceived without ART. The literature pertaining to cardiometabolic health of offspring conceived after ART is contradictory, but generally suggests unfavourable cardiometabolic health parameters, such as an increase in blood pressure (BP), vascular dysfunction and adiposity, as well as unfavourable glucose and lipid profiles. With over 8 million children and adults born through ART worldwide, it is important to investigate whether these early signs of adverse cardiometabolic differences persist into adolescence and beyond.The Growing Up Healthy Study (GUHS) is a prospective cohort study that recruited 303 adolescents and young adults conceived after ART (aged 13-21 years) and born between 1991 and 2001 in Western Australia. Their health parameters, including cardiometabolic factors, were assessed and compared with counterparts from the Raine Study Generation 2 (Gen2). The 2868 Gen2 participants were born 1989-1992 and are representative of the Western Australian adolescent population. At ∼17 years of age (2013-2017), 163 GUHS participants replicated assessments previously completed by Gen2 at a similar age.Cardiometabolic parameters were compared between a total of 163 GUHS and 1457 Gen2 adolescents. Separate male (GUHS n = 81, Gen2 n = 735) and female (GUHS n = 82, Gen2 n = 722) analyses were conducted. Assessments consisted of a detailed questionnaire including health, lifestyle and demographic parameters, anthropometric assessments (height, weight, BMI, waist circumference and skinfold thickness), fasting serum biochemistry, arterial stiffness and BP (assessed using applanation tonometry). Abdominal ultrasonography was used to assess the presence and severity of hepatic steatosis, and thickness of abdominal fat compartments. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) was diagnosed if there was sonographic fatty liver in the absence of significant alcohol consumption. Chi2, Fisher's exact and Mann-Whitney U tests, performed in SPSS V25, examined cohort differences and generalized estimating equations adjusted for the following covariates: singleton vs non-singleton pregnancy, birthweight (z-score), gestational age, BMI, smoking, alcohol consumption in the past 6 months and parent cardiovascular status. Arterial stiffness measures and waist circumference were additionally adjusted for height, and female analyses were additionally adjusted for use of oral contraceptives in the preceding 6 months.In adjusted analyses, GUHS females had a lower BMI (22.1 vs 23.3 kg/m2, P = 0.014), and thinner skinfolds (triceps, subscapular, mid-abdominal; 16.9 vs 18.7 mm, P = 0.021, 13.4 vs 15.0 mm, P = 0.027, 19.7 vs 23.2 mm, P < 0.001, respectively), whereas males were not significantly different. Waist circumference was lower in GUHS adolescents (males: 78.1 vs 81.3 cm, P = 0.008, females: 76.7 vs 83.3 cm, P = 0.007). There were no significant differences between the two groups in glucose, insulin, homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C), total cholesterol (TC), alanine aminotransferase and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein in both sexes. In females, serum triglycerides were lower in GUHS adolescents (1.0 vs 1.2 mmol/l, P = 0.029). GUHS males had higher serum HDL-C (1.1 vs 1.0 mmol/l, P = 0.004) and a lower TC/HDL-C ratio (3.2 vs 3.6, P = 0.036). There were no significant differences in the prevalence of NAFLD or steatosis severity scores between the cohorts in males and females. GUHS females had less subcutaneous adipose tissue (9.4 vs 17.9 mm, P < 0.001), whereas GUHS males had greater visceral adipose thickness (44.7 vs 36.3 mm, P < 0.001). There was no significant difference in pre-peritoneal adipose thickness. Pulse wave velocity was lower in GUHS males (5.8 vs 6.3 m/s, P < 0.001) and heart rate corrected augmentation index was lower in GUHS females (-8.4 vs -2.7%, P = 0.048). There were no significant differences in BP or heart rate in males or females between the two groups.Despite the substantial study size and the unique study design of the ART cohort, we were unable to differentiate between different types of ART, due to the low number of ICSI cycles (e.g. IVF vs ICSI), draw definite conclusions, or relate the outcomes to the cause of infertility. Considering the differences in time points when both cohorts were studied, external factors could have changed, which could not be accounted for. Given the observational nature of this study, causation cannot be proven.Contrary to our hypothesis and previous findings focussing mainly on childhood, this study reports mostly similar or favourable cardiometabolic markers in adolescents conceived with ART compared to those conceived without ART. The greater visceral adipose thickness, particularly present in males, requires further investigation. While these findings are generally reassuring, future well-designed and appropriately powered studies are required to definitively address the issue of cardiometabolic health in ART adults.This project was supported by NHMRC project grant number 1042269 and R.J.H. received education grant funding support from Ferring Pharmaceuticals.

Cryopreservation of supernumerary embryos has contributed to an increase in cumulative pregnancy rates and as a consequence, an increasing number of children are being born through these techniques worldwide. However, long-term follow-up studies of children born through ART are scarce, and concerns about the long-term health effects on individuals conceived through ART have been raised. The relevant genomic transformations that occur at the time cryopreservation is usually applied to embryos may have potential epigenetic risks. With advances in multi-omic single cell technologies, new ways to assess the (epi)genomic status during early embryo development have now become feasible. These novel strategies could provide a revolutionary opportunity to understand the actual impact of ART, but also may help future developments aiming at increase both their efficiency and safety.

This hormone is involved in the regulation of appetite, informing the brain about the body's energy resources. Having the correct mechanisms related to the action of leptin is a factor reducing the risk of obesity. The natural presence of leptin in the composition of breast milk suggests that it has a specific role in shaping the health of a breastfed child. Obesity as a disease of civilization affects more and more people, including children. The development of this disease is multifaceted and determined by many factors, including genetic and environmental factors such as eating habits and low physical activity. Behind obesity, there are complex mechanisms in which many elements of the human body are involved. Understanding the effects of breastfeeding as a natural source of leptin can help prevent childhood obesity and development of this disease in future life."

This study is committed to creating a new prognostic model based on hypoxia related genes. Here, we established a novel tumor hypoxia-related prognostic model consisting of 6 hypoxia-related genes by univariate Cox regression and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm to predict CHOL prognosis and then the risk score for each patient was calculated. The results showed that the patients with high-risk scores had poor prognosis compared with those with low-risk scores, which was verified as an independent predictor by multivariate analysis. The hypoxia-related prognostic model was validated in both TCGA and GEO cohorts and exhibited excellent performance in predicting overall survival in CHOL. The PPI results suggested that hypoxia-related genes involved in the model may play a central role in regulating the hypoxic state. In addition, the presence of IDH1 mutations in the high-risk group was high, and GSEA results showed that some metabolic pathways were upregulated, but immune response processes were generally downregulated. These factors may be potential reasons for the high-risk group with worse prognosis. The analysis of different immune regulation-related processes in the high- and low-risk groups revealed that the expression of genes related to immune checkpoints would show differences between these two groups. We further verified the expression of the oncogene PPFIA4 in the model, and found that compared with normal samples, CHOL patients were generally highly expressed, and the patients with high-expression of PPFIA4 had a poor prognosis. In summary, the present study may provide a valid prognostic model for bile duct cancer to inform better clinical management of patients.Copyright © 2022 Sun, Wang, Xiao, Xue and Wang."

In this study, two molecular subtypes were defined through unsupervised consensus clustering based on immune-related dysregulated genes. Then, patients with different molecular subtypes of GC were shown to have distinct differences in sensitivity to immune checkpoint blockers (ICBs). The immune-related prognostic signature was established utilizing least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)-Cox regression analysis. Three independent external cohorts and the IMvigor210 cohort were introduced to validate the robustness of IPRS. scRNA-seq data of GC samples were used to decipher the underlying mechanisms of how IPRS contributes to the TIME.

An experimental mouse model of dilated cardiomyopathy was used to validate the bioinformatics results.FRZB and EXT1 were identified as hub biomarkers, and the ROC curves suggested an excellent diagnostic ability of the above genes for DCM. In addition, naive B cells were upregulated in DCM tissues, while eosinophils, M2 macrophages, and memory CD4 T cells were downregulated in DCM tissues. The increase in two hub genes and naive B cells was validated in animal experiments.These results indicated that FRZB and EXT1 could be used as promising biomarkers, and eosinophils, M2 macrophages, resting memory CD4 T cells and naive B cells may also affect the occurrence of DCM.© 2022.

"35846134","Analysis of Pyroptosis-Related Immune Signatures and Identification of Pyroptosis-Related LncRNA Prognostic Signature in Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma.","Front Genet","Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is a common urinary system malignant tumor with a high incidence and recurrence rate. Pyroptosis is a kind of programmed cell death caused by inflammasomes. More and more evidence had confirmed that pyroptosis plays a very significant part in cancer, and it is controversial whether pyroptosis promotes or inhibits tumors. Consistently, its potential role in ccRCC treatment efficacy and prognosis remains unclear. In this study, we systematically investigated the role of pyroptosis in the ccRCC samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Based on the differentially expressed pyroptosis-related genes (DEPRGs), we identified three pyroptosis subtypes with different clinical outcomes, immune signatures, and responses to immunotherapy. Gene set variation analysis (GSVA), Gene Ontology (GO) analysis, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis revealed that pyroptosis activation meant infiltration of more immune cells that is conducive to tumor progression. To further investigate the immunomodulatory effect of pyroptosis in ccRCC, we constructed a pyroptosis-score based on the common differential prognostic genes of the three pyroptosis subtypes. It was found that patients with high pyroptosis-score were in an unfavorable immune environment and the prognosis was worse. Gene set enrichment analysis suggested that immune-related biological processes were activated in the high pyroptosis-score group. Then, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression was implemented for constructing a prognostic model of eight pyroptosis-related long noncoding RNAs (PRlncRNAs) in the TCGA dataset, and the outcomes revealed that, compared with the low-risk group, the model-based high-risk group was intently associated with poor overall survival (OS). We further explored the relationship between high- and low-risk groups with tumor microenvironment (TME), immune infiltration, and drug therapy. Finally, we constructed and confirmed a robust and reliable PRlncRNA pairs prediction model of ccRCC, identified PRlncRNA, and verified it by experiments. Our findings suggested the potential role of pyroptosis in ccRCC, offering new insights into the prognosis of ccRCC and guiding effectual targeted therapy and immunotherapy.Copyright © 2022 Zhong, Wang, Zhu, Gong, Fei, Zhao, Wu, Tang, Zhang, Wang and Zheng."

Clinical implications of AS events and their interaction with tumor immunity were systematically analyzed in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD).Transcriptome profiling as well as AS data of LUAD were retrospectively curated. Then, the network of the overall survival (OS)-relevant AS events with splicing factors was established. After screening OS-relevant AS events, a LASSO prognostic model was conducted and evaluated with ROC curves. A nomogram that integrated independent prognostic indicators was created. Immune response and immune cell infiltration were estimated with ESTIMATE, CIBERSORT, and ssGSEA algorithms. Drug sensitivity was inferred with pRRophetic package.In total, 2415 OS-relevant AS events were identified across LUAD patients. The interaction network of splicing factors with OS-relevant AS events uncovered the underlying regulatory mechanisms of AS events in LUAD. Thereafter, a prognostic model containing 12 AS events was developed, which acted as a reliable and independent prognostic indicator following verification. A nomogram that constituted stage and risk score displayed great effectiveness in evaluating the survival likelihood. Moreover, the AS-based prognostic model was in relation to immune response and immune cell infiltration. Patients with a high-risk score displayed therapeutic superiority to cisplatin, erlotinib, gefitinib, and gemcitabine. Finally, three AS-relevant genes (CDKN2A, TTC39C, and PKIB) were identified as prognostic markers.Collectively, our findings developed an AS event signature with powerful prognostic predictive efficacy in LUAD.Copyright © 2022 Bao, Li, Guan, Yao, Liang, Xiang and Zhong."

The treatment of RCC, especially kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), has always been the focus of clinical treatment. Using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database as a starting point, we explored the feasibility of applying the pyroptosis mechanism to KIRC treatment by searching for cancer markers associated with pyroptosis and cancer treatment signatures. The obtained samples were clustered using unsupervised clustering analysis to define the different KIRC subtypes with different pyroptosis expression levels. Based on this, a gene expression analysis was performed to explore the carcinogenic mechanism that is markedly related to pyroptosis. The Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer database and single sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) algorithm were used to analyze the different treatment methods of the current prominent KIRC to determine whether pyroptosis plays a role. Finally, LASSO regression was used to screen for related genes and construct a model to predict patient prognosis. The expression levels of GSDME, CASP3, CASP4, CASP5, CHMP3, and CHMP4C were incorporated into the model construction. After verification, the prediction accuracy of the 3-, 5-, 7- and 10 years survival rates of our prognostic model were 0.66, 0.701, 0.719, and 0.728, respectively. Through the above analysis, we demonstrated the feasibility of pyroptosis in the clinical treatment of KIRC and provided novel ideas and suggestions for the clinical treatment of KIRC.Copyright © 2022 Qi, Che, Li, Wang and Wu."
"35783640","Novel Epigenetic Clock Biomarkers of Age-Related Macular Degeneration.","Front Med (Lausanne)","Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) is a bilateral ocular condition resulting in irreversible vision impairment caused by the progressive loss of photoreceptors in the macula, a region at the center of the retina. The progressive loss of photoreceptor is a key feature of dry AMD but not always wet AMD, though both forms of AMD can lead to loss of vision. Regression-based biological age clocks are one of the most promising biomarkers of aging but have not yet been used in AMD. Here we conducted analyses to identify regression-based biological age clocks for the retina and explored their use in AMD using transcriptomic data consisting of a total of 453 retina samples including 105 Minnesota Grading System (MGS) level 1 samples, 175 MGS level 2, 112 MGS level 3 and 61 MGS level 4 samples, as well as 167 fibroblast samples. The clocks yielded good separation among AMD samples with increasing severity score viz., MGS1-4, regardless of whether clocks were trained in retina tissue, dermal fibroblasts, or in combined datasets. Clock application to cultured fibroblasts, embryonic stem cells, and induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs) were consistent with age reprograming in iPSCs. Moreover, clock application toin vitroneuronal differentiation suggests broader applications. Interesting, many of the age clock genes identified include known targets mechanistically linked to AMD and aging, such as GDF11, C16ORF72, and FBN2. This study provides new observations for retina age clocks and suggests new applications for monitoringin vitroneuronal differentiation. These clocks could provide useful markers for AMD monitoring and possible intervention, as well as potential targets forin vitroscreens.Copyright © 2022 Mallik, Grodstein, Bennett, Vavvas and Lemos."

Immunotherapy offers promising new treatment options for gastric cancer patients; however, it is only effective in a limited fraction of patients. In this study, we evaluated the composition of 22 tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in TCGA Stomach Adenocarcinoma (STAD) using deconvolution-based method by analyzing the publicly available bulk tumor RNA-seq data. The patients were classified into high-TIL and low-TIL subtypes based on their immune cell profiles and prognosis outputs. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the two subtypes were identified, and GO/KEGG analysis showed that broad immune genes, such as PD-L1 and PD-1, were highly expressed in the high-TIL subtype. A comprehensive protein-protein interaction (PPI) network centered on DEGs was built, and 16 hub genes of the network were further identified. Based on the hub genes, an elastic model with 11 gene signatures (NKG7,GZMB,IL2RB,CCL5,CD8A,IDO1,MYH1,GNLY,CXCL11,GBP5andPRF1) was developed to predict the high-TIL subtype. In summary, our findings showed that the compositions of TILs within the tumor immune microenvironment of stomach cancer patients are highly heterogeneous, and the profiles of TILs have the potential to be predictive markers of patients' responses and overall survival outcomes."

Random forest (RF) regression and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression were applied to identify immune-related genetic biomarkers (IRGBs) of IS, and accuracy was verified using neural network models. Finally, proportion changes of various immune cells in peripheral blood of IS patients were evaluated using CIBERSORT and xCell and correlation analyses were performed between IRGBs and differentially distributed immune cells.A total of 537 genes were differentially expressed between IS and control samples. Four immune-related differential expressed genes identified by regression analysis presented strong predictive power (AUC = 0.909) which we suggeseted them as immune-related genetic biomarkers (IRGBs). We also demonstrated six immune-related genes targeted by known drugs. In addition, post-IS immune system presented an increase in the proportion of innate immune cells and a decrease in adaptive immune cells in the peripheral circulation, and IRGBs showing significance were associated with this process.The study identifiedCARD11,ICAM2,VIM, andCD19as immune-related genetic biomarkers of IS. Six immune-related DEGs targeted by known drugs were found and provide new candidate drug targets for modulating the post-IS immune system. The innate immune cells and adaptive immune cells are diversified in the post-IS immune system, and IRGBs might play important role during this process.Copyright © 2022 Wenhao Liu et al."

Here, we conducted an integrative analysis of the role of TNFα-derived genes in GC prognosis and precision medicine.Methods:We pooled transcriptome and clinical features of GC patients from TCGA and GSE15459 projects. TNFα signaling was quantified through the ssGSEA algorithm, and TNFα-derived genes were screened with WGCNA. Thereafter, a LASSO model was established. The somatic mutation was analyzed across GC specimens. Immune cell infiltrations were inferred through ESTIMATE and ssGSEA algorithms, followed by measuring the immune checkpoint expression. AKR1B1, CPVL, and CTSL expressions were measured in gastric mucosal cells GES-1 and GC cells (HGC-27, MKN-28, and AGS) through RT-qPCR and Western blotting.Results:A TNFα-derived gene signature (containing AKR1B1, CPVL, and CTSL) was developed for GC. A high-risk score indicated more undesirable OS, DFS, DSS, and PFS outcomes. Time-independent ROC curves and multivariate cox regression models confirmed that the signature reliably and independently predicted GC prognosis. Additionally, risk scores displayed significant correlations to more severe histological grades and pathological stages. A low-risk score was characterized by increased somatic mutation, while a high-risk score was characterized by immune and stromal activation, enhanced immune cell infiltrations, and increased expression of immune checkpoint molecules. Experimental results confirmed the significant upregulation of AKR1B1, CPVL, and CTSL in GC cells.Conclusion:Collectively, stratification based on the TNFα-derived gene signature might enable GC patients to predict prognosis, benefit from immunotherapy, and assist in formulating novel therapeutic regimens.Copyright © 2022 Wang, Qi, Sun, Diao and Yang."

However, the roles of lncRNA in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have not been fully established. In this study, we aimed at identifying lncRNAs-related costimulatory molecules in HCC and to construct a prognostic signature for predicting the clinical outcomes for HCC patients. Data were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas database for bioinformatics analyses. Costimulatory molecules were obtained from published literature. The R software, SPSS, and GraphPad Prism were used for statistical analyses. A risk model that is based on five costimulatory molecule-related lncRNAs was constructed using lasso and Cox regression analyses. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that the risk score could predict the prognostic outcomes for HCC. Samples in high- and low-risk groups exhibited significant differences in gene set enrichment and immune infiltration levels. Through colony formation and CCK8 assays, we found that AC099850.3 was strongly associated with HCC cell proliferation.

However, the role of CLEC10A from a pan-cancer perspective has not yet been analyzed, and its role in human cancer prognosis and immunology remains largely unclear.We studied the expression levels of CLEC10A and investigated its prognostic value in various cancers across distinct datasets including Oncomine, cBioPortal, and TCGA, and conducted immunohistochemical experiments using fresh bladder cancer and breast cancer samples to verify the results. In addition, we also performed GSEA of CLEC10A and explored the relationship between CLEC10A expression and immune infiltration, immune checkpoints, immune activation genes, immunosuppressive genes, chemokines and chemokine receptors.The results showed that the expression level of CLEC10A in most tumors was significantly lower compared with non-cancerous tissue, and the decreased expression was related to poor prognosis and more advanced cancer stages. We also found that the expression of CLEC10A was significantly related to the immunomodulatory interaction between lymph and non-lymphocytes. Furthermore, the expression of CLEC10A was not only significantly correlated with the level of infiltration of CD4+T cells and CD8+T cells, but also closely related to immune checkpoints, immune activation genes, immunosuppressive genes, chemokines, and chemokine receptors. Importantly, our analysis of the relationship between CLEC10A and TMB and MSI also confirmed the speculation that CLEC10A may influence antitumor immunity by regulating the composition and immune mechanisms of the tumor microenvironment.In conclusion, CLEC10A may serve as a new target for tumor immunotherapy and has great potential as a molecular biomarker for predicting pan-cancer prognosis and immune infiltration.AJTR Copyright © 2022."

Therefore, we first used The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database to identify prognosis and m7G-related long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). Then we randomly divided the samples into the training set and test set and then constructed and verified the m7G lnRNA prognostic model (m7Gscore) by the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analysis. The m7Gscore has been proved to be an independent marker of BCR-free survival in patients with PCa. Furthermore, the m7Gscore was significantly correlated with the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) and somatic mutation of PCa patients and had the potential to be an indicator for the selection of drug treatment. We also clustered TCGA cohort into three m7G-related patterns (C1, C2, and C3). The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that C1 had the best BCR-free survival and C3 had the worst. The TIME was also significantly distinct among the three m7G-related patterns. According to the TIME characteristics of the patterns, we defined C1, C2, and C3 as immune-desert phenotype, immune-inflamed phenotype, and immune-excluded phenotype, respectively.Copyright © 2022 Xin, Deng, Mao, Wang, Liu, Wang, Song, Song and Liu."

By LASSO Cox regression analyses, a gene signature was constructed based on the genes in diabetes-related modules. ROC curves were plotted for assessing the diagnostic efficacy. Correlations between the genes and immune cell infiltration and pathways were analyzed. BST2 and BTBD1 expression was verified in glucotoxicity-induced and normal isletβcells. The influence of BST2 onβcell dysfunction was investigated under si-BST2 transfection.Totally, 14 coexpression modules were constructed, and red and cyan modules displayed the correlations to diabetes. The LASSO gene signature (BST2, BTBD1, IFIT1, IFIT3, and RTP4) was developed. The AUCs in the combined datasets and GSE20966 dataset were separately 0.914 and 0.910, confirming the excellent performance in diagnosing type 2 diabetes. Each gene in the model was distinctly correlated to immune cell infiltration and key signaling pathways (TGF-βand P53, etc.). The abnormal expression of BST2 and BTBD1 was confirmed in glucotoxicity-inducedβcells. BST2 knockdown amelioratedβcell dysfunction and altered the activation of TGF-βand P53 pathways.Our findings propose a gene signature with high efficacy to diagnose type 2 diabetes, which could assist and improve early diagnosis and therapy.Copyright © 2022 Huaming Shao et al."

Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and distinct machine-learning algorithms were then used to identify hub modules and candidate biomarkers. We assessed the diagnostic value of the candidate biomarkers using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. We then used the CIBERSORT algorithm to analyze immune cell infiltration patterns, and the Wilcoxon test to screen out hub immune cells that might affect OA occurrence. Finally, the expression levels of hub biomarkers were confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR).Results:We identified 102 up-regulated genes and 110 down-regulated genes. The functional enrichment analysis results showed that DEGs are enriched mainly in immune response pathways. Combining the results of the algorithms and ROC analysis, we identified GUCA1A and NELL1 as potential diagnostic biomarkers for OA, and validated their diagnosibility using an external dataset. Construction of a TF-mRNA-miRNA network enabled prediction of potential candidate compounds targeting hub biomarkers. Immune cell infiltration analyses revealed the expression of hub biomarkers to be correlated with CD8 T cells, memory B cells, M0/M2 macrophages, resting mast cells and resting dendritic cells. qRT-PCR results showed both GUCA1A and NELL1 were significantly increased in OA samples (p< 0.01). All validations are consistent with the microarray hybridization, indicating that GUCA1A and NELL1 may be involved in the pathogenesis of OA.Conclusion:The findings suggest that GUCA1A and NELL1, closely related to OA occurrence and progression, represent new OA candidate markers, and that immune cell infiltration plays a significant role in the progression of OA.Copyright © 2022 Liu, Liu, Li, Ma, Lu, Sun, Zhang and Yang."

Standard diagnostic procedures for AD population are reliant on neuroimaging features (positron emission tomography, PET), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers (Aβ1-42, T-tau, P-tau), which are expensive or require invasive sampling. The blood-based biomarkers offer the opportunity to provide an alternative approach for easy diagnosis of AD, which would be a less invasive and cost-effective screening tool than currently approved CSF or amyloid β positron emission tomography (PET) biomarkers.We developed and validated a sensitive and selective immunoassay for total Tau in plasma. Robust signatures were obtained based on several clinical features selected by multiple machine learning algorithms between the three participant groups. Subsequently, a well-fitted nomogram was constructed and validated, integrating clinical factors and total Tau concentration. The predictive performance was evaluated according to the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and area under the curve (AUC) statistics. Decision curve analysis and calibration curves are used to evaluate the net benefit of nomograms in clinical decision-making.Under optimum conditions, chemiluminescence analysis (CLIA) displays a desirable dynamic range within Tau concentration from 7.80 to 250 pg/mL with readily achieved higher performances (LOD: 5.16 pg/mL). In the discovery cohort, the discrimination between the three well-defined participant groups according to Tau concentration was in consistent agreement with clinical diagnosis (AD vs. non-MCI: AUC = 0.799; aMCI vs. non-MCI: AUC = 0.691; AD vs. aMCI: AUC = 0.670). Multiple machine learning algorithms identified Age, Gender, EMPG, Tau, ALB, HCY, VB12, and/or Glu as robust signatures.

ESTIMATE, CIBERSORT, McpCounter and TIMER algorithm were used to analyze the infiltration of immune cells in two molecular subgroups. LASSO algorithm and multivariate Cox analysis were used to construct a prognostic risk signature. Functional analysis was conducted to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Finally, the FRPGs were verified by Quantitative Real-Time PCR. We obtained 16 FRGs and divided GC patients into two subgroups by consistent clustering. Cluster C1 with a higher abundance of immune cell infiltration but lower probability in response to immunotherapy, it was reasonable to speculate that Cluster C1 was in accordance with the immune rejection type. Functional analysis showed that the biological process of DEGs in training cohort mainly included immune globulin, and human immune response mediated by circulating immune globulin. GSEA analysis showed that compared with Cluster C2, Cluster C1 showed lower expression in lipid metabolism. The nomogram combined with risk signature and clinical features can accurately predict the prognosis of GC patients. We identified two molecular subtypes, Clusters C1 and C2. In Cluster C1, patients with poor prognosis present with a hyperimmune status and low lipid metabolism, and we speculate that Cluster C1 was in accordance with the immune rejection type. The risk model based on FRPGs can accurately predict the prognosis of GC. These results indicated that ferroptosis is associated with TIME, and deserved considerable attention in determining immunotherapy treatment strategy for GC patients.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35549979","A novel hypoxia-driven gene signature that can predict the prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma.","Bioengineered","Hypoxia environment exists in already started hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and promotes its progression by driving changes in the gene expression profiles of cells. However, the status of hypoxia-driven genes in HCC is largely unknown. In the present study, 368 HCC tissues from The Cancer Genome Atlas were divided into high and low hypoxia groups according to their hypoxia signatures. A total of 1,142 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between the two groups, and 34 of these DEGs were highly expressed in HCC tissues compared with adjacent tissues, especially in HCC tissues from patients with stage III-IV HCC. After constructing a protein-protein interaction network and applying the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator Cox regression method for 34 DEGs, a three-gene signature (complement factor H related 3 [CFHR3], egl-9 family hypoxia inducible factor 3 [EGLN3], and chromogranin A [CHGA]) was constructed and had prognostic value to predicted outcome of patients with HCC. This three-gene signature was suitable for classifying patients with HCC in the International Cancer Genome Consortium. CFHR3 shows remarkable diagnostic value in HCC. Hypoxia decreased CFHR3 expression, but increased HCC cell proliferation and motility. Overexpression of CFHR3 in HCC cells under hypoxia reversed the stimulatory effects of hypoxia and suppressed cell proliferation and metastasisin vivo. In conclusion, we identified a novel hypoxia-driven gene signature (CFHR3, EGLN3, andCHGA) for reliable prognostic prediction of HCC, and demonstrated that overexpression of CFHR3 may be a potential strategy to overcome hypoxia and treat HCC."

Understanding the molecular characteristics of the early stages of MI is of significance for the treatment of the disease. In this study, RNA-seq and MeDIP-seq were performed on heart tissue from mouse models at multiple time points (0 h, 10 min, 1, 6, 24, and 72 h) to explore genetic and epigenetic features that influence MI progression. Analysis based on a single point in time, the number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially methylated regions (DMRs) increased with the time of myocardial infarction, using 0 h as a control group. Moreover, within 10 min of MI onset, the cells are mainly in immune response, and as the duration of MI increases, apoptosis begins to occur. Analysis based on time series data, the expression of 1012 genes was specifically downregulated, and these genes were associated with energy metabolism. The expression of 5806 genes was specifically upregulated, and these genes were associated with immune regulation, inflammation and apoptosis. Fourteen transcription factors were identified in the genes involved in apoptosis and inflammation, which may be potential drug targets. Analysis based on MeDIP-seq combined with RNA-seq methodology, focused on methylation at the promoter region. GO revealed that the downregulated genes with hypermethylation at 72 h were enriched in biological processes such as cardiac muscle contraction. In addition, the upregulated genes with hypomethylation at 72 h were enriched in biological processes, such as cell-cell adhesion, regulation of the apoptotic signaling pathway and regulation of angiogenesis. Among these genes, the Tnni3 gene was also present in the downregulated model. Hypermethylation of Tnni3 at 72 h after MI may be an important cause of exacerbation of MI.Copyright © 2022 Han, Duan, Wu, Zheng, Gu, Cai, Lu, Wu, Li and Gu."

However, no database was available to provide the comprehensive factors of these types. Herein, a database entitled 'Human Microbiome Affect The Host Epigenome (MIAOME)' was constructed. Based on the types of epigenetic modifications confirmed in the literature review, the MIAOME database captures 1068 (63 genus, 281 species, 707 strains,etc.) human microbes, 91 unique microbiota-derived metabolites & components (16 fatty acids, 10 bile acids, 10 phenolic compounds, 10 vitamins, 9 tryptophan metabolites,etc.) derived from 967 microbes; 50 microbes that secreted 40 proteins; 98 microbes that directly influence the host epigenetic modification, and provides 3 classifications of the epigenome, including (1) 4 types of DNA modifications, (2) 20 histone modifications and (3) 490 ncRNAs regulations, involved in 160 human diseases. All in all, MIAOME has compiled the information on the microenvironmental factors influence host epigenome through the scientific literature and biochemical databases, and allows the collective considerations among the different types of factors.

"35916901","Personalised prevention of type 2 diabetes.","Diabetologia","It is well established from clinical trials that behavioural interventions can halve the risk of progression from prediabetes to type 2 diabetes but translating this evidence of efficacy into effective real-world interventions at scale is an ongoing challenge. A common suggestion is that future preventive interventions need to be more personalised in order to enhance effectiveness. This review evaluates the degree to which existing interventions are already personalised and outlines how greater personalisation could be achieved through better identification of those at high risk, division of type 2 diabetes into specific subgroups and, above all, more individualisation of the behavioural targets for preventive action. Approaches using more dynamic real-time data are in their scientific infancy. Although these approaches are promising they need longer-term evaluation against clinical outcomes. Whatever personalised preventive approaches for type 2 diabetes are developed in the future, they will need to be complementary to existing individual-level interventions that are being rolled out and that are demonstrably effective. They will also need to ideally synergise with, and at the very least not detract attention from, efforts to develop and implement strategies that impact on type 2 diabetes risk at the societal level.© 2022.

"35928158","Prediction of Smoking Habits From Class-Imbalanced Saliva Microbiome Data Using Data Augmentation and Machine Learning.","Front Microbiol","Human microbiome research is moving from characterization and association studies to translational applications in medical research, clinical diagnostics, and others. One of these applications is the prediction of human traits, where machine learning (ML) methods are often employed, but face practical challenges. Class imbalance in available microbiome data is one of the major problems, which, if unaccounted for, leads to spurious prediction accuracies and limits the classifier's generalization. Here, we investigated the predictability of smoking habits from class-imbalanced saliva microbiome data by combining data augmentation techniques to account for class imbalance with ML methods for prediction. We collected publicly available saliva 16S rRNA gene sequencing data and smoking habit metadata demonstrating a serious class imbalance problem, i.e., 175 current vs. 1,070 non-current smokers. Three data augmentation techniques (synthetic minority over-sampling technique, adaptive synthetic, and tree-based associative data augmentation) were applied together with seven ML methods: logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, support vector machine with linear and radial kernels, decision trees, random forest, and extreme gradient boosting. K-fold nested cross-validation was used with the different augmented data types and baseline non-augmented data to validate the prediction outcome. Combining data augmentation with ML generally outperformed baseline methods in our dataset. The final prediction model combined tree-based associative data augmentation and support vector machine with linear kernel, and achieved a classification performance expressed as Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.36 and AUC of 0.81. Our method successfully addresses the problem of class imbalance in microbiome data for reliable prediction of smoking habits.Copyright © 2022 Díez López, Montiel González, Vidaki and Kayser."

"35784574","Histone Lysine Methylation Modification and Its Role in Vascular Calcification.","Front Endocrinol (Lausanne)","Histone methylation is an epigenetic change mediated by histone methyltransferase, and has been connected to the beginning and progression of several diseases. The most common ailments that affect the elderly are cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disorders. They are the leading causes of death, and their incidence is linked to vascular calcification (VC). The key mechanism of VC is the transformation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) into osteoblast-like phenotypes, which is a highly adjustable process involving a variety of complex pathophysiological processes, such as metabolic abnormalities, apoptosis, oxidative stress and signalling pathways. Many researchers have investigated the mechanism of VC and related targets for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Their findings revealed that histone lysine methylation modification may play a key role in the various stages of VC. As a result, a thorough examination of the role and mechanism of lysine methylation modification in physiological and pathological states is critical, not only for identifying specific molecular markers of VC and new therapeutic targets, but also for directing the development of new related drugs. Finally, we provide this review to discover the association between histone methylation modification and VC, as well as diverse approaches with which to investigate the pathophysiology of VC and prospective treatment possibilities.Copyright © 2022 Cao, Shan, Guo, Li, Li, Zheng, Xu, Wang, Lei, Tang, Ou-Yang, Duan, Wu, Ullah, Zhou, Xu, Lin, Wu, Liao and Yuan."
"35736136","H3K36me2 methyltransferase NSD2 orchestrates epigenetic reprogramming during spermatogenesis.","Nucleic Acids Res","Spermatogenesis is precisely controlled by sophisticated gene expression programs and is driven by epigenetic reprogramming, including histone modification alterations and histone-to-protamine transition. Nuclear receptor binding SET domain protein 2 (Nsd2) is the predominant histone methyltransferase catalyzing H3K36me2 and its role in male germ cell development remains elusive. Here, we report that NSD2 protein is abundant in spermatogenic cells. Conditional loss of Nsd2 in postnatal germ cells impaired fertility owing to apoptosis of spermatocytes and aberrant spermiogenesis. Nsd2 deficiency results in dysregulation of thousands of genes and remarkable reduction of both H3K36me2 and H3K36me3 in spermatogenic cells, with H3K36me2 occupancy correlating positively with expression of germline genes. Nsd2 deficiency leads to H4K16ac elevation in spermatogenic cells, probably through interaction between NSD2 and PSMA8, which regulates acetylated histone degradation. We further reveal that Nsd2 deficiency impairs EP300-induced H4K5/8ac, recognized by BRDT to mediate the eviction of histones. Accordingly, histones are largely retained in Nsd2-deficient spermatozoa. In addition, Nsd2 deficiency enhances expression of protamine genes, leading to increased protamine proteins in Nsd2-deficient spermatozoa. Our findings thus reveal a previously unappreciated role of the Nsd2-dependent chromatin remodeling during spermatogenesis and provide clues to the molecular mechanisms in epigenetic abnormalities impacting male reproductive health.© The Author(s) 2022.

Many molecular alterations have been found in HCC. However, the interactions and modulatory mechanisms among these molecules in HCC are still unclear.CTB-193M12.5 expression in tissues and cells were detected by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). In vitro experiments were conducted to evaluate the function of CTB-193M12.5 in cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion. The interaction between CTB-193M12.5 and nuclear receptor binding SET domain-containing protein 1 (NSD1) was assessed by RNA-protein pull-down and RNA immunoprecipitation assays. The roles of CTB-193M12.5 on WNT10B and Wnt/β-catenin signaling was detected by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, qPCR, Western blot, and dual luciferase reporter assay.We identified a novel prognosis-related long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) CTB-193M12.5 in HCC. CTB-193M12.5 was upregulated in HCC and its high expression was correlated with alpha fetoprotein, large tumor size, aggressive clinical characteristics, and poor survival. Functional experiments showed that CTB-193M12.5 enhanced HCC cellular proliferation, suppressed HCC cellular apoptosis, and promoted HCC cellular migration and invasion. CTB-193M12.5 knockdown exerted opposite effects in HCC. Mechanistic investigation demonstrated that CTB-193M12.5 was mainly distributed in nucleus. Histone methyltransferase NSD1 was identified as a CTB-193M12.5 interactor. CTB-193M12.5 bound and recruited NSD1 to the promoter ofWNT10B, leading to an increase in di-methylation of histone H3 at lysine 36 (H3K36me2) and the reduction of tri-methylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3) atWNT10Bpromoter. Therefore, CTB-193M12.5 epigenetically activatedWNT10Btranscription. Through upregulating WNT10B, CTB-193M12.5 further activated Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Functional rescue experiments demonstrated that overexpression of WNT10B reversed the tumor suppressive roles of CTB-193M12.5 knockdown, while Wnt/β-catenin signaling inhibitor ICG-001 abolished the oncogenic roles of CTB-193M12.5 overexpression.CTB-193M12.5 was a highly expressed and poor prognosis-related lncRNA in HCC. CTB-193M12.5 functioned as an oncogenic lncRNA through promoting NSD1-mediated WNT10B/Wnt/β-catenin signaling activation.© 2022 Zhang et al."

"35626091","Comprehensive Analysis of Acquired Genetic Variants and Their Prognostic Impact in Systemic Mastocytosis.","Cancers (Basel)","Systemic mastocytosis (SM) is a rare clonal haematopoietic stem cell disease in which activatingKITmutations (most commonlyKITD816V) are present in virtually every (&gt;90%) adult patient at similar frequencies among non-advanced and advanced forms of SM. TheKITD816V mutation is considered the most common pathogenic driver of SM. Acquisition of this mutation early during haematopoiesis may cause multilineage involvement of haematopoiesis byKITD816V, which has been associated with higher tumour burden and additional mutations in other genes, leading to an increased rate of transformation to advanced SM. Thus, among other mutations, alterations in around 30 genes that are also frequently mutated in other myeloid neoplasms have been reported in SM cases. From these genes, 12 (i.e.,ASXL1,CBL,DNMT3A,EZH2,JAK2,KRAS,NRAS,SF3B1,RUNX1,SF3B1,SRSF2,TET2) have been recurrently reported to be mutated in SM. Because of all the above, assessment of multilineage involvement of haematopoiesis by theKITD816V mutation, in the setting of multi-mutated haematopoiesis as revealed by a limited panel of genes (i.e.,ASXL1,CBL,DNMT3A,EZH2,NRAS,RUNX1andSRSF2) and associated with a poorer patient outcome, has become of great help to identify SM patients at higher risk of disease progression and/or poor survival who could benefit from closer follow-up and eventually also early cytoreductive treatment."

The objective of this paper is to describe the Growing up Healthy Study (GUHS) cohort in detail, publicise it and invite collaboration. Combining the data collected in the GUHS with other cohorts or databases will improve the much-needed knowledge about the effects of ART, and allow for better understanding of the long-term health outcomes of offspring conceived after ART. The GUHS cohort is a prospective observational study of adolescents and young adults conceived after assisted reproductive technologies (ART). It was established to determine if the long-term health of offspring conceived by ART differs from that of the general population. This was investigated by comparing a substantial number of health parameters to those of a representative population of offspring conceived without ART. The n = 303 GUHS participants were born between 1991-2001 in the two fertility clinics operating at the time in Perth, Western Australia, and undertook assessments at ages 14, 17 and 20, replicating the pre-defined study protocols from the reference cohort-the Raine Study. Participants were comprehensively phenotyped through detailed questionnaires, anthropometry, biochemical analyses, as well as age-specific assessments (asthma, atopy, cardiometabolic health, body composition, mental health, thyroid function, epigenetics and vision). To date the GUHS cohort has been used to study the methylation, cardiometabolic, and thyroid profiles, as well as respiratory and mental health. To summarise, the GUHS cohort provides a valuable addition to the limited knowledge of the long-term health outcomes of ART-conceived offspring."
"35799889","Reactive Oxygen Species Bridge the Gap between Chronic Inflammation and Tumor Development.","Oxid Med Cell Longev","According to numerous animal studies, adverse environmental stimuli, including physical, chemical, and biological factors, can cause low-grade chronic inflammation and subsequent tumor development. Human epidemiological evidence has confirmed the close relationship between chronic inflammation and tumorigenesis. However, the mechanisms driving the development of persistent inflammation toward tumorigenesis remain unclear. In this study, we assess the potential role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and associated mechanisms in modulating inflammation-induced tumorigenesis. Recent reports have emphasized the cross-talk between oxidative stress and inflammation in many pathological processes. Exposure to carcinogenic environmental hazards may lead to oxidative damage, which further stimulates the infiltration of various types of inflammatory cells. In turn, increased cytokine and chemokine release from inflammatory cells promotes ROS production in chronic lesions, even in the absence of hazardous stimuli. Moreover, ROS not only cause DNA damage but also participate in cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis by modulating several transcription factors and signaling pathways. We summarize how changes in the redox state can trigger the development of chronic inflammatory lesions into tumors. Generally, cancer cells require an appropriate inflammatory microenvironment to support their growth, spread, and metastasis, and ROS may provide the necessary catalyst for inflammation-driven cancer. In conclusion, ROS bridge the gap between chronic inflammation and tumor development; therefore, targeting ROS and inflammation represents a new avenue for the prevention and treatment of cancer.Copyright © 2022 Weihua Yu et al."
"35769600","A Comprehensive Overview of the Complex Role of Oxidative Stress in Aging, The Contributing Environmental Stressors and Emerging Antioxidant Therapeutic Interventions.","Front Aging Neurosci","Aging is a normal, inevitable, irreversible, and progressive process which is driven by internal and external factors. Oxidative stress, that is the imbalance between prooxidant and antioxidant molecules favoring the first, plays a key role in the pathophysiology of aging and comprises one of the molecular mechanisms underlying age-related diseases. However, the oxidative stress theory of aging has not been successfully proven in all animal models studying lifespan, meaning that altering oxidative stress/antioxidant defense systems did not always lead to a prolonged lifespan, as expected. On the other hand, animal models of age-related pathological phenotypes showed a well-correlated relationship with the levels of prooxidant molecules. Therefore, it seems that oxidative stress plays a more complicated role than the one once believed and this role might be affected by the environment of each organism. Environmental factors such as UV radiation, air pollution, and an unbalanced diet, have also been implicated in the pathophysiology of aging and seem to initiate this process more rapidly and even at younger ages.The purpose of this review is to elucidate the role of oxidative stress in the physiology of aging and the effect of certain environmental factors in initiating and sustaining this process. Understanding the pathophysiology of aging will contribute to the development of strategies to postpone this phenomenon. In addition, recent studies investigating ways to alter the antioxidant defense mechanisms in order to prevent aging will be presented.Careful exposure to harmful environmental factors and the use of antioxidant supplements could potentially affect the biological processes driving aging and slow down the development of age-related diseases. Maybe a prolonged lifespan could not be achieved by this strategy alone, but a longer healthspan could also be a favorable target.Copyright © 2022 Iakovou and Kourti."

In the current study, we identified by microarray technology six eligible real hub genes from already identified hub genes through a systematicin silicoapproach that could be useful to lower the heterogenetic-specific barriers in PRAD patients for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. For this purpose, microarray technology-based, already-identified PRAD-associated hub genes were initially explored through extensive literature mining; then, a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network construction of those hub genes and its analysis helped us to identify six most critical genes (real hub genes). Various online available expression databases were then used to explore the tumor driving, diagnostic, and prognostic roles of real hub genes in PRAD patients with different clinicopathologic variables. In total, 124 hub genes were extracted from the literature, and among those genes, six, including CDC20, HMMR, AURKA, CDK1, ASF1B, and CCNB1 were identified as real hub genes by the degree method. Further expression analysis revealed the significant up-regulation of real hub genes in PRAD patients of different races, age groups, and nodal metastasis status relative to controls. Moreover, through correlational analyses, different valuable correlations between treal hub genes expression and different other data (promoter methylation status, genetic alterations, overall survival (OS), tumor purity, CD4+ T, CD8+ T immune cells infiltration, and different other mutant genes and a few more) across PRAD samples were also documented. Ultimately, from this study, a few important transcription factors (TFS), miRNAs, and chemotherapeutic drugs showing a great therapeutic potential were also identified. In conclusion, we have discovered a set of six real hub genes that might be utilized as new biomarkers for lowering heterogenetic-specific barriers in PRAD patients for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment.AJTR Copyright © 2022."

Moreover, the study aimed to provide new strategies for the treatment and evaluation of prognosis in gliomas.Methods:The mRNA sequencing and relevant clinical data were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Secondly, differential analysis was conducted to reveal the radiosensitivity- and ferroptosis-associated differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Further, a predictive model based on the seven genes was constructed, and LASSO regression analysis was carried out. After that, the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) was used for validation of the results.Results:A total of 36 radiosensitivity- and 19 ferroptosis-associated DEGs with a prognostic value were identified. Moreover, seven intersecting genes (HSPB1, STAT3, CA9, MAP1LC3A, MAPK1, ZEB1, and TNFAIP3) were identified as the risk signature genes. The ROC curves and K-M analysis revealed that the signature genes showed a good survival prediction. Furthermore, the functional analysis revealed that the differentially expressed genes between the high-risk and the low-risk groups were enriched in glioma-related biological processes. In addition, differences were reported in immune function status between the two groups.Conclusion:This study revealed that the seven biomarkers could help predict the prognosis in glioma patients.

However, the reproducibility and sensitivity of the current classification remain ambiguous. This study aimed to construct more accurate risk-stratification approaches.According to bioinformatics, the sequencing profiles of methylation and transcription and imaging data derived from LGG patients were analyzed and developed predictable risk score and radiomics score. Moreover, the performance of predictable models was further validated.In this study, we determined a cluster of 6 genes that were correlated with IDH mutation/1p19q co-deletion status. Risk score model was calculated based on 6 genes and showed gratifying sensitivity and specificity for survival prediction and therapy response of LGG patients. Furthermore, a radiomics risk score model was established to noninvasively assist judgment of risk score in pre-surgery. Taken together, a predictable nomogram that combined transcriptional signatures and clinical characteristics was established and validated to be preferable to the histopathological classification.

Consequently, colorectal cancer liver metastasis is the focus of clinical treatment, as well as being the most difficult. The primary target genes related to colorectal cancer liver metastasis were via bioinformatics analysis. First, five prognosis-related genes, CTAG1A, CSTL1, FJX1, IER5L, and KLHL35, were identified through screening, and the prognosis of the CSTL1, FJX1, IER5L, and KLHL35 high expression group was considerably poorer than that of the low expression group. Furthermore, the clinical correlation analysis revealed that in distinct pathological stages T, N, and M, the mRNA expression levels of CSTL1, IER5L, and KLHL35 were higher than in normal tissues. Finally, a correlation study of the above genes and clinical manifestations revealed that FJX1 was strongly linked to colorectal cancer liver metastasis. FJX1 is thought to affect chromogenic modification enzymes, the Notch signaling system, cell senescence, and other signaling pathways, according to KEGG enrichment analysis.

Here, we developed an analytical pipeline to explore single-cell DNA methylation variations in COVID-19 patients by transferring bulk-tissue-level knowledge to the single-cell level. We discovered that the methylation variations in the whole blood of COVID-19 patients showed significant cell-type specificity with remarkable enrichment in gamma-delta T cells and presented a phenomenon of hypermethylation and low expression. Furthermore, we identified five genes whose methylation variations were associated with several cell types. Among them,S100A9,AHNAK, andCX3CR1have been reported as potential COVID-19 biomarkers previously, and the others (TRAF3IP3andLFNG) are closely associated with the immune and virus-related signaling pathways.

Recent studies have revealed that the dysregulation of PBX4 is closely related to multiple diseases, especially cancers. However, the research on PBX4's potential roles in 33 cancers from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) is still insufficient. Therefore, we performed a comprehensive pan-cancer analysis to explore the roles of PBX4with multiple public databases. Our results showed that PBX4 was differentially expressed in 17 types of human cancer and significantly correlated to the pathological stage, tumor grade, and immune and molecular subtypes. We used the Kaplan-Meier plotter and PrognoScan databases to find the significant associations between PBX4 expression and prognostic values of multiple cancers. It was also found that PBX4 expression was statistically related to mutation status, DNA methylation, immune infiltration, drug sensitivity, and immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. Additionally, we found that PBX4 was involved in different functional states of multiple cancers from the single-cell resolution perspective. Enrichment analysis results showed that PBX4-related genes were enriched in the cell cycle process, MAPK cascade, ncRNA metabolic process, positive regulation of GTPase activity, and regulation of lipase activity and mainly participated in the pathways of cholesterol metabolism, base excision repair, herpes simplex virus 1 infection, transcriptional misregulation in cancer, and Epstein-Barr virus infection. Altogether, our integrative analysis could help in better understanding the potential roles of PBX4 in different human cancers."

The HPV8 E7 oncoprotein plays a key role in the tumorigenesis of HPV-associated cutaneous tumors. However, the exact role of HPV8 E7 in human epidermal carcinogenesis has not been fully elucidated.Methods:To investigate the potential carcinogenic effects of HPV8 E7 on epithelial cells, we used RNA-sequencing technology to analyze the gene expression profile of HPV8 E7-overexpressed normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEKs).Results:RNA-sequencing revealed 831 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between HPV8 E7-expressing NHEKs and control cells, among which, 631 genes were significantly upregulated, and 200 were downregulated. Gene ontology annotation enrichment analysis showed that HPV8 E7 mainly affected the expression of genes associated with protein heterodimerization activity, DNA binding, nucleosomes, and nucleosome assembly. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis revealed that overexpression of HPV8 E7 affected the expression of gene clusters associated with viral carcinogenesis and transcriptional misregulation in cancer and necroptosis signaling pathways that reportedly play crucial roles in HPV infection promotion and cancer progression. We also found the DEGs, such asHKDC1andTNFAIP3, were associated with epigenetic modifications, immune regulation, and metabolic pathways.Conclusion:Our results demonstrate that the pro-carcinogenic effect of HPV8 expression in epithelial cells may be attributed to the regulatory effect of oncogene E7 on gene expression associated with epigenetic modifications and immune and metabolic status-associated gene expression. Although our data are based on anin vitroexperiment, it provides the theoretical evidence that the development of squamous cell carcinoma can be caused by HPV.Copyright © 2022 Chen, Li, Tang, Liang, Hua, He, Song and Cheng."

Ageing-associated changes in regenerative tissue regions include defects in maintenance of stem cell quiescence, differentiation ability and bias, clonal expansion and infiltration of immune cells in the niche. In this Review, we discuss cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying ageing in the regenerative regions of different tissues as well as potential rejuvenation strategies. We focus primarily on brain, muscle and blood tissues, but also provide examples from other tissues, such as skin and intestine. We describe the complex interactions between different cell types, non-cell-autonomous mechanisms between ageing niches and stem cells, and the influence of systemic factors. We also compare different interventions for the rejuvenation of old regenerative regions. Future outlooks in the field of stem cell ageing are discussed, including strategies to counter ageing and age-dependent disease.© 2022. Springer Nature Limited."
"35834015","Epialleles and epiallelic heterogeneity in hematological malignancies.","Med Oncol","DNA methylation has a well-established role in the pathogenesis, prognosis, and response to treatment in all the spectra of hematological malignancies. However, most of the data reported involve average DNA methylation observed in a sample. The emergence of bisulfite sequencing methods such as enhanced reduced representation that permit analyze adjacent CpGs led to exciting findings. Among these are the epialleles shift and the resulting epigenetic heterogeneity observed in leukemias and lymphomas. Epialleles seem to have an influential role as the cause of mutations that characterize leukemias, may stratify groups with different prognosis and response to treatment, and may be redistributed in the genome at different time points of the disease promoting activation of alternate transcriptional networks. Epiallelic shift may be responsible for the intratumor heterogeneity observed within the cells of the same tumor which increases with disease aggressiveness. It may also responsible for the interpatient heterogeneity explaining why blood cancers exhibit different behavior among different patients. Understanding better epiallelic conformation and the consequent chromatin conformational changes and the pathways that may be affected will permit deeper understanding of hematological malignancies pathogenesis and treatment.© 2022.

However, high levels of technical noise and data sparsity frequently lead to a lack of statistical power in correlative analyses, identifying very few, if any, significant associations between different molecular layers. Here we propose SCRaPL, a novel computational tool that increases power by carefully modelling noise in the experimental systems. We show on real and simulated multi-omics single-cell data sets that SCRaPL achieves higher sensitivity and better robustness in identifying correlations, while maintaining a similar level of false positives as standard analyses based on Pearson and Spearman correlation."

For the study of muscle, single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) has emerged not only as an alternative to scRNA-seq, but as a novel method providing valuable insights into multinucleated cells such as myofibers. Nuclei within myofibers specialize at junctions with other cell types such as motor neurons. Nuclear heterogeneity plays important roles in certain diseases such as muscular dystrophies. We survey current methods of high-throughput single cell and subcellular resolution transcriptomics, including single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics, applied to satellite cells, myoblasts, myotubes and myofibers. We summarize the major myonuclei subtypes identified in homeostatic and regenerating tissue including those specific to fiber type or at junctions with other cell types. Disease-specific nucleus populations were found in two muscular dystrophies, FSHD and Duchenne muscular dystrophy, demonstrating the importance of performing transcriptome studies at the single nucleus level in muscle.Copyright © 2022 Williams, Yokomori and Mortazavi."
"35793100","Associations Between Pregnancy-Related Predisposing Factors for Offspring Neurodevelopmental Conditions and Parental Genetic Liability to Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Autism, and Schizophrenia: The Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa).","JAMA Psychiatry","Several maternal exposures during pregnancy are considered predisposing factors for offspring neurodevelopmental conditions. However, many of these exposures may be noncausal and biased by maternal genetic liability.To assess whether pregnancy-related predisposing factors for offspring neurodevelopmental conditions are associated with maternal genetic liability for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism, and schizophrenia and to compare associations for maternal genetic liability with those for paternal genetic liability, which could indicate that paternal exposures are not suitable negative controls for maternal exposures.The Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) is a population-based pregnancy cohort that recruited parents from June 1999 to December 2008. Polygenic scores (PGS) for ADHD, autism, and schizophrenia were derived in mothers and fathers. The associations between maternal PGS and 37 pregnancy-related measures were estimated, and these results were compared with those from paternal PGS predicting paternal measures during the mother's pregnancy. Analysis took place between March 2021 and March 2022.PGS for ADHD, autism, and schizophrenia, calculated (using discovery effect size estimates and threshold of P < .05) from the largest available genome-wide association studies.Self-reported pregnancy-related measures capturing lifestyle behaviors, metabolism, infectious and autoimmune diseases, other physical health conditions, and medication use.Data were available for up to 14 539 mothers (mean [SD] age, 30.00 [4.45] years) and 14 897 fathers (mean [SD] age, 32.46 [5.13] years) of European ancestry. Modest but robust associations were observed between specific pregnancy-related measures and maternal PGS, including ADHD PGS with asthma (odds ratio [OR], 1.15 [95% CI, 1.06-1.25]), smoking (OR, 1.26 [95% CI, 1.19-1.33]), prepregnancy body mass index (β, 0.25 [95% CI, 0.18-0.31]), pregnancy weight gain (β, 0.20 [95% CI, 0.10-0.30]), taking folate (OR, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.88-0.96]), and not taking supplements (OR, 1.09 [95% CI, 1.04-1.14]). Schizophrenia PGS was associated with coffee consumption (OR, 1.09 [95% CI, 1.05-1.12]), smoking (OR, 1.12 [95% CI, 1.06-1.19]), prepregnancy body mass index (β, -0.18 [95% CI, -0.25 to -0.11]), and pregnancy weight gain (β, 0.17 [95% CI, 0.07-0.27]). All 3 PGSs associated with symptoms of depression/anxiety (ADHD: OR, 1.15 [95% CI, 1.09-1.22]; autism: OR, 1.13 [95% CI, 1.06-1.19]; schizophrenia: OR, 1.13 [95% CI, 1.07-1.20]). Associations were largely consistent for maternal and paternal PGS, except ADHD PGS and smoking (fathers: OR, 1.13 [95% CI, 1.09-1.17]).In this study, genetic liability to neurodevelopmental conditions that is passed from mothers to children was associated with several pregnancy-related factors and may therefore confound associations between these pregnancy-related factors and offspring neurodevelopment that have previously been thought to be causal. It is crucial that future study designs account for genetic confounding to obtain valid causal inferences so that accurate advice can be given to pregnant individuals."

Genetically predetermined levels or likelihood of presenting these traits were estimated for Mendelian randomization.Infertility (time-to-pregnancy ≥12 months).Having ever smoked was unrelated to infertility in women or men. Higher smoking intensity in women was associated with greater infertility odds (+1 standard deviation [SD, 48 cigarettes/week]: odds ratio [OR]crude,1.19; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.11-1.28; ORadjusted1.12; 95% CI, 1.03-1.21), also after adjusting for the partner's tobacco use. Later smoking initiation (+1 SD [3.2 years]: ORcrude,0.94; 95% CI, 0.88-0.99; ORadjusted0.89; 95% CI, 0.84-0.95) and smoking cessation (vs. not quitting: ORcrude,0.83; 95% CI, 0.75-0.91; ORadjusted,0.83; 95% CI, 0.75-0.93) were linked to decreased infertility in women. Nevertheless, Mendelian randomization results were not directionally consistent for smoking intensity and cessation and were estimated imprecisely in the 2-sample approach. In men, greater smoking intensity was not robustly associated with infertility in multivariable regression and Mendelian randomization.We did not find robust evidence of an effect of smoking on infertility. This may be due to a true lack of effect, weak genetic instruments, or other kinds of confounding.Copyright © 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
"35793592","Stratification of rheumatoid arthritis cohort using Ayurveda based deep phenotyping approach identifies novel genes in a GWAS.","J Ayurveda Integr Med","Genome wide association studies have scaled up both in terms of sample size and range of complex disorders investigated, but these have explained relatively little phenotypic variance. Of the several reasons, phenotypic heterogeneity seems to be a likely contributor for missing out genetic associations of large effects. Ayurveda, the traditional Indian system of medicine is one such tool which adopts a holistic deep phenotyping approach and classifies individuals based on their body constitution/prakriti. We hypothesized that Ayurveda based phenotypic stratification of healthy and diseased individuals will allow us to achieve much desired homogeneous cohorts which would facilitate detection of genetic association of large effects. In this proof of concept study, we performed a genome wide association testing of clinically diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis patients and healthy controls, who were re-phenotyped into Vata, Pitta and Kapha predominant prakriti sub-groups.Genotypes of rheumatoid arthritis cases (Vata = 49; Pitta = 117; Kapha = 78) and controls (Vata = 33; Pitta = 175; Kapha = 85) were retrieved from the total genotype data, used in a recent genome-wide association study performed in our laboratory. A total of 528461 SNPs were included after quality control. Prakriti-wise genome-wide association analysis was employed.This study identified (i) prakriti-specific novel disease risk genes of high effect sizes; (ii) putative candidates of novel therapeutic potential; and (iii) a good correlation between genetic findings and clinical knowledge in Ayurveda. Adopting Ayurveda based deep phenotyping may facilitate explaining hitherto undiscovered heritability in complex traits and may propel much needed progress in personalized medicine.Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

A study of functional connectivity in ADHD and pharmacologically challenged healthy volunteers with a genetic risk profile.","Transl Psychiatry","Recent GWAS allow us to calculate polygenic risk scores for ADHD. At the imaging level, resting-state fMRI analyses have given us valuable insights into changes in connectivity patterns in ADHD patients. However, no study has yet attempted to combine these two different levels of investigation. For this endeavor, we used a dopaminergic challenge fMRI study (L-DOPA) in healthy participants who were genotyped for their ADHD, MDD, schizophrenia, and body height polygenic risk score (PRS) and compared results with a study comparing ADHD patients and healthy controls. Our objective was to evaluate how L-DOPA-induced changes of reward-system-related FC are dependent on the individual polygenic risk score. FMRI imaging was used to evaluate resting-state functional connectivity (FC) of targeted subcortical structures in 27 ADHD patients and matched controls. In a second study, we evaluated the effect of ADHD and non-ADHD PRS in a L-DOPA-based pharmaco-fMRI-challenge in 34 healthy volunteers. The functional connectivity between the putamen and parietal lobe was decreased in ADHD patients. In healthy volunteers, the FC between putamen and parietal lobe was lower in ADHD high genetic risk participants. This direction of connectivity was reversed during L-DOPA challenge. Further findings are described for other dopaminergic subcortical structures. The FC between the putamen and the attention network showed the most consistent change in patients as well as in high-risk participants. Our results suggest that FC of the dorsal attention network is altered in adult ADHD as well as in healthy controls with higher genetic risk.© 2022. The Author(s)."

Drug repurposing offers a more efficient pathway compared with de novo drug discovery with lower cost and less risk. Various computational approaches have been applied to mine the vast amount of biomedical data generated over recent decades. Among these methods, network-based drug repurposing stands out as a potent tool for the comprehension of multiple domains of knowledge considering the interactions or associations of various factors. Aligned well with the poly-pharmacology paradigm shift in drug discovery, network-based approaches offer great opportunities to discover repurposing candidates for complex psychiatric disorders. In this review, we present the potential of network-based drug repurposing in psychiatry focusing on the incentives for using network-centric repurposing, major network-based repurposing strategies and data resources, applications in psychiatry and challenges of network-based drug repurposing. This review aims to provide readers with an update on network-based drug repurposing in psychiatry. We expect the repurposing approach to become a pivotal tool in the coming years to battle debilitating psychiatric disorders."
"35867573","KSHV Topologically Associating Domains in Latent and Reactivated Viral Chromatin.","J Virol","Eukaryotic genomes are structurally organized via the formation of multiple loops that create gene expression regulatory units called topologically associating domains (TADs). Here we revealed the KSHV TAD structure at 500 bp resolution and constructed a 3D KSHV genomic structural model with 2 kb binning. The latent KSHV genome formed very similar genomic architectures in three different naturally infected PEL cell lines and in an experimentally infected epithelial cell line. The majority of the TAD boundaries were occupied by structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC1) cohesin complex and CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), and the KSHV transactivator was recruited to those sites during reactivation. Triggering KSHV gene expression decreased prewired genomic loops within the regulatory unit, while contacts extending outside of regulatory borders increased, leading to formation of a larger regulatory unit with a shift from repressive to active compartments (B to A). The 3D genomic structural model proposes that the immediate early promoter region is localized on the periphery of the 3D viral genome during latency, while highly inducible noncoding RNA regions moved toward the inner space of the structure, resembling the configuration of a ""bird cage"" during reactivation. The compartment-like properties of viral episomal chromatin structure and its reorganization during the transition from latency may help facilitate viral gene transcription.IMPORTANCEThe 3D architecture of chromatin allows for efficient arrangement, expression, and replication of genetic material. The genomes of all organisms studied to date have been found to be organized through some form of tiered domain structures. However, the architectural framework of the genomes of large double-stranded DNA viruses such as the herpesvirus family has not been reported. Prior studies with Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) have indicated that the viral chromatin shares many biological properties exhibited by the host cell genome, essentially behaving as a mini human chromosome. Thus, we hypothesized that the KSHV genome may be organized in a similar manner. In this report, we describe the domain structure of the latent and lytic KSHV genome at 500 bp resolution and present a 3D genomic structural model for KSHV under each condition. These results add new insights into the complex regulation of the viral life cycle."

Thus, huge amounts of single-cell genomics data of unpaired observations on different cells are generated. We propose a method named UnpairReg for the regression analysis on unpaired observations to integrate single-cell multi-omics data. On real and simulated data, UnpairReg provides an accurate estimation of cell gene expression where only chromatin accessibility data is available. The cis-regulatory network inferred from UnpairReg is highly consistent with eQTL mapping.

"35817982","DeepLoop robustly maps chromatin interactions from sparse allele-resolved or single-cell Hi-C data at kilobase resolution.","Nat Genet","Mapping chromatin loops from noisy Hi-C heatmaps remains a major challenge. Here we present DeepLoop, which performs rigorous bias correction followed by deep-learning-based signal enhancement for robust chromatin interaction mapping from low-depth Hi-C data. DeepLoop enables loop-resolution, single-cell Hi-C analysis. It also achieves a cross-platform convergence between different Hi-C protocols and micrococcal nuclease (micro-C). DeepLoop allowed us to map the genetic and epigenetic determinants of allele-specific chromatin interactions in the human genome. We nominate new loci with allele-specific interactions governed by imprinting or allelic DNA methylation. We also discovered that, in the inactivated X chromosome (Xi), local loops at the DXZ4 'megadomain' boundary escape X-inactivation but the FIRRE 'superloop' locus does not. Importantly, DeepLoop can pinpoint heterozygous single-nucleotide polymorphisms and large structure variants that cause allelic chromatin loops, many of which rewire enhancers with transcription consequences. Taken together, DeepLoop expands the use of Hi-C to provide loop-resolution insights into the genetics of the three-dimensional genome.© 2022.

Here, we study the nuclear microenvironment of KSHV episomes and show that the KSHV latency-lytic replication switch is regulated via viral long non-coding (lnc)RNA-CHD4 (chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 4) interaction. KSHV episomes localize with CHD4 and ADNP proteins, components of the cellular ChAHP complex. The CHD4 and ADNP proteins occupy the 5'-region of the highly inducible lncRNAs and terminal repeats of the KSHV genome together with latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA). Viral lncRNA binding competes with CHD4 DNA binding, and KSHV reactivation sequesters CHD4 from the KSHV genome, which is also accompanied by detachment of KSHV episomes from host chromosome docking sites. We propose a model in which robust KSHV lncRNA expression determines the latency-lytic decision by regulating LANA/CHD4 binding to KSHV episomes.Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).

"35709140","Combined analyses of RNA-sequence and Hi-C along with GWAS loci-A novel approach to dissect keloid disorder genetic mechanism.","PLoS Genet","Keloid disorder is a tumour-like disease with invasive growth and a high recurrence rate. Genetic contribution is well expected due to the presence of autosomal dominant inheritance and various genetic mutations in keloid lesions. However, GWAS failed to reveal functional variants in exon regions but single nucleotide polymorphisms in the non-coding regions, suggesting the necessity of innovative genetic investigation. This study employed combined GWAS, RNA-sequence and Hi-C analyses to dissect keloid disorder genetic mechanisms using paired keloid tissues and normal skins. Differentially expressed genes, miRNAs and lncRNAs mined by RNA-sequence were identified to construct a network. From which, 8 significant pathways involved in keloid disorder pathogenesis were enriched and 6 of them were verified. Furthermore, topologically associated domains at susceptible loci were located via the Hi-C database and ten differentially expressed RNAs were identified. Among them, the functions of six molecules for cell proliferation, cell cycle and apoptosis were particularly examined and confirmed by overexpressing and knocking-down assays. This study firstly revealed unknown key biomarkers and pathways in keloid lesions using RNA-sequence and previously reported mutation loci, indicating a feasible approach to reveal the genetic contribution to keloid disorder and possibly to other diseases that are failed by GWAS analysis alone."

Previous work showed that a polymorphism in the PACAP-PAC1R (pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide) system is associated with PTSD risk in women, and PACAP (ADCYAP1)-PAC1R (ADCYAP1R1) are highly expressed in the hypothalamus. Here, we show that female mice subjected to acute stress immobilization (IMO) have fear extinction impairments related to Adcyap1 and Adcyap1r1 mRNA upregulation in the hypothalamus, PACAP-c-Fos downregulation in the Medial Amygdala (MeA), and PACAP-FosB/ΔFosB upregulation in the Ventromedial Hypothalamus dorsomedial part (VMHdm). DREADD-mediated inhibition of MeA neurons projecting to the VMHdm during IMO rescues both PACAP upregulation in VMHdm and the fear extinction impairment.

Therapy-related MDS (t-MDS) are classified by WHO together with therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia (t-AML) in the same group, named therapy-related myeloid neoplasm. However, in clinical practice, the diagnosis of t-MDS is made with the same criteria as for primitive MDS (p-MDS), and the only difference is a previous non-myeloid neoplasm. The prognosis and the consequent therapy can be established following the same criteria as for p-MDS, and the therapy is generally decided using the same criteria. We stress the possible difference in cytogenetics, mutations, and epigenetics to distinguish the two forms. Actually, there is no marker specific for t-MDS either in cytogenetics, epigenetics, or mutations; however, some alterations are also frequent in t-MDS and, in general, they induce a poorer prognosis. So, the high-risk forms in t-MDS are prevalent. The present literature data suggest classifying the t-MDS as a subgroup of MDS and introducing some parameters to evaluate the probability of previous therapy in inducing MDS. An important issue remains the patient's fitness, which strongly influences the outcome."

However, single cell Hi-C (scHi-C) data suffer severely from sparsity, that is, the existence of excess zeros due to insufficient sequencing depth. Complicating the matter further is the fact that not all zeros are created equal: some are due to loci truly not interacting because of the underlying biological mechanism (structural zeros); others are indeed due to insufficient sequencing depth (sampling zeros or dropouts), especially for loci that interact infrequently. Differentiating between structural zeros and dropouts is important since correct inference would improve downstream analyses such as clustering and discovery of subtypes. Nevertheless, distinguishing between these two types of zeros has received little attention in the single cell Hi-C literature, where the issue of sparsity has been addressed mainly as a data quality improvement problem. To fill this gap, in this paper, we propose HiCImpute, a Bayesian hierarchical model that goes beyond data quality improvement by also identifying observed zeros that are in fact structural zeros. HiCImpute takes spatial dependencies of scHi-C 2D data structure into account while also borrowing information from similar single cells and bulk data, when such are available. Through an extensive set of analyses of synthetic and real data, we demonstrate the ability of HiCImpute for identifying structural zeros with high sensitivity, and for accurate imputation of dropout values. Downstream analyses using data improved from HiCImpute yielded much more accurate clustering of cell types compared to using observed data or data improved by several comparison methods. Most significantly, HiCImpute-improved data have led to the identification of subtypes within each of the excitatory neuronal cells of L4 and L5 in the prefrontal cortex."

A causative missense mutation (G434V) was found in the voltage-gated potassium channel, subfamily C member 3 (Kcnc3)gene in a region that encodes a transmembrane voltage sensor. Generation of a Kcnc3G434VCRISPR mutant mouse confirmed this mutation as the cause of the learning defects. While G434V had no effect on transcription, translation, or trafficking of the channel, electrophysiological analysis of the G434V mutant channel revealed a complete loss of voltage-gated conductance, a broadening of the action potential, and decreased neuronal firing.

Here we will for once roll the clock back to the times that the science of the glucocorticoid hormone was honored with a Nobel prize and highlight the discovery of their receptors in the hippocampus as inroad to its current status as master regulator in control of stress coping and adaptation. Glucocorticoids operate in concert with numerous neurotransmitters, neuropeptides, and other hormones with the aim to facilitate processing of information in the neurocircuitry of stress, from anticipation and perception of a novel experience to behavioral adaptation and memory storage. This action, exerted by the glucocorticoids, is guided by two complementary receptor systems, mineralocorticoid receptors (MR) and glucocorticoid receptors (GR), that need to be balanced for a healthy stress response pattern. Here we discuss the cellular, neuroendocrine, and behavioral studies underlying the MR:GR balance concept, highlight the relevance of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) -axis patterns and note the limited understanding yet of sexual dimorphism in glucocorticoid actions. We conclude with the prospect that (i) genetically and epigenetically regulated receptor variants dictate cell-type-specific transcriptome signatures of stress-related neuropsychiatric symptoms and (ii) selective receptor modulators are becoming available for more targeted treatment. These two new developments may help to 'restart the clock' with the prospect to support resilience.© 2022 Published by Elsevier Inc."

However, because PAF requires reviewing large numbers of antimicrobial orders on a case-by-case basis, PAF programs are highly resource intensive. The current study aimed to identify predictors of ASP intervention (ie, feedback) and to build models to identify orders that can be safely bypassed from review, to make PAF programs more efficient.We performed a retrospective cross-sectional study of inpatient antimicrobial orders reviewed by the University of Maryland Medical Center's PAF program between 2017 and 2019. We evaluated the relationship between antimicrobial and patient characteristics with ASP intervention using multivariable logistic regression models. Separately, we built prediction models for ASP intervention using statistical and machine learning approaches and evaluated performance on held-out data.Across 17 503 PAF reviews, 4219 (24%) resulted in intervention. In adjusted analyses, a clinical pharmacist on the ordering unit or receipt of an infectious disease consult were associated with 17% and 56% lower intervention odds, respectively (adjusted odds ratios [aORs], 0.83 and 0.44;P ≤ .001 for both). Fluoroquinolones had the highest adjusted intervention odds (aOR, 3.22 [95% confidence interval, 2.63-3.96]). A machine learning classifier (C-statistic 0.76) reduced reviews by 49% while achieving 78% sensitivity. A ""workflow simplified"" regression model that restricted to antimicrobial class and clinical indication variables, 2 strong machine learning-identified predictors, reduced reviews by one-third while achieving 81% sensitivity.Prediction models substantially reduced PAF review caseloads while maintaining high sensitivities.

Lindl. polysaccharides (ARPs) have been reported to exhibit multiple pharmacological activities including anti-inflammatory and anti-hyperglycemia. This study aims to investigate the effect of ARPs on cognitive dysfunction induced by high fat diet (HFD).Six-week-old male mice were treated with ARPs by dietary supplementation for 14 weeks. The effect of ARPs on cognitive function was determined by assessing the changes in spatial learning and memory ability, neurotrophic factors in hippocampus, inflammatory parameters, intestinal barrier integrity, and gut microbiota.ARPs supplementation can effectively ameliorate cognitive dysfunction, decrease the phosphorylation levels of Tau protein in hippocampus. Meanwhile, the increased body weight, plasma glucose, total cholesterol, inflammatory factors induced by HFD were abolished by ARPs treatment. Furthermore, ARPs treatment restored the intestinal epithelial barrier as evidenced by upregulation of intestinal tight junction proteins. Additionally, ARPs supplementation significantly decreased the relative abundance of several bacteria genus such asParabacteroides, which may play regulatory roles in cognitive function.These results suggest that ARPs might be a promising strategy for the treatment of cognitive dysfunction induced by HFD. Mechanistically, alleviation of cognitive dysfunction by ARPs might be associated with the ""gut-brain"" axis.© 2022 Fu et al."

Because of these confounding factors, the development of reliable diagnostics and targeted treatments for brain injury remains elusive. We argue that the development of effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for TBI requires a deep understanding of human neurophysiology at the molecular level and that the framework of multiomics may provide some effective solutions for the diagnosis and treatment of this challenging condition. To this end, we present here a comprehensive review of TBI biomarker candidates from across the multiomic disciplines and compare them with known signatures associated with other neuropsychological conditions, including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. We believe that this integrated view will facilitate a deeper understanding of the pathophysiology of TBI and its potential links to other neurological diseases.© The Author(s) 2022."

The advent of long-read sequencing technologies offers the opportunity to study the role of genetic variation in transcript structure8-16. In this Article, we present a large human long-read RNA-seq dataset using the Oxford Nanopore Technologies platform from 88 samples from Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) tissues and cell lines, complementing the GTEx resource. We identified just over 70,000 novel transcripts for annotated genes, and validated the protein expression of 10% of novel transcripts. We developed a new computational package, LORALS, to analyse the genetic effects of rare and common variants on the transcriptome by allele-specific analysis of long reads. We characterized allele-specific expression and transcript structure events, providing new insights into the specific transcript alterations caused by common and rare genetic variants and highlighting the resolution gained from long-read data. We were able to perturb the transcript structure upon knockdown of PTBP1, an RNA binding protein that mediates splicing, thereby finding genetic regulatory effects that are modified by the cellular environment. Finally, we used this dataset to enhance variant interpretation and study rare variants leading to aberrant splicing patterns.© 2022.

"35844237","Multiplexed Visualization Method to Explore Complete Targeting Regulatory Relationships Among Circadian Genes for Insomnia Treatment.","Front Neurosci","Understanding the complete map of melatonin synthesis, the information transfer network among circadian genes in pineal gland, promises to resolve outstanding issues in endocrine systems and improve the clinical diagnosis and treatment level of insomnia, immune disease and hysterical depression. Currently, some landmark studies have revealed some genes that regulate circadian rhythm associated with melatonin synthesis. However, these studies don't give a complete map of melatonin synthesis, as transfer information among circadian genes in pineal gland is lost. New biotechnology, integrates dynamic sequential omics and multiplexed imaging method, has been used to visualize the complete process of melatonin synthesis. It is found that there are two extremely significant information transfer processes involved in melatonin synthesis. In the first stage, as the light intensity decreased, melatonin synthesis mechanism has started, which is embodied in circadian genes,Rel, Polr2A, Mafk, andSrbf1become active. In the second stage, circadian genesHif1a, Bach1, Clock, E2f6, andPer2are regulated simultaneously by four genes,Rel, Polr2A, Mafk, andSrbf1and contribute genetic information toAanat. The expeditious growth in this technique offer reference for an overall understanding of gene-to-gene regulatory relationship among circadian genes in pineal gland. In the study, dynamic sequential omics and the analysis process well provide the current state and future perspectives to better diagnose and cure diseases associated with melatonin synthesis disorder.Copyright © 2022 Li, Liu, Wang, Zuo, Wang, Ju, Wang, Xing, Ling, Liu, Zhang, Zhou, Yin, Cao and Gao."

However, its diagnostic value for PCa remains controversial. Based on the data from the latest literature published in the past decade, the present review was conducted to clarify the diagnostic value of cfDNA in PCa.The related studies were systematically searched in the databases of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library from January 1, 2010 to December 1, 2020. Sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPE), and other relative parameters were pooled using a random model.14 eligible studies with 1049 PCa patients and 973 controls were selected based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Results demonstrated that cfDNA showed favorable SPE (0.89, 95% CI: 0.79, 0.94) but unsatisfied SEN (0.56, 95% CI: 0.43, 0.68) in the PCa diagnosis. The positive likelihood ratios (PLR), negative likelihood ratios (NLR), and diagnostic odds ratios (DOR) were 5.1 (95% CI: 3.1, 8.5), 0.49 (95% CI: 0.39, 0.63), and 10 (95% CI: 6, 17), respectively. The summary receiver operating characteristic graph (SROC) with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.80 (95% CI: 0.76, 0.83) was constructed which indicated favorable diagnostic accuracy for PCa. Results of the subgroup analysis and metaregression analysis reminded ""ethnicity"" and ""methylation"" might be sources of heterogeneity. The potential publication bias was not found using Deek's funnel plot asymmetry test (p> 0.05).Our meta-analysis illustrated that the cfDNA could undertake a promising role in the PCa diagnosis.Copyright © 2022 Cong Zhang et al."

However, little is known about the mechanisms of transferring effector messages between the primary tumor and the site of metastasis. Exosomes provide a novel transfer message method, and exosomal circular RNAs (circRNAs) play critical regulatory roles in cancer biology. In this study, the results showed that the expression of circPABPC1 was aberrantly upregulated in CRC tissues and exosomes. Exosomal circPABPC1 was considered an oncogene by functional experimental analysis in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, circPABPC1 recruited KDM4C to the HMGA2 promoter, reduced its H3K9me3 modification and initiated the transcription process in the nucleus. Moreover, cytoplasmic circPABPC1 promoted CRC progression by protecting ADAM19 and BMP4 from miR-874-/miR-1292-mediated degradation. Our findings indicated that exosomal circPABPC1 is an essential regulator in CRC liver metastasis progression by promoting HMGA2 and BMP4/ADAM19 expression. CircPABPC1 is expected to be a novel biomarker and antimetastatic therapeutic target in CRC.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35666111","Quantifying concordant genetic effects of de novo mutations on multiple disorders.","Elife","Exome sequencing on tens of thousands of parent-proband trios has identified numerous deleterious de novo mutations (DNMs) and implicated risk genes for many disorders. Recent studies have suggested shared genes and pathways are enriched for DNMs across multiple disorders. However, existing analytic strategies only focus on genes that reach statistical significance for multiple disorders and require large trio samples in each study. As a result, these methods are not able to characterize the full landscape of genetic sharing due to polygenicity and incomplete penetrance. In this work, we introduce EncoreDNM, a novel statistical framework to quantify shared genetic effects between two disorders characterized by concordant enrichment of DNMs in the exome. EncoreDNM makes use of exome-wide, summary-level DNM data, including genes that do not reach statistical significance in single-disorder analysis, to evaluate the overall and annotation-partitioned genetic sharing between two disorders. Applying EncoreDNM to DNM data of nine disorders, we identified abundant pairwise enrichment correlations, especially in genes intolerant to pathogenic mutations and genes highly expressed in fetal tissues. These results suggest that EncoreDNM improves current analytic approaches and may have broad applications in DNM studies.© 2022, Guo et al."

Here, we evaluate the efficacy of MS proteomics applied to human peripheral fluids of schizophrenia (SCZ) patients to identify disease biomarkers and relevant networks of biological pathways. Following PRISMA guidelines, a search was performed for studies that used MS proteomics approaches to identify proteomic differences between SCZ patients and healthy control groups (PROSPERO database: CRD42021274183). Nineteen articles fulfilled the inclusion criteria, allowing the identification of 217 differentially expressed proteins. Gene ontology analysis identified lipid metabolism, complement and coagulation cascades, and immune response as the main enriched biological pathways. Meta-analysis results suggest the upregulation of FCN3 and downregulation of APO1, APOA2, APOC1, and APOC3 in SCZ patients. Despite the proven ability of MS proteomics to characterize SCZ, several confounding factors contribute to the heterogeneity of the findings. In the future, we encourage the scientific community to perform studies with more extensive sampling and validation cohorts, integrating omics with bioinformatics tools to provide additional comprehension of differentially expressed proteins. The produced information could harbor potential proteomic biomarkers of SCZ, contributing to individualized prognosis and stratification strategies, besides aiding in the differential diagnosis."

Among the changes, enhanced oxidative phosphorylation is critical for supporting high energy demands of postimplantation embryos, but increases mitochondrial oxidative stress, which in turn threatens mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) stability. However, how mitochondria protect their own histone-lacking mtDNA, during this stage remains unclear. Concurrently, the mitochondrial genome gain DNA methylation by this stage. Its spatiotemporal coincidence with enhanced mitochondrial stress led us to ask if mtDNA methylation has a role in maintaining mitochondrial genome stability. Herein, we report that mitochondrial genome undergoes de novo mtDNA methylation that can protect mtDNA against enhanced oxidative damage during the peri-implantation window. Mitochondrial genome gains extensive mtDNA methylation during transition from blastocysts to postimplantation embryos, thus establishing relatively hypermethylated mtDNA from hypomethylated state in blastocysts. Mechanistic study revealed that DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A) and DNMT3B enter mitochondria during this process and bind to mtDNA, via their unique mitochondrial targeting sequences. Importantly, loss- and gain-of-function analyses indicated that DNMT3A and DNMT3B are responsible for catalyzing de novo mtDNA methylation, in a synergistic manner. Finally, we proved, in vivo and in vitro, that increased mtDNA methylation functions to protect mitochondrial genome against mtDNA damage induced by increased mitochondrial oxidative stress. Together, we reveal mtDNA methylation dynamics and its underlying mechanism during the critical developmental window. We also provide the functional link between mitochondrial epigenetic remodeling and metabolic changes, which reveals a role for nuclear-mitochondrial crosstalk in establishing mitoepigenetics and maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis."

Right eyes were covered with a -6D lens to induce myopia. Meanwhile, LIM + EA group and LIM + sham group were treated with EA at acupoints Hegu (LI4) and Taiyang (EX-HN5) and sham points. Refraction, axial length (AL), choroidal thickness (ChT), vessel density of choriocapillaris (CC) and choroidal layer, and scleral collagen fiber were measured. Besides, hypoxia-inducible factor-1α(HIF-1α), matrix metalloprotein-2 (MMP-2), and tissue inhibitor metalloprotease-2 (TIMP-2) expression in sclera were detected.Refraction and AL were significantly decreased and ChT and vessel density of CC were significantly increased in LIM + EA group at 2 weeks and 4 weeks (allP< 0.05) compared with LIM group. However, no significant difference of vessel density of choroidal layer was observed between LIM and LIM + EA group at 2 weeks and 4 weeks. Scleral collagen fibrils diameters were significantly increased in LIM + EA group at 4 weeks (P< 0.001) compared with LIM group. At the end of experiment, the mRNA and protein expression of HIF-1αand MMP-2 were significantly decreased (allP< 0.05) and those of TIMP-2 were increased in LIM + EA, compared with LIM. However, there were no significant differences between LIM and LIM + sham group.EA can improve the vessel density of choroid and then possibly improve scleral hypoxia, which may inhibit the growth of the AL in myopia guinea pig.Copyright © 2022 Ting Yu et al."
"35907790","Metabolomic predictors of phenotypic traits can replace and complement measured clinical variables in population-scale expression profiling studies.","BMC Genomics","Population-scale expression profiling studies can provide valuable insights into biological and disease-underlying mechanisms. The availability of phenotypic traits is essential for studying clinical effects. Therefore, missing, incomplete, or inaccurate phenotypic information can make analyses challenging and prevent RNA-seq or other omics data to be reused. A possible solution are predictors that infer clinical or behavioral phenotypic traits from molecular data. While such predictors have been developed based on different omics data types and are being applied in various studies, metabolomics-based surrogates are less commonly used than predictors based on DNA methylation profiles.In this study, we inferred 17 traits, including diabetes status and exposure to lipid medication, using previously trained metabolomic predictors. We evaluated whether these metabolomic surrogates can be used as an alternative to reported information for studying the respective phenotypes using expression profiling data of four population cohorts. For the majority of the 17 traits, the metabolomic surrogates performed similarly to the reported phenotypes in terms of effect sizes, number of significant associations, replication rates, and significantly enriched pathways.The application of metabolomics-derived surrogate outcomes opens new possibilities for reuse of multi-omics data sets. In studies where availability of clinical metadata is limited, missing or incomplete information can be complemented by these surrogates, thereby increasing the size of available data sets. Additionally, the availability of such surrogates could be used to correct for potential biological confounding. In the future, it would be interesting to further investigate the use of molecular predictors across different omics types and cohorts.© 2022. The Author(s)."

Miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements (MITEs), some of which are known as active nonautonomous DNA transposons with high copy numbers, play important roles in genome evolution and diversification. AhMITE1, a member of the MITE family of transposons, but information on the peanut genomes is still limited. Here, we analyzed AhMITE1, AuMITE1 and ApMITE1 in the cultivated (A. hypogaea) and two wild peanut (A. duranensis and A. ipaensis) genomes.The cultivated and the two wild peanut genomes harbored 142, 14 and 21 AhMITE1, AuMITE1 and ApMITE1 family members, respectively. These three family members exhibited highly conserved TIR sequences, and insertions preferentially occurred within 2 kb upstream and downstream of gene-coding and AT-rich regions. Phylogenetic and pairwise nucleotide diversity analysis showed that AhMITE1 and ApMITE1 family members have undergone one round of amplification bursts during the evolution of the peanut genome. PCR analyses were performed in 23 peanut varieties and demonstrated that AhMITE1 is an active transposon and that hybridization or chemical mutagenesis can promote the mobilization of AhMITE1.AhMITE1, AuMITE1 and ApMITE1 family members were identified based on local BLAST search with MAK between the cultivated and the two wild peanut genomes. The phylogenetic, nucleotide diversity and variation copy numbers of AhMITE1, AuMITE1 and ApMITE1 members provides opportunities for investigating their roles during peanut evolution. These findings will contribute to knowledge on diversity of AhMITE1, provide information about the potential impact on the gene expression and promote the development of DNA markers in peanut.© 2022.

We have previously demonstrated that Eomes-positive helper T (Eomes + Th) cells recognizing LINE-1(L1)-derived prototypic antigen ORF1 mediate neurotoxicity associated with the neurodegenerative pathology of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Here, we show that Eomes + Th cells accumulate in the CNS of mouse models of authentic neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), and secrete the neurotoxic granzyme B after encounter with ORF1 antigen. Multimodal derepression of neuronal L1 transcription is observed in EAE and ALS/AD models during neurodegeneration in active and cell cycle-mediated manner, respectively.

The underlying mechanisms of AF is remained to be revealed and current treatment options for AF have limitations. Besides, a detection system can help identify those at risk of developing AF and will enable personalized management.In this study, we utilized the robust rank aggregation method to integrate six AF microarray datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus database, and identified a set of differentially expressed genes between patients with AF and controls. Potential compounds were identified by mining the Connectivity Map database. Functional modules and closely-interacted clusters were identified using weighted gene co-expression network analysis and protein-protein interaction network, respectively. The overlapped hub genes were further filtered. Subsequent analyses were performed to analyze the function, biological features, and regulatory networks. Moreover, a reliable Machine Learning-based diagnostic model was constructed and visualized to clarify the diagnostic features of these genes.A total of 156 upregulated and 34 downregulated genes were identified, some of which had not been previously investigated. We showed that mitogen-activated protein kinase and epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors were likely to mitigate AF based on Connectivity Map analysis. Four genes, includingCXCL12, LTBP1, LOXL1, andIGFBP3, were identified as hub genes.CXCL12was shown to play an important role in regulation of local inflammatory response and immune cell infiltration. Regulation ofCXCL12expression in AF was analyzed by constructing a transcription factor-miRNA-mRNA network. The Machine Learning-based diagnostic model generated in this study showed good efficacy and reliability.Key genes involving in the pathogenesis of AF and potential therapeutic compounds for AF were identified. The biological features ofCXCL12in AF were investigated using integrative bioinformatics tools. The results suggested thatCXCL12might be a biomarker that could be used for distinguishing subsets of AF, and indicated thatCXCL12might be an important intermediate in the development of AF.

It is currently not possible to accurately predict who will benefit from the specific types of NACT. DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism known to play an important role in regulating gene expression and may serve as a biomarker for treatment response and survival. We investigated the potential role of DNA methylation as a prognostic marker for long-term survival (> 5 years) after NACT in breast cancer.DNA methylation profiles of pre-treatment (n = 55) and post-treatment (n = 75) biopsies from 83 women with locally advanced breast cancer were investigated using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. The patients received neoadjuvant treatment with epirubicin and/or paclitaxel. Linear mixed models were used to associate DNA methylation to treatment response and survival based on clinical response to NACT (partial response or stable disease) and 5-year survival, respectively. LASSO regression was performed to identify a risk score based on the statistically significant methylation sites and Kaplan-Meier curve analysis was used to estimate survival probabilities using ten years of survival follow-up data. The risk score developed in our discovery cohort was validated in an independent validation cohort consisting of paired pre-treatment and post-treatment biopsies from 85 women with locally advanced breast cancer. Patients included in the validation cohort were treated with either doxorubicin or 5-FU and mitomycin NACT.DNA methylation patterns changed from before to after NACT in 5-year survivors, while no significant changes were observed in non-survivors or related to treatment response. DNA methylation changes included an overall loss of methylation at CpG islands and gain of methylation in non-CpG islands, and these changes affected genes linked to transcription factor activity, cell adhesion and immune functions. A risk score was developed based on four methylation sites which successfully predicted long-term survival in our cohort (p = 0.0034) and in an independent validation cohort (p = 0.049).Our results demonstrate that DNA methylation patterns in breast tumors change in response to NACT. These changes in DNA methylation show potential as prognostic biomarkers for breast cancer survival.© 2022. The Author(s)."

Moreover, a dynamic D-loop methylation pattern was observed in the brain of transgenic AD mice along with disease progression. However, investigations on the blood cells of AD patients in the prodromal phases of the disease have not been performed so far. The aim of this study was to analyze D-loop methylation levels by means of the MS-HRM technique in the peripheral blood cells of 14 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients, 18 early stage AD patients, 70 advanced stage AD patients, and 105 healthy control subjects. We found higher D-loop methylation levels in MCI patients than in control subjects and AD patients. Moreover, higher D-loop methylation levels were observed in control subjects than in AD patients in advanced stages of the disease, but not in those at early stages. The present pilot study shows that peripheral D-loop methylation levels differ in patients at different stages of AD pathology, suggesting that further studies deserve to be performed in order to validate the usefulness of D-loop methylation analysis as a peripheral biomarker for the early detection of AD."

To test the hypothesis that STMN2 loss contributes to ALS pathogenesis, we generated constitutive and conditional STMN2 knockout mice. Constitutive STMN2 loss results in early-onset sensory and motor neuropathy featuring impaired motor behavior and dramatic distal neuromuscular junction (NMJ) denervation of fast-fatigable motor units, which are selectively vulnerable in ALS, without axon or motoneuron degeneration. Selective excision of STMN2 in motoneurons leads to similar NMJ pathology. STMN2 knockout heterozygous mice, which better model the partial loss of STMN2 protein found in patients with ALS, display a slowly progressive, motor-selective neuropathy with functional deficits and NMJ denervation. Thus, our findings strongly support the hypothesis that STMN2 reduction owing to TDP-43 pathology contributes to ALS pathogenesis.Copyright © 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

A meta-analysis of miRNAs dysregulated in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, dementia with Lewy bodies and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (TDP43 variant) was performed to determine if diseases within a proteinopathy have distinct or shared mechanisms of action leading to neuronal death, and if proteinopathies can be classified on the basis of their miRNA profiles. Our results identified both miRNAs distinct to the anatomy, disease type and pathology, and miRNAs consistently dysregulated within single proteinopathies and across neurodegeneration in general. Our results also highlight the necessity to minimize the variability between studies. These findings showcase the need for more transcriptomic research on infrequently occurring NDDs, and the need for the standardization of research techniques and platforms utilized across labs and diseases."

Possible mechanisms for this observation are epigenetic modifications in utero that have lasting effects on developmental programs in children of mothers with asthma. To test this hypothesis, we performed differential DNA methylation analyses of 398,186 individual CpG sites in primary bronchial epithelial cells (BECs) from 42 nonasthma controls and 88 asthma cases, including 56 without MA (NMA) and 32 with MA. We used weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) of 69 and 554 differentially methylated CpGs (DMCs) that were specific to NMA and MA cases, respectively, compared with controls. WGCNA grouped 66 NMA-DMCs and 203 MA-DMCs into two and five comethylation modules, respectively. The eigenvector of one MA-associated module (turquoise) was uniquely correlated with 85 genes expressed in BECs and enriched for 36 pathways, 16 of which discriminated between NMA and MA using machine learning. Genes in all 16 pathways were decreased in MA compared with NMA cases (P = 7.1 × 10−3), a finding that replicated in nasal epithelial cells from an independent cohort (P = 0.02). Functional interpretation of these pathways suggested impaired T cell signaling and responses to viral and bacterial pathogens. The MA-associated turquoise module eigenvector was additionally correlated with clinical features of severe asthma and reflective of type 2 (T2)-low asthma (i.e., low total serum immunoglobulin E, fractional exhaled nitric oxide, and eosinophilia). Overall, these data suggest that MA alters diverse epigenetically mediated pathways that lead to distinct subtypes of severe asthma in adults, including hard-to-treat T2-low asthma."
"35712080","Neurodevelopmental disorders, immunity, and cancer are connected.","iScience","Immunity could be viewed as the common factor in neurodevelopmental disorders and cancer. The immune and nervous systems coevolve as the embryo develops. Immunity can release cytokines that activate MAPK signaling in neural cells. In specific embryonic brain cell types, dysregulated signaling that results from germline or embryonic mutations can promote changes in chromatin organization and gene accessibility, and thus expression levels of essential genes in neurodevelopment. In cancer, dysregulated signaling can emerge from sporadic somatic mutations during human life. Neurodevelopmental disorders and cancer share similarities. In neurodevelopmental disorders, immunity, and cancer, there appears an almost invariable involvement of small GTPases (e.g., Ras, RhoA, and Rac) and their pathways. TLRs, IL-1, GIT1, and FGFR signaling pathways, all can be dysregulated in neurodevelopmental disorders and cancer. Although there are signaling similarities, decisive differentiating factors are timing windows, and cell type specific perturbation levels, pointing to chromatin reorganization.

Using a rare collection of bone samples gathered from across northern Australia, we applied skeletochronology and characterized the length-at-age relationship, established baseline growth rates from the hatchling to adult life stages, and produced empirical estimates of age-at- and size-at-sexual-maturation (ASM, SSM). We analyzed humeri from 74 flatback sea turtles ranging in body size from 6.0-96.0 cm curved carapace length (CCL), and recovered from Western Australia (n = 48), Eastern Australia (n = 13), central Australia (n = 8; Northern Territory n = 3, the Gulf of Carpentaria n = 5), and unknown locations (n = 5). We identified the onset of sexual maturity for 29 turtles, based on rapprochement growth patterns in the bones. Estimates for ASM ranged from 12.0 to 23.0 years (mean: 16.3 ± 0.53 SE), SSM ranged from 76.1 to 94.0 cm CCL (mean: 84.9 ± 0.90 SE), and maximum observed reproductive longevity was 31 years for a 45-year old male flatback. Growth was modeled as a smoothing spline fit to the size-at-age relationship and at the mean SSM (84.9 cm CCL) corresponded with a spline-predicted maturity age of 18 years (95% CI: 16 to 24), while mean nesting sizes reported in the literature (86.4 to 94 cm CCL) corresponded to estimated ages of 24+ years. A bootstrapped von Bertalanffy growth model was also applied and showed consistencies with the spline curve, yielding an estimated upper size limit, Linf, at 89.2 ± 0.04 cm (95% CI: 85.5 to 95.9 cm) with the intrinsic growth rate parameter, k, at 0.185 ± 0.0004 (0.16 to 0.22); at the same mean SSM (84.9 cm CCL) the estimated ASM was 16.3 ± 0.05 years (95% CI: 12.8 to 27.7 years). Lastly, four of the samples analyzed were collected from deceased adult females that had previous sizes known from on-going mark/recapture studies at nesting sites in Western Australia. The paired CCL data (measured at nesting and back-calculated) did not significantly differ (p = 0.875). This first skeletochronology study for flatback sea turtles generates valuable empirical estimates for ongoing conservation and management efforts."
"35822016","Aging: What We Can Learn From Elephants.","Front Aging","Elephants are large-brained, social mammals with a long lifespan. Studies of elephants can provide insight into the aging process, which may be relevant to understanding diseases that affect elderly humans because of their shared characteristics that have arisen through independent evolution. Elephants become sexually mature at 12 to 14 years of age and are known to live into, and past, their 7thdecade of life. Because of their relatively long lifespans, elephants may have evolved mechanisms to counter age-associated morbidities, such as cancer and cognitive decline. Elephants rely heavily on their memory, and engage in multiple levels of competitive and collaborative relationships because they live in a fission-fusion system. Female matrilineal relatives and dependent offspring form tight family units led by an older-aged matriarch, who serves as the primary repository for social and ecological knowledge in the herd. Similar to humans, elephants demonstrate a dependence on social bonds, memory, and cognition to navigate their environment, behaviors that might be associated with specializations of brain anatomy. Compared with other mammals, the elephant hippocampus is proportionally smaller, whereas the temporal lobe is disproportionately large and expands laterally. The elephant cerebellum is also relatively enlarged, and the cerebral cortex is highly convoluted with numerous gyral folds, more than in humans. Last, an interesting characteristic unique to elephants is the presence of at least 20 copies of theTP53tumor suppressor gene.Humans have only a single copy.TP53encodes for the p53 protein, which is known to orchestrate cellular response to DNA damage. The effects of these multiple copies ofTP53are still being investigated, but it may be to protect elephants against multiple age-related diseases. For these reasons, among others, studies of elephants would be highly informative for aging research. Elephants present an underappreciated opportunity to explore further common principles of aging in a large-brained mammal with extended longevity. Such research can contribute to contextualizing our knowledge of age-associated morbidities in humans.Copyright © 2021 Chusyd, Ackermans, Austad, Hof, Mielke, Sherwood and Allison."
"35846154","RNA-SSNV: A Reliable Somatic Single Nucleotide Variant Identification Framework for Bulk RNA-Seq Data.","Front Genet","The usage of expressed somatic mutations may have a unique advantage in identifying active cancer driver mutations. However, accurately calling mutations from RNA-seq data is difficult due to confounding factors such as RNA-editing, reverse transcription, and gap alignment. In the present study, we proposed a framework (named RNA-SSNV, https://github.com/pmglab/RNA-SSNV) to call somatic single nucleotide variants (SSNV) from tumor bulk RNA-seq data. Based on a comprehensive multi-filtering strategy and a machine-learning classification model trained with comprehensively curated features, RNA-SSNV achieved the best precision-recall rate (0.880-0.884) in a testing dataset and robustly retained 0.94 AUC for the precision-recall curve in three validation adult-based TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) datasets. We further showed that the somatic mutations called by RNA-SSNV tended to have a higher functional impact and therapeutic power in known driver genes. Furthermore, VAF (variant allele fraction) analysis revealed that subclonal harboring expressed mutations had evolutional selection advantage and RNA had higher detection power to rescue DNA-omitted mutations. In sum, RNA-SSNV will be a useful approach to accurately call expressed somatic mutations for a more insightful analysis of cancer drive genes and carcinogenic mechanisms.Copyright © 2022 Long, Yuan and Li."
"35769342","OPUSeq simplifies detection of low-frequency DNA variants and uncovers fragmentase-associated artifacts.","NAR Genom Bioinform","Detection of low-frequency DNA variants (below 1%) is becoming increasingly important in biomedical research and clinical practice, but is challenging to do with standard sequencing approaches due to high error rates. The use of double-stranded unique molecular identifiers (dsUMIs) allows correction of errors by comparing reads arising from the same original DNA duplex. However, the implementation of such approaches is still challenging. Here, we present a novel method, one-pot dsUMI sequencing (OPUSeq), which allows incorporation of dsUMIs in the same reaction as the library PCR. This obviates the need for adapter pre-synthesis or additional enzymatic steps. OPUSeq can be incorporated into standard DNA library preparation approaches and coupled with hybridization target capture. We demonstrate successful error correction and detection of variants down to allele frequency of 0.01%. Using OPUSeq, we also show that the use of enzymatic fragmentation can lead to the appearance of spurious double-stranded variants, interfering with detection of variant fractions below 0.1%.© The Author(s) 2022.

"35753349","A new deep learning technique reveals the exclusive functional contributions of individual cancer mutations.","J Biol Chem","Cancers are caused by genomic alterations that may be inherited, induced by environmental carcinogens, or caused due to random replication errors. Postinduction of carcinogenicity, mutations further propagate and drastically alter the cancer genomes. Although a subset of driver mutations has been identified and characterized to date, most cancer-related somatic mutations are indistinguishable from germline variants or other noncancerous somatic mutations. Thus, such overlap impedes appreciation of many deleterious but previously uncharacterized somatic mutations. The major bottleneck arises due to patient-to-patient variability in mutational profiles, making it difficult to associate specific mutations with a given disease outcome. Here, we describe a newly developed technique Continuous Representation of Codon Switches (CRCS), a deep learning-based method that allows us to generate numerical vector representations of mutations, thereby enabling numerous machine learning-based tasks. We demonstrate three major applications of CRCS; first, we show how CRCS can help detect cancer-related somatic mutations in the absence of matched normal samples, which has applications in cell-free DNA-based assessment of tumor mutation burden. Second, the proposed approach also enables identification and exploration of driver genes; our analyses implicate DMD, RSK4, OFD1, WDR44, and AFF2 as potential cancer drivers. Finally, we used CRCS to score individual mutations in a tumor sample, which was found to be predictive of patient survival in bladder urothelial carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and lung adenocarcinoma. Taken together, we propose CRCS as a valuable computational tool for analysis of the functional significance of individual cancer mutations.Copyright © 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

"35666194","The impact of genetic modifiers on variation in germline mutation rates within and among human populations.","Genetics","Mutation rates and spectra differ among human populations. Here, we examine whether this variation could be explained by evolution at mutation modifiers. To this end, we consider genetic modifier sites at which mutations, ""mutator alleles,"" increase genome-wide mutation rates and model their evolution under purifying selection due to the additional deleterious mutations that they cause, genetic drift, and demographic processes. We solve the model analytically for a constant population size and characterize how evolution at modifier sites impacts variation in mutation rates within and among populations. We then use simulations to study the effects of modifier sites under a plausible demographic model for Africans and Europeans. When comparing populations that evolve independently, weakly selected modifier sites (2Nes≈1), which evolve slowly, contribute the most to variation in mutation rates. In contrast, when populations recently split from a common ancestral population, strongly selected modifier sites (2Nes≫1), which evolve rapidly, contribute the most to variation between them. Moreover, a modest number of modifier sites (e.g. 10 per mutation type in the standard classification into 96 types) subject to moderate to strong selection (2Nes>1) could account for the variation in mutation rates observed among human populations. If such modifier sites indeed underlie differences among populations, they should also cause variation in mutation rates within populations and their effects should be detectable in pedigree studies.© The Author(s) 2022.

"35634240","Identification of lung cancer drivers by comparison of the observed and the expected numbers of missense and nonsense mutations in individual human genes.","Oncotarget","Largely, cancer development is driven by acquisition and positive selection of somatic mutations that increase proliferation and survival of tumor cells. As a result, genes related to cancer development tend to have an excess of somatic mutations in them. An excess of missense and/or nonsense mutations in a gene is an indicator of its cancer relevance. To identify genes with an excess of potentially functional missense or nonsense mutations one needs to compare the observed and expected numbers of mutations in the gene. We estimated the expected numbers of missense and nonsense mutations in individual human genes using (i) the number of potential sites for missense and nonsense mutations in individual transcripts and (ii) histology-specific nucleotide context-dependent mutation rates. To estimate mutation rates defined as the number of mutations per site per tumor we used silent mutations reported in the Catalog Of Somatic Mutations In Cancer (COSMIC). The estimates were nucleotide context dependent. We have identified 26 genes with an excess of missense and/or nonsense mutations for lung adenocarcinoma, 18 genes for small cell lung cancer, and 26 genes for squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. These genes include known genes and novel lung cancer gene candidates.Copyright: © 2022 Gorlova et al."

Little is known about the lung and oral cavity microbiomes in smokers, and even less for electronic cigarette (EC) users, compared with never-smokers. In a cross-sectional study (n = 28) of smokers, EC users, and never-smokers, bronchoalveolar lavage and saliva samples underwent metatranscriptome profiling to examine associations with lung and oral microbiomes. Pairwise comparisons assessed differentially abundant bacteria species. Total bacterial load was similar between groups, with no differences in bacterial diversity across lung microbiomes. In lungs, 44 bacteria species differed significantly (FDR < 0.1) between smokers/never-smokers, with most decreased in smokers. Twelve species differed between smokers/EC users, all decreased in smokers of which Neisseria sp. KEM232 and Curvibacter sp. AEP1-3 were observed. Among the top five decreased species in both comparisons, Neisseria elongata, Neisseria sicca, and Haemophilus parainfluenzae were observed. In the oral microbiome, 152 species were differentially abundant for smokers/never-smokers, and 17 between smokers/electronic cigarette users, but only 21 species were differentially abundant in both the lung and oral cavity. EC use is not associated with changes in the lung microbiome compared with never-smokers, indicating EC toxicity does not affect microbiota. Statistically different bacteria in smokers compared with EC users and never-smokers were almost all decreased, potentially due to toxic effects of cigarette smoke. The low numbers of overlapping oral and lung microbes suggest that the oral microbiome is not a surrogate for analyzing smoking-related effects in the lung.The microbiome affects cancer and other disease risk. The effects of e-cig usage on the lung microbiome are essentially unknown. Given the importance of lung microbiome dysbiosis populated by oral species which have been observed to drive lung cancer progression, it is important to study effects of e-cig use on microbiome.©2022 American Association for Cancer Research."

Cancer medications have evolved with the establishment of various cell models. Patient-derived cell lines are very useful for identifying characteristic phenotypes and susceptibilities to anticancer drugs as well as molecularly targeted therapies for tumors. However, conventional 2-dimensional (2D) cell cultures have several drawbacks in terms of engraftment rate and phenotypic changes during culture. The organoid is a recently developed in vitro model with cultured cells that form a three-dimensional structure in the extracellular matrix. Organoids have the capacity to self-renew and can organize themselves to resemble the original organ or tumor in terms of both structure and function. Patient-derived cancer organoids are more suitable for the investigation of cancer biology and clinical medicine than conventional 2D cell lines or patient-derived xenografts. With recent advances in genetic analysis technology, the genetic information of various tumors has been clarified, and personalized medicine based on genetic information has become clinically available. Here, we have reviewed the recent advances in the development and application of patient-derived cancer organoids in cancer biology studies and personalized medicine. We have focused on the potential of organoids as a platform for the identification and development of novel targeted medicines for pancreatobiliary cancer, which is the most intractable cancer."

"35874645","The Role of Transposable Elements in Sexual Development.","Front Behav Neurosci","Up to 50% of most mammalian genomes are made up of transposable elements (TEs) that have the potential to mobilize around the genome. Despite this prevalence, research on TEs is only beginning to gain traction within the field of neuroscience. While TEs have long been regarded as ""junk"" or parasitic DNA, it has become evident that they are adaptive DNA and RNA regulatory elements. In addition to their vital role in normal development, TEs can also interact with steroid receptors, which are key elements to sexual development. In this review, we provide an overview of the involvement of TEs in processes related to sexual development- from TE activity in the germline to TE accumulation in sex chromosomes. Moreover, we highlight sex differences in TE activity and their regulation of genes related to sexual development. Finally, we speculate on the epigenetic mechanisms that may govern TEs' role in sexual development. In this context, we emphasize the need to further the understanding of sexual development through the lens of TEs including in a variety of organs at different developmental stages, their molecular networks, and evolution.Copyright © 2022 Chiang, DeRosa, Park and Hunter."

The RHINESSA core cohort, adult offspring generation 3 (G3), was first investigated in 2014-17 in a questionnaire study (N=8818, age 18-53 years) and a clinical study (subsample, n=1405). Their G2 parents participated in the population-based cohorts, European Community Respiratory Heath Survey and Respiratory Health In Northern Europe, followed since the early 1990s when they were 20-44 years old, at 8-10 years intervals. Study protocols are harmonised across generations.Collected data include spirometry, skin prick tests, exhaled nitric oxide, anthropometrics, bioimpedance, blood pressure; questionnaire/interview data on respiratory/general/reproductive health, indoor/outdoor environment, smoking, occupation, general characteristics and lifestyle; biobanked blood, urine, gingival fluid, skin swabs; measured specific and total IgE, DNA methylation, sex hormones and oral microbiome. Research results suggest that parental environment years before conception, in particular, father's exposures such as smoking and overweight, may be of key importance for asthma and lung function, and that there is an important susceptibility window in male prepuberty. Statistical analyses developed to approach causal inference suggest that these associations may be causal. DNA methylation studies suggest a mechanism for transfer of father's exposures to offspring health and disease through impact on offspring DNA methylation.Follow-up is planned at 5-8 years intervals, first in 2021-2023.

Inflammaging has been implicated in the pathogenesis of many age-associated chronic diseases as well as loss of physical and cognitive function. The search for mechanisms that underlie inflammaging focused initially on the hallmarks of aging, but it is rapidly expanding in multiple directions. Here, we discuss the threads connecting cellular senescence and mitochondrial dysfunction to impaired mitophagy and DNA damage, which may act as a hub for inflammaging. We explore the emerging multi-omics efforts that aspire to define the complexity of inflammaging - and identify molecular signatures and novel targets for interventions aimed at counteracting excessive inflammation and its deleterious consequences while preserving the physiological immune response. Finally, we review the emerging evidence that inflammation is involved in brain aging and neurodegenerative diseases.

Therefore, it may also be helpful for understanding the detailed pathological mechanism of traumatic brain injury (TBI). In this study, we performed Tandem Mass Tag-based quantitative analysis of cortical proteome profiles in a mouse model of TBI. Our results showed that there were 302 differentially expressed proteins in TBI mice compared with normal mice 7 days after injury. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analyses showed that these differentially expressed proteins were predominantly involved in inflammatory responses, including complement and coagulation cascades, as well as chemokine signaling pathways. Subsequent transcription factor analysis revealed that the inflammation-related transcription factors NF-κB1, RelA, IRF1, STAT1, and Spi1 play pivotal roles in the secondary injury that occurs after TBI, which further corroborates the functional enrichment for inflammatory factors. Our results suggest that inflammation-related proteins and inflammatory responses are promising targets for the treatment of TBI."

However, the identity and longitudinal patterns of such proteins are largely unknown due to the inaccessibility of the human placenta and limitations in assay technologies. We aimed to identify proteins derived from and taken up by the placenta in the maternal circulation. Furthermore, we aimed to describe the longitudinal patterns across gestation of placenta-derived proteins as well as identify placenta-derived proteins that can serve as reference curves for placental function.We analyzed proteins in plasma samples collected in two cohorts using the Somalogic 5000-plex platform. Antecubital vein samples were collected at three time points (gestational weeks 14-16, 22-24, and 30-32) across gestation in 70 healthy pregnancies in the longitudinal STORK cohort. In the cross sectional 4-vessel cohort, blood samples were collected simultaneously from the maternal antecubital vein (AV), radial artery (RA), and uterine vein (UV) during cesarean section in 75 healthy pregnancies. Placenta-derived proteins and proteins taken up by the placenta were identified using venoarterial differences (UV-RA). Placenta-derived proteins were defined as placenta-specific by comparison to the venoarterial difference in the antecubital vein-radial artery (AV-RA). These proteins were described longitudinally based on the STORK cohort samples using a linear mixed effects model per protein. Using a machine learning algorithm, we identified placenta-derived proteins that could predict gestational age, meaning that they closely tracked gestation, and were potential read-outs of placental function.Among the nearly 5000 measured proteins, we identified 256 placenta-derived proteins and 101 proteins taken up by the placenta (FDR < 0.05). Among the 256 placenta-derived proteins released to maternal circulation, 101 proteins were defined as placenta-specific. These proteins formed two clusters with distinct developmental patterns across gestation. We identified five placenta-derived proteins that closely tracked gestational age when measured in the systemic maternal circulation, termed a ""placental proteomic clock.""Together, these data may serve as a first step towards a reference for the healthy placenta-derived proteome that can be measured in the systemic maternal circulation and potentially serve as biomarkers of placental function. The ""placental proteomic clock"" represents a novel concept that warrants further investigation. Deviations in the proteomic pattern across gestation of such proteomic clock proteins may serve as an indication of placental dysfunction.© 2022. The Author(s)."

We used a highly sensitive and robust nano-5hmC-Seal technology and profiled genome-wide 5hmC distribution in 239 plasma cfDNA samples from 103 AML patients and 81 non-cancer controls. We developed a 5hmC diagnostic model that precisely differentiates AML patients from controls with high sensitivity and specificity. We also developed a 5hmC prognostic model that accurately predicts prognosis in AML patients. High weighted prognostic scores (wp-scores) in AML patients were significantly associated with adverse overall survival (OS) in both training (P = 3.31e-05) and validation (P = 0.000464) sets. The wp-score was also significantly associated with genetic risk stratification and displayed dynamic changes with varied disease burden. Moreover, we found that high wp-scores in a single gene, BMS1 and GEMIN5 predicted OS in AML patients in both the training set (P = 0.023 and 0.031, respectively) and validation set (P = 9.66e-05 and 0.011, respectively). Lastly, our study demonstrated the genome-wide landscape of DNA hydroxymethylation in AML and revealed critical genes and pathways related to AML diagnosis and prognosis.

We first screened out the differential methylation sites in CC and normal tissues and performed multiple statistical analyses to discover DNA methylation diagnostic markers that are used to distinguish CC and normal control. Then, we developed a methylation-based survival model to improve risk stratification.A diagnostic prediction panel consists of five CpG markers that could predict cervical cancer versus normal tissue with highly correct rate of 100%, and cg16428251, cg22341310, and cg23316360 which in diagnostic prediction panel all could yield high sensitivity and specificity for detection of CC and normal in six cohorts (area under curve [AUC] > 0.8), in addition to excellent performance in discriminating between CC and normal sample. The diagnostic marker panel also effectively predicted the CIN3 versus normal tissue with high accuracy in two datasets (AUC = 0.80, 0.789, respectively). Furthermore, a prognostic prediction model aggregated two CpG markers that effectively stratified the prognosis of high-risk and low-risk groups (training cohort: hazard ratio [HR] 4, 95% CI: 1.7-9.6,P= 0.0021; testing cohort: hazard ratio [HR] 1.9, 95% CI: 1.2-3.1,P= 0.0072).The findings of our study showed that DNA methylation markers are of great value in the diagnosis and prognosis of CC.© 2022 Tu et al."

Examining the molecular signature of subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) following different types of bariatric surgery may help in gaining further insight into their distinct metabolic impact.Subjects undergoing biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch (BPD-DS) showed a significantly higher percentage of total weight loss than those undergoing gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy (RYGB + SG) (41.7 ± 4.6 vs 28.2 ± 6.8%; p = 0.00005). Individuals losing more weight were also significantly more prone to achieve both type 2 diabetes and dyslipidemia remission (OR = 0.75; 95%CI = 0.51-0.91; p = 0.03). Whole transcriptome and methylome profiling showed that bariatric surgery induced a profound molecular remodeling of SAT at 12 months postoperative, mainly through gene down-regulation and hypermethylation. The extent of changes observed was greater following BPD-DS, with 61.1% and 49.8% of up- and down-regulated genes, as well as 85.7% and 70.4% of hyper- and hypomethylated genes being exclusive to this procedure, and mostly associated with a marked decrease of immune and inflammatory responses. Weight loss was strongly associated with genes being simultaneously differentially expressed and methylated in BPD-DS, with the strongest association being observed for GPD1L (r2 = 0.83; p = 1.4 × 10-6).Present findings point to the greater SAT molecular remodeling following BPD-DS as potentially linked with higher metabolic remission rates.

Moreover, sub-optimal levels of RAD21 expression in early development can result in cohesinopathies. Altered RAD21 levels can result directly from mutations in the RAD21 gene. However, whether DNA variants outside of the RAD21 gene could control its expression and thereby contribute to cancer and developmental disease is unknown. In this study, we searched for genomic variants that modify RAD21expression to determine their potential to contribute to development or cancer by RAD21 dysregulation. We searched 42,953,834 genomic variants for a spatial-eQTL association with the transcription of RAD21. We identified 123 significant associations (FDR < 0.05), which are local (cis) or long-distance (trans) regulators of RAD21 expression. The 123 variants co-regulate a further seven genes (AARD, AKAP11, GRID1, KCNIP4, RCN1, TRIOBP, and USP32), enriched for having Sp2 transcription factor binding sites in their promoter regions. The Sp2 transcription factor and six of the seven genes had previously been associated with cancer onset, progression, and metastasis. Our results suggest that genome-wide variation in non-coding regions impacts on RAD21 transcript levels in addition to other genes, which then could impact on oncogenesis and the process of ubiquitination. This identification of distant co-regulation of oncogenes represents a strategy for discovery of novel genetic regions influencing cancer onset and a potential for diagnostics.© 2022. The Author(s)."

We identified 1,276 lncRNAs, of which most are unknown, with different expression levels in the healthy and NPC tissues. In order to shed light on the functions of these unknown lncRNAs, we first constructed a co-expression network of lncRNAs and mRNAs using bioinformatics and systematic biological approach. Moreover, mRNAs were clustered and enriched by their biological functions, and those lncRNAs have similar expression trends with mRNAs were defined as functional molecules with potential biological significance. The module may help identify key lncRNAs in the carcinogenesis of NPC and provide clues for in-depth study of their functions and associated signaling pathways.

However, their interplays are poorly understood. We report here that elevated TIGAR (TP53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator), an antioxidant and glucose metabolic regulator and a target of oncogenic histone methyltransferase NSD2 (nuclear receptor binding SET domain protein 2), is mainly localized in the nucleus of therapeutic resistant tumor cells where it stimulates NSD2 expression and elevates global H3K36me2 mark. Mechanistically, TIGAR directly interacts with the antioxidant master regulator NRF2 and facilitates chromatin recruitment of NRF2, H3K4me3 methylase MLL1 and elongating Pol-II to stimulate the expression of both new (NSD2) and established (NQO1/2,PRDX1andGSTM4) targets ofNRF2, independent of its enzymatic activity. Nuclear TIGAR confers cancer cell resistance to chemotherapy and hormonal therapyin vitroand in tumors through effective maintenance of redox homeostasis. In addition, nuclear accumulation of TIGAR is positively associated with NSD2 expression in clinical tumors and strongly correlated with poor survival.

Here we will discuss recent progress in our understanding of the chromatin-based mechanisms of breast tumorigenesis, how these mechanisms affect therapeutic response to standard of care treatment, and discuss new strategies towards therapeutic intervention to overcome resistance.Copyright © 2022 Arruabarrena-Aristorena and Toska."
"35705546","Sex-specific multi-level 3D genome dynamics in the mouse brain.","Nat Commun","The female mammalian brain exhibits sex hormone-driven plasticity during the reproductive period. Recent evidence implicates chromatin dynamics in gene regulation underlying this plasticity. However, whether ovarian hormones impact higher-order chromatin organization in post-mitotic neurons in vivo is unknown. Here, we mapped the 3D genome of ventral hippocampal neurons across the oestrous cycle and by sex in mice. In females, we find cycle-driven dynamism in 3D chromatin organization, including in oestrogen response elements-enriched X chromosome compartments, autosomal CTCF loops, and enhancer-promoter interactions. With rising oestrogen levels, the female 3D genome becomes more similar to the male 3D genome. Cyclical enhancer-promoter interactions are partially associated with gene expression and enriched for brain disorder-relevant genes and pathways. Our study reveals unique 3D genome dynamics in the female brain relevant to female-specific gene regulation, neuroplasticity, and disease risk.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35802708","The association between Alu hypomethylation and the severity of hypertension.","PLoS One","Epigenetic changes that cause genomic instability may be the basis of pathogenic processes of age-associated noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). Essential hypertension is one of the most common NCDs. Alu hypomethylation is an epigenetic event that is commonly found in elderly individuals. Epigenomic alterations are also found in age-associated NCDs such as osteoporosis and diabetes mellitus. Alu methylation prevents DNA from being damaged. Therefore, Alu hypomethylated DNA accumulates DNA damage and, as a result, causes organ function deterioration. Here, we report that Alu hypomethylation is a biomarker for essential hypertension.We investigated Alu methylation levels in white blood cells from normal controls, patients with prehypertension, and patients with hypertension. The hypertension group possessed the lowest Alu methylation level when classified by systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure (P = 0.0002 and P = 0.0088, respectively). In the hypertension group, a higher diastolic blood pressure and a lower Alu methylation level were observed (r = -0.6278). Moreover, we found that changes in Alu hypomethylation in the four years of follow-up in the same person were directly correlated with increased diastolic blood pressure.Similar to other age-associated NCDs, Alu hypomethylation is found in essential hypertension and is directly correlated with severity, particularly with diastolic blood pressure. Therefore, Alu hypomethylation may be linked with the molecular pathogenesis of high blood pressure and can be used for monitoring the clinical outcome of this disease."
"35832620","Predicting 3D chromatin interactions from DNA sequence using Deep Learning.","Comput Struct Biotechnol J","Gene regulation in eukaryotes is profoundly shaped by the 3D organization of chromatin within the cell nucleus. Distal regulatory interactions between enhancers and their target genes are widespread and many causal loci underlying heritable agricultural or clinical traits have been mapped to distal cis-regulatory elements. Dissecting the sequence features that mediate such distal interactions is key to understanding their underlying biology. Deep Learning (DL) models coupled with genome-wide 3C-based sequencing data have emerged as powerful tools to infer the DNA sequence grammar underlying such distal interactions. In this review we show that most DL models have remarkably high prediction accuracy, which indicates that DNA sequence features are important determinants of chromatin looping. However, DL model training has so far been limited to a small set of human cell lines, raising questions about the generalization of these predictions to other tissue-types and species. Furthermore, we find that the model architecture seems less relevant for model performance than the training strategy and the data preparation step. Transfer learning, coupled with functionally curated interactions, appear to be the most promising approach to learn cell-type specific and possibly species- specific sequence features in future applications.© 2022 The Author(s)."

To identify genetic modifiers ofBRCA1/2, we carried out a whole-genome sequencing study of 66 ovarian cancer patients that were enriched withBRCAcarriers, followed by validation using data from the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes Consortium. We foundPPARGC1A, a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis and function, to be highly mutated inBRCAcarriers, and patients with bothPPARGC1AandBRCA1/2mutations were diagnosed with breast or ovarian cancer at significantly younger ages, while the mutation status of each gene alone did not significantly associate with age of onset. Our study suggestsPPARGC1Aas a possibleBRCAmodifier gene. Upon further validation, this finding can help improve cancer risk prediction and provide personalized preventive care forBRCAcarriers."

Nevertheless, the extent to which chronological age (CA) at injury affects TBI-related brain aging is unknown. This study applies Gaussian process regression to T1-weighted magnetic resonance images (MRIs) acquired within [Formula: see text]7 days and again [Formula: see text]6 months after a single mTBI sustained by 133 participants aged 20-83 (CA [Formula: see text] = 42.6 ± 17 years; 51 females). Brain BAs are estimated, modeled, and compared as a function of sex and CA at injury using a statistical model selection procedure. On average, the brains of older adults age by 15.3 ± 6.9 years after mTBI, whereas those of younger adults age only by 1.8 ± 5.6 years, a significant difference (Welch's t32 =  - 9.17, p ≃ 9.47 × 10-11). For an adult aged [Formula: see text]30 to [Formula: see text]60, the expected amount of TBI-related brain aging is [Formula: see text]3 years greater than in an individual younger by a decade. For an individual over [Formula: see text]60, the respective amount is [Formula: see text]7 years. Despite no significant sex differences in brain aging (Welch's t108 = 0.78, p > 0.78), the statistical test is underpowered. BAs estimated at acute baseline versus chronic follow-up do not differ significantly (t264 = 0.41, p > 0.66, power = 80%), suggesting negligible TBI-related brain aging during the chronic stage of TBI despite accelerated aging during the acute stage. Our results indicate that a single mTBI sustained after age [Formula: see text]60 involves approximately [Formula: see text]10 years of premature and lasting brain aging, which is MRI detectable as early as [Formula: see text]7 days post-injury.© 2022.

Results fromin vitroexperiments, animal models and analysis of human samples from randomized controlled trials provide comprehensive data illustrating the pleiotropic actions of Vitamin D on the immune system. They globally result in immunomodulation by decreasing differentiation of effector T and B cells while promoting regulatory subsets. Vitamin D also modulates innate immune cells such as macrophages, monocytes and dendritic cells, and acts at the level of the blood-brain barrier reducing immune cell trafficking. Vitamin D exerts additional activity within the central nervous system reducing microglial and astrocytic activation. The immunomodulatory role of Vitamin D detected in animal models of multiple sclerosis has suggested its potential therapeutic use for treating multiple sclerosis. In this review, we focus on recent published data describing the biological effects of Vitamin D in animal models of multiple sclerosis on immune cells, blood-brain barrier function, activation of glial cells and its potential neuroprotective effects. Based on the current knowledge, we also discuss optimization of therapeutic interventions with Vitamin D in patients with multiple sclerosis, as well as new technologies allowing in-depth analysis of immune cell regulations by vitamin D.© The Author(s) 2022.

In this study, using single-cell transcriptomics, we mapped all non-immune, non-neuronal cell populations in wild-type and AD model (5xFAD) mouse brains. We identified an oligodendrocyte state that increased in association with brain pathology, which we termed disease-associated oligodendrocytes (DOLs). In a murine model of amyloidosis, DOLs appear long after plaque accumulation, and amyloid-beta (Aβ) alone was not sufficient to induce the DOL signature in vitro. DOLs could be identified in a mouse model of tauopathy and in other murine neurodegenerative and autoimmune inflammatory conditions, suggesting a common response to severe pathological conditions. Using quantitative spatial analysis of mouse and postmortem human brain tissues, we found that oligodendrocytes expressing a key DOL marker (SERPINA3N/SERPINA3 accordingly) are present in the cortex in areas of brain damage and are enriched near Aβ plaques. In postmortem human brain tissue, the expression level of this marker correlated with cognitive decline. Altogether, this study uncovers a shared signature of oligodendrocytes in central nervous system pathologies.© 2022. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc."

However, decades of unfortunate historical, sociocultural and leadership challenges make the continent a hotspot for poverty, indoor and outdoor pollutants with attendant stress factors such as violence, malnutrition, infectious outbreaks and psychological perturbations. The burden of these stressors initiate neuroinflammatory responses but the pattern and mechanisms of glial activation in these scenarios are yet to be properly elucidated. Africa is therefore most vulnerable to neurological stressors when placed against a backdrop of demographics that favor explosive childbearing, a vast population of unemployed youths making up a projected 42% of global youth population by 2030, repressive sociocultural policies towards women, poor access to healthcare, malnutrition, rapid urbanization, climate change and pollution. Early life stress, whether physical or psychological, induces neuroinflammatory response in developing nervous system and consequently leads to the emergence of mental health problems during adulthood. Brain inflammatory response is driven largely by inflammatory mediators released by glial cells; namely astrocytes and microglia. These inflammatory mediators alter the developmental trajectory of fetal and neonatal brain and results in long-lasting maladaptive behaviors and cognitive deficits. This review seeks to highlight the patterns and mechanisms of stressors such as poverty, developmental stress, environmental pollutions as well as malnutrition stress on astrocytes and microglia in neuroinflammation within the African context.Copyright © 2022 Olude, Mouihate, Mustapha, Farina, Quintana and Olopade."
"35682895","Blood-Brain Barrier Dysfunction and Astrocyte Senescence as Reciprocal Drivers of Neuropathology in Aging.","Int J Mol Sci","As the most abundant cell types in the brain, astrocytes form a tissue-wide signaling network that is responsible for maintaining brain homeostasis and regulating various brain activities. Here, we review some of the essential functions that astrocytes perform in supporting neurons, modulating the immune response, and regulating and maintaining the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Given their importance in brain health, it follows that astrocyte dysfunction has detrimental effects. Indeed, dysfunctional astrocytes are implicated in age-related neuropathology and participate in the onset and progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we review two mechanisms by which astrocytes mediate neuropathology in the aging brain. First, age-associated blood-brain barrier dysfunction (BBBD) causes the hyperactivation of TGFβ signaling in astrocytes, which elicits a pro-inflammatory and epileptogenic phenotype. Over time, BBBD-associated astrocyte dysfunction results in hippocampal and cortical neural hyperexcitability and cognitive deficits. Second, senescent astrocytes accumulate in the brain with age and exhibit a decreased functional capacity and the secretion of senescent-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) factors, which contribute to neuroinflammation and neurotoxicity. Both BBBD and senescence progressively increase during aging and are associated with increased risk of neurodegenerative disease, but the relationship between the two has not yet been established. Thus, we discuss the potential relationship between BBBD, TGFβ hyperactivation, and senescence with respect to astrocytes in the context of aging and disease and identify future areas of investigation in the field."

Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) has been identified as one of the key factors regulating astrocyte reactivity. The genetic and pharmacological manipulation of the TGF-β signaling pathway in animal models of central nervous system (CNS) injury and disease alters pathological and functional outcomes. This review aims to provide recent understanding regarding astrocyte reactivity and TGF-β signaling in brain injury, aging, and neurodegeneration. Further, it explores how TGF-β signaling modulates astrocyte reactivity and function in the context of CNS disease and injury."

In India, roughly 25-30% of urban populations and 15-20% of rural populations have abnormal lipid levels. Statin, which is deemed to be the gold standard lipid-lowering agent, is the first treatment of choice for these patients. Although statins at one end are highly effective against dyslipidemiaand cardiovascular diseases, at the other end, they cause adverse effects including an increased risk of diabetes mellitus. The objective of this study was to understand the coexistence of diabetes and dyslipidemia in patients undergoing statin therapy. A scoping review was conducted with published articles selected from PubMed and Google Scholar. The obtained results were filtered based on inclusion/exclusion criteria. Our database search provided a total of 822 articles, of which 48 were selected for this review, with results concluding that statin users are potentially at a greater risk of developing diabetes mellitus compared with patients who are not using statins. Although many studies have been conducted to ascertain the onset of diabetes mellitus amongst statin users, the exact mechanism is not yet precisely established.

Urinary parameters and chronological age were correlated then the biological age of enrolled individuals was determined from the urinary oxidative stress markers using the algorithm of Klemera and Doubal.Our findings showed that 8-oxo-7,8-deoxyguanosine (8-oxoG), 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanosine (8-OHdG), and dityrosine (DTyr) positively correlated with chronological age, while the level of an F2-isoprostane (iPF2α-VI) correlated negatively with age. We found that 8-oxoG, DTyr, and iPF2α-VI were significantly higher among accelerated agers compared to nonaccelerated agers and that a decision tree model could successfully identify accelerated agers with an accuracy of >92%.Discussion.

"35889763","The Use of Dietary Supplements and Amino Acid Restriction Interventions to Reduce Frailty in Pre-Clinical Models.","Nutrients","Frailty is a state of accelerated aging that increases susceptibility to adverse health outcomes. Due to its high societal and personal costs, there is growing interest in discovering beneficial interventions to attenuate frailty. Many of these interventions involve the use of lifestyle modifications such as dietary supplements. Testing these interventions in pre-clinical models can facilitate our understanding of their impact on underlying mechanisms of frailty. We conducted a narrative review of studies that investigated the impact of dietary modifications on measures of frailty or overall health in rodent models. These interventions include vitamin supplements, dietary supplements, or amino acid restriction diets. We found that vitamins, amino acid restriction diets, and dietary supplements can have beneficial effects on frailty and other measures of overall health in rodent models. Mechanistic studies show that these effects are mediated by modifying one or more mechanisms underlying frailty, in particular effects on chronic inflammation. However, many interventions do not measure frailty directly and most do not investigate effects in both sexes, which limits their applicability. Examining dietary interventions in animal models allows for detailed investigation of underlying mechanisms involved in their beneficial effects. This may lead to more successful, translatable interventions to attenuate frailty."

Such research is important to advance cancer treatment outcomes as well as to address clinically observed sex-differences in short- and long-term taxane-induced toxicities that have disproportionate effects on female and male cancer patients. To gain more insight into these underlying differences between the sexes, the following review draws from pre-clinical and clinical paclitaxel and taxane oncology literature, examines sex-discrepancies, and highlights uncharacterized sex-dependent mechanisms of action and clinical outcomes. To our knowledge, this is the first literature review to provide a current overview of the basic and clinical sex dimorphisms of taxane-induced effects.

In this study, we investigated the effect of sex on the outcomes of hospitalized COVID-19 patients with CVDRF.Methods and Results:We analyzed 693 COVID-19 patients with CVDRF. Patients were divided into 2 groups based on sex, and baseline characteristics and in-hospital outcomes were compared between the 2 groups. The mean age of the 693 patients was 68 years; 64.8% were men and 96.1% were Japanese. In a univariate analysis model, sex was not significantly associated with in-hospital mortality (odds ratio [OR] 1.22; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.74-2.02; P=0.43). However, men had higher in-hospital mortality than women, especially among older (age ≥80 years) patients (OR 2.21; 95% CI 1.11-4.41; P=0.024). After adjusting for age and pivotal risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, heart failure, coronary artery disease, chronic lung disease, and chronic kidney disease), multivariate analysis suggested that male sex was an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality (OR 2.20; 95% CI 1.23-3.92; P=0.008).Conclusions:In this post hoc analysis of a nationwide registry focusing on patients with COVID-19 and CVDRF, men had higher in-hospital mortality than women, especially among older patients.Copyright © 2022, THE JAPANESE CIRCULATION SOCIETY."

The importance of the intersection between sex and age in immunity to viral respiratory diseases is clearly demonstrated by the increased prevalence and severity of influenza and COVID-19 in older males compared to older females. Despite sex and age biases in the epidemiology and clinical manifestations of disease, these host factors are often ignored in vaccine research. Here, we review sex differences in the immunogenicity, effectiveness, and safety of the influenza and COVID-19 vaccines in older adults and the impact of sex-specific effects of age-related factors, including chronological age, frailty, and the presence of comorbidities. While a female bias in immunity to influenza vaccines has been consistently reported, understanding of sex differences in the response to COVID-19 vaccines in older adults is incomplete due to small sample sizes and failure to disaggregate clinical trial data by both sex and age. For both vaccines, a major gap in the literature is apparent, whereby very few studies investigate sex-specific effects of aging, frailty, or multimorbidity. By providing a roadmap for sex-responsive vaccine research, beyond influenza and COVID-19, we can leverage the heterogeneity in immunity among older adults to provide better protection against vaccine-preventable diseases.Copyright © 2022 Shapiro, Morgan, Leng and Klein."
"35795579","A Review of the Potential Effects of Melatonin in Compromised Mitochondrial Redox Activities in Elderly Patients With COVID-19.","Front Nutr","Melatonin, an endogenous indoleamine, is an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory molecule widely distributed in the body. It efficiently regulates pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines under various pathophysiological conditions. The melatonin rhythm, which is strongly associated with oxidative lesions and mitochondrial dysfunction, is also observed during the biological process of aging. Melatonin levels decline considerably with age and are related to numerous age-related illnesses. The signs of aging, including immune aging, increased basal inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, significant telomeric abrasion, and disrupted autophagy, contribute to the increased severity of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. These characteristics can worsen the pathophysiological response of the elderly to SARS-CoV-2 and pose an additional risk of accelerating biological aging even after recovery. This review explains that the death rate of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) increases with chronic diseases and age, and the decline in melatonin levels, which is closely related to the mitochondrial dysfunction in the patient, affects the virus-related death rate. Further, melatonin can enhance mitochondrial function and limit virus-related diseases.

Liquid biopsy tests aim to detect cancer using known markers, including genetic alterations and epigenetic profiles of ctDNA. Despite various advantages, the major limitation remains the low fraction of tumor-originating DNA fragments in a high background of normal blood-cell originating fragments in the cell-free DNA (cfDNA) pool in plasma. Deep targeted sequencing of cfDNA allows for enrichment of fragments in known cancer marker-associated regions of the genome, thus increasing the chances of detecting the low fraction variant harboring fragments. Most targeted sequencing panels are designed to include known recurrent mutations or methylation markers of cancer. Here, we propose the integration of cancer-specific chromatin accessibility states into panel designs for liquid biopsy. Using machine learning approaches, we first identify accessible and inaccessible chromatin regions specific to each major human cancer type. We then introduce a score that quantifies local chromatin accessibility in tumor relative to blood cells and show that this metric can be useful for prioritizing marker regions with higher chances of being detected in cfDNA for inclusion in future panel designs.© 2022.

The psychopathological implications in COVID-19 survivors such as depression, anxiety, and cognitive impairments are now recognized as primary symptoms of the ""post-acute COVID-19 syndrome."" Depressive psychopathology was reported in around 35% of patients at short, medium, and long-term follow-up after the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Post-COVID-19 depressive symptoms are known to increase fatigue and affect neurocognitive functioning, sleep, quality of life, and global functioning in COVID-19 survivors. The psychopathological mechanisms underlying post-COVID-19 depressive symptoms are mainly related to the inflammation triggered by the peripheral immune-inflammatory response to the viral infection and to the persistent psychological burden during and after infection. The large number of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients and the high prevalence of post-COVID-19 depressive symptoms may significantly increase the pool of people suffering from depressive disorders. Therefore, it is essential to screen, diagnose, treat, and monitor COVID-19 survivors' psychopathology to counteract the depression disease burden and related years of life lived with disability.

In addition to lipid-lowering properties, statins have been shown to exert anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects within the context of autoimmunity. Importantly, autoimmune incidence and lipid markers differ between men and women, suggesting that the relationship between lipid metabolism and immune function may vary by sex. Therefore, we investigated whether a predictive, sex-specific relationship exists between serum lipids, statin use, and antinuclear antibodies (ANA)-a routine clinical marker of autoimmunity and immune dysfunction-in U.S. men and women (>20 years old;n= 1,526) from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2004. Within this population, a greater proportion of women were positive for ANA (ANA+) and had higher ANA titers, as compared to men. While we did not observe statistical differences in average total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C), HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C), or triglyceride levels in ANA positive (ANA+) vs. ANA negative (ANA-) men or women, we observed that a greater proportion of ANA+ women had high total cholesterol levels (>240 mg/dL) when compared to ANA+ men (13.0 vs. 9.0%), and that a greater percentage of ANA+ women had low HDL-C as compared to ANA+ men (29.2 vs. 19.6%). However, in logistic regression models, total cholesterol, LDL-C, and HDL-C levels were not able to predict ANA status, whereas elevated serum triglycerides (150 to < 200 mg/dL) were significantly less likely to be ANA+ vs. ANA- (OR 0.33; 95% CI 0.11-0.92) in men only. Interestingly, women who reported taking statins have significantly lower odds of being ANA+ (OR 0.25; 95% CI 0.09-0.76), whereas no significant association between statin use and ANA status was observed in men.

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were analyzed regarding: i) thymic function surrogates [T cell receptor excision circles (TRECs) and recent thymic emigrants (RTEs)]; ii) naïve and memory CD4+and CD8+T cells subsets; iii) T helper (Th) phenotype and chemokine receptors expression on CD8+T cells subsets; iv) regulatory T cell (Tregs) phenotype; and exclude expression of activating/inhibitory receptors by natural killer (NK) and NKT cells. Analyses were controlled for age, sex, and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) IgG seroprevalence.Newly diagnosed patients with RRMS and HC have equivalent thymic function as determined by similar numbers of RTEs and levels of sjTRECs, DJβTRECs, and sj/DJβTREC ratio. In the CD8+T cells compartment, patients with RRMS have a higher naive to memory ratio and lower memory cell counts in blood, specifically of effector memory and TemRA CD8+T cells. Interestingly, higher numbers and percentages of central memory CD8+T cells are associated with increasing time from the relapse. Among CD4+T cells, lower blood counts of effector memory cells are found in patients upon controlling for sex, age, and anti-HCMV IgG seroprevalence. Higher numbers of CD4+T cells (both naïve and memory) and of Th2 cells are associated with increasing time from the relapse; lower numbers of Th17 cells are associated with higher MS severity scores (MSSS). Patients with RRMS have a higher percentage of naïve Tregs compared with HC, and lower percentages of these cells are associated with higher MSSS. Percentages of immature CD56brightNK cells expressing the inhibitory receptor KLRG1 and of mature CD56dimCD57+NK cells expressing NKp30 are higher in patients. No major alterations are observed on NKT cells.Characterization of the peripheral immune system of treatment-naïve newly diagnosed patients with RRMS unveiled immune features present at clinical onset including lower memory T cells blood counts, particularly among CD8+T cells, higher percentage of naïve Tregs and altered percentages of NK cells subsets expressing inhibitory or activating receptors. These findings might set the basis to better understand disease pathogenesis.Copyright © 2022 Canto-Gomes, Silva, Rb-Silva, Boleixa, da Silva, Cheynier, Costa, González-Suárez, Correia-Neves, Cerqueira and Nobrega."

Although biological and immunological hallmarks of PDAC have been frequently reported recently, early detection and the particularly aggressive biological features are the major challenges remaining unclear. In the current study, we retrieved multiple scRNA-seq datasets and illustrated the genetic programs of PDAC development in genetically modified mouse models. Notably, the transcription levels of Id1 were elevated specifically along with the PDAC development. Pseudotime trajectory analysis revealed that Id1 was closely correlated with the malignancy of PDAC. The gene expression patterns of human PDAC cells were determined by the comparative analysis of the scRNA-seq data on human PDAC and normal pancreas tissues. ID1 levels in human PDAC cancer cells were dramatically increased compared to normal epithelial cells. ID1 deficiency in vitro significantly blunt the invasive tumor-formation related phenotypes. IPA analysis on the differentially expressed genes suggested that EIF2 signaling was the core pathway regulating the development of PDAC. Blocking EFI2 signaling remarkably decreased the expression of ID1 and attenuated the tumor-formation related phenotypes. These observations confirmed that ID1 was regulated by EIF2 signaling and was the critical determinator of PDAC development and progression. This study suggests that ID1 is a potential malignant biomarker of PDAC in both mouse models and human and detecting and targeting ID1 may be a promising strategy to treat or even rescue PDAC.© 2022.

Herein we present Scarf, a modularly designed Python package that seamlessly interoperates with other single-cell toolkits and allows for memory-efficient single-cell analysis of millions of cells on a laptop or low-cost devices like single-board computers. We demonstrate Scarf's memory and compute-time efficiency by applying it to the largest existing single-cell RNA-Seq and ATAC-Seq datasets. Scarf wraps memory-efficient implementations of a graph-based t-stochastic neighbour embedding and hierarchical clustering algorithm. Moreover, Scarf performs accurate reference-anchored mapping of datasets while maintaining memory efficiency. By implementing a subsampling algorithm, Scarf additionally has the capacity to generate representative sampling of cells from a given dataset wherein rare cell populations and lineage differentiation trajectories are conserved. Together, Scarf provides a framework wherein any researcher can perform advanced processing, subsampling, reanalysis, and integration of atlas-scale datasets on standard laptop computers.

"35893239","Systematic Analysis of Long Non-Coding RNA Genes in Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.","Noncoding RNA","The largest solid organ in humans, the liver, performs a variety of functions to sustain life. When damaged, cells in the liver can regenerate themselves to maintain normal liver physiology. However, some damage is beyond repair, which necessitates liver transplantation. Increasing rates of obesity, Western diets (i.e., rich in processed carbohydrates and saturated fats), and cardiometabolic diseases are interlinked to liver diseases, including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which is a collective term to describe the excess accumulation of fat in the liver of people who drink little to no alcohol. Alarmingly, the prevalence of NAFLD extends to 25% of the world population, which calls for the urgent need to understand the disease mechanism of NAFLD. Here, we performed secondary analyses of published RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data of NAFLD patients compared to healthy and obese individuals to identify long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) that may underly the disease mechanism of NAFLD. Similar to protein-coding genes, many lncRNAs are dysregulated in NAFLD patients compared to healthy and obese individuals, suggesting that understanding the functions of dysregulated lncRNAs may shed light on the pathology of NAFLD. To demonstrate the functional importance of lncRNAs in the liver, loss-of-function experiments were performed for one NAFLD-related lncRNA,LINC01639, which showed that it is involved in the regulation of genes related to apoptosis, TNF/TGF, cytokine signaling, and growth factors as well as genes upregulated in NAFLD. Since there is no lncRNA database focused on the liver, especially NAFLD, we built a web database, LiverDB, to further facilitate functional and mechanistic studies of hepatic lncRNAs."

"35830477","What are housekeeping genes?","PLoS Comput Biol","The concept of ""housekeeping gene"" has been used for four decades but remains loosely defined. Housekeeping genes are commonly described as ""essential for cellular existence regardless of their specific function in the tissue or organism"", and ""stably expressed irrespective of tissue type, developmental stage, cell cycle state, or external signal"". However, experimental support for the tenet that gene essentiality is linked to stable expression across cell types, conditions, and organisms has been limited. Here we use genome-scale functional genomic screens together with bulk and single-cell sequencing technologies to test this link and optimize a quantitative and experimentally validated definition of housekeeping gene. Using the optimized definition, we identify, characterize, and provide as resources, housekeeping gene lists extracted from several human datasets, and 10 other animal species that include primates, chicken, and C. elegans. We find that stably expressed genes are not necessarily essential, and that the individual genes that are essential and stably expressed can considerably differ across organisms; yet the pathways enriched among these genes are conserved. Further, the level of conservation of housekeeping genes across the analyzed organisms captures their taxonomic groups, showing evolutionary relevance for our definition. Therefore, we present a quantitative and experimentally supported definition of housekeeping genes that can contribute to better understanding of their unique biological and evolutionary characteristics."

Our previous work demonstrated the latent reproductive maladies of early-life TCDD exposure in zebrafish. Zebrafish acutely exposed to low, environmentally relevant levels of TCDD (50 pg/mL) during two windows of sexual differentiation in development (1 hour of exposure at 3 and 7 weeks postfertilization) were later infertile, showed a reduction in sperm, and exhibited gene expression consistent with an altered microenvironment, even months after exposure. Due to the highly heterogeneous cell- type and -stage landscape of the testes, we hypothesized various cell types contribute markedly different profiles toward the pathology of TCDD exposure. To investigate the contributions of the diverse cell types in the adult zebrafish testes to TCDD-induced pathology, we utilized single-cell RNA-seq and the 10x Genomics platform. The method successfully captured every stage of testicular germ cell development. Testes of adult fish exposed during sexual differentiation to TCDD contained sharply decreased populations of late spermatocytes, spermatids, and spermatozoa. Spermatogonia and early spermatocyte populations were, in contrast, enriched following exposure. Pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes supported previous findings that TCDD exposure resulted in male infertility, and suggested this outcome is due to apoptosis of spermatids and spermatozoa, even years after exposure cessation. Increased germ cell apoptosis was confirmed histologically. These results provide support for an environmental exposure explanation of idiopathic male infertility.© The Author(s) 2022.

Relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) is the most common form, which can transform into secondary-progressive MS (SPMS) that is associated with progressive neurodegeneration. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) of MS lesions identified disease-related transcriptomic alterations; however, their relationship to non-lesioned MS brain regions has not been reported and which could identify prodromal or other disease susceptibility signatures. Here, snRNA-seq was used to generate high-quality RRMS vs. SPMS datasets of 33,197 nuclei from 8 normal-appearing MS brains, which revealed divergent cell type-specific changes. Notably, SPMS brains downregulated astrocytic sphingosine kinases (SPHK1/2) - the enzymes required to phosphorylate and activate the MS drug, fingolimod. This reduction was modeled with astrocyte-specificSphk1/2null mice in which fingolimod lost activity, supporting functionality of observed transcriptomic changes.

Recently developed methods for SNV detection from single-cell DNA sequencing data, such as SCIΦ and scVILP, leverage the evolutionary history of the cells to overcome the technical errors associated with single-cell sequencing protocols. Despite being accurate, these methods are not scalable to the extensive genomic breadth of single-cell whole-genome (scWGS) and whole-exome sequencing (scWES) data.Here, we report on a new scalable method, Phylovar, which extends the phylogeny-guided variant calling approach to sequencing datasets containing millions of loci. Through benchmarking on simulated datasets under different settings, we show that, Phylovar outperforms SCIΦ in terms of running time while being more accurate than Monovar (which is not phylogeny-aware) in terms of SNV detection. Furthermore, we applied Phylovar to two real biological datasets: an scWES triple-negative breast cancer data consisting of 32 cells and 3375 loci as well as an scWGS data of neuron cells from a normal human brain containing 16 cells and approximately 2.5 million loci. For the cancer data, Phylovar detected somatic SNVs with high or moderate functional impact that were also supported by bulk sequencing dataset and for the neuron dataset, Phylovar identified 5745 SNVs with non-synonymous effects some of which were associated with neurodegenerative diseases.Phylovar is implemented in Python and is publicly available at https://github.com/NakhlehLab/Phylovar.© The Author(s) 2022.

"35685355","Can we infer tumor presence of single cell transcriptomes and their tumor of origin from bulk transcriptomes by machine learning?","Comput Struct Biotechnol J","There is a growing need to build a model that uses single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) to separate malignant cells from nonmalignant cells and to identify tumor of origin of single cells and/or circulating tumor cells (CTCs). Currently, it is infeasible to build a tumor of origin model learnt from scRNA-seq by machine learning (ML). We then wondered if an ML model learnt from bulk transcriptomes is applicable to scRNA-seq to infer single cells' tumor presence and further indicate their tumor of origin. We used k-nearest neighbors, one-versus-all support vector machine, one-versus-one support vector machine, random forest and introduced scTumorTrace to conduct a pioneering experiment containing leukocytes and seven major cancer types where bulk RNA-seq and scRNA-seq data were available. 13 ML models learnt from bulk RNA-seq were all reliable to use (F-score > 96%) shown by a validation set of bulk transcriptomes, but none of them was applicable to scRNA-seq except scTumorTrace. Making inferences from bulk RNA-seq to scRNA-seq was impaired by feature selection and improved by log2-transformed TPM units. scTumorTrace with transcriptome-wide 2-tuples showed F-score beyond 98.74 and 94.29% in inferring tumor presence and tumor of origin at single-cell resolution and correctly identified 45 single candidate prostate CTCs but lineage-confirmed non-CTCs as leukocytes. We concluded that modern ML techniques are quantitative and could hardly address the raised questions. scTumorTrace with transcriptome-wide 2-tuples is qualitative, standardization-free and not subject to log2-transformed quantities, enabling us to infer tumor presence of single cell transcriptomes and their tumor of origin from bulk transcriptomes.© 2022 The Author(s)."

We quantify base-specific RNA editing across three major cell populations from the human prefrontal cortex: glutamatergic neurons, medial ganglionic eminence-derived GABAergic neurons, and oligodendrocytes. We identify more selective editing and hyper-editing in neurons relative to oligodendrocytes. RNA editing patterns are highly cell type-specific, with 189,229 cell type-associated sites. The cellular specificity for thousands of sites is confirmed by single nucleus RNA-sequencing. Importantly, cell type-associated sites are enriched in GTEx RNA-sequencing data, edited ~twentyfold higher than all other sites, and variation in RNA editing is largely explained by neuronal proportions in bulk brain tissue. Finally, we uncover 661,791 cis-editing quantitative trait loci across thirteen brain regions, including hundreds with cell type-associated features. These data reveal an expansive repertoire of highly regulated RNA editing sites across human brain cell types and provide a resolved atlas linking cell types to editing variation and genetic regulatory effects.© 2022.

However, there are currently limited options for treating PCPF patients. To address this problem, we investigated COVID-19 patients' transcriptome at single-cell resolution and combined biological network analyses to repurpose the drugs treating PCPF. We revealed a novel gene signature of PCPF. The signature is functionally associated with the viral infection and lung fibrosis. Further, the signature has good performance in diagnosing and assessing pulmonary fibrosis. Next, we applied a network-based drug repurposing method to explore novel treatments for PCPF. By quantifying the proximity between the drug targets and the signature in the interactome, we identified several potential candidates and provided a drug list ranked by their proximity. Taken together, we revealed a novel gene expression signature as a theragnostic biomarker for PCPF by integrating different computational approaches. Moreover, we showed that network-based proximity could be used as a framework to repurpose drugs for PCPF."
"35626576","Inference of Molecular Regulatory Systems Using Statistical Path-Consistency Algorithm.","Entropy (Basel)","One of the key challenges in systems biology and molecular sciences is how to infer regulatory relationships between genes and proteins using high-throughout omics datasets. Although a wide range of methods have been designed to reverse engineer the regulatory networks, recent studies show that the inferred network may depend on the variable order in the dataset. In this work, we develop a new algorithm, called the statistical path-consistency algorithm (SPCA), to solve the problem of the dependence of variable order. This method generates a number of different variable orders using random samples, and then infers a network by using the path-consistent algorithm based on each variable order. We propose measures to determine the edge weights using the corresponding edge weights in the inferred networks, and choose the edges with the largest weights as the putative regulations between genes or proteins. The developed method is rigorously assessed by the six benchmark networks in DREAM challenges, the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway, and a cancer-specific gene regulatory network. The inferred networks are compared with those obtained by using two up-to-date inference methods. The accuracy of the inferred networks shows that the developed method is effective for discovering molecular regulatory systems."

Our lab previously showed the toxicological value of the scRNA-seq pipeline to characterize the sequelae of TCDD exposure in testes, demonstrating that loss of spermatids and spermatozoa, but not other cell types, contributed to the pathology of infertility in adult male zebrafish exposed during sexual differentiation. To investigate the potential for technical artifacts in scRNA-seq such as cell dissociation effects and reduced transcriptome coverage, we compared bulk-sequenced and scRNA-seq-paired samples from control and TCDD-exposed samples to understand what is gained and lost in scRNA-seq vs bulk-seq, both transcriptomically and toxicologically. We hypothesized that the testes may be sensitive to tissue disruption as they contain multiple cell types under constant division and/or maturation, and that TCDD exposure may mediate the extent of sensitivity. Thus, we sought to understand the extent to which this dissociation impacts the toxicological value of data returned from scRNA-seq. We confirm that the required dissociation of individual cells from intact tissue has a significant impact on gene expression, affecting gene pathways with the potential to confound toxicogenomics studies on exposures if findings are not well-controlled and well-situated in context. Additionally, a common scRNA-seq method using cDNA amplified from the 3' end of mRNA under-detects low-expressing transcripts including transcription factors. We confirm this, and show TCDD-related genes may be overlooked by scRNA-seq, however, this under-detection effect is not mediated by TCDD exposure. Even so, scRNA-seq generally extracted toxicologically relevant information better than the bulk-seq method in the present study. This report aims to inform future experimental design for transcriptomic investigation in the growing field of toxicogenomics by demonstrating the differential information extracted from sequencing cells-despite being from the same tissue and exposure scheme-is influenced by the specific protocol used, with implications for the interpretation of exposure-induced risk.Copyright © 2022 Haimbaugh, Meyer, Akemann, Gurdziel and Baker."

No correlation between UVR level and melanoma incidence was present when Eu% (depigmented or light skin type) was kept statistically constant, even after adjusting for other known variables.

Compared with labetalol (26.0%), risk of preterm delivery was similar for methyldopa (26.5%; aOR 1.10 [0.95 to 1.27]) and slightly higher for nifedipine (28.5%; aOR 1.25 [1.06 to 1.46]) and other β-blockers (31.2%; aOR 1.58 [1.07 to 2.23]). Neonatal ICU admission was more common with nifedipine than labetalol (25.9% vs. 23.3%, aOR 1.21 [1.02 to 1.43]) but not elevated with methyldopa. Risks of other outcomes did not differ by medication.Risk of most outcomes was similar comparing labetalol, methyldopa and nifedipine. Risk of the infant being small for gestational age was substantially lower for methyldopa, suggesting this medication may warrant further consideration."

Chronic alcohol consumption may alter RNA methylome (or epitranscriptome) in the NAc, leading to altered gene expression and thus behavioral neuroadaptation to alcohol.This pilot study profiled the epitranscriptomes of mRNAs, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), and microRNAs (miRNAs) in postmortem NAc of three male Caucasian subjects with alcohol use disorder (AUD) and three matched male Caucasian control subjects using Arraystar's m6A-mRNA&lncRNA Epitranscriptomic Microarray assay. Differentially methylated (DM) RNAs and the function of DM RNAs were analyzed by biostatistics and bioinformatics programs.26 mRNAs were hypermethylated and three mRNAs were hypomethylated in the NAc of AUD subjects (≥2-fold changes andp≤ 0.05). Most of these 29 DM mRNAs are involved in immune-related pathways (e.g., IL-17 signaling). Moreover, four lncRNAs were hypermethylated and one lncRNA was hypomethylated in the NAc of AUD subjects (≥2-fold changes andp≤ 0.05). Additionally, three miRNAs were hypermethylated in the NAc of AUD subjects (≥2-fold changes andp≤ 0.05).This study revealed RNA methylomic changes in the NAc of AUD subjects, suggesting that chronic alcohol consumption may lead to AUD through epitranscriptomic RNA modifications. Our findings need to be replicated in a larger sample."

Dysregulated inflammatory and immune responses to surgery correlate with reduced surgical outcomes, but the dysregulated gene signatures in patients with stiffness after TKA are poorly defined. As a consequence, we are limited in our ability to identify patients at risk of developing poor surgical outcomes and develop preventative approaches. In this pilot study we aimed to identify perioperative blood gene signatures in patients undergoing TKA for knee osteoarthritis and its association with early surgical outcomes, specifically knee range of motion. To do this, we integrated clinical outcomes collected at 6 weeks after surgery with transcriptomics analyses in blood samples collected immediately before surgery and at 24 h after surgery. We found that patients with stiffness at 6 weeks after surgery have a more variable and attenuated circulating gene expression response immediately after surgery. Our results suggest that patients with stiffness following TKA may have distinct gene expression signatures detectable in peripheral blood in the immediate postoperative period.© 2022.

"35814409","Drug Repurposing by Tumor Tissue Editing.","Front Oncol","The combinatory use of drugs for systemic cancer therapy commonly aims at the direct elimination of tumor cells through induction of apoptosis. An alternative approach becomes the focus of attention if biological changes in tumor tissues following combinatory administration of regulatorily active drugs are considered as a therapeutic aim, e.g., differentiation, transdifferentiation induction, reconstitution of immunosurveillance, the use of alternative cell death mechanisms. Editing of the tumor tissue establishes new biological 'hallmarks' as a 'pressure point' to attenuate tumor growth. This may be achieved with repurposed, regulatorily active drug combinations, often simultaneously targeting different cell compartments of the tumor tissue. Moreover, tissue editing is paralleled by decisive functional changes in tumor tissues providing novel patterns of target sites for approved drugs. Thus, agents with poor activity in non-edited tissue may reveal new clinically meaningful outcomes. For tissue editing and targeting edited tissue novel requirements concerning drug selection and administration can be summarized according to available clinical and pre-clinical data. Monoactivity is no pre-requisite, but combinatory bio-regulatory activity. The regulatorily active dose may be far below the maximum tolerable dose, and besides inhibitory active drugs stimulatory drug activities may be integrated. Metronomic scheduling often seems to be of advantage. Novel preclinical approaches like functional assays testing drug combinations in tumor tissue are needed to select potential drugs for repurposing. The two-step drug repurposing procedure, namely establishing novel functional systems states in tumor tissues and consecutively providing novel target sites for approved drugs, facilitates the systematic identification of drug activities outside the scope of any original clinical drug approvals.Copyright © 2022 Lüke, Harrer, Pantziarka, Pukrop, Ghibelli, Gerner, Reichle and Heudobler."
"35712255","Novel Targeting of DNA Methyltransferase Activity Inhibits Ewing Sarcoma Cell Proliferation and Enhances Tumor Cell Sensitivity to DNA Damaging Drugs by Activating the DNA Damage Response.","Front Endocrinol (Lausanne)","DNA methylation is an important component of the epigenetic machinery that regulates the malignancy of Ewing sarcoma (EWS), the second most common primary bone tumor in children and adolescents. Coordination of DNA methylation and DNA replication is critical for maintaining epigenetic programming and the DNMT1 enzyme has been demonstrated to have an important role in both maintaining the epigenome and controlling cell cycle. Here, we showed that the novel nonnucleoside DNMT inhibitor (DNMTi) MC3343 induces a specific depletion of DNMT1 and affects EWS tumor proliferation through a mechanism that is independent on DNA methylation. Depletion of DNMT1 causes perturbation of the cell cycle, with an accumulation of cells in the G1 phase, and DNA damage, as revealed by the induction of γH2AX foci. These effects elicited activation of p53-dependent signaling and apoptosis in p53wt cells, while in p53 mutated cells, persistent micronuclei and increased DNA instability was observed. Treatment with MC3343 potentiates the efficacy of DNA damaging agents such as doxorubicin and PARP-inhibitors (PARPi). This effect correlates with increased DNA damage and synergistic tumor cytotoxicity, supporting the use of the DNMTi MC3343 as an adjuvant agent in treating EWS.Copyright © 2022 Cristalli, Manara, Valente, Pellegrini, Bavelloni, De Feo, Blalock, Di Bello, Piñeyro, Merkel, Esteller, Tirado, Mai and Scotlandi."

"35859180","Deep whole-genome ctDNA chronology of treatment-resistant prostate cancer.","Nature","Circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) in blood plasma is an emerging tool for clinical cancer genotyping and longitudinal disease monitoring1. However, owing to past emphasis on targeted and low-resolution profiling approaches, our understanding of the distinct populations that comprise bulk ctDNA is incomplete2-12. Here we perform deep whole-genome sequencing of serial plasma and synchronous metastases in patients with aggressive prostate cancer. We comprehensively assess all classes of genomic alterations and show that ctDNA contains multiple dominant populations, the evolutionary histories of which frequently indicate whole-genome doubling and shifts in mutational processes. Although tissue and ctDNA showed concordant clonally expanded cancer driver alterations, most individual metastases contributed only a minor share of total ctDNA. By comparing serial ctDNA before and after clinical progression on potent inhibitors of the androgen receptor (AR) pathway, we reveal population restructuring converging solely on AR augmentation as the dominant genomic driver of acquired treatment resistance. Finally, we leverage nucleosome footprints in ctDNA to infer mRNA expression in synchronously biopsied metastases, including treatment-induced changes in AR transcription factor signalling activity. Our results provide insights into cancer biology and show that liquid biopsy can be used as a tool for comprehensive multi-omic discovery.© 2022.

The model provides a quantification of tumor cell dissemination rates between the tumor and metastasis sites. These rates were used to estimate the probability of developing a metastasis for untreated patients. The model was validated using tenfold cross-validation. We also investigated the effect of HER2 (Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2) status, estrogen receptor (ER) status and progesterone receptor (PR) status on the probability of metastatic spread. We found that dissemination rate through secondary seeding is up to 300 times higher than through primary seeding. Hormone receptor positivity promotes seeding to the bone and reduces seeding to the lungs and primary seeding to the liver, while HER2 expression increases dissemination to the bone, lungs and primary seeding to the liver. Secondary seeding from the lungs to the liver seems to be hormone receptor-independent, while that from the lungs to the brain appears HER2-independent.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35844557","Identification of Critical Biomarkers and Immune Infiltration in Rheumatoid Arthritis Based on WGCNA and LASSO Algorithm.","Front Immunol","Rheumatoid arthritis(RA) is the most common inflammatory arthritis, and a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. RA patients' synovial inflammation contains a variety of genes and signalling pathways that are poorly understood. It was the goal of this research to discover the major biomarkers related to the course of RA and how they connect to immune cell infiltration. The Gene Expression Omnibus was used to download gene microarray data. Differential expression analysis, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression were used to identify hub markers for RA. Single-sample GSEA was used to examine the infiltration levels of 28 immune cells and their connection to hub gene markers. The hub genes' expression in RA-HFLS and HFLS cells was verified by RT-PCR. The CCK-8 assay was applied to determine the roles of hub genes in RA. In this study, we identified 21 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in RA. WGCNA yielded two co-expression modules, one of which exhibited the strongest connection with RA. Using a combination of differential genes, a total of 6 intersecting genes was discovered. Six hub genes were identified as possible biomarkers for RA after a lasso analysis was performed on the data. Three hub genes, CKS2, CSTA, and LY96, were found to have high diagnostic value using ROC curve analysis. They were shown to be closely related to the concentrations of several immune cells. RT-PCR confirmed that the expressions of CKS2, CSTA and LY96 were distinctly upregulated in RA-HFLS cells compared with HFLS cells. More importantly, knockdown of CKS2 suppressed the proliferation of RA-HFLS cells. Overall, to help diagnose and treat RA, it's expected that CKS2, CSTA, and LY96 will be available, and the aforementioned infiltration of immune cells may have a significant impact on the onset and progression of the disease.Copyright © 2022 Jiang, Zhou and Shen."

Indeed, many animal and human studies involving innovative techniques have shed light on the complex regulation ofIGF2expression. The physiological roles of IGF-II have also been documented, revealing pleiotropic tissue-specific and developmental-stage-dependent action. Furthermore, in recent years, animal studies have highlighted important interspecies differences in IGF-II function, gene expression and regulation. The identification of human disorders due to impairedIGF2gene expression has also helped to elucidate the major role of IGF-II in growth and in tumor proliferation. The Silver-Russell and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndromes are the most representative imprinted disorders, as they constitute both phenotypic and molecular mirrors ofIGF2-linked abnormalities. The characterization of patients with either epigenetic or genetic defects alteringIGF2expression has confirmed the central role of IGF-II in human growth regulation, particularly before birth, and its effects on broader body functions, such as metabolism or tumor susceptibility. Given the long-term health impact of these rare disorders, it is important to understand the consequences ofIGF2defects in these patients."
"35724961","Identification of a distal enhancer that determines the expression pattern of acute phase marker C-reactive protein.","J Biol Chem","C-reactive protein (CRP) is a major acute phase protein and inflammatory marker, the expression of which is largely liver specific and highly inducible. Enhancers are regulatory elements critical for the precise activation of gene expression, yet the contributions of enhancers to the expression pattern of CRP have not been well defined. Here, we identify a constitutively active enhancer (E1) located 37.7 kb upstream of the promoter of human CRP in hepatocytes. By using chromatin immunoprecipitation, luciferase reporter assay, in situ genetic manipulation, CRISPRi, and CRISPRa, we show that E1 is enriched in binding sites for transcription factors STAT3 and C/EBP-β and is essential for the full induction of human CRP during the acute phase. Moreover, we demonstrate that E1 orchestrates with the promoter of CRP to determine its varied expression across tissues and species through surveying activities of E1-promoter hybrids and the associated epigenetic modifications. These results thus suggest an intriguing mode of molecular evolution wherein expression-changing mutations in distal regulatory elements initiate subsequent functional selection involving coupling among distal/proximal regulatory mutations and activity-changing coding mutations.Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the parallel effects ofAPOEgenetic variants and promoter methylation levels of six CpGs on the risk of diabetic dyslipidemia. A total of 204 Palestinian type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients (mean age ± SD: 62.7±10.2) were enrolled in the present study (n=96 with dyslipidemia and n=108 without dyslipidemia). Next generation sequencing was performed to analyze five single nucleotide polymorphisms: Two variants rs7412 and rs429358 that determineAPOEε alleles, and three variants in the promoter region (rs769446, rs449647, and rs405509). For all subjects, the most common genotype was ε3/ε3 (79.4%). No statistical differences were observed in theAPOEε polymorphisms and the three promoter variants among T2D patients with and without dyslipidemia (P>0.05). A comparison of lipid parameters between ε3/ε3 subjects and ε4 carriers in both groups revealed no significant differences in the mean values of LDL-C, HDL-C, TG, and TC levels (P>0.05). Six CpG sites in theAPOEpromoter on chromosome 19:44905755-44906078 were identified, and differential DNA methylation in these CpGs were observed between the study groups. Logistic regression analysis revealed a significant association of DNA methylation level at the six CpGs with an increased risk of diabetic dyslipidemia (odds ratio, 1.038; 95% confidence interval, 1.012-1.064; P=0.004). In conclusion, the present study revealed that DNA methylation levels in six CpGs in theAPOEpromoter region was associated with the risk of diabetic dyslipidemia independently of theAPOEε4 variant which could be a potential therapeutic target to reverse the methylation of theAPOEpromoter.Copyright: © Ereqat et al."
"35880026","Chronology of natural selection in Oceanian genomes.","iScience","As human populations left Asia to first settle in Oceania around 50,000 years ago, they entered a territory ecologically separated from the Old World for millions of years. We analyzed genomic data of 239 modern Oceanian individuals to detect and date signals of selection specific to this region. Combining both relative and absolute dating approaches, we identified a strong selection pattern between 52,000 and 54,000 years ago in the genomes of descendants of the first settlers of Sahul. This strikingly corresponds to the dates of initial settlement as inferred from archaeological evidence. Loci under selection during this period, some showing enrichment in Denisovan ancestry, overlap genes involved in the immune response and diet, especially based on plants. Pathogens and natural resources, especially from endemic plants, therefore appear to have acted as strong selective pressures on the genomes of the first settlers of Sahul.© 2022 The Authors."

Here, we show how evolutionary forces affecting selection, including recombination and effective population size, drive genomic patterns of allele-specific expression (ASE). Integrating tissue-specific genotypic and transcriptomic data from 1500 individuals from two different cohorts, we demonstrate that ASE is less often observed in regions of low recombination, and loci in high or normal recombination regions are more efficient at using ASE to underexpress harmful mutations. By tracking genetic ancestry, we discriminate between ASE variability due to past demographic effects, including subsequent bottlenecks, versus local environment. We observe that ASE is not randomly distributed along the genome and that population parameters influencing the efficacy of natural selection alter ASE levels genome wide."

We are committed to finding promising biomarkers for the treatment of PTB.An extensive search of the literature was conducted with MEDLINE/PubMed, and in total, 151 studies were included and summarized in the present review.Substantial evidence supports that the infection and/or inflammatory cascade associated with infection is an early event in PTB. Toll-like receptor (TLR) is a prominent pattern recognition receptor (PRR) found on both immune and non-immune cells, including fetal membrane cells. The activation of TLR downstream molecules, followed by TLR binding to its ligand, is critical for infection and inflammation, leading to the involvement of the TLR signaling pathway in PTB. TLR ligands are derived from microbial components and molecules released by damaged and dead cells. Particularly, TLR4 is an essential TLR because of its ability to recognize lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In this comprehensive overview, we discuss the role of TLR signaling in PTB, focus on numerous host-derived genetic and epigenetic regulators of the TLR signaling pathway, and cover ongoing research and prospective therapeutic options for treating PTB by inhibiting TLR signaling.This is a critical topic because TLR-related molecules and mechanisms may enable obstetricians to better understand the physiological changes in PTB and develop new treatment and prevention strategies.© 2022.

Its beneficial effect has been revealed in terms of both the neonatal period and those of lifelong effects. However, as for protection against allergy, there is not enough data. In the current narrative review, the literature within the last five years from clinical trials and population-based studies on breastfeeding and allergy from different aspects was explored. The aim of this review was to explain how different factors could contribute to the overall effect of BF. Special consideration was given to accompanying exposure to cow milk, supplement use, the introduction of solid foods, microbiota changes, and the epigenetic function of BF. Those factors seem to be modifying the impact of BF. We also identified studies regarding BF in atopic mothers, with SCFA as a main player explaining differences according to this status. Conclusion: Based on the population-based studies, breastfeeding could be protective against some allergic phenotypes, but the results differ within different study groups. According to the new research in that matter, the effect of BF could be modified by different genetic (HMO composition), environmental (cesarean section, allergen exposure), dietary (SCFA, introduction of solid food), and immunologic factors (IgG, IgE), thus partially explaining the variance."

We herein revealed an antisense Alu element insertion/deletion polymorphism in intron 4 of ALDH1A1, and hypothesized that it might play a role in PD.  METHODS: A Han Chinese cohort comprising 488 PD patients and 515 controls was recruited to validate the Alu insertion/deletion polymorphism following a previous study of tag-single nucleotide polymorphisms, where rs7043217 was shown to be significantly associated with PD. Functional analyses of the Alu element insertion were performed.The Alu element of ALDH1A1 was identified to be a variant of Yb8 subfamily and termed as Yb8c4. The antisense Yb8c4 insertion/deletion polymorphism (named asYb8c4insand asYb8c4del, respectively) appeared to be in a complete linkage disequilibrium with rs7043217 and was validated to be significantly associated with PD susceptibility with asYb8c4insserving as a risk allele (P = 0.030, OR = 1.224, 95% CI = 1.020-1.470). Multiple functional analyses including ALDH1A1 mRNA expression in blood cells of carriers, and reporters of EGFP and luciferase showed that the asYb8c4inshad a suppressive activity on gene transcription. Mechanistic explorations suggested that the asYb8c4insinduced no changes in CpG methylation and mRNA splicing of ALDH1A1 and appeared no binding of transcription factors.Our results consolidate an involvement of ALDH1 in PD pathogenesis. The asYb8c4 polymorphism may be a functional output of its linkage disequilibrium-linked single nucleotide polymorphisms.© 2022. The Author(s)."

Natriuretic peptides (NPs) family, including Corin-B type natriuretic peptide (BNP)-neprilysin (NEP) protein levels increased with age and are risk markers of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, such as AF and cardioembolic stroke. Aging is also linked to epigenetics, specifically DNA methylation. However, only a few studies have investigated the effect of DNA methylation on the NP system. Thus, the present study aimed to investigate whether the Corin-BNP-NEP protein pathway is involved in the pathogenesis of AF-stroke and CpG methylation in the promoter region of the Corin protein gene has an effect on AF-related ischemic stroke.A total of 82 patients hospitalized with acute ischemic strokes were enrolled in this study. The differences in clinical information were compared between the AF-stroke (n= 37) and no AF-stroke groups (n= 45). Plasma-soluble Corin and NEP were detected using an ELISA kit. CpG methylation in the promoter region of the gene was assessed by a next-generation sequencing-based bisulfite sequencing polymerase chain reaction (BSP).(1) Patients in AF-stroke were older, had higher initial NIHSS score, 90-day mRs, higher D2-dimer, INR, and APTT, and low TG, TC, and HbA1c (allp< 0.05). (2) Serum levels of Corin and BNP in the AF-stroke group were significantly higher than that in the no AF-stroke group (p< 0.05). No significant difference was detected in the serum levels of NEP between the two groups. (3) The levels of CpG methylation in the promoter region of the Corin protein gene in the AF-stroke group was significantly lower than that in the no AF-stroke group (p< 0.05). The CpG sites with maximal methylation differences between the two groups were CORIN:678, CORIN:682, CORIN:694, and CORIN:700.The current findings raise the possibility that the Corin-BNP-NEP protein pathway may be involved in the pathogenesis of AF-related ischemic stroke.

Here, we follow the hypothesis, that mitochondria dysfunction which is inevitably associated with bioenergetic disbalance is a risk factor that contributes to the susceptibility of an individual to develop MDD. Thus, we investigated molecular mechanisms related to mitochondrial function in induced neuronal progenitor cells (NPCs) which were reprogrammed from fibroblasts of eight MDD patients and eight non-depressed controls. We found significantly lower maximal respiration rates, altered cytosolic basal calcium levels, and smaller soma size in NPCs derived from MDD patients. These findings are partially consistent with our earlier observations in MDD patient-derived fibroblasts. Furthermore, we differentiated MDD and control NPCs into iPS-neurons and analyzed their passive biophysical and active electrophysiological properties to investigate whether neuronal function can be related to altered mitochondrial activity and bioenergetics. Interestingly, MDD patient-derived iPS-neurons showed significantly lower membrane capacitance, a less hyperpolarized membrane potential, increased Na+current density and increased spontaneous electrical activity. Our findings indicate that functional differences evident in fibroblasts derived from MDD patients are partially present after reprogramming to induced-NPCs, could relate to altered function of iPS-neurons and thus might be associated with the aetiology of major depressive disorder.© 2022.

"35620395","The Emerging Roles and Therapeutic Implications of Epigenetic Modifications in Ovarian Cancer.","Front Endocrinol (Lausanne)","Ovarian cancer (OC) is one of the most lethal gynecologic malignancies globally. In spite of positive responses to initial therapy, the overall survival rates of OC patients remain poor due to the development of drug resistance and consequent cancer recurrence. Indeed, intensive studies have been conducted to unravel the molecular mechanisms underlying OC therapeutic resistance. Besides, emerging evidence suggests a crucial role for epigenetic modifications, namely, DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNA regulation, in the drug resistance of OC. These epigenetic modifications contribute to chemoresistance through various mechanisms, namely, upregulating the expression of multidrug resistance proteins (MRPs), remodeling of the tumor microenvironment, and deregulated immune response. Therefore, an in-depth understanding of the role of epigenetic mechanisms in clinical therapeutic resistance may improve the outcome of OC patients. In this review, we will discuss the epigenetic regulation of OC drug resistance and propose the potential clinical implications of epigenetic therapies to prevent or reverse OC drug resistance, which may inspire novel treatment options by targeting resistance mechanisms for drug-resistant OC patients.Copyright © 2022 Wang, Huang, Li, Liu and Huang."

In addition,PNPLA6transcription was significantly enhanced following treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine methylation inhibitor in HPCASMC.The receiver operating characteristic analyses of curves showed that thePNPLA6mean methylation [area under the curve (AUC) = 0.74,p< 0.001] and mRNA expression (AUC = 0.86,p< 0.001) could have a diagnostic value for patients with IA.Conclusion: Although future functional experiments are required to test our hypothesis, our study demonstrated thatPNPLA6methylation and mRNA expression were significantly associated with the risk of IA; thus, they show potential for use in the early diagnosis of IA.Copyright © 2022 Zhou, Zhang, Zhou, Gong, Zhu, Pan, Sun, Gao and Huang."
"35711063","A single-cell transcriptomic atlas tracking the neural basis of division of labour in an ant superorganism.","Nat Ecol Evol","Ant colonies with permanent division of labour between castes and highly distinct roles of the sexes have been conceptualized to be superorganisms, but the cellular and molecular mechanisms that mediate caste/sex-specific behavioural specialization have remained obscure. Here we characterized the brain cell repertoire of queens, gynes (virgin queens), workers and males of Monomorium pharaonis by obtaining 206,367 single-nucleus transcriptomes. In contrast to Drosophila, the mushroom body Kenyon cells are abundant in ants and display a high diversity with most subtypes being enriched in worker brains, the evolutionarily derived caste. Male brains are as specialized as worker brains but with opposite trends in cell composition with higher abundances of all optic lobe neuronal subtypes, while the composition of gyne and queen brains remained generalized, reminiscent of solitary ancestors. Role differentiation from virgin gynes to inseminated queens induces abundance changes in roughly 35% of cell types, indicating active neurogenesis and/or programmed cell death during this transition. We also identified insemination-induced cell changes probably associated with the longevity and fecundity of the reproductive caste, including increases of ensheathing glia and a population of dopamine-regulated Dh31-expressing neurons. We conclude that permanent caste differentiation and extreme sex-differentiation induced major changes in the neural circuitry of ants.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35697513","Robust, long-term video EEG monitoring in a porcine model of post-traumatic epilepsy.","eNeuro","To date, post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE) research in large animal models has been limited. Recent advances in neocortical microscopy have made possible new insights into neocortical PTE. However, it is very difficult to engender convincing neocortical PTE in rodents. Thus, large animal models that develop neocortical PTE may provide useful insights that also can be more comparable to human patients. Because gyrencephalic species have prolonged latent periods, long-term video EEG recording is required. Here, we report a fully subcutaneous EEG implant with synchronized video in freely ambulatory swine for up to 13 months during epileptogenesis following bilateral cortical impact injuries or sham surgery The advantages of this system include the availability of a commercially available system that is simple to install, a low failure rate after surgery for EEG implantation, radiotelemetry that enables continuous monitoring of freely ambulating animals, excellent synchronization to video to EEG, and a robust signal to noise ratio. The disadvantages of this system in this species and age are the accretion of skull bone which entirely embedded a subset of skull screws and EEG electrodes, and the inability to rearrange the EEG electrode array. These disadvantages may be overcome by splicing a subdural electrode strip to the electrode leads so that skull growth is less likely to interfere with long-term signal capture and by placing two implants for a more extensive montage. This commercially available system in this bilateral cortical impact swine model may be useful to a wide range of investigators studying epileptogenesis in PTE.SignificancePost-traumatic epilepsy (PTE) is a cause of significant morbidity after traumatic brain injury (TBI) and is often drug-resistant. Robust, informative animal models would greatly facilitate PTE research. Ideally, this biofidelic model of PTE would utilize a species that approximates human brain anatomy, brain size, glial populations, and inflammatory pathways. An ideal model would also incorporate feasible methods for long-term video EEG recording required to quantify seizure activity. Here, we describe the first model of PTE in swine and describe a method for robust long-term video EEG monitoring for up to 13 months post-TBI. The relatively easy ""out-of-the-box"" radiotelemetry system and surgical techniques described here will be adaptable by a wide array of investigators studying the pathogenesis and treatment of PTE.Copyright © 2022 Martinez-Ramirez et al."

Recently, the mutations in ubiquitin-associated protein 1 (UBAP1) have been described in patients with HSP, known as spastic paraplegias 80 (SPG80). Here, we reported a Chinese HSP family presenting a frameshift mutation in theUBAP1gene leading to complex HSP. Their clinical features encompassed spastic paraparetic gait, exaggerated patellar tendon reflexes, bilateral Babinski signs, and hyperactive Achilles tendon reflex. The proband also had severe urinary incontinence and a dermoid cyst at the lumbar 4-5 spinal cord, which rarely occurs in HSP patients. Following whole-exome sequencing, a novel heterozygous mutation (c.437dupG, NM_016,525) was identified in theUBAP1that segregated with the family's phenotype and resulted in truncating UBAP1 protein (p.Ser146ArgfsTer13). Moreover, we reviewed the genotypes ofUBAP1and the phenotypic variability in 90 HSP patients reported in the literature. We found that the age of onset in UBAP1-related patients was juvenile, and there were population differences in the age of onset. The main complications were lower extremity spasticity, hyperreflexia, and the Babinski sign. Exon 4 of UBAP1 was identified as a mutation hotspot region. Our study expands the knowledge of UBAP1 mutations, which will aid in HSP patient counseling. Further molecular biological research is needed to explore the genotype-phenotype correlations of UBAP1-related HSP.Copyright © 2022 Li, Huang, Chai, Zhu, Huang, Ma, Zhang and Xie."

However, the generation of Markov chains is computationally slow. We introduce a form of blocked Gibbs sampling for estimating SNP effects from Markov chains that greatly reduces computational time by sampling each SNP effect iteratively n-times from conditional block posteriors. Subsequent iteration over all blocks m-times produces chains of length m × n. We use this strategy to solve large-scale genomic prediction and fine-mapping problems using the Bayesian MCMC mixed-effects genetic model, BayesR3. We validate the method using simulated data, followed by analysis of empirical dairy cattle data using high dimension milk mid infra-red spectra data as an example of ""omics"" data and show its use to increase the precision of mapping variants affecting milk, fat, and protein yields relative to a univariate analysis of milk, fat, and protein.© 2022.

Recent reports highlighted that butyrate, one of the short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) primarily originated from the fermentation of dietary fiber in the gut, attenuates inflammation and fibrosis in the prevention and treatment of DKD; however, the molecular mechanisms are still unclear. Histone lysine butyrylation (Kbu), a novel histone modification marker induced by butyrate, has been found to be involved in the regulation of pathophysiological processes. To reveal the mechanisms of butyrate-induced histone (Kbu), in the prevention and treatment of DKD, both DKD modelsin vivoandin vitrowere treated with sodium butyrate (NaB). Our results confirmed that exogenous NaB improved the disorder of glucose and lipid metabolism, prevented proteinuria and renal failure, and inhibited renal inflammation and fibrosis. Meanwhile, NaB also induced histone Kbu and H3K9 butyrylation (H3K9bu)in vivoandin vitro; however, inhibition of histone Kbu with the histone modification enzyme p300 inhibitor A485 reversed the anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrosis effects of NaB. In conclusion, our data reveal that NaB antagonizes renal inflammatory and fibrosis injury and attenuates DKD possibly via histone Kbu, suggesting that butyrate-induced histone Kbu or H3K9bu may be an important molecular mechanism in the pathogenesis and treatment of DKD.Copyright © 2022 Tingting Zhou et al."
"35756735","Sodium-glucose cotransporter inhibition in polycystic kidney disease: fact or fiction.","Clin Kidney J","Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most prevalent hereditary kidney disease. Recent evidence suggests that the pathogenesis of ADPKD is a complex web of abnormal cellular processes including altered cell signaling, disordered cell metabolism, impaired autophagy, increased apoptosis, mitochondrial dysfunction and chronic inflammation. Sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT) inhibitors (SGLTi) reduce body weight, blood pressure and blood glucose levels, have kidney and cardiovascular protective activity, and have been reported to decrease inflammation, increase autophagy and improve mitochondrial dysfunction. We now review results from preclinical studies on SGLTi for ADPKD identified through a systematic search of the MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, Embase and PubMed databases. Potential underlying mechanisms for the conflicting results reported as well as implications for clinical translation are discussed, as ADPKD patients were excluded from clinical trials exploring kidney protection by SGLT2 inhibitors (SGLT2i). However, they were not excluded from cardiovascular safety trials or trials for cardiovascular conditions. A post-hoc analysis of the kidney function trajectories and safety of SGLT2i in ADPKD patients enrolled in such trials may provide additional information. In conclusion, SGLT2i are cardio- and nephroprotective in diverse clinical situations. Currently, it is unclear whether ADPKD patients may benefit from SGLT2i in terms of kidney function preservation, and their safety in this population remains unexplored. We propose a roadmap to address this unmet clinical need.© The Author(s) 2022. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the ERA."
"35892331","Molecular Biomarkers in Cancer.","Biomolecules","Molecular cancer biomarkers are any measurable molecular indicator of risk of cancer, occurrence of cancer, or patient outcome. They may include germline or somatic genetic variants, epigenetic signatures, transcriptional changes, and proteomic signatures. These indicators are based on biomolecules, such as nucleic acids and proteins, that can be detected in samples obtained from tissues through tumor biopsy or, more easily and non-invasively, from blood (or serum or plasma), saliva, buccal swabs, stool, urine, etc. Detection technologies have advanced tremendously over the last decades, including techniques such as next-generation sequencing, nanotechnology, or methods to study circulating tumor DNA/RNA or exosomes. Clinical applications of biomarkers are extensive. They can be used as tools for cancer risk assessment, screening and early detection of cancer, accurate diagnosis, patient prognosis, prediction of response to therapy, and cancer surveillance and monitoring response. Therefore, they can help to optimize making decisions in clinical practice. Moreover, precision oncology is needed for newly developed targeted therapies, as they are functional only in patients with specific cancer genetic mutations, and biomarkers are the tools used for the identification of these subsets of patients. Improvement in the field of cancer biomarkers is, however, needed to overcome the scientific challenge of developing new biomarkers with greater sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value."

Although recent FDA approvals of both single and multi-analyte liquid biopsy companion diagnostic assays are proof of the tremendous progress made in this domain, using ctDNA for the diagnosis of early-stage (stage I/II) cancers remains challenging due to several factors, such as low mutational allele frequency in circulation, overlapping profiles in genomic alterations among diverse cancers, and clonal hematopoiesis.

High-capacity refrigerated centrifuges, which have the advantage of handling large volumes of blood samples, are widely utilized, but they are bulky, non-transportable, and prohibitively expensive for low-resource settings, with prices starting at $1,500. On the other hand, there are low-cost commercial and open-source micro-centrifuges available, but they are incapable of handling typical clinical amounts of blood samples (2-10mL). There is currently no low-cost CE marked centrifuge that can process large volumes of clinical blood samples on the market. As a solution, we customised the rotor of a commercially available low-cost micro-centrifuge (~$125) using 3D printing to enable centrifugation of large clinical blood samples in resource poor-settings. Our custom adaptor ($15) can hold two 9 mL S-Monovette tubes and achieve the same separation performance (yield, cell count, hemolysis, albumin levels) as the control benchtop refrigerated centrifuge, and even outperformed the control in platelet separation by at least four times. This low-cost open-source centrifugation system capable of processing clinical blood tubes could be valuable to low-resource settings where centrifugation is required immediately after blood withdrawal for further testing."

It should be noted that ultrasound is already widely used as a diagnostic procedure for detecting tumorigenesis. In addition, ultrasound energy can also be utilized effectively for treating cancer. By filling the interior of lipospheres with gas molecules, these particles can serve both as contrast agents for ultrasonic imaging and as delivery systems for drugs such as microbubbles and nanobubbles. Therefore, this review aims to describe the nanoparticle-assisted drug delivery system and how it can enhance image analysis and biomedicine. The formation characteristics of nanoparticles indicate that they will accumulate at the tumor site upon ultrasonic imaging, in accordance with their modification characteristics. As a result of changing the accumulation of materials, it is possible to examine the results by comparing images of other tumor cell lines. It is also possible to investigate ultrasound images for evidence of cellular effects. In combination with a precision ultrasound imaging system, drug-carrying lipospheres can precisely track tumor tissue and deliver drugs to tumor cells to enhance the ability of this nanocomposite to treat cancer."

This study aimed to report the burden differences, pattern trend, and potential risk factors of all neoplasm types in China in recent 30 years, and further compared with top economies in the world.The disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) and age-standardized DALY rate (ASDR) of all neoplasms with the attributable risk factors from 1990 to 2019 in China, Japan, European Union, USA, and the world were extracted from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019. The temporal trend analysis was estimated using the joinpoint regression model.In 2019, about 251.4 million DALYs worldwide were caused by all neoplasms, and nearly 26.9% (67.5 million DALYs) occurred in China with the ASDR in 2019 of 342.09/10 000, which was higher than European Union (334.25/10 000), USA (322.94/10 000), and Japan (250.36/10 000). Although the cancer burden of the colorectum, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, oral cavity, ovary, and kidney in China was lower than in Japan, European Union and USA, the corresponding ASDR gradually increased in China over the past 30 years, but declined in the three developed areas. Around 46.29% of overall neoplasms DALYs in China in 2019 were attributed to 22 identified risk factors, and the specific risk attributable-fraction for several neoplasm types varied greatly in these regions.The ASDR of cancers of the lung, colorectum, pancreas, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, oral cavity, ovary, kidney, and chronic lymphoid leukemia increased in China compared to 30 years ago. With the population aging and the social transformation in China, the increasing burden of neoplasms and the changing spectrum of neoplasms suggest that effective comprehensive prevention and treatment measures should be adopted to reduce the burden, including public health education, strict tobacco-control policy, healthier lifestyles, along with expanding vaccination programs and early cancer screening.Copyright © 2022 Yang, Chen, Sang, Chen, Li and Yang."

This study investigated the most prevalent and lethal cancer types, including primary liver cancer (PLC), colorectal adenocarcinoma (CRC), and lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Leveraging the emerging cell-free DNA (cfDNA) fragmentomics, we developed a robust machine learning model for multi-cancer early detection. 1,214 participants, including 381 PLC, 298 CRC, 292 LUAD patients, and 243 healthy volunteers, were enrolled. The majority of patients (N = 971) were at early stages (stage 0, N = 34; stage I, N = 799). The participants were randomly divided into a training cohort and a test cohort in a 1:1 ratio while maintaining the ratio for the major histology subtypes. An ensemble stacked machine learning approach was developed using multiple plasma cfDNA fragmentomic features. The model was trained solely in the training cohort and then evaluated in the test cohort. Our model showed an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.983 for differentiating cancer patients from healthy individuals. At 95.0% specificity, the sensitivity of detecting all cancer reached 95.5%, while 100%, 94.6%, and 90.4% for PLC, CRC, and LUAD, individually. The cancer origin model demonstrated an overall 93.1% accuracy for predicting cancer origin in the test cohort (97.4%, 94.3%, and 85.6% for PLC, CRC, and LUAD, respectively). Our model sensitivity is consistently high for early-stage and small-size tumors. Furthermore, its detection and origin classification power remained superior when reducing sequencing depth to 1× (cancer detection: ≥ 91.5% sensitivity at 95.0% specificity; cancer origin: ≥ 91.6% accuracy). In conclusion, we have incorporated plasma cfDNA fragmentomics into the ensemble stacked model and established an ultrasensitive assay for multi-cancer early detection, shedding light on developing cancer early screening in clinical practice.© 2022.

Lung cancer (LC) induced by oncogene mutations has been detected in the patient's saliva, and saliva glycosylation has been altered. Saliva contains highly glycosylated glycoproteins, the characteristics of which may be related to various diseases. Therefore, elucidating cancer-specific glycosylation in the saliva of healthy, non-cancer, and cancer patients can reveal whether tumor glycosylation has unique characteristics for early diagnosis. In this work, we used a solid-phase chemoenzymatic method to study the glycosylation of saliva glycoproteins in clinical specimens. The results showed that the α1,6-core fucosylation of glycoproteins was increased in cancer patients, whereas α1,2 or α1,3 fucosylation was significantly increased. We further analyzed the expression of fucosyltransferases responsible for α1,2, α1,3, and α1,6 fucosylation. The fucosylation of the saliva of cancer patients is drastically different from that of non-cancer or health controls. These results indicate that the glycoform of saliva fucosylation distinguishes LC from other diseases, and this feature has the potential to diagnose lung adenocarcinoma.© 2022 The Authors.

Here, we developed an ultrasensitive nanomechanical method based on microcantilever array and peptide nucleic acid (PNA) for the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA. The method has an extremely low detection limit of 0.1 fM (105copies/mL) for N-gene specific sequence (20 bp). Interestingly, it was further found that the detection limit of N gene (pharyngeal swab sample) was even lower, reaching 50 copies/mL. The large size of the N gene dramatically enhances the sensitivity of the nanomechanical sensor by up to three orders of magnitude. The detection limit of this amplification-free assay method is an order of magnitude lower than RT-PCR (500 copies/mL) that requires amplification. The non-specific signal in the assay is eliminated by thein-situcomparison of the array, reducing the false-positive misdiagnosis rate. The method is amplification-free and label-free, allowing for accurate diagnosis within 1 h. The strong specificity and ultra-sensitivity allow single base mutations in viruses to be distinguished even at very low concentrations. Also, the method remains sensitive to fM magnitude lung cancer marker (miRNA-155). Therefore, this ultrasensitive, amplification-free and inexpensive assay is expected to be used for the early diagnosis of COVID-19 patients and to be extended as a broad detection tool.Supplementary material (experimental section, N gene sequences and all nucleic acid sequences used in the study, Figs.

Our analysis of the literature reveals that deregulation of genome structure is characteristic in distinct classes of chromatin-driven tumors.

Leveraging available GWAS data and functional genomic tools to assess regulatory variation could help explain the role of major depression-associated genetic variants in disease pathogenesis. We have conducted a fine-mapping analysis of genetic variants associated with major depression and applied a pipeline focused on gene expression regulation by using two complementary approaches: cis-eQTL colocalization analysis and alteration of transcription factor binding sites. The fine-mapping process uncovered putative causally associated variants whose proximal genes were linked with major depression pathophysiology. Four colocalizing genetic variants altered the expression of five genes, highlighting the role of SLC12A5 in neuronal chlorine homeostasis and MYRF in nervous system myelination and oligodendrocyte differentiation. The transcription factor binding analysis revealed the potential role of rs62259947 in modulating P4HTM expression by altering the YY1 binding site, altogether regulating hypoxia response. Overall, our pipeline could prioritize putative causal genetic variants in major depression. More importantly, it can be applied when only index genetic variants are available. Finally, the presented approach enabled the proposal of mechanistic hypotheses of these genetic variants and their role in disease pathogenesis."

However, compared to bulk-sequencing, its ultra-high missingness remarkably reduces usable reads in each cell type, resulting in broader, fuzzier peak boundary definitions and limiting our ability to pinpoint functional regions and interpret variant impacts precisely. We propose a weakly supervised learning method, scEpiLock, to directly identify core functional regions from coarse peak labels and quantify variant impacts in a cell-type-specific manner. First, scEpiLock uses a multi-label classifier to predict chromatin accessibility via a deep convolutional neural network. Then, its weakly supervised object detection module further refines the peak boundary definition using gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM). Finally, scEpiLock provides cell-type-specific variant impacts within a given peak region. We applied scEpiLock to various scATAC-seq datasets and found that it achieves an area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of ~0.9 and an area under precision recall (AUPR) above 0.7. Besides, scEpiLock's object detection condenses coarse peaks to only ⅓ of their original size while still reporting higher conservation scores. In addition, we applied scEpiLock on brain scATAC-seq data and reported several genome-wide association studies (GWAS) variants disrupting regulatory elements around known risk genes for Alzheimer's disease, demonstrating its potential to provide cell-type-specific biological insights in disease studies."

While acute depletion in short-term culture models suggests a limited importance of cohesin for steady-state transcriptional circuits, long-term studies are hampered by essential functions of cohesin during replication. Here, we study genome architecture in a postmitotic differentiation setting, the differentiation of human blood monocytes (MO). We profile and compare epigenetic, transcriptome and 3D conformation landscapes during MO differentiation (either into dendritic cells or macrophages) across the genome and detect numerous architectural changes, ranging from higher level compartments down to chromatin loops. Changes in loop structures correlate with cohesin-binding, as well as epigenetic and transcriptional changes during differentiation. Functional studies show that the siRNA-mediated depletion of cohesin (and to a lesser extent also CTCF) markedly disturbs loop structures and dysregulates genes and enhancers that are primarily regulated during normal MO differentiation. In addition, gene activation programs in cohesin-depleted MO-derived macrophages are disturbed. Our findings implicate an essential function of cohesin in controlling long-term, differentiation- and activation-associated gene expression programs.© 2022. The Author(s)."

We found 118 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between VKH patients and healthy control subjects, and 21 DEGs between VKH patients before and after treatment.TRIB1was selected as a potential biomarker to monitor the development of VKH according to the mRNA sequencing. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis were performed to predict the possible biological functions and signaling pathways of DEGs. Neutrophil degranulation, peptidase regulator activity, secretory granule membrane, cellular response to peptide, growth factor binding and cell projection membrane were enriched as GO annotations of DEGs. Arachidonic acid metabolism and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway were potential signaling pathways involved in pathogenesis and drug response of VKH. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed by STRING, and colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) was identified as the hubgene of all DEGs by Cytoscape. The cell type presumed to contribute to the aberrant expression of DEGs was analyzed with the use of publicly available single-cell sequencing data of PBMC from a healthy donor and single-cell sequencing dataset of monocytes from VKH patients. Our findings may help to decipher the underlying cellular and molecular pathogenesis of VKH and may lead novel therapeutic applications.© 2021 Chongqing Medical University.

CHD5 expression levels may affect an individual's susceptibility to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study aimed to evaluate the methylation pattern of theCHD5promoter region and the gene's corresponding mRNA expression in HCC patients compared with healthy individuals.In this case-control study,CHD5mRNA gene expression levels and DNA methylation patterns were analyzed in 81 HCC patients and 90 healthy individuals by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction, respectively.TheCHD5gene was hypermethylated in 61.8% of the HCC patients and 54.4% of the controls, and this difference was statistically significant. TheCHD5mRNA expression levels were significantly lower in the HCC patient group.Hypermethylation of theCHD5promoter region may significantly lower the expression of this gene, affecting the incidence and severity of HCC. The methylation status ofCHD5can also be further studied as a prognostic factor in HCC."

However, applying ctDNA in breast cancer early diagnosis remains highly challenging due to the contamination of background DNA from blood and low DNA methylation signals. Here, we report an improved way to extract ctDNA, reduce background contamination, and build a whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) library from different stages of breast cancer. We first compared the DNA methylation data of 74 breast cancer patients with those of seven normal controls to screen candidate methylation CpG site biomarkers for breast cancer diagnosis. The obtained 26 candidate ctDNA methylation biomarkers produced high accuracy in breast cancer patients (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.889; sensitivity: 100%; specificity: 75%). Furthermore, we revealed potential ctDNA methylated CpG sites for detecting early-stage breast cancer (AUC = 0.783; sensitivity: 93.44%; specificity: 50%). In addition, different subtypes of breast cancer could be well distinguished by the ctDNA methylome, which was obtained through our improved ctDNA-WGBS method. Overall, we identified high specificity and sensitivity breast cancer-specific methylation CpG site biomarkers, and they will be expected to have the potential to be translated to clinical practice.© 2022 The Authors.

Thus, this article aims to review: (1) the effect of associations between the above highlighted factors on adverse fetal growth and (2) recent birth cohort studies regarding environmental health risks.Based on a search of the PubMed database through August 2021, 68 epidemiological studies on gene-environment interactions, focusing on the association between environmental and lifestyle-related chemical exposure and adverse fetal growth was identified. Moreover, we also reviewed recent worldwide birth cohort studies regarding environmental health risks.Thirty studies examined gene-smoking associations with adverse fetal growth. Sixteen maternal genes significantly modified the association between maternal smoking and adverse fetal growth. Two genes significantly related with this association were detected in infants. Moreover, the maternal genes that significantly interacted with maternal smoking during pregnancy were cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1), X-ray repair cross-complementing protein 3 (XRCC3), interleukin 6 (IL6), interleukin 1 beta (IL1B), human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DQ alpha 1 (HLA-DQA1), HLA DQ beta 1 (HLA-DQB1), and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. Fetal genes that had significant interactions with maternal smoking during pregnancy were glutathione S-transferase theta 1 (GSTT1) and fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO). Thirty-eight studies examined the association between chemical exposures and adverse fetal growth. In 62 of the 68 epidemiological studies (91.2%), a significant association was found with adverse fetal growth. Across the studies, there was a wide variation in the analytical methods used, especially with respect to the genetic polymorphisms of interest, environmental and lifestyle-related chemicals examined, and the study design used to estimate the gene-environment interactions. It was also found that a consistently increasing number of European and worldwide large-scale birth cohort studies on environmental health risks have been conducted since approximately 1996.There is some evidence to suggest the importance of gene-environment interactions on adverse fetal growth. The current knowledge on gene-environment interactions will help guide future studies on the combined effects of maternal-child genetic polymorphisms and exposure to environmental and lifestyle-related chemicals during pregnancy."
"35875661","Depression in Adolescence and Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor.","Front Mol Neurosci","The incidence of depression among adolescents has been rapidly increasing in recent years. Environmental and genetic factors have been identified as important risk factors for adolescent depression. However, the mechanisms underlying the development of adolescent depression that are triggered by these risk factors are not well understood. Clinical and preclinical studies have focused more on adult depression, and differences in depressive symptoms between adolescents and adults make it difficult to adequately diagnose and treat adolescent depression. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is known to play a critical role in the pathophysiology of many psychiatric disorders, including depression. However, there are still few studies on adolescent depression. Therefore, in this review paper, the causes and treatment of adolescent depression and the function of BDNF are investigated.Copyright © 2022 Lee, Shin, Song and Chang."

It severely debilitates the quality of life. Investigating hyperglycemia-induced changes in neural transcription could provide fundamental insights into the complex pathogenesis of painful DPN (PDPN). Gene expression profiles of physiological dorsal root ganglia (DRG) have been studied. However, the transcriptomic changes in DRG neurons in PDPN remain largely unexplored. In this study, by single-cell RNA sequencing on dissociated rat DRG, we identified five physiological neuron types and a novel neuron type MAAC (Fxyd7+/Atp1b1+) in PDPN. The novel neuron type originated from peptidergic neuron cluster and was characterized by highly expressing genes related to neurofilament and cytoskeleton. Based on the inferred gene regulatory networks, we found that activated transcription factorsHobx7andLarp1in MAAC could enhanceAtp1b1expression. Moreover, we constructed the cellular communication network of MAAC and revealed its receptor-ligand pairs for transmitting signals with other cells. Our molecular investigation at single-cell resolution advances the understanding of the dynamic peripheral neuron changes and underlying molecular mechanisms during the development of PDPN.Copyright © 2022 Zhou, Yang, Liao, Chen, Wu, Xie, Ma and Zhang."

These outcomes are also influenced by common genetic polymorphisms. We aimed to investigate the combined effect of maternal smoking during pregnancy and genetic predisposition on birth weight and body mass index (BMI)-related traits in 1,086 children of the Human Early Life Exposome (HELIX) project.Methods:Maternal smoking during pregnancy was self-reported. Phenotypic traits were assessed at birth or at the age of 8 years. Ten polygenic risk scores (PRSs) per trait were calculated using the PRSice v2 program. For birth weight, we estimated two sets of PRSs based on two different base GWAS summary statistics: PRS-EGG, which includes HELIX children, and PRS-PanUK, which is completely independent. The best PRS per trait (highestR2) was selected for downstream analyses, and it was treated in continuous or categorized into three groups. Multivariate linear regression models were applied to evaluate the association of the explanatory variables with the traits of interest. The combined effect was evaluated by including an interaction term in the regression models and then running models stratified by the PRS group.Results:BMI-related traits were correlated among them but not with birth weight. A similar pattern was observed for their PRSs. On average, the PRSs explained ∼4% of the phenotypic variation, with higher PRS values related to higher trait values (p-value <5.55E-08). Sustained maternal smoking was associated with lower birth weight and higher BMI and related traits (p-value <2.99E-02). We identified a gene by environment (GxE) interaction for birth weight between sustained maternal smoking and the PRS-EGG in three groups (p-value interaction = 0.01), which was not replicated with the PRS-PanUK (p-value interaction = 0.341). Finally, we did not find any statistically significant GxE interaction for BMI-related traits (p-value interaction >0.237).Conclusion:Sustained maternal smoking and the PRSs were independently associated with birth weight and childhood BMI-related traits. There was low evidence of GxE interactions.Copyright © 2022 Fuentes-Paez, Escaramís, Aguilar-Lacasaña, Andrusaityte, Brantsæter, Casas, Charles, Chatzi, Lepeule, Grazuleviciene, Gützkow, Heude, Maitre, Ruiz-Arenas, Sunyer, Urquiza, Yang, Wright, Vrijheid, Vilor-Tejedor and Bustamante."
"35855334","Common Pathogenetic Mechanisms Underlying Aging and Tumor and Means of Interventions.","Aging Dis","Recently, there has been an increase in the incidence of malignant tumors among the older population. Moreover, there is an association between aging and cancer. During the process of senescence, the human body suffers from a series of imbalances, which have been shown to further accelerate aging, trigger tumorigenesis, and facilitate cancer progression. Therefore, exploring the junctions of aging and cancer and searching for novel methods to restore the junctions is of great importance to intervene against aging-related cancers. In this review, we have identified the underlying pathogenetic mechanisms of aging-related cancers by comparing alterations in the human body caused by aging and the factors that trigger cancers. We found that the common mechanisms of aging and cancer include cellular senescence, alterations in proteostasis, microbiota disorders (decreased probiotics and increased pernicious bacteria), persistent chronic inflammation, extensive immunosenescence, inordinate energy metabolism, altered material metabolism, endocrine disorders, altered genetic expression, and epigenetic modification. Furthermore, we have proposed that aging and cancer have common means of intervention, including novel uses of common medicine (metformin, resveratrol, and rapamycin), dietary restriction, and artificial microbiota intervention or selectively replenishing scarce metabolites. In addition, we have summarized the research progress of each intervention and revealed their bidirectional effects on cancer progression to compare their reliability and feasibility. Therefore, the study findings provide vital information for advanced research studies on age-related cancers. However, there is a need for further optimization of the described methods and more suitable methods for complicated clinical practices. In conclusion, targeting aging may have potential therapeutic effects on aging-related cancers.copyright: © 2022 Shen et al."

Previous studies have noted differences in the tumor microenvironment between AFR and EUR patients with CRC. However, the molecular regulatory processes that underpin these immune differences remain largely unknown.Multiomics analysis was carried out for 55 AFR and 456 EUR patients with microsatellite-stable CRC using The Cancer Genome Atlas. We evaluated the tumor microenvironment by using gene expression and methylation data, transcription factor, and master transcriptional regulator analysis to identify the cell signaling pathways mediating the observed phenotypic differences.We demonstrate that downregulated genes in AFR patients with CRC showed enrichment for canonical pathways, including chemokine signaling. Moreover, evaluation of the tumor microenvironment showed that cytotoxic lymphocytes and neutrophil cell populations are significantly decreased in AFR compared with EUR patients, suggesting AFR patients have an attenuated immune response. We further demonstrate that molecules called ""master transcriptional regulators"" (MTRs) play a critical role in regulating the expression of genes impacting key immune processes through an intricate signal transduction network mediated by disease-associated transcription factors (TFs). Furthermore, a core set of these MTRs and TFs showed a positive correlation with levels of cytotoxic lymphocytes and neutrophils across both AFR and EUR patients with CRC, thus suggesting their role in driving the immune infiltrate differences between the two ancestral groups.Our study provides an insight into the intricate regulatory landscape of MTRs and TFs that orchestrate the differences in the tumor microenvironment between patients with CRC of AFR and EUR ancestry.© 2022 The Authors."
"35705056","Absence of microglia promotes diverse pathologies and early lethality in Alzheimer's disease mice.","Cell Rep","Microglia are strongly implicated in the development and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD), yet their impact on pathology and lifespan remains unclear. Here we utilize a CSF1R hypomorphic mouse to generate a model of AD that genetically lacks microglia. The resulting microglial-deficient mice exhibit a profound shift from parenchymal amyloid plaques to cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), which is accompanied by numerous transcriptional changes, greatly increased brain calcification and hemorrhages, and premature lethality. Remarkably, a single injection of wild-type microglia into adult mice repopulates the microglial niche and prevents each of these pathological changes. Taken together, these results indicate the protective functions of microglia in reducing CAA, blood-brain barrier dysfunction, and brain calcification. To further understand the clinical implications of these findings, human AD tissue and iPSC-microglia were examined, providing evidence that microglia phagocytose calcium crystals, and this process is impaired by loss of the AD risk gene, TREM2.Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

With an improvement in the overall survival (OS) as both first- and second-line treatments, ICIs, and especially programmed-death 1 (PD-1) and programmed-death ligands 1 (PD-L1), changed the landscape of thoracic oncology. The PD-L1 level of expression is commonly accepted as the most used biomarker, with both prognostic and predictive values. However, even in a low expression level of PD-L1, response rates remain significant while a significant number of patients will experience hyperprogression or adverse events. The dentification of such subtypes is thus of paramount importance. While several studies focused mainly on the prediction of the PD-L1 expression status, others aimed directly at the development of prediction/prognostic models. The response to ICIs depends on a complex physiopathological cascade, intricating multiple mechanisms from the molecular to the macroscopic level. With the high-throughput extraction of features, omics approaches aim for the most comprehensive assessment of each patient. In this article, we will review the place of the different biomarkers (clinical, biological, genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and radiomics), their clinical implementation and discuss the most recent trends projecting on the future steps in prediction modeling in NSCLC patients treated with ICI."

Here we review the various potentials of omics data including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, pharmacogenomics. We comprehensively summarize the impact of omics data and its major role in precision medicine and provide a description about the domino effect on the pathophysiology of diseases. Each constituent of the omics data typically provides different information in associated with disease. Current research, although inadequate, clearly indicate that the information of omics data can be applicable in the concept of precision medicine. Integration of different omics data type in domino effect hypothesis can explain the causative changes of disease as it is discussed in the system biology too.

An artificial intelligence algorithm under a parallel dual-domain concatenated convolutional neural network (PDDC-CNN) was proposed to process the images of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI, magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), and susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) were performed on all 60 research objects with a 3.0 MRI scanner. The number of cases with cerebral microbleeds (CMBs), SWI image display of small veins, the number of lacunar infarctions, vertebral artery dominance, and vertebrobasilar morphology were observed in the two groups. The number of lacunar infarctions was 2.400 ± 3.358 and 0.672 ± 0.251, respectively, in the BBPV group with 30 cases and the control group with the other 30 cases. The positive rates of CMBs on SWI images were 48% and 27% in the BBPV group and the control group, respectively, and the average CMBs were counted as 1.670 ± 2.326 and 0.487 ± 0.865. CMBs were shown as round or oval lesions of conventional sequence deletion in the images with a diameter of less than 1.5 cm. SWI images of the BBPV group showed a significant increase in intracerebral small veins compared to those of the control group. The curvature of the vertebrobasilar artery in the BBPV group was significantly higher than that in the control group, and the curvature of the basilar artery was slightly higher than that in the control group. In conclusion, the MRI features of BPPV patients were related to their own microvascular lesions closely, and it was speculated that the cerebrovascular factors might play a dominant role in the early onset of BPPV.Copyright © 2022 Hailong Xue et al."

Moreover, IQ is strongly associated with CNV risk scores that model the predicted risk of CNVs across the genome. But the utility of CNV risk scores for psychiatric phenotypes has been sparsely examined.To determine how CNV risk scores, common genetic variation indexed by polygenic scores (PGSs), and environmental factors combine to associate with cognition and psychopathology in a community sample.The Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort is a community-based study examining genetics, psychopathology, neurocognition, and neuroimaging. Participants were recruited through the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia pediatric network. Participants with stable health and fluency in English underwent genotypic and phenotypic characterization from November 5, 2009, through December 30, 2011. Data were analyzed from January 1 through July 30, 2021.The study examined (1) CNV risk scores derived from models of burden, predicted intolerance, and gene dosage sensitivity; (2) PGSs from genomewide association studies related to developmental outcomes; and (3) environmental factors, including trauma exposure and neighborhood socioeconomic status.The study examined (1) neurocognition, with the Penn Computerized Neurocognitive Battery; (2) psychopathology, with structured interviews based on the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children; and (3) brain volume, with magnetic resonance imaging.Participants included 9498 youths aged 8 to 21 years; 4906 (51.7%) were female, and the mean (SD) age was 14.2 (3.7) years. After quality control, 18 185 total CNVs greater than 50 kilobases (10 517 deletions and 7668 duplications) were identified in 7101 unrelated participants genotyped on Illumina arrays. In these participants, elevated CNV risk scores were associated with lower overall accuracy on cognitive tests (standardized β = 0.12; 95% CI, 0.10-0.14; P = 7.41 × 10-26); lower accuracy across a range of cognitive subdomains; increased overall psychopathology; increased psychosis-spectrum symptoms; and higher deviation from a normative developmental model of brain volume. Statistical models of developmental outcomes were significantly improved when CNV risk scores were combined with PGSs and environmental factors.In this study, elevated CNV risk scores were associated with lower cognitive ability, higher psychopathology including psychosis-spectrum symptoms, and greater deviations from normative magnetic resonance imaging models of brain development. Together, these results represent a step toward synthesizing rare genetic, common genetic, and environmental factors to understand clinically relevant outcomes in youth."
"35743818","Prediction and Experimental Validation of a New Salinity-Responsive Cis-Regulatory Element (CRE) in a Tilapia Cell Line.","Life (Basel)","Transcriptional regulation is a major mechanism by which organisms integrate gene x environment interactions. It can be achieved by coordinated interplay between cis-regulatory elements (CREs) and transcription factors (TFs). Euryhaline tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus) tolerate a wide range of salinity and thus are an appropriate model to examine transcriptional regulatory mechanisms during salinity stress in fish. Quantitative proteomics in combination with the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D revealed 19 proteins that are transcriptionally upregulated by hyperosmolality in tilapia brain (OmB) cells. We searched the extended proximal promoter up to intron1 of each corresponding gene for common motifs using motif discovery tools. The top-ranked motif identified (STREME1) represents a binding site for the Forkhead box TF L1 (FoxL1). STREME1 function during hyperosmolality was experimentally validated by choosing two of the 19 genes, chloride intracellular channel 2 (clic2) and uridine phosphorylase 1 (upp1), that are enriched in STREME1 in their extended promoters. Transcriptional induction of these genes during hyperosmolality requires STREME1, as evidenced by motif mutagenesis. We conclude that STREME1 represents a new functional CRE that contributes to gene x environment interactions during salinity stress in tilapia. Moreover, our results indicate that FoxL1 family TFs are contribute to hyperosmotic induction of genes in euryhaline fish."
"35721559","A Multi-Species Comparison and Evolutionary Perspectives on Ion Regulation in the Antennal Gland of Brachyurans.","Front Physiol","Brachyurans inhabit a variety of habitats and have evolved diverse osmoregulatory patterns. Gills, antennal glands and a lung-like structure are important organs of crabs that maintain their homeostasis in different habitats. Species use different processes to regulate ions in the antennal gland, especially those with high terrestriality such as Grapsoidea and Ocypodoidea. Our phylogenetic generalized least square (PGLS) result also suggested that there is a correlation between antennal gland NKA activity and urine-hemolymph ratio for Na+concentration in hypo-osmotic environments among crabs. Species with higher antennal gland NKA activity showed a lower urine-hemolymph ratio for Na+concentration under hypo-osmotic stress. These phenomenon may correlate to the structural and functional differences in gills and lung-like structure among crabs. However, a limited number of studies have focused on the structural and functional differences in the antennal gland among brachyurans. Integrative and systemic methods like next generation sequencing and proteomics method can be useful for investigating the differences in multi-gene expression and sequences among species. These perspectives can be combined to further elucidate the phylogenetic history of crab antennal glands.Copyright © 2022 Tseng, Tsai and Lin."

To obtain an unbiased understanding of the molecular pathobiology of the aged posterior cingulate cortex, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on tissue obtained from 26 participants of the Rush Religious Orders Study (11 males/15 females; aged 76-96 years) with a pre-mortem clinical diagnosis of no cognitive impairment and post-mortem neurofibrillary tangle Braak Stages I/II, III, and IV. Transcriptomic data were gathered using next-generation sequencing of RNA extracted from posterior cingulate cortex generating an average of 60 million paired reads per subject. Normalized expression of RNA-seq data was calculated using a global gene annotation and a microRNA profile. Differential expression (DESeq2, edgeR) using Braak staging as the comparison structure isolated genes for dimensional scaling, associative network building and functional clustering. Curated genes were correlated with the Mini-Mental State Examination and semantic, working and episodic memory, visuospatial ability, and a composite Global Cognitive Score. Regulatory mechanisms were determined by co-expression networks with microRNAs and an overlap of transcription factor binding sites. Analysis revealed 750 genes and 12 microRNAs significantly differentially expressed between Braak Stages I/II and III/IV and an associated six groups of transcription factor binding sites. Inputting significantly different gene/network data into a functional annotation clustering model revealed elevated presynaptic, postsynaptic and ATP-related expression in Braak Stages III and IV compared with Stages I/II, suggesting these pathways are integral for cognitive resilience seen in unimpaired elderly subjects. Principal component analysis and Kruskal-Wallis testing did not associate Braak stage with cognitive function. However, Spearman correlations between genes and cognitive test scores followed by network analysis revealed upregulation of classes of synaptic genes positively associated with performance on the visuospatial perceptual orientation domain. Upregulation of key synaptic genes suggests a role for these transcripts and associated synaptic pathways in cognitive resilience seen in elders despite Alzheimer disease pathology and dementia.© The Author(s) 2022.

"35874611","Benchmarking of ATAC Sequencing Data From BGI's Low-Cost DNBSEQ-G400 Instrument for Identification of Open and Occupied Chromatin Regions.","Front Mol Biosci","Background:Chromatin falls into one of two major subtypes: closed heterochromatin and euchromatin which is accessible, transcriptionally active, and occupied by transcription factors (TFs). The most widely used approach to interrogate differences in the chromatin state landscape is the Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq). While library generation is relatively inexpensive, sequencing depth requirements can make this assay cost-prohibitive for some laboratories.Findings:Here, we benchmark data from Beijing Genomics Institute's (BGI) DNBSEQ-G400 low-cost sequencer against data from a standard Illumina instrument (HiSeqX10). For comparisons, the same bulk ATAC-seq libraries generated from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) and fibroblasts were sequenced on both platforms. Both instruments generate sequencing reads with comparable mapping rates and genomic context. However, DNBSEQ-G400 data contained a significantly higher number of small, sub-nucleosomal reads (>30% increase) and a reduced number of bi-nucleosomal reads (>75% decrease), which resulted in narrower peak bases and improved peak calling, enabling the identification of 4% more differentially accessible regions between PSCs and fibroblasts. The ability to identify master TFs that underpin the PSC state relative to fibroblasts (via HOMER, HINT-ATAC, TOBIAS), namely, foot-printing capacity, were highly similar between data generated on both platforms. Integrative analysis with transcriptional data equally enabled direct recovery of three published 3-factor combinations that have been shown to induce pluripotency.Conclusion:Other than a small increase in peak calling sensitivity for DNBSEQ-G400 data (BGI), both platforms enable comparable levels of open chromatin identification for ATAC-seq library sequencing, yielding similar analytical outcomes, albeit at low-data generation costs in the case of the BGI instrument.Copyright © 2022 Naval-Sanchez, Deshpande, Tran, Zhang, Alhomrani, Alsanie, Nguyen and Nefzger."

A large fraction of polyp and CRC cells exhibit a stem-like phenotype, and we define a continuum of epigenetic and transcriptional changes occurring in these stem-like cells as they progress from homeostasis to CRC. Advanced polyps contain increasing numbers of stem-like cells, regulatory T cells and a subtype of pre-cancer-associated fibroblasts. In the cancerous state, we observe T cell exhaustion, RUNX1-regulated cancer-associated fibroblasts and increasing accessibility associated with HNF4A motifs in epithelia. DNA methylation changes in sporadic CRC are strongly anti-correlated with accessibility changes along this continuum, further identifying regulatory markers for molecular staging of polyps.© 2022.

Orca captures the sequence dependencies of structures including chromatin compartments and topologically associating domains, as well as diverse types of interactions from CTCF-mediated to enhancer-promoter interactions and Polycomb-mediated interactions with cell-type specificity. Orca enables various applications including predicting structural variant effects on multiscale genome organization and it recapitulated effects of experimentally studied variants at varying sizes (300 bp to 90 Mb). Moreover, Orca enables in silico virtual screens to probe the sequence basis of 3D genome organization at different scales. At the submegabase scale, it predicted specific transcription factor motifs underlying cell-type-specific genome interactions.

The Python and R language were combined to process the transcriptional data of SGs and clinical data of 27 cancer types in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Mutations of SGs in 27 cancer types were analyzed to identify the most common mutated SGs, as well as survival-related SGs. Different SGs were screened out, and SGs with survival significance in different types of tumors were found. Furthermore, TCGA and GTEx datasets were used to further confirm the expressions of SGs in different tumors. Western blot assay was performed to verify the expression of SNRPB protein in colon cancer and lung adenocarcinoma. Three SGs were screened out to establish the Bagging model for tumor diagnosis.Among 150 SGs, THOC2, PRPF8, SNRNP200, and SF3B1 had the highest mutation rate. The survival time of mutant THOC2 and SF3B1 was better than that of wild type, respectively. The differential expression analysis of 150 SGs between 674 normal tissue samples and 9,163 tumor tissue samples with 27 cancer types of 9070 patients showed that 13 SGs were highly expressed and 1 was low-expressed. For all cancer types, the prognosis (survival time) of the low-expression group of three SGs (SNRPB, LSM7, and HNRNPCL1) was better than the high expression group, respectively (p< 0.05). Cox hazards model showed that male, over 60 years old, clinical stages III-IV, and with highly expressed SNRPB and HNRNPCL1 had a poor prognosis. GEPIA2 website analysis showed that SNRPB and LSM7 were highly expressed in most tumors but not in LAML, showing low expression. Compared with the control group, the expression of SNRPB protein in colon cancer was increased by Western blot (p< 0.05). Enrichment analysis showed that the differential SGs were mainly enriched in RNA splicing and binding. The average error of 10-fold cross-validation of the Bagging model for diagnosed cancer was 0.093, which demonstrates that the Bagging model can effectively diagnose cancer with a small error rate.This study provided the first landscape of spliceosome changes across 27 cancer types in 9070 patients and revealed that spliceosome was related to tumor progression. Spliceosome may play important an important role in cancer biological processes. These findings are the important scientific data to demonstrate the common and specific changes of spliceosome genes across 27 cancer types, which is a valuable biomarker resource to under the common or specific molecular mechanisms among different cancer types and establish biomarkers and therapeutic targets for the common or specific management of different types of cancer patients to benefit the research and practice of 3P medicine in cancers.The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s13167-022-00279-0.© The Author(s), under exclusive licence to European Association for Predictive, Preventive and Personalised Medicine (EPMA) 2022."
"35883613","A Method for In Situ Reverse Genetic Analysis of Proteins Involved mtDNA Replication.","Cells","The unavailability of tractable reverse genetic analysis approaches represents an obstacle to a better understanding of mitochondrial DNA replication. Here, we used CRISPR-Cas9 mediated gene editing to establish the conditional viability of knockouts in the key proteins involved in mtDNA replication. This observation prompted us to develop a set of tools for reverse genetic analysis in situ, which we called the GeneSwap approach. The technique was validated by identifying 730 amino acid (aa) substitutions in the mature human TFAM that are conditionally permissive for mtDNA replication. We established that HMG domains of TFAM are functionally independent, which opens opportunities for engineering chimeric TFAMs with customized properties for studies on mtDNA replication, mitochondrial transcription, and respiratory chain function. Finally, we present evidence that the HMG2 domain plays the leading role in TFAM species-specificity, thus indicating a potential pathway for TFAM-mtDNA evolutionary co-adaptations."
"35713211","Insights regarding mitochondrial DNA copy number alterations in human cancer (Review).","Int J Mol Med","Mitochondria are the critical organelles involved in various cellular functions. Mitochondrial biogenesis is activated by multiple cellular mechanisms which require a synchronous regulation between mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and nuclear DNA (nDNA). The mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNA‑CN) is a proxy indicator for mitochondrial activity, and its alteration reflects mitochondrial biogenesis and function. Despite the precise mechanisms that modulate the amount and composition of mtDNA, which have not been fully elucidated, mtDNA‑CN is known to influence numerous cellular pathways that are associated with cancer and as well as multiple other diseases. In addition, the utility of current technology in measuring mtDNA‑CN contributes to its extensive assessment of diverse traits and tumorigenesis. The present review provides an overview of mtDNA‑CN variations across human cancers and an extensive summary of the existing knowledge on the regulation and machinery of mtDNA‑CN. The current information on the advanced methods used for mtDNA‑CN assessment is also presented."

The common variants of specific oxytocin-related genes (OTRGs), particularly OXTR, are associated with the aetiology of ASD. The contribution of rare genetic variations in OTRGs to ASD aetiology remains unclear.We catalogued publicly available de novo mutations (DNMs) [from 6,511 patients with ASD and 3,391 controls], rare inherited variants (RIVs) [from 1,786 patients with ASD and 1,786 controls], and both de novo copy number variations (dnCNVs) and inherited CNVs (ihCNVs) [from 15,581 patients with ASD and 6,017 controls] in 963 curated OTRGs to explore their contribution to ASD pathology, respectively. Finally, a combined model was designed to prioritise the contribution of each gene to ASD aetiology by integrating DNMs and CNVs.The rare genetic variations of OTRGs were significantly associated with ASD aetiology, in the order of dnCNVs > ihCNVs > DNMs. Furthermore, 172 OTRGs and their connected 286 ASD core genes were prioritised to positively contribute to ASD aetiology, including top-ranked MAPK3. Probands carrying rare disruptive variations in these genes were estimated to account for 10∼11% of all ASD probands.Our findings suggest that rare disruptive variations in 172 OTRGs and their connected 286 ASD core genes are associated with ASD aetiology and may be potential biomarkers predicting the effects of oxytocin treatment.Guangdong Key Project, National Natural Science Foundation of China, Key Laboratory of Clinical Laboratory Diagnosis and Translational Research of Zhejiang Province.Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).

Its prevalence in Australia is unclear. This scoping review aimed to evaluate all Australian literature providing estimates of the prevalence ofH. pylori.Australian studies examiningH. pyloriprevalence from 1982 onwards were eligible for inclusion. Medline, Embase and Scopus databases, and grey literature sources, were searched. Two independent reviewers undertook a two-stage screening process. Data were extracted by two independent reviewers using a pre-specified template.Of 444 identified studies, 75 were included in the review.H. pyloriprevalence in Australian population-based studies (n = 8) ranged from 38.0% in 1991 to 15.1% in 2002; however, estimated prevalence across all non-clinical population studies in diverse sub-groups (n = 29) has varied dramatically. Decreased prevalence has been more marked in populations with gastrointestinal symptoms and conditions compared to non-clinical populations. Data onH. pyloriprevalence in vulnerable populations are lacking.This is the first scoping review of Australian studies reportingH. pyloriprevalence. A wide range of study designs, population groups, geographic regions, and diagnostic methods was included, involving data collected over a 50-year period (1969 to 2018). The summary ofH. pyloriprevalence estimates over time in this review points to a decrease in prevalence in Australia, particularly among populations with gastrointestinal symptoms and illnesses; however, it is unknown whether there is inequity in prevalence trends across vulnerable sub-groups of the Australian population. Future research and interventions supporting the health and wellbeing of vulnerable populations is required to ensure equitable health gains are made for all.©2022 Congedi et al."

The main exposure indicator and outcome indicator were maternal age and spontaneous abortion, respectively. We used both a generalized additive model and a two-piece-wise linear model to determine the association. We further performed stratified analyses to test the robustness of the association between maternal age and spontaneous abortion in different subgroups.We observed a J-shaped relationship between maternal age and spontaneous abortion risk, after adjusting for multiple covariates. Further, we found that the optimal threshold age was 29.68 years old. The adjusted odds ratio (95% confidence interval) of spontaneous abortion per 1 year increase in maternal age were 0.97 (0.90-1.06) on the left side of the turning point and 1.25 (1.28-1.31) on the right side. Additionally, none of the covariates studied modified the association between maternal age and spontaneous abortion (P> 0.05).Advanced maternal age (>30 years old) was significantly associated with increased prevalence of spontaneous abortion, supporting a J-shaped association between maternal age and spontaneous abortion.Copyright © 2022 Zhang, Yang, Sun, Qian, Xaverius, Aaron, Zhao, Zhang, Liu, Dong, Yin and Yue."

However, the regulatory mechanisms by which the immune response mediates the initiation of pulmonary fibrosis has yet to be fully characterized. This study aimed to illustrate the interplay between different cell clusters and key pathways in triggering chronic lung injuries in mice following PM exposure.Six-week-old C57BL/6J male mice were exposed to PM or filtered air for 16 weeks in a real-ambient PM exposure system in Shijiazhuang, China. The transcriptional profiles of whole lung cells following sub-chronic PM exposure were characterized by analysis of single-cell transcriptomics. The IL-17A knockout (IL-17A-/-) mouse model was utilized to determine whether the IL-17 signaling pathway mediated immune dysregulation in PM-induced chronic lung injuries. After 16-week PM exposure, chronic lung injuries with excessive collagen deposition and increased fibroblasts, neutrophils, and monocytes were noted concurrent with a decreased number of major classes of immune cells. Single-cell analysis showed that activation of the IL-17 signaling pathway was involved in the progression of pulmonary fibrosis upon sub-chronic PM exposure. Depletion of IL-17A led to significant decline in chronic lung injuries, which was mainly triggered by reduced recruitment of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and downregulation of TGF-β.These novel findings demonstrate that immunosuppression via the IL-17A pathway plays a critical role in the initiation of chronic lung injuries upon sub-chronic PM exposure.© 2022.

"35932085","Effects of smoking on the tissue regeneration-associated functions of human endometrial stem cells via a novel target gene SERPINB2.","Stem Cell Res Ther","Smokers directly inhale mainstream cigarette smoke, which contains numerous known and potential toxic substances, and thus, smoking is expected to have broad harmful effects that cause tissue injury and dysfunction. Interestingly, many studies have suggested that the recent decline in female fertility and increased rate of spontaneous abortion could be associated with increased smoking rates. Indeed, women that smoked for 10 years or more were reported to have a ~ 20% higher infertility rate than women that had never smoked. However, the reasons for the underlying harmful aspects of smoking on female fertility remain a matter of debate. Importantly, a previous study revealed that resident endometrial stem cell deficiency significantly limits the cyclic regeneration potential of endometrium, which, in turn, decreases successful pregnancy outcomes. In this context, we postulated that exposure to mainstream cigarette smoke extracts might decrease female fertility by inhibiting the functions of resident endometrial stem cells.We investigated whether cigarette mainstream smoke exposure directly inhibits various tissue regeneration-associated functions of endometrial stem cells, such as self-renewal, migration, pluripotency, and differentiation capacity in vitro. Next, we determined whether SERPINB2 mediates cigarette smoke-induced suppressive effects on various tissue regeneration-associated functions by depleting SERPINB2 expression with specific shRNA targeting SERPINB2. Mice were injected intraperitoneally with low (0.5 mg/kg) or high (1 mg/kg) doses of cigarette smoke extract (10 times for two weeks), and endometrial stem cells were then isolated from mice uterine tissues.We found that exposure to cigarette smoke extracts remarkably suppressed various tissue regeneration-associated functions of endometrial stem cells, such as self-renewal, migration, multilineage differentiation ability, and pluripotency in vitro and in vivo by activating the SERPINB2 gene. Indeed, cigarette smoke-induced inhibitory effects on various endometrial stem cell functions were significantly abolished by SERPINB2 knockdown.These findings provide valuable information on the harmful effects of cigarette smoking on resident endometrial stem cells and hopefully will facilitate the developments of promising therapeutic strategies for subfertile or infertile women that smoke cigarettes.© 2022.

"35662228","Interleukin 17A deficiency alleviates neuroinflammation and cognitive impairment in an experimental model of diabetic encephalopathy.","Neural Regen Res","Interleukin 17A (IL-17A) was previously shown to be a key pro-inflammatory factor in diabetes mellitus and associated complications. However, the role of IL-17A in diabetic encephalopathy remains poorly understood. In this study, we established a mouse model of diabetic encephalopathy that was deficient in IL-17A by crossing Il17a-/-mice with spontaneously diabetic Ins2Akita(Akita) mice. Blood glucose levels and body weights were monitored from 2-32 weeks of age. When mice were 32 weeks of age, behavioral tests were performed, including a novel object recognition test for assessing short-term memory and learning and a Morris water maze test for evaluating hippocampus-dependent spatial learning and memory. IL-17A levels in the serum, cerebrospinal fluid, and hippocampus were detected with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Moreover, proteins related to cognitive dysfunction (amyloid precursor protein, β-amyloid cleavage enzyme 1, p-tau, and tau), apoptosis (caspase-3 and -9), inflammation (inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase 2), and occludin were detected by western blot assays. Pro-inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β, and interferon-γ in serum and hippocampal tissues were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Microglial activation and hippocampal neuronal apoptosis were detected by immunofluorescent staining. Compared with that in wild-type mice, mice with diabetic encephalopathy had higher IL-17A levels in the serum, cerebrospinal fluid, and hippocampus; downregulation of occludin expression; lower cognitive ability; greater loss of hippocampal neurons; increased microglial activation; and higher expression of inflammatory factors in the serum and hippocampus. IL-17A knockout attenuated the abovementioned changes in mice with diabetic encephalopathy. These findings suggest that IL-17A participates in the pathological process of diabetic encephalopathy. Furthermore, IL-17A deficiency reduces diabetic encephalopathy-mediated neuroinflammation and cognitive defects. These results highlight a role for IL-17A as a mediator of diabetic encephalopathy and potential target for the treatment of cognitive impairment induced by diabetic encephalopathy."
"35628444","How Important Are Genes to Achieve Longevity?","Int J Mol Sci","Several studies on the genetics of longevity have been reviewed in this paper. The results show that, despite efforts and new technologies, only two genes, APOE and FOXO3A, involved in the protection of cardiovascular diseases, have been shown to be associated with longevity in nearly all studies. This happens because the genetic determinants of longevity are dynamic and depend on the environmental history of a given population. In fact, population-specific genes are thought to play a greater role in the attainment of longevity than those shared between different populations. Hence, it is not surprising that GWAS replicated associations of common variants with longevity have been few, if any, as these studies pool together different populations. An alternative way might be the study of long-life families. This type of approach is proving to be an ideal resource for uncovering protective alleles and associated biological signatures for healthy aging phenotypes and exceptional longevity."

The study cohort consisted of consecutive adult (> 18 years) patients presenting to the ED of Mount Sinai Health System hospitals between March 2020 and April 2020, diagnosed with COVID-19. Logistic regression was utilized to construct predictive models for hospitalization and prolonged (> 3 days) LOS. Discrimination was evaluated using area under the receiver operating curve (AUC). Internal validation with bootstrapping was performed, and a web-based calculator was implemented. From 5859 patients, 65% were hospitalized. Independent predictors of hospitalization and extended LOS included older age, chronic kidney disease, elevated maximum temperature, and low minimum oxygen saturation (p < 0.001). Additional predictors of hospitalization included male sex, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, and diabetes. AUCs of 0.881 and 0.770 were achieved for hospitalization and LOS, respectively. Elevated levels of CRP, creatinine, and ferritin were key determinants of hospitalization and LOS (p < 0.05). A calculator was made available under the following URL: https://covid19-outcome-prediction.shinyapps.io/COVID19_Hospitalization_Calculator/ . This study yielded internally validated models that predict hospitalization risk in COVID-19-positive patients, which can be used to optimize resource allocation.

"35769576","Sex Differences in Airway Remodeling and Inflammation: Clinical and Biological Factors.","Front Allergy","Asthma is characterized by an increase in the contraction and inflammation of airway muscles, resulting in airflow obstruction. The prevalence of asthma is lower in females than in males until the start of puberty, and higher in adult women than men. This sex disparity and switch at the onset of puberty has been an object of debate among many researchers. Hence, in this review, we have summarized these observations to pinpoint areas needing more research work and to provide better sex-specific diagnosis and management of asthma. While some researchers have attributed it to the anatomical and physiological differences in the male and female respiratory systems, the influences of hormonal interplay after puberty have also been stressed. Other hormones such as leptin have been linked to the sex differences in asthma in both obese and non-obese patients. Recently, many scientists have also demonstrated the influence of the sex-specific genomic framework as a key player, and others have linked it to environmental, social lifestyle, and occupational exposures. The majority of studies concluded that adult men are less susceptible to developing asthma than women and that women display more severe forms of the disease. Therefore, the understanding of the roles played by sex- and gender-specific factors, and the biological mechanisms involved will help develop novel and more accurate diagnostic and therapeutic plans for sex-specific asthma management.Copyright © 2022 Ekpruke and Silveyra."

Limited evidence has suggested that accelerated biological aging may play an important role. In this study, using a sub-sample of 906 women with newly diagnosed breast cancer at M.D. Anderson, we examined whether levels of selected markers of biological aging (e.g., allostatic load, telomere length, and global DNA methylation) were affected by neighborhood disadvantage. The Area Deprivation Index was used to determine the neighborhood disadvantage. Based on the median ADI at the national level, the study population was divided into low and high ADI groups. Overall, breast cancer patients from the high ADI group were more likely to be younger and non-Hispanic Black than those from the low ADI group (P < 0.001, respectively). They were also more likely to have higher grade and poorly differentiated breast tumors (P = 0.029 and 0.019, respectively). For the relationship with markers, compared to the low ADI group, high ADI group had higher median levels of allostatic load (P = 0.046) and lower median levels of global DNA methylation (P < 0.001). Compared to their counterparts, those from the high ADI group were 20% more likely to have increased allostatic load and 51% less likely to have increased levels of global DNA methylation. In summary, we observed that levels of allostatic load and global DNA methylation are influenced by neighborhood disadvantage among breast cancer patients.© 2022. The Author(s)."

However, data from multiple sources frequently show strong technical variations, which is referred to as batch effects. In order to perform joint analysis across multiple datasets, specialized method is required to remove technical variations between datasets while keep biological information.Here we present an algorithm named epiConv to perform joint analyses on scATAC-seq datasets. We first show that epiConv better corrects batch effects and is less prone to over-fitting problem than existing methods on a collection of PBMC datasets. In a collection of mouse brain data, we show that epiConv is capable of aligning low-depth scATAC-Seq from co-assay data (simultaneous profiling of transcriptome and chromatin) onto high-quality ATAC-seq reference and increasing the resolution of chromatin profiles of co-assay data. Finally, we show that epiConv can be used to integrate cells from different biological conditions (T cells in normal vs. germ-free mouse; normal vs. malignant hematopoiesis), which reveals hidden cell populations that would otherwise be undetectable.In this study, we introduce epiConv to integrate multiple scATAC-seq datasets and perform joint analysis on them. Through several case studies, we show that epiConv removes the batch effects and retains the biological signal. Moreover, joint analysis across multiple datasets improves the performance of clustering and differentially accessible peak calling, especially when the biological signal is weak in single dataset.© 2022.

Though platelets have no nucleus or DNA, they contain a full transcriptome that, during platelet formation, is transported from the megakaryocyte to the platelet. It has been described that transcripts in platelets can be translated into proteins that influence platelet response. The platelet transcriptome is highly dynamic and has been extensively studied using microarrays and, more recently, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) in relation to diverse conditions (inflammation, obesity, cancer, pathogens and others). In this review, we focus on bulk and single-cell RNA-seq studies that have aimed to characterize the coding transcriptome of healthy megakaryocytes and platelets in humans. It has been noted that bulk RNA-seq has limitations when studying in vitro-generated megakaryocyte cultures that are highly heterogeneous, while single-cell RNA-seq has not yet been applied to platelets due to their very limited RNA content. Next, we illustrate how these methods can be applied in the field of inherited platelet disorders for gene discovery and for unraveling novel disease mechanisms using RNA from platelets and megakaryocytes and rare disease bioinformatics. Next, future perspectives are discussed on how this field of coding transcriptomics can be integrated with other next-generation technologies to decipher unexplained inherited platelet disorders in a multiomics approach."

Chromatin remodeling has been observed in individuals severely ill or convalescing with COVID-19, but chromatin remodeling early in disease prior to anti-spike protein IgG seroconversion has not been defined. We performed the Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) and RNA-seq on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from outpatients with mild or moderate symptom severity at different stages of clinical illness. Early in the disease course prior to IgG seroconversion, modifications in chromatin accessibility associated with mild or moderate symptoms were already robust and included severity-associated changes in accessibility of genes in interleukin signaling, regulation of cell differentiation and cell morphology. Furthermore, single-cell analyses revealed evolution of the chromatin accessibility landscape and transcription factor motif accessibility for individual PBMC cell types over time. The most extensive remodeling occurred in CD14+ monocytes, where sub-populations with distinct chromatin accessibility profiles were observed prior to seroconversion. Mild symptom severity was marked by upregulation of classical antiviral pathways, including those regulating IRF1 and IRF7, whereas in moderate disease, these classical antiviral signals diminished, suggesting dysregulated and less effective responses. Together, these observations offer novel insight into the epigenome of early mild SARS-CoV-2 infection and suggest that detection of chromatin remodeling in early disease may offer promise for a new class of diagnostic tools for COVID-19.© 2022.

"35695574","Genome-Wide Analysis of Yeast Metabolic Cycle through Metabolic Network Models Reveals Superiority of Integrated ATAC-seq Data over RNA-seq Data.","mSystems","Saccharomyces cerevisiae undergoes robust oscillations to regulate its physiology for adaptation and survival under nutrient-limited conditions. Environmental cues can induce rhythmic metabolic alterations in order to facilitate the coordination of dynamic metabolic behaviors. Of such metabolic processes, the yeast metabolic cycle enables adaptation of the cells to varying nutritional status through oscillations in gene expression and metabolite production levels. In this process, yeast metabolism is altered between diverse cellular states based on changing oxygen consumption levels: quiescent (reductive charging [RC]), growth (oxidative [OX]), and proliferation (reductive building [RB]) phases. We characterized metabolic alterations during the yeast metabolic cycle using a variety of approaches. Gene expression levels are widely used for condition-specific metabolic simulations, whereas the use of epigenetic information in metabolic modeling is still limited despite the clear relationship between epigenetics and metabolism. This prompted us to investigate the contribution of epigenomic information to metabolic predictions for progression of the yeast metabolic cycle. In this regard, we determined altered pathways through the prediction of regulated reactions and corresponding model genes relying on differential chromatin accessibility levels. The predicted metabolic alterations were confirmed via data analysis and literature. We subsequently utilized RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) data sets in the contextualization of the yeast model. The use of ATAC-seq data considerably enhanced the predictive capability of the model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to use genome-wide chromatin accessibility data in metabolic modeling. The preliminary results showed that epigenomic data sets can pave the way for more accurate metabolic simulations.IMPORTANCEDynamic chromatin organization mediates the emergence of condition-specific phenotypes in eukaryotic organisms. Saccharomyces cerevisiae can alter its metabolic profile via regulation of genome accessibility and robust transcriptional oscillations under nutrient-limited conditions. Thus, both epigenetic information and transcriptomic information are crucial in the understanding of condition-specific metabolic behavior in this organism. Based on genome-wide alterations in chromatin accessibility and transcription, we investigated the yeast metabolic cycle, which is a remarkable example of coordinated and dynamic yeast behavior. In this regard, we assessed the use of ATAC-seq and RNA-seq data sets in condition-specific metabolic modeling. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to use chromatin accessibility data in the reconstruction of context-specific metabolic models, despite the extensive use of transcriptomic data. As a result of comparative analyses, we propose that the incorporation of epigenetic information is a promising approach in the accurate prediction of metabolic dynamics."
"35668194","A single-cell map of dynamic chromatin landscapes of immune cells in renal cell carcinoma.","Nat Cancer","A complete chart of the chromatin regulatory elements of immune cells in patients with cancer and their dynamic behavior is necessary to understand the developmental fates and guide therapeutic strategies. Here, we map the single-cell chromatin landscape of immune cells from blood, normal tumor-adjacent kidney tissue and malignant tissue from patients with early-stage clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). We catalog the T cell states dictated by tissue-specific and developmental-stage-specific chromatin accessibility patterns, infer key chromatin regulators and observe rewiring of regulatory networks in the progression to dysfunction in CD8+T cells. Unexpectedly, among the transcription factors orchestrating the path to dysfunction, NF-κB is associated with a pro-apoptotic program in late stages of dysfunction in tumor-infiltrating CD8+T cells. Importantly, this epigenomic profiling stratified ccRCC patients based on a NF-κB-driven pro-apoptotic signature. This study provides a rich resource for understanding the functional states and regulatory dynamics of immune cells in ccRCC.© 2022. The Author(s)."

Although bulk tumor genomic analyses have provided some insight into these processes, single-cell sequencing has emerged as a powerful technique to profile individual cells in unprecedented detail. Since the introduction of single-cell RNA sequencing, we now have the capability to capture not only transcriptomic, but also genomic, epigenetic, and proteomic variation between single cells separately and in combination. This rapidly evolving field has the potential to transform our understanding of the fundamental biology of pediatric ALL and guide the management of ALL patients to improve their clinical outcome.

We used ATAC-seq (assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing), RNA-seq, and DNA sequencing to investigate 22 organoids, six patient-derived xenografts, and 12 cell lines. We identified the well-characterized AR-dependent and neuroendocrine subtypes, as well as two AR-negative/low groups: a Wnt-dependent subtype, and a stem cell-like (SCL) subtype driven by activator protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factors. We used transcriptomic signatures to classify 366 patients, which showed that SCL is the second most common subtype of CRPC after AR-dependent. Our data suggest that AP-1 interacts with the YAP/TAZ and TEAD proteins to maintain subtype-specific chromatin accessibility and transcriptomic landscapes in this group. Together, this molecular classification reveals drug targets and can potentially guide therapeutic decisions."

The correct deposition and removal of methylated cytosine and its oxidized analogues is pivotal for cellular homeostasis, rapid responses to exogenous stimuli, and regulated gene expression. Uncoordinated expression of DNA/RNA methyltransferases and demethylase enzymes has been linked to genome instability and consequently to cancer progression. Furthermore, accumulating evidence indicates that post-transcriptional DNA/RNA modifications are important features in DNA/RNA function, regulating the timely recruitment of modification-specific reader proteins. Understanding the biological processes that lead to tumorigenesis or somatic reprogramming has attracted a lot of attention from the scientific community. This work has revealed extensive crosstalk between epigenetic and epitranscriptomic pathways, adding a new layer of complexity to our understanding of cellular programming and responses to environmental cues. One of the key modifications, m5C, has been identified as a contributor to regulation of the DNA damage response (DDR).

It has been shown that the epigenetic functions of miRNAs are closely related to metabolic syndrome, but epigenetic studies have not yet fully elucidated the regulatory network and key genes associated with metabolic syndrome. To perform data analysis and screening of potential differentially expressed target miRNAs, mRNAs and genes based on a bioinformatics approach using a metabolic syndrome mRNA and miRNA gene microarray, leading to further analysis and identification of metabolic syndrome-related miRNA-mRNA regulatory networks and key genes. The miRNA gene set (GSE98896) and mRNA gene set (GSE98895) of peripheral blood samples from patients with metabolic syndrome from the GEO database were screened, and set|logFC|> 1 and adjusted P < 0.05 were used to identify the differentially expressed miRNAs and mRNAs. Differentially expressed miRNA transcription factors were predicted using FunRich software and subjected to GO and KEGG enrichment analysis. Next, biological process enrichment analysis of differentially expressed mRNAs was performed with Metascape. Differentially expressed miRNAs and mRNAs were identified and visualized as miRNA-mRNA regulatory networks based on the complementary pairing principle. Data analysis of genome-wide metabolic syndrome-related mRNAs was performed using the gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) database. Finally, further WGCNA of the set of genes most closely associated with metabolic syndrome was performed to validate the findings. A total of 217 differentially expressed mRNAs and 158 differentially expressed miRNAs were identified by screening the metabolic syndrome miRNA and mRNA gene sets, and these molecules mainly included transcription factors, such as SP1, SP4, and EGR1, that function in the IL-17 signalling pathway; cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction; proteoglycan syndecan-mediated signalling events; and the glypican pathway, which is involved in the inflammatory response and glucose and lipid metabolism. miR-34C-5P, which was identified by constructing a miRNA-mRNA regulatory network, could regulate DPYSL4 expression to influence insulin β-cells, the inflammatory response and glucose oxidative catabolism. Based on GSEA, metabolic syndrome is known to be closely related to oxidative phosphorylation, DNA repair, neuronal damage, and glycolysis. Finally, RStudio and DAVID were used to perform WGCNA of the gene sets most closely associated with metabolic syndrome, and the results further validated the conclusions. Metabolic syndrome is a common metabolic disease worldwide, and its mechanism of action is closely related to the inflammatory response, glycolipid metabolism, and impaired mitochondrial function. miR-34C-5P can regulate DPYSL4 expression and can be a potential research target. In addition, UQCRQ and NDUFA8 are core genes of oxidative phosphorylation and have also been identified as potential targets for the future treatment of metabolic syndrome.© 2022.

The available evidence suggests that these disorders arise from an interaction between genetic vulnerability and stress, particularly traumatic stress, but the attention paid to the underlying genetic diatheses has been sparse. In this paper, the existing literature on the molecular genetics of dissociative disorders, as well as of clinically significant dissociative symptoms not reaching the threshold of a disorder, is reviewed comprehensively across clinical and non-clinical samples. Association studies suggest a link between dissociative symptoms and genes related to serotonergic, dopaminergic and peptidergic transmission, neural plasticity and cortisol receptor sensitivity, particularly following exposure to childhood trauma. Genome-wide association studies have identified loci of interest related to second messenger signaling and synaptic integration. Though these findings are inconsistent, they suggest biologically plausible mechanisms through which traumatic stress can lead to pathological dissociation. However, methodological concerns related to phenotype definition, study power, and correction for the confounding factors limit the value of these findings, and they require replication and extension in studies with better design."
"35853083","Enrichment of centromeric DNA from human cells.","PLoS Genet","Centromeres are key elements for chromosome segregation. Canonical centromeres are built over long-stretches of tandem repetitive arrays. Despite being quite abundant compared to other loci, centromere sequences overall still represent only 2 to 5% of the human genome, therefore studying their genetic and epigenetic features is a major challenge. Furthermore, sequencing of centromeric regions requires high coverage to fully analyze length and sequence variations, and this can be extremely costly. To bypass these issues, we have developed a technique, named CenRICH, to enrich for centromeric DNA from human cells based on selective restriction digestion and size fractionation. Combining restriction enzymes cutting at high frequency throughout the genome, except within most human centromeres, with size-selection of fragments >20 kb, resulted in over 25-fold enrichment in centromeric DNA. High-throughput sequencing revealed that up to 60% of the DNA in the enriched samples is made of centromeric repeats. We show that this method can be used in combination with long-read sequencing to investigate the DNA methylation status of certain centromeres and, with a specific enzyme combination, also of their surrounding regions (mainly HSATII). Finally, we show that CenRICH facilitates single-molecule analysis of replicating centromeric fibers by DNA combing. This approach has great potential for making sequencing of centromeric DNA more affordable and efficient and for single DNA molecule studies."
"35721504","Centromere Identity and the Regulation of Chromosome Segregation.","Front Cell Dev Biol","Eukaryotes segregate their chromosomes during mitosis and meiosis by attaching chromosomes to the microtubules of the spindle so that they can be distributed into daughter cells. The complexity of centromeres ranges from the point centromeres of yeast that attach to a single microtubule to the more complex regional centromeres found in many metazoans or holocentric centromeres of some nematodes, arthropods and plants, that bind to dozens of microtubules per kinetochore. In vertebrates, the centromere is defined by a centromere specific histone variant termed Centromere Protein A (CENP-A) that replaces histone H3 in a subset of centromeric nucleosomes. These CENP-A nucleosomes are distributed on long stretches of highly repetitive DNA and interspersed with histone H3 containing nucleosomes. The mechanisms by which cells control the number and position of CENP-A nucleosomes is unknown but likely important for the organization of centromeric chromatin in mitosis so that the kinetochore is properly oriented for microtubule capture. CENP-A chromatin is epigenetically determined thus cells must correct errors in CENP-A organization to prevent centromere dysfunction and chromosome loss. Recent improvements in sequencing complex centromeres have paved the way for defining the organization of CENP-A nucleosomes in centromeres. Here we discuss the importance and challenges in understanding CENP-A organization and highlight new discoveries and advances enabled by recent improvements in the human genome assembly.Copyright © 2022 Sundararajan and Straight."

Here, we conduct the phasing analysis of non-small cell lung cancer specimens of 20 Japanese patients. By the combinatory use of short and long read sequencing data, we obtain long phased blocks of 834 kb in N50 length with >99% concordance rate. By analyzing the obtained phasing information, we reveal that several cancer genomes harbor regions in which mutations are unevenly distributed to either of two haplotypes. Large-scale chromosomal rearrangement events, which resemble chromothripsis events but have smaller scales, occur on only one chromosome, and these events account for the observed biased distributions. Interestingly, the events are characteristic of EGFR mutation-positive lung adenocarcinomas. Further integration of long read epigenomic and transcriptomic data reveal that haploid chromosomes are not always at equivalent transcriptomic/epigenomic conditions. Distinct chromosomal backgrounds are responsible for later cancerous aberrations in a haplotype-specific manner.© 2022. The Author(s)."

At present, there are few effective methods that achieve satisfactory clinical results in the treatment of PD. Platelet-derived growth factors (PDGFs) and platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFRs) are important neurotrophic factors that are expressed in various cell types. Their unique structures allow for specific binding that can effectively regulate vital functions in the nervous system. In this review, we summarized the possible mechanisms by which PDGFs/PDGFRs regulate the occurrence and development of PD by affecting oxidative stress, mitochondrial function, protein folding and aggregation, Ca2+homeostasis, and cell neuroinflammation. These modes of action mainly depend on the type and distribution of PDGFs in different nerve cells. We also summarized the possible clinical applications and prospects for PDGF in the treatment of PD, especially in genetic treatment. Recent advances have shown that PDGFs have contradictory roles within the central nervous system (CNS). Although they exert neuroprotective effects through multiple pathways, they are also associated with the disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Our recommendations based on our findings include further investigation of the contradictory neurotrophic and neurotoxic effects of the PDGFs acting on the CNS.Copyright © 2022 Li, Huang, Zhang, Li and Wang."
"35829808","Cholesterol homeostasis regulated by ABCA1 is critical for retinal ganglion cell survival.","Sci China Life Sci","Genome-wide association studies have suggested a link between primary open-angle glaucoma and the function of ABCA1. ABCA1 is a key regulator of cholesterol efflux and the biogenesis of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles. Here, we showed that the POAG risk allele near ABCA1 attenuated ABCA1 expression in cultured cells. Consistently, POAG patients exhibited lower ABCA1 expression, reduced HDL, and higher cholesterol in white blood cells. Ablation of Abca1 in mice failed to form HDL, leading to elevated cholesterol levels in the retina. Counting retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) by using an artificial intelligence (AI) program revealed that Abca1-deficient mice progressively lost RGCs with age. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) revealed aberrant oxidative phosphorylation in the Abca1-/-retina, as well as activation of the mTORC1 signaling pathway and suppression of autophagy. Treatment of Abca1-/-mice using atorvastatin reduced the cholesterol level in the retina, thereby improving metabolism and protecting RGCs from death. Collectively, we show that lower ABCA1 expression and lower HDL are risk factors for POAG. Accumulated cholesterol in the Abca1-/-retina causes profound aberrant metabolism, leading to a POAG-like phenotype that can be prevented by atorvastatin. Our findings establish statin use as a preventive treatment for POAG associated with lower ABCA1 expression.© 2022. Science China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

CARs were taken from the Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, Georgia. Drug exposure data were taken from the National Survey of Drug Use and Health, with a response rate of 74.1%. Ethnicity and income data were taken from the US Census Bureau. National cannabinoid exposure was taken from Drug Enforcement Agency publications and multiplied by state cannabis use data to derive state-based estimates of Δ8THC exposure. At bivariate continuous analysis, Δ8THC was associated with 23 CAs on raw CA rates, 33 CARs after correction for early termination for anomaly estimates and 41 on a categorical analysis comparing the highest and lowest exposure quintiles. At inverse probability weighted multivariable additive and interactive models lagged to 0, 2 and 4 years, Δ8THC was linked with 39, 8, 4 and 9 CAs. Chromosomal, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, limb, central nervous system (CNS) and face systems were particularly affected. The minimumE-values ranged to infinity. Both the number of anomalies implicated and the effect sizes demonstrated were much greater for Δ8THC than for tobacco and alcohol combined. Δ8THC appears epidemiologically to be more strongly associated with many CAs than for tobacco and alcohol and is consistent with a cannabinoid class genotoxic/epigenotoxic effect. Quantitative causality criteria were fulfilled, and causal relationships either for Δ8THC or for cannabinoid/s, for which it is a surrogate marker, may be in operation.© The Author(s) 2022.

We found that the changes in the expression of most regulators followed the rule that ""development is consistent with regeneration and opposite to injury."" Immunoblotting with pan-acetylated antibodies also revealed that development and regeneration are a process of increased acetylation, while injury is a process of decreased acetylation. Moreover, we used bioinformatics methods to analyze the possible downstream molecules of two key regulators, histone deacetylase 1 (Hdac1) and lysine acetyltransferase 2b (Kat2b), and found that they were associated with many genes that regulate the cell cycle.

"35693291","Are polygenic risk scores ready for the cancer clinic?-a perspective.","Transl Lung Cancer Res","To realize the goals of precision medicine in complex disease, discriminative clinical risk models are needed. One approach that has been proposed is polygenic risk scores (PRSs). PRSs incorporate information about inherited genetic risk for cancer, specifically those genetic variants that are common in the population. While PRSs are clearly associated with risk of cancer, there is an on-going debate on whether integrating PRSs into clinical practice have utility. Here, we present this important discussion to the cancer clinic. We argue that in cancer, the clinical utility of PRSs will depend on their actionability, or how such a score may guide clinical practice. In turn, the actionability depends on several factors. First, actionability depends on the discriminative power of the score, or how well it predicts who is at risk of the disease. Second, it depends on their comparative performance with respect to existing practice, as a score with good discriminative power will not be useful if there are better predictors used in the clinic. Finally, for a PRS to be useful there must also be available preventive actions. We discuss the strengths and challenges of utilizing a PRS in the context of each of these criteria, and provide insights on what is needed towards moving forward in translating PRSs into the cancer clinic. We further argue that in future studies, beyond predicting cancer risk, similarly developed PRS models may be of utility in predicting prognosis or treatment resistance.2022 Translational Lung Cancer Research.

To explore the genomic architecture of schizophrenia symptomatology, we analyzed blood co-expression modules and their association with clinical data from patients in remission after a first episode of schizophrenia.

Weighted-gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was applied to identify modules of co-expressed genes and to test its correlation with global functioning, clinical symptomatology, and premorbid adjustment. Among the 25 modules identified, six modules were significantly correlated with clinical data. These modules could be clustered in two groups according to their correlation with clinical data. Hub genes in each group showing overlap with risk genes for schizophrenia were enriched in biological processes related to metabolic processes, regulation of gene expression, cellular localization and protein transport, immune processes, and neurotrophin pathways. Our results indicate that modules with significant associations with clinical data showed overlap with gene sets previously identified in differential gene-expression analysis in brain, indicating that peripheral tissues could reveal pathogenic mechanisms. Hub genes involved in these modules revealed multiple signaling pathways previously related to schizophrenia, which may represent the complex interplay in the pathological mechanisms behind the disease. These genes could represent potential targets for the development of peripheral biomarkers underlying illness traits in clinical remission stages after a first episode of schizophrenia.© 2022.

In this study, we used hiPSC-derived microglia-like cells (MGLs) to perform side-by-side testing of a selective chemical probe, SGC-CK2-1, compared with an advanced clinical candidate, CX-4945, both targeting casein kinase 2 (CK2), one of the first kinases shown to be dysregulated in Alzheimer's disease (AD). CK2 can mediate neuroinflammation in AD, however, its role in microglia, the innate immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS), has not been defined. We analyzed available RNA-seq data to determine the microglial expression of kinases inhibited by SGC-CK2-1 and CX-4945 with a reported role in mediating inflammation in glial cells. As proof-of-concept for using hiPSC-MGLs as a potential screening platform, we used both wild-type (WT) MGLs and MGLs harboring a mutation in presenilin-1 (PSEN1), which is causative for early-onset, familial AD (FAD). We stimulated these MGLs with pro-inflammatory lipopolysaccharides (LPS) derived fromE. coliand observed strong inhibition of the expression and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines by simultaneous treatment with SGC-CK2-1. A direct comparison shows that SGC-CK2-1 was more effective at suppression of proinflammatory cytokines than CX-4945. Together, these results validate a selective chemical probe, SGC-CK2-1, in human microglia as a tool to reduce neuroinflammation.Copyright © 2022 Mishra, Kinoshita, Axtman and Young."
"35740351","New Insights into the Neurodegeneration Mechanisms Underlying Riboflavin Transporter Deficiency (RTD): Involvement of Energy Dysmetabolism and Cytoskeletal Derangement.","Biomedicines","Riboflavin transporter deficiency (RTD) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by motor, sensory and cranial neuropathy. This childhood-onset neurodegenerative disease is caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in eitherSLC52A2orSLC52A3genes, resulting in insufficient supply of riboflavin (vitamin B2) and consequent impairment of flavoprotein-dependent metabolic pathways. Current therapy, empirically based high-dose riboflavin supplementation, ameliorates the progression of the disease, even though response to treatment is variable and partial. Recent studies have highlighted concurrent pathogenic contribution of cellular energy dysmetabolism and cytoskeletal derangement. In this context, patient specific RTD models, based on induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology, have provided evidence of redox imbalance, involving mitochondrial and peroxisomal dysfunction. Such oxidative stress condition likely causes cytoskeletal perturbation, associated with impaired differentiation of RTD motor neurons. In this review, we discuss the most recent findings obtained using different RTD models. Relevantly, the integration of data from innovative iPSC-derived in vitro models and invertebrate in vivo models may provide essential information on RTD pathophysiology. Such novel insights are expected to suggest custom therapeutic strategies, especially for those patients unresponsive to high-dose riboflavin treatments."

It has become an emerging public health problem and a major economic and social burden. However, there is currently no effective treatment for AD. Although the mechanism of AD pathogenesis has been investigated substantially, the full range of molecular factors that contribute to its development remain largely unclear. In recent years, accumulating evidence has revealed that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), a type of non-coding RNA longer than 200 nucleotides, play important roles in multiple biological processes involved in AD pathogenesis. With the further exploration of genomics, the role of lncRNA in the pathogenesis of AD has been phenotypically or mechanistically studied. Herein, we systematically review the current knowledge about lncRNAs implicated in AD and elaborate on their main regulatory pathways, which may contribute to the discovery of novel therapeutic targets and drugs for AD.Copyright: © 2022 Liu et al."
"35631387","Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-Based Drug Screening by Use of Artificial Intelligence.","Pharmaceuticals (Basel)","Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are terminally differentiated somatic cells that differentiate into various cell types. iPSCs are expected to be used for disease modeling and for developing novel treatments because differentiated cells from iPSCs can recapitulate the cellular pathology of patients with genetic mutations. However, a barrier to using iPSCs for comprehensive drug screening is the difficulty of evaluating their pathophysiology. Recently, the accuracy of image analysis has dramatically improved with the development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology. In the field of cell biology, it has become possible to estimate cell types and states by examining cellular morphology obtained from simple microscopic images. AI can evaluate disease-specific phenotypes of iPS-derived cells from label-free microscopic images; thus, AI can be utilized for disease-specific drug screening using iPSCs. In addition to image analysis, various AI-based methods can be applied to drug development, including phenotype prediction by analyzing genomic data and virtual screening by analyzing structural formulas and protein-protein interactions of compounds. In the future, combining AI methods may rapidly accelerate drug discovery using iPSCs. In this review, we explain the details of AI technology and the application of AI for iPSC-based drug screening."

Thus, to overcome these obstacles and construct an online community, we developed a panoramic database named Brain Research Hotspot Database (BRHD). As of 30 January 2022, the database had been integrated with standardized vocabularies from various resources, including 423,681 papers, 46,344 patents, 9585 transcriptomic datasets, 261 cell markers, as well as with information regarding brain initiatives that were officially launched and well-known scholars in brain research. Based on the keywords entered by users and the search options they set, data can be accessed and retrieved through exact and fuzzy search scenarios. In addition, for brain diseases, we developed three featured functions based on deep data mining: (1) a brain disease-genome network, which collects the associations between common brain diseases, genes, and mutations reported in the literature; (2) brain and gut microbiome associations, based on the literature related to this topic, with added annotations for reference; (3) 3D brain structure, containing a high-precision brain anatomy model with visual links to quickly connect to an organ-on-a-chip database. In short, the BRHD integrates data from a variety of brain science resources to provide a friendly user interface and freely accessible viewing and downloading environment.

However, the CO model may only be representative of certain clinical findings in affected patients, while some features are not recapitulated. In this study, we found that neurons in the CO model from patients with Alzheimer's disease were less responsive to depolarization, in contrast to previous reports. This difference may be partly attributed to the variations in brain spatial identity depending on the genetic background of the induced pluripotent stem cells. Our current observation raises concerns that the phenotypes observed in the CO model need to be carefully evaluated for their clinical implications.© 2022. The Author(s)."

However, the effect of m6A on skeletal myoblast differentiation and the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. Here, we ascertained mRNA m6A methylation exhibited declined changes during bovine skeletal myoblast differentiation, and bothMEF2CmRNA expression and m6A levels were significantly increased during myoblast differentiation. We found thatMEF2Cwith mutated m6A sites significantly inhibited myoblast differentiation compared with wild-typeMEF2C. METTL3 promoted MEF2C protein expression through posttranscriptional modification in an m6A-YTHDF1-dependent manner. Moreover, MEF2C promoted the expression of METTL3 by binding to its promoter. These results revealed that there is a positive feedback loop between these molecules in myoblast differentiation. Our study provided new insights into skeletal muscle differentiation and fusion, which may provide an RNA methylation-based approach for molecular genetics and breeding in livestock as well as for the treatment of muscle-related diseases.Copyright © 2022 Yang, Ning, Abbas Raza, Mei and Zan."
"35859544","Inherited genetics of adult diffuse glioma and polygenic risk scores-a review.","Neurooncol Pract","Knowledge about inherited and acquired genetics of adult diffuse glioma has expanded significantly over the past decade. Genomewide association studies (GWAS) stratified by histologic subtype identified six germline variants that were associated specifically with glioblastoma (GBM) and 12 that were associated with lower grade glioma. A GWAS performed using the 2016 WHO criteria, stratifying patients byIDHmutation and 1p/19q codeletion (as well asTERTpromoter mutation), discovered that many of the known variants are associated with specific WHO glioma subtypes. In addition, the GWAS stratified by molecular group identified two additional novel regions: variants inD2HGDHthat were associated with tumors that had anIDHmutation and a variant nearFAM20Cthat was associated with tumors that had bothIDHmutation and 1p/19q codeletion. The results of these germline associations have been used to calculate polygenic risk scores, from which to estimate relative and absolute risk of overall glioma and risk of specific glioma subtypes. We will review the concept of polygenic risk models and their potential clinical utility, as well as discuss the published adult diffuse glioma polygenic risk models. To date, these prior genetic studies have been done on European populations. Using the published glioma polygenic risk model, we show that the genetic associations published to date do not generalize across genetic ancestries, demonstrating that genetic studies need to be done on more diverse populations.© The Author(s) 2022.

"35693015","Preoperative Diagnosis and Molecular Characterization of Gliomas With Liquid Biopsy and Radiogenomics.","Front Neurol","Gliomas are a heterogenous group of central nervous system tumors with different outcomes and different therapeutic needs. Glioblastoma, the most common subtype in adults, has a very poor prognosis and disabling consequences. The World Health Organization (WHO) classification specifies that the typing and grading of gliomas should include molecular markers. The molecular characterization of gliomas has implications for prognosis, treatment planning, and prediction of treatment response. At present, gliomas are diagnosed via tumor resection or biopsy, which are always invasive and frequently risky methods. In recent years, however, substantial advances have been made in developing different methods for the molecular characterization of tumors through the analysis of products shed in body fluids. Known as liquid biopsies, these analyses can potentially provide diagnostic and prognostic information, guidance on choice of treatment, and real-time information on tumor status. In addition, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is another good source of tumor data; radiomics and radiogenomics can link the imaging phenotypes to gene expression patterns and provide insights to tumor biology and underlying molecular signatures. Machine and deep learning and computational techniques can also use quantitative imaging features to non-invasively detect genetic mutations. The key molecular information obtained with liquid biopsies and radiogenomics can be useful not only in the diagnosis of gliomas but can also help predict response to specific treatments and provide guidelines for personalized medicine. In this article, we review the available data on the molecular characterization of gliomas using the non-invasive methods of liquid biopsy and MRI and suggest that these tools could be used in the future for the preoperative diagnosis of gliomas.Copyright © 2022 Balana, Castañer, Carrato, Moran, Lopez-Paradís, Domenech, Hernandez and Puig."

"35842725","Crosstalk of organelles in Parkinson's disease - MiT family transcription factors as central players in signaling pathways connecting mitochondria and lysosomes.","Mol Neurodegener","Living organisms constantly need to adapt to their surrounding environment and have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to deal with stress. Mitochondria and lysosomes are central organelles in the response to energy and nutrient availability within a cell and act through interconnected mechanisms. However, when such processes become overwhelmed, it can lead to pathologies. Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder (NDD) characterized by proteinaceous intracellular inclusions and progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons, which causes motor and non-motor symptoms. Genetic and environmental factors may contribute to the disease etiology. Mitochondrial dysfunction has long been recognized as a hallmark of PD pathogenesis, and several aspects of mitochondrial biology are impaired in PD patients and models. In addition, defects of the autophagy-lysosomal pathway have extensively been observed in cell and animal models as well as PD patients' brains, where constitutive autophagy is indispensable for adaptation to stress and energy deficiency. Genetic and molecular studies have shown that the functions of mitochondria and lysosomal compartments are tightly linked and influence each other. Connections between these organelles are constituted among others by mitophagy, organellar dynamics and cellular signaling cascades, such as calcium (Ca2+) and mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) signaling and the activation of transcription factors. Members of the Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor family (MiT), including MITF, TFE3 and TFEB, play a central role in regulating cellular homeostasis in response to metabolic pressure and are considered master regulators of lysosomal biogenesis. As such, they are part of the interconnection between mitochondria and lysosome functions and therefore represent attractive targets for therapeutic approaches against NDD, including PD. The activation of MiT transcription factors through genetic and pharmacological approaches have shown encouraging results at ameliorating PD-related phenotypes in in vitro and in vivo models. In this review, we summarize the relationship between mitochondrial and autophagy-lysosomal functions in the context of PD etiology and focus on the role of the MiT pathway and its potential as pharmacological target against PD.© 2022.

However, our understanding of the evolution of epigenetic regulation on brain development in primates is limited. Here, we compared chromatin accessibility landscapes and transcriptomes during fetal prefrontal cortex (PFC) development between rhesus macaques and humans. A total of 304,761 divergent DNase I-hypersensitive sites (DHSs) are identified between rhesus macaques and humans, although many of these sites share conserved DNA sequences. Interestingly, most of the cis-elements linked to orthologous genes with dynamic expression are divergent DHSs. Orthologous genes expressed at earlier stages tend to have conserved cis-elements, whereas orthologous genes specifically expressed at later stages seldom have conserved cis-elements. These genes are enriched in synapse organization, learning and memory. Notably, DHSs in the PFC at early stages are linked to human educational attainment and cognitive performance. Collectively, the comparison of the chromatin epigenetic landscape between rhesus macaques and humans suggests a potential role for regulatory elements in the evolution of differences in cognitive ability between non-human primates and humans.© 2022.

"35571061","DNA Methylation Analysis of Ribosomal DNA in Adults With Down Syndrome.","Front Genet","Control of ribosome biogenesis is a critical aspect of the regulation of cell metabolism. As ribosomal genes (rDNA) are organized in repeated clusters on chromosomes 13, 14, 15, 21, and 22, trisomy of chromosome 21 confers an excess of rDNA copies to persons with Down syndrome (DS). Previous studies showed an alteration of ribosome biogenesis in children with DS, but the epigenetic regulation of rDNA genes has not been investigated in adults with DS so far. In this study, we used a targeted deep-sequencing approach to measure DNA methylation (DNAm) of rDNA units in whole blood from 69 adults with DS and 95 euploid controls. We further evaluated the expression of the precursor of ribosomal RNAs (RNA45S) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from the same subjects. We found that the rDNA promoter tends to be hypermethylated in DS concerning the control group. The analysis of epihaplotypes (the combination of methylated and unmethylated CpG sites along the same DNA molecule) showed a significantly lower intra-individual diversity in the DS group, which at the same time was characterized by a higher interindividual variability. Finally, we showed that RNA45S expression is lower in adults with DS. Collectively, our results suggest a rearrangement of the epigenetic profile of rDNA in DS, possibly to compensate for the extranumerary rDNA copies. Future studies should assess whether the regulation of ribosome biogenesis can contribute to the pathogenesis of DS and explain the clinical heterogeneity characteristic of the syndrome.Copyright © 2022 Ravaioli, Zampieri, Morandi, Pirazzini, Pellegrini, De Fanti, Gensous, Pirazzoli, Sambati, Ghezzo, Ciccarone, Reale, Monti, Salvioli, Caiafa, Capri, Bürkle, Moreno-Villanueva, Garagnani, Franceschi and Bacalini."
"35743950","First Steps towards the Development of Epigenetic Biomarkers in Female Cheetahs (<i>Acinonyx jubatus</i>).","Life (Basel)","Free-ranging cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus) are generally healthy, whereas cheetahs under human care, such as those in zoological gardens, suffer from ill-defined infectious and degenerative pathologies. These differences are only partially explained by husbandry management programs because both groups share low genetic diversity. However, mounting evidence suggests that physiological differences between populations in different environments can be tracked down to differences in epigenetic signatures. Here, we identified differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between free-ranging cheetahs and conspecifics in zoological gardens and prospect putative links to pathways relevant to immunity, energy balance and homeostasis. Comparing epigenomic DNA methylation profiles obtained from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from eight free-ranging female cheetahs from Namibia and seven female cheetahs living in zoological gardens within Europe, we identified DMRs of which 22 were hypermethylated and 23 hypomethylated. Hypermethylated regions in cheetahs under human care were located in the promoter region of a gene involved in host-pathogen interactions (KLC1) and in an intron of a transcription factor relevant for the development of pancreatic β-cells, liver, and kidney (GLIS3). The most canonical mechanism of DNA methylation in promoter regions is assumed to repress gene transcription. Taken together, this could indicate that hypermethylation at the promoter region ofKLC1is involved in the reduced immunity in cheetahs under human care. This approach can be generalized to characterize DNA methylation profiles in larger cheetah populations under human care with a more granular longitudinal data collection, which, in the future, could be used to monitor the early onset of pathologies, and ultimately translate into the development of biomarkers with prophylactic and/or therapeutic potential."

It is associated with a higher frequency and severity of exacerbations, a faster lung function decline, and a higher healthcare cost. Systemic inflammation in COPD and asthma is driven by type 1 T helper (Th1) and Th2 immune responses, respectively, both of which may contribute to airway remodeling in ACO. ACO-related biomarkers can be classified into four categories: neutrophil-mediated inflammation, Th2 cell responses, arachidonic acid-eicosanoids pathway, and metabolites. Gene-environment interactions are key contributors to the complexity of ACO and are regulated by epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNAs. Thus, this review focuses on the link between epigenetics and ACO, and outlines the following: (I) inheriting epigenotypes without change with environmental stimuli, or epigenetic changes in response to long-term exposure to inhaled particles plus intermittent exposure to specific allergens; (II) epigenetic markers distinguishing ACO from COPD and asthma; (III) potential epigenetic drugs that can reverse oxidative stress, glucocorticoid insensitivity, and cell injury.

However, the effects of ELF4 on porcine embryonic development remain unclear. In this study, the expression of ELF4 was detected in early porcine embryos and different tissues. By knocking down ELF4, the changes of H3K9me3 modification, DNA methylation and ZGA-related genes were analyzed. Our results showed thatELF4was expressed at all stages of early porcine embryos fertilizedin vitro(IVF), with the highest expression level at the 8-cell stage. The embryonic developmental competency and blastocyst quality decreased after ELF4 knockdown (20.70% control vs. 17.49% si-scramble vs. 2.40% si-ELF4;p< 0.001). Knockdown of ELF4 induced DNA damage at the 4-cell stage. Interfering with ELF4 resulted in abnormal increases in H3K9me3 and DNA methylation levels at the 4-cell stage and inhibited the expression of genes related to ZGA. These results suggest that ELF4 affects ZGA and embryonic development competency in porcine embryos by maintaining genome integrity and regulating dynamic changes of H3K9me3 and DNA methylation, and correctly activating ZGA-related genes to promote epigenetic reprogramming. These results provide a theoretical basis for further studies on the regulatory mechanisms of ELF4 in porcine embryos.Copyright © 2022 Shi, Zhai, Zhao, Kong, Zhang, Yu and Li."

However, whether histone modification can aid the classification of patients or influence clinical behavior in patients with colon cancer remains unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate histone modifier expression patterns using the unsupervised clustering of the transcriptomic expressions of 88 histone acetylation and methylation regulators.In this study, by consensus clustering analysis based on the transcriptome data of 88 histone modification regulators, we identified four distinct expression patterns of histone modifiers associated with different prognoses, intrinsic fluorouracil sensitivities, biological pathways, and tumor microenvironment characteristics among 1372 colon cancer samples. In these four clusters, the HMC4 cluster represented a stroma activation phenotype characterized by both the worst prognosis and lowest response rates to fluorouracil treatment. Then, we established a scoring scheme comprising 155 genes designated as ""HM_score"" by using the Boruta algorithm to distinguish colon cancer patients within the HMC4 cluster. Patients with a high HM_score were considered to have high stromal pathway activation, high stromal fraction, and an unfavorable prognosis. Further analyses indicated that a high HM_score also correlated with reduced therapeutic benefits from fluorouracil chemotherapy. Moreover, through CRISPR library screening, ZEB2 was found to be a critical driver gene that mediates fluorouracil resistance, which is associated with histone modifier expression patterns.This study highlights that characterizing histone modifier expression patterns may help better understand the epigenetic mechanisms underlying tumor heterogeneity in patients with colon cancer and provide more personalized therapeutic strategies.© 2022.

"35669868","Long-term field studies in bat research: importance for basic and applied research questions in animal behavior.","Behav Ecol Sociobiol","Animal species differ considerably in longevity. Among mammals, short-lived species such as shrews have a maximum lifespan of about a year, whereas long-lived species such as whales can live for more than two centuries. Because of their slow pace of life, long-lived species are typically of high conservation concern and of special scientific interest. This applies not only to large mammals such as whales, but also to small-sized bats and mole-rats. To understand the typically complex social behavior of long-lived mammals and protect their threatened populations, field studies that cover substantial parts of a species' maximum lifespan are required. However, long-term field studies on mammals are an exception because the collection of individualized data requires considerable resources over long time periods in species where individuals can live for decades. Field studies that span decades do not fit well in the current career and funding regime in science. This is unfortunate, as the existing long-term studies on mammals yielded exciting insights into animal behavior and contributed data important for protecting their populations. Here, I present results of long-term field studies on the behavior, demography, and life history of bats, with a particular focus on my long-term studies on wild Bechstein's bats. I show that long-term studies on individually marked populations are invaluable to understand the social system of bats, investigate the causes and consequences of their extraordinary longevity, and assess their responses to changing environments with the aim to efficiently protect these unique mammals in the face of anthropogenic global change.© The Author(s) 2022."
"35592062","Impacts of seasonality on gene expression in the Chinese horseshoe bat.","Ecol Evol","Seasonality can cause changes in many environmental factors which potentially affects gene expression. Here, we used a bat species (Rhinolophus sinicus) from eastern China as a model to explore the molecular mechanisms of seasonal effects, in particular during phenological shifts in the spring and autumn. Based on the analysis of 45 RNA-seq samples, we found strong seasonal effects on gene expression, with a large number of genes identified as either specific or biased to each season. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis also identified multiple modules significantly associated with each season. These seasonal genes were further enriched into different functional categories. Consistent with effects of phenological shifts on bats, we found that genes related to promoting food intake were highly expressed in both autumn and spring. In addition, immunity genes were also highly expressed in both seasons although this seasonal immune response had tissue specificity in different seasons. In female bats, genes related to the delay of ovulation (e.g.,NPPC, natriuretic peptide precursor type C) were highly expressed in October, while genes associated with the promotion of reproduction (e.g.,DIO2, iodothyronine deiodinase 2) were biasedly expressed in April. Lastly, we found multiple known core clock genes in both October-biased and April-biased expressed genes, which may be involved in regulating the start and end of hibernation, respectively. Overall, together with studies in other land and aquatic animals, our work supports that seasonal gene expression variations may be a general evolutionary response to environmental changes in wild animals.© 2022 The Authors.

However, in the longitudinal analyses, positive affect in a non-social context, when observed at four months of age, was positively associated with weight-for-length at 12 months of age (zWFL; ß = 1.49, SE = 0.67,p= 0.03), while positive affect observed at four months of age in a social context was inversely associated with body fat percentage at 12 months of age (ß = -11.41, SE = 5.44,p= 0.04). These findings provide preliminary evidence that the p positive affect is related to adiposity in infancy and suggest that the direction of association (i.e., direct or inverse) may be specific to the context in which positive affect is measured. Future research should examine the role of nutritional status in any relationships between adiposity and emotion at this early stage."

Furthermore, the potential for therapeutic intervention is limited upon the onset of symptoms, providing motivation for studying and treating the AD precursor mild cognitive impairment (MCI), the prodromal stage of AD instead. Applying machine learning classification to transcriptomic data of MCI, AD, and cognitively normal (CN) control patients, we identified differentially expressed genes that serve as biomarkers for the characterization and classification of subjects into MCI or AD groups. Predictive models employing these biomarker genes exhibited good classification performances for CN, MCI, and AD, significantly above random chance. The PI3K-Akt, IL-17, JAK-STAT, TNF, and Ras signaling pathways were also enriched in these biomarker genes, indicating their diagnostic potential and pathophysiological roles in MCI and AD. These findings could aid in the recognition of MCI and AD risk in clinical settings, allow for the tracking of disease progression over time in individuals as part of a therapeutic approach, and provide possible personalized drug targets for early intervention of MCI and AD.Copyright © 2022 Oh, Zhou, Chin, Amarnath, Cheah, Ng, Kandiah, Goh and Chiam."

However, according to data from recent literature, there is a large group of genes that are revealed as differentially expressed (DE) in many studies, regardless of the biological context. Additional analyses could shed more light on the relationships between genes, their differential expression, and diseases. We generated a set of 9972 disease genes from five gene-phenotype databases (OMIM, ORPHANET, DDG2P, DisGeNet and MalaCards) and a report of the International Union of Immunological Societies. To study transcriptomics of disease and non-disease genes in healthy tissues, we obtained data from the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) website. We analyzed the dependency between expression in healthy tissues and gene occurrence in Gene Expression Omnibus series using tools within the Enrichr libraries. The results of expression studies were annotated with Gene Ontology (GO) and Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms. Using transcriptomics analysis of healthy tissues, we validated the previous findings of higher expression levels of disease genes in pathologically linked tissues compared to other tissues. Preferentially DE genes were generally highly expressed in one or multiple tissues and were enriched for disease genes. According to the results of GO enrichment analyses, both down- and up-regulated DE genes most often took part in immune response, translation and tissue-specific processes. A connection between DE-related pathology and the diversity of HPO terms was found. Investigating a link between expression and phenotype contributes to understanding the mode of development and progression of human diseases."

The COVID-19 survey was carried out to collect information on lifestyle and depressive symptom during lockdown. A total of 3327 participants were included in the COVID-19 survey, including 2098 (63.1%) reported having NCDs at baseline and 1457 (44%) without NCDs. The prevalence of current drinkers decreased from 42.9% before COVID-19 lockdown to 23.7% during lockdown, current smokers from 15.9 to 13.5%, and poor sleepers from 23.9 to 15.3%, while low physical activity increased from 13.4 to 25.2%, among participants with NCDs (P < 0.05 for all comparisons using McNemar's test). Participants with NCDs were more likely than those without to have depressive symptom (OR, 1.30; 95% CI 1.05-1.61), especially among those who need to refill their medication during the COVID-19 lockdown (OR, 1.52; 95% CI 1.15-2.02).

The biological events controlled by BCR signaling in CLL are not fully understood and need investigation. Here, by analysis of the chromatin states and gene expression profiles of CLL B cells from patients before and after Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor (BTKi) ibrutinib treatment, we show that BTKi treatment leads to a decreased expression of APOBEC3 family genes by regulating the activity of their enhancers. BTKi treatment reduces enrichment of enhancer marks (H3K4me1 and H3K27ac) and chromatin accessibility at putative APOBEC3 enhancers. CRISPR-Cas9 directed deletion or inhibition of the putative APOBEC3 enhancers leads to reduced APOBEC3 expression. We further find that transcription factor NFATc1 couples BCR signaling with the APOBEC3 enhancer activity to control APOBEC3 expression. We also find that enhancer-regulated APOBEC3 expression contributes to replication stress in malignant B cells. In total we demonstrate a novel mechanism for BTKi suppression of APOBEC3 expression via direct enhancer regulation in an NFATc1-dependent manner, implicating BCR signaling as a potential regulator of leukemic genomic instability.© 2022.

Various oncogenes are abnormally overexpressed in lung cancer, including cancer/testis antigens (CTAs), which are restrictively expressed in the male testis but are hardly expressed in other normal tissues, if at all. CTAs are aberrantly overexpressed in various types of cancer, with more than 60 CTAs abnormally overexpressed in lung cancer. Overexpression of oncogenic CTAs drives the initiation, metastasis and progression of lung cancer, and is closely associated with poor prognosis in cancer patients. Several CTAs, such as XAGE, SPAG9 and AKAP4, have been considered as biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognostic prediction of lung cancer. More interestingly, due to the high immunogenicity and specificity of CTAs in cancer, several CTAs, including CT45, BCAP31 and ACTL8, have been targeted for developing novel therapeutics against cancer. CTA-based vaccines, chimeric antigen receptor-modified T cells (CAR-T) and small molecules have been used in lung cancer treatment in pre-clinical and early clinical trials, with encouraging results being obtained. However, there are still many hurdles to be overcome before these therapeutics can be routinely used in clinical lung cancer therapy. This review summarises the recent rapid progress in oncogenic CTAs, focusing on CTAs as biomarkers for lung cancer diagnosis and prognostic prediction, and as targets for novel anti-cancer drug discovery and lung cancer therapy. We also identify challenges and opportunities in CTA-based cancer diagnosis and treatment. Finally, we provide perspectives on the mechanisms of oncogenic CTAs in lung cancer development, and we also suggest CTAs as a new platform for lung cancer diagnosis, prognostic prediction, and novel anti-cancer drug discovery.Copyright © 2022 Yang, Qiao, Meng and Zhou."

The aim of the present study is to determine the presence and frequency ofCYP2C9pVNTRin a Spanish population, as well as analyzing whether thepVNTR-Sallele is in LD with theCYP2C9*3allele in this population.A total of 209 subjects from Spain participated in the study. TheCYP2C9promoter region was amplified and analyzed using capillary electrophoresis. Genotyping forCYP2C9*2and*3variants was performed using a fluorescence-based allele-specific TaqMan allelic discrimination assay.The frequencies ofCYP2C9pVNTR-L,MandSvariant alleles are 0.10, 0.82 and 0.08, respectively. A high LD betweenCYP2C9pVNTR-SandCYP2C9*3variant alleles is observed (D' = 0.929, r2= 0.884).The results from the present study show that bothCYP2C9pVNTRandCYP2C9*3are in a high LD, which could help to better understand the lower metabolic activity exhibited byCYP2C9*3allele carriers.

"35609568","A phenome-wide association study identifies effects of copy-number variation of VNTRs and multicopy genes on multiple human traits.","Am J Hum Genet","The human genome contains tens of thousands of large tandem repeats and hundreds of genes that show common and highly variable copy-number changes. Due to their large size and repetitive nature, these variable number tandem repeats (VNTRs) and multicopy genes are generally recalcitrant to standard genotyping approaches and, as a result, this class of variation is poorly characterized. However, several recent studies have demonstrated that copy-number variation of VNTRs can modify local gene expression, epigenetics, and human traits, indicating that many have a functional role. Here, using read depth from whole-genome sequencing to profile copy number, we report results of a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) of VNTRs and multicopy genes in a discovery cohort of ∼35,000 samples, identifying 32 traits associated with copy number of 38 VNTRs and multicopy genes at 1% FDR. We replicated many of these signals in an independent cohort and observed that VNTRs showing trait associations were significantly enriched for expression QTLs with nearby genes, providing strong support for our results. Fine-mapping studies indicated that in the majority (∼90%) of cases, the VNTRs and multicopy genes we identified represent the causal variants underlying the observed associations. Furthermore, several lie in regions where prior SNV-based GWASs have failed to identify any significant associations with these traits. Our study indicates that copy number of VNTRs and multicopy genes contributes to diverse human traits and suggests that complex structural variants potentially explain some of the so-called ""missing heritability"" of SNV-based GWASs.Copyright © 2022 American Society of Human Genetics.

"35871075","Extensive co-binding and rapid redistribution of NANOG and GATA6 during emergence of divergent lineages.","Nat Commun","Fate-determining transcription factors (TFs) can promote lineage-restricted transcriptional programs from common progenitor states. The inner cell mass (ICM) of mouse blastocysts co-expresses the TFs NANOG and GATA6, which drive the bifurcation of the ICM into either the epiblast (Epi) or the primitive endoderm (PrE), respectively. Here, we induce GATA6 in embryonic stem cells-that also express NANOG-to characterize how a state of co-expression of opposing TFs resolves into divergent lineages. Surprisingly, we find that GATA6 and NANOG co-bind at the vast majority of Epi and PrE enhancers, a phenomenon we also observe in blastocysts. The co-bound state is followed by eviction and repression of Epi TFs, and quick remodeling of chromatin and enhancer-promoter contacts thus establishing the PrE lineage while repressing the Epi fate. We propose that co-binding of GATA6 and NANOG at shared enhancers maintains ICM plasticity and promotes the rapid establishment of Epi- and PrE-specific transcriptional programs.© 2022.

Enhancers are critical regulatory elements that have fundamental functions in evolution, development and disease. Genome-wide quantification of functional enhancers in the pig is needed.We performed self-transcribing active regulatory region sequencing (STARR-seq) in the porcine kidney epithelial PK15 and testicular ST cell lines, and reliably identified 2576 functional enhancers. Most of these enhancers were located in repetitive sequences and were enriched within silent and lowly expressed genes. Enhancers poorly overlapped with chromatin accessibility regions and were highly enriched in chromatin with the repressive histone modification H3K9me3, which is different from predicted pig enhancers detected using ChIP-seq for H3K27ac or/and H3K4me1 modified histones. This suggests that most pig enhancers identified with STARR-seq are endogenously repressed at the chromatin level and may function during cell type-specific development or at specific developmental stages. Additionally, the PPP3CA gene is associated with the loin muscle area trait and the QKI gene is associated with alkaline phosphatase activity that may be regulated by distal functional enhancers.In summary, we generated the first functional enhancer map in PK15 and ST cells for the pig genome and highlight its potential roles in pig breeding.© 2022.

"35710842","Building regulatory landscapes reveals that an enhancer can recruit cohesin to create contact domains, engage CTCF sites and activate distant genes.","Nat Struct Mol Biol","Developmental gene expression is often controlled by distal regulatory DNA elements called enhancers. Distant enhancer action is restricted to structural chromosomal domains that are flanked by CTCF-associated boundaries and formed through cohesin chromatin loop extrusion. To better understand how enhancers, genes and CTCF boundaries together form structural domains and control expression, we used a bottom-up approach, building series of active regulatory landscapes in inactive chromatin. We demonstrate here that gene transcription levels and activity over time reduce with increased enhancer distance. The enhancer recruits cohesin to stimulate domain formation and engage flanking CTCF sites in loop formation. It requires cohesin exclusively for the activation of distant genes, not of proximal genes, with nearby CTCF boundaries supporting efficient long-range enhancer action. Our work supports a dual activity model for enhancers: its classic role of stimulating transcription initiation and elongation from target gene promoters and a role of recruiting cohesin for the creation of chromosomal domains, the engagement of CTCF sites in chromatin looping and the activation of distal target genes.© 2022.

"35594906","Compatibility rules of human enhancer and promoter sequences.","Nature","Gene regulation in the human genome is controlled by distal enhancers that activate specific nearby promoters1. A proposed model for this specificity is that promoters have sequence-encoded preferences for certain enhancers, for example, mediated by interacting sets of transcription factors or cofactors2. This 'biochemical compatibility' model has been supported by observations at individual human promoters and by genome-wide measurements in Drosophila3-9. However, the degree to which human enhancers and promoters are intrinsically compatible has not yet been systematically measured, and how their activities combine to control RNA expression remains unclear. Here we design a high-throughput reporter assay called enhancer × promoter self-transcribing active regulatory region sequencing (ExP STARR-seq) and applied it to examine the combinatorial compatibilities of 1,000 enhancer and 1,000 promoter sequences in human K562 cells. We identify simple rules for enhancer-promoter compatibility, whereby most enhancers activate all promoters by similar amounts, and intrinsic enhancer and promoter activities multiplicatively combine to determine RNA output (R2 = 0.82). In addition, two classes of enhancers and promoters show subtle preferential effects. Promoters of housekeeping genes contain built-in activating motifs for factors such as GABPA and YY1, which decrease the responsiveness of promoters to distal enhancers. Promoters of variably expressed genes lack these motifs and show stronger responsiveness to enhancers. Together, this systematic assessment of enhancer-promoter compatibility suggests a multiplicative model tuned by enhancer and promoter class to control gene transcription in the human genome.© 2022.

"35552697","Pleiotropic Enhancers are Ubiquitous Regulatory Elements in the Human Genome.","Genome Biol Evol","Enhancers are regulatory elements of genomes that determine spatio-temporal patterns of gene expression. The human genome contains a vast number of enhancers, which largely outnumber protein-coding genes. Historically, enhancers have been regarded as highly tissue-specific. However, recent evidence has demonstrated that many enhancers are pleiotropic, with activity in multiple developmental contexts. Yet, the extent and impact of pleiotropy remain largely unexplored. In this study we analyzed active enhancers across human organs based on the analysis of both eRNA transcription (FANTOM5 consortium data sets) and chromatin architecture (ENCODE consortium data sets). We show that pleiotropic enhancers are pervasive in the human genome and that most enhancers active in a particular organ are also active in other organs. In addition, our analysis suggests that the proportion of context-specific enhancers of a given organ is explained, at least in part, by the proportion of context-specific genes in that same organ. The notion that such a high proportion of human enhancers can be pleiotropic suggests that small regions of regulatory DNA contain abundant regulatory information and that these regions evolve under important evolutionary constraints.© The Author(s) 2022.

"35682854","Interaction of Proteins with Inverted Repeats and Cruciform Structures in Nucleic Acids.","Int J Mol Sci","Cruciforms occur when inverted repeat sequences in double-stranded DNA adopt intra-strand hairpins on opposing strands. Biophysical and molecular studies of these structures confirm their characterization as four-way junctions and have demonstrated that several factors influence their stability, including overall chromatin structure and DNA supercoiling. Here, we review our understanding of processes that influence the formation and stability of cruciforms in genomes, covering the range of sequences shown to have biological significance. It is challenging to accurately sequence repetitive DNA sequences, but recent advances in sequencing methods have deepened understanding about the amounts of inverted repeats in genomes from all forms of life. We highlight that, in the majority of genomes, inverted repeats are present in higher numbers than is expected from a random occurrence. It is, therefore, becoming clear that inverted repeats play important roles in regulating many aspects of DNA metabolism, including replication, gene expression, and recombination. Cruciforms are targets for many architectural and regulatory proteins, including topoisomerases, p53, Rif1, and others. Notably, some of these proteins can induce the formation of cruciform structures when they bind to DNA. Inverted repeat sequences also influence the evolution of genomes, and growing evidence highlights their significance in several human diseases, suggesting that the inverted repeat sequences and/or DNA cruciforms could be useful therapeutic targets in some cases."

"35545449","Automated annotation of human centromeres with HORmon.","Genome Res","Recent advances in long-read sequencing opened a possibility to address the long-standing questions about the architecture and evolution of human centromeres. They also emphasized the need for centromere annotation (partitioning human centromeres into monomers and higher-order repeats [HORs]). Although there was a half-century-long series of semi-manual studies of centromere architecture, a rigorous centromere annotation algorithm is still lacking. Moreover, an automated centromere annotation is a prerequisite for studies of genetic diseases associated with centromeres and evolutionary studies of centromeres across multiple species. Although the monomer decomposition (transforming a centromere into a monocentromere written in the monomer alphabet) and the HOR decomposition (representing a monocentromere in the alphabet of HORs) are currently viewed as two separate problems, we show that they should be integrated into a single framework in such a way that HOR (monomer) inference affects monomer (HOR) inference. We thus developed the HORmon algorithm that integrates the monomer/HOR inference and automatically generates the human monomers/HORs that are largely consistent with the previous semi-manual inference.© 2022 Kunyavskaya et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press."
"35682604","Epigenetic and Genetic Factors Related to Curve Progression in Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis: A Systematic Scoping Review of the Current Literature.","Int J Mol Sci","Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is a progressive deformity of the spine. Scoliotic curves progress until skeletal maturity leading, in rare cases, to a severe deformity. While the Cobb angle is a straightforward tool in initial curve magnitude measurement, assessing the risk of curve progression at the time of diagnosis may be more challenging. Epigenetic and genetic markers are potential prognostic tools to predict curve progression. The aim of this study is to review the available literature regarding the epigenetic and genetic factors associated with the risk of AIS curve progression. This review was carried out in accordance with Preferential Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The search was carried out in January 2022. Only peer-reviewed articles were considered for inclusion. Forty studies were included; fifteen genes were reported as having SNPs with significant association with progressive AIS, but none showed sufficient power to sustain clinical applications. In contrast, nine studies reporting epigenetic modifications showed promising results in terms of reliable markers. Prognostic testing for AIS has the potential to significantly modify disease management. Most recent evidence suggests epigenetics as a more promising field for the identification of factors associated with AIS progression, offering a rationale for further investigation in this field."

The mechanistic factors promoting these different classes of DSBs in neural stem/progenitor cells are not understood. Here, we elucidated the genome-wide landscape of RNA:DNA hybrid structures called ""R-loops"" in primary neural stem/progenitor cells undergoing aphidicolin-induced, mild replication stress to assess the potential contribution of R-loops to the different, recurrent classes of DNA break ""hotspots"". We find that R-loops in neural stem/progenitor cells undergoing mild replication stress are present primarily in early-replicating, transcribed regions and in genes with promoter GC skew that are associated with cell lineage-specific processes. Surprisingly, most long, neural genes that form recurrent DSB clusters do not show R-loop formation under conditions of mild replication stress. Our findings are consistent with a role of R-loop-associated processes in promoter-proximal DNA break formation in highly transcribed, early replicating regions but suggest that R-loops do not drive replication stress-induced, recurrent DSB cluster formation in most long, neural genes.© 2022.

"35893865","Tea Polyphenols as Prospective Natural Attenuators of Brain Aging.","Nutrients","No organism can avoid the process of aging, which is often accompanied by chronic disease. The process of biological aging is driven by a series of interrelated mechanisms through different signal pathways, including oxidative stress, inflammatory states, autophagy and others. In addition, the intestinal microbiota play a key role in regulating oxidative stress of microglia, maintaining homeostasis of microglia and alleviating age-related diseases. Tea polyphenols can effectively regulate the composition of the intestinal microbiota. In recent years, the potential anti-aging benefits of tea polyphenols have attracted increasing attention because they can inhibit neuroinflammation and prevent degenerative effects in the brain. The interaction between human neurological function and the gut microbiota suggests that intervention with tea polyphenols is a possible way to alleviate brain-aging. Studies have been undertaken into the possible mechanisms underpinning the preventative effect of tea polyphenols on brain-aging mediated by the intestinal microbiota. Tea polyphenols may be regarded as potential neuroprotective substances which can act with high efficiency and low toxicity."
"35822045","G-quadruplexes Stabilization Upregulates CCN1 and Accelerates Aging in Cultured Cerebral Endothelial Cells.","Front Aging","Senescence in the cerebral endothelium has been proposed as a mechanism that can drive dysfunction of the cerebral vasculature, which precedes vascular dementia. Cysteine-rich angiogenic inducer 61 (Cyr61/CCN1) is a matricellular protein secreted by cerebral endothelial cells (CEC). CCN1 induces senescence in fibroblasts. However, whether CCN1 contributes to senescence in CEC and how this is regulated requires further study. Aging has been associated with the formation of four-stranded Guanine-quadruplexes (G4s) in G-rich motifs of DNA and RNA. Stabilization of the G4 structures regulates transcription and translation either by upregulation or downregulation depending on the gene target. Previously, we showed that aged mice treated with a G4-stabilizing compound had enhanced senescence-associated (SA) phenotypes in their brains, and these mice exhibited enhanced cognitive deficits. A sequence in the 3'-UTR of the humanCCN1mRNA has the ability to fold into G4sin vitro. We hypothesize that G4 stabilization regulates CCN1 in cultured primary CEC and induces endothelial senescence. We used cerebral microvessel fractions and cultured primary CEC from young (4-months old, m/o) and aged (18-m/o) mice to determine CCN1 levels. SA phenotypes were determined by high-resolution fluorescence microscopy in cultured primary CEC, and we used Thioflavin T to recognize RNA-G4s for fluorescence spectra. We found that cultured CEC from aged mice exhibited enhanced levels of SA phenotypes, and higher levels of CCN1 and G4 stabilization. In cultured CEC, CCN1 induced SA phenotypes, such as SA β-galactosidase activity, and double-strand DNA damage. Furthermore, CCN1 levels were upregulated by a G4 ligand, and a G-rich motif in the 3'-UTR of theCcn1mRNA was folded into a G4. In conclusion, we demonstrate that CCN1 can induce senescence in cultured primary CEC, and we provide evidence that G4 stabilization is a novel mechanism regulating the SASP component CCN1.Copyright © 2022 Noh, Blasco-Conesa, Lai, Ganesh, Urayama, Moreno-Gonzalez, Marrelli, McCullough and Moruno-Manchon."
"35682813","Age-Related Changes in the Fibroblastic Differon of the Dermis: Role in Skin Aging.","Int J Mol Sci","Skin aging is a multi-factorial process that affects nearly every aspect of skin biology and function. The processes developing in the skin during aging are based on fundamental molecular mechanisms associated with fibroblasts, the main cellular population of the dermis. It has been revealed that the amount of fibroblasts decreases markedly with age and their functional activity is also reduced. This inevitably leads to a decrease in the regenerative abilities of the skin and the progression of its aging. In this review we consider the mechanisms underlying these processes, mainly the changes observed with age in the stem/progenitor cells that constitute the fibroblastic differon of the dermis and form their microenvironment (niches). These changes lead to the depletion of stem cells, which, in turn, leads to a decrease in the number of differentiated (mature) dermal fibroblasts responsible for the production of the dermal extracellular matrix and its remodeling. We also describe in detail DNA damages, their cellular and systemic consequences, molecular mechanisms of DNA damage response, and also the role of fibroblast senescence in skin aging."

"35703050","Dynamics in brain activation and behaviour in acute and repeated social defensive behaviour.","Proc Biol Sci","In nature, confrontations between conspecifics are recurrent and related, in general, due to the lack of resources such as food and territory. Adequate defence against a conspecific aggressor is essential for the individual's survival and the group integrity. However, repeated social defeat is a significant stressor promoting several behavioural changes, including social defenceper se. What would be the neural basis of these behavioural changes? To build new hypotheses about this, we here investigate the effects of repeated social stress on the neural circuitry underlying motivated social defence behaviour in male mice. We observed that animals re-exposed to the aggressor three times spent more time in passive defence during the last exposure than in the first one. These animals also show less activation of the amygdalar and hypothalamic nuclei related to the processing of conspecific cues. In turn, we found no changes in the activation of the hypothalamic dorsal pre-mammillary nucleus (PMD) that is essential for passive defence. Therefore, our data suggest that the balance between the activity of circuits related to conspecific processing and the PMD determines the pattern of social defence behaviour. Changes in this balance may be the basis of the adaptations in social defence after repeated social defeat."

To clarify the lead body burden among residents in the region, a human biomonitoring study on a voluntary basis was initiated in which the blood lead level (BLL) was assessed. A questionnaire was distributed to evaluate lead exposure routes and confounders. Overall, 506 volunteers participated in the study, of whom 7.5% were children and adolescents, 71.9% were adults from 18 to 69 years, and 19.4% were residents 70 years or older. While the BLLs in the adult population were inconspicuous, among the children and adolescents investigated, 16.7% of the children between 3 and 17 years had BLLs above the recently revised German reference values for BLL in children. These results point towards a higher lead exposure in children living in the region. The hierarchical regression analysis based on the BLL and the questionnaire revealed the significant influence of the factors age, sex, smoking, construction age of the real estate, occupancy, and intensive contact with soil on the BLL. Measures to reduce lead exposure include a focus on improved personal and domestic hygiene to minimize lead intake."

The aim of this study is to analyze the m6A-related molecular biological mechanisms of AMI in terms of accurate diagnosis and prognosis.The platform data and probe data of the GSE66360 data set were downloaded. The differential analysis was conducted by combining the m6A-related gene expression. Thereafter, a diagnostic model was established using the random-forest method. The diagnostic accuracy of the diagnostic models was assessed by using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). Next, the patients with AMI were clustered by unsupervised machine learning using the R software.

In COVID-19, leukocyte pyroptosis has been previously associated with both beneficial and detrimental effects, so its role in the development of this disease remains controversial. Using transcriptomic data (GSE157103) of blood leukocytes from 126 acute respiratory distress syndrome patients (ARDS) with or without COVID-19, we found that COVID-19 patients present with enhanced leukocyte pyroptosis. Based on unsupervised clustering, we divided 100 COVID-19 patients into two clusters (PYRcluster1 and PYRcluster2) according to the expression of 35 pyroptosis-related genes. The results revealed distinct pyroptotic patterns associated with different leukocytes in these PYRclusters. PYRcluster1 patients were in a hyperinflammatory state and had a worse prognosis than PYRcluster2 patients. The hyperinflammation of PYRcluster1 was validated by the results of gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of proteomic data (MSV000085703). These differences in pyroptosis between the two PYRclusters were confirmed by the PYRscore. To improve the clinical treatment of COVID-19 patients, we used least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression to construct a prognostic model based on differentially expressed genes between PYRclusters (PYRsafescore), which can be applied as an effective prognosis tool. Lastly, we explored the upstream transcription factors of different pyroptotic patterns, thereby identifying 112 compounds with potential therapeutic value in public databases.Copyright © 2022 Tang, Zhang, Liu, Cao and Xu."

However, a small proportion of pediatric patients develop a severe clinical condition, multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). The involvement of epigenetics in the control of the immune response and viral activity prompted us to carry out an epigenomic study to uncover target loci regulated by DNA methylation that could be altered upon the appearance of MIS-C.Peripheral blood samples were recruited from 43 confirmed MIS-C patients. 69 non-COVID-19 pediatric samples and 15 COVID-19 pediatric samples without MIS-C were used as controls. The cases in the two groups were mixed and divided into discovery (MIS-C = 29 and non-MIS-C = 56) and validation (MIS-C = 14 and non-MIS-C = 28) cohorts, and balanced for age, gender and ethnic background. We interrogated 850,000 CpG sites of the human genome for DNA methylation variants.The DNA methylation content of 33 CpG loci was linked with the presence of MIS-C. Of these sites, 18 (54.5%) were located in described genes. The top candidate gene was the immune T-cell mediator ZEB2; and others highly ranked candidates included the regulator of natural killer cell functional competence SH2D1B; VWA8, which contains a domain of the Von Willebrand factor A involved in the pediatric hemostasis disease; and human leukocyte antigen complex member HLA-DRB1; in addition to pro-inflammatory genes such as CUL2 and AIM2. The identified loci were used to construct a DNA methylation profile (EPIMISC) that was associated with MIS-C in both cohorts. The EPIMISC signature was also overrepresented in Kawasaki disease patients, a childhood pathology with a possible viral trigger, that shares many of the clinical features of MIS-C.We have characterized DNA methylation loci that are associated with MIS-C diagnosis. The identified genes are likely contributors to the characteristic exaggerated host inflammatory response observed in these patients. The described epigenetic signature could also provide new targets for more specific therapies for the disorder.Unstoppable campaign of Josep Carreras Leukaemia Foundation, Fundació La Marató de TV3, Cellex Foundation and CERCA Programme/Generalitat de Catalunya.© 2022 The Author(s)."

It contributes to pathogenic cardiac phenotypes of COVID-19, e.g., low heart rate, myocardial edema, and myofibrillar disarray. DNA methylation studies reveal changes which likely contribute to cardiac disease through unknown mechanisms. The incidence of severe COVID-19 disease, including hospitalization, requiring respiratory support, morbidity, and mortality, is disproportionately higher in individuals with co-morbidities. This poses unprecedented strains on the global healthcare system. While their underlying conditions make patients more susceptible to severe COVID-19 disease, strained healthcare systems, lack of adequate support, or sedentary lifestyles from ongoing lockdowns have proved detrimental to their underlying health conditions, thus pushing them to severe risk of congenital heart disease (CHD) itself. Prophylactic vaccines against COVID-19 have ushered new hope for CHD. A common connection between COVID-19 and CHD is SARS-CoV-2's host receptor ACE2, because ACE2 regulates and protects organs, including the heart, in various ways.

Several acute and long-term symptoms have been reported in infected adults, but it remains unclear whether children/adolescents also experience persistent sequelae. Hence, we conducted a review of symptoms and pathophysiology associated with post-coronavirus disease 2019 (post-COVID-19) condition in children and adolescents. We reviewed the scientific literature for reports on persistent COVID-19 symptoms after SARS-CoV-2 infection in both children/adolescents and adults from 1 January 2020 to 31 March 2022 (based on their originality and relevance to the broad scope of this review, 26 reports were included, 8 focused on adults and 18 on children/adolescents). Persistent sequelae of COVID-19 are less common in children/adolescents than in adults, possibly owing to a lower frequency of SARS-CoV-2 infection and to the lower impact of the infection itself in this age group. However, cumulative evidence has shown prolonged COVID-19 to be a clinical entity, with few pathophysiological associations at present. The most common post-COVID-19 symptoms in children/adolescents are fatigue, lack of concentration, and muscle pain. In addition, we found evidence of pathophysiology associated with fatigue and/or headache, persistent loss of smell and cough, and neurological and/or cardiovascular symptoms.

Thus, the BR signaling regulators have the potential to be targeted for gene editing to optimize the architecture of plants and make them more resilient to environmental stress. Our understanding of the BR signaling mechanism in monocot crop species is limited compared to our knowledge of this process accumulated in the model dicot species -Arabidopsis thaliana. A deeper understanding of the BR signaling and response during plant growth and adaptation to continually changing environmental conditions will provide insight into mechanisms that govern the coordinated expression of the BR signaling genes in rice (Oryza sativa) which is a model for cereal crops. Therefore, in this study a comprehensive and detailedin silicoanalysis of promoter sequences of rice BR signaling genes was performed. Moreover, expression profiles of these genes during various developmental stages and reactions to several stress conditions were analyzed. Additionally, a model of interactions between the encoded proteins was also established. The obtained results revealed that promoters of the 39 BR signaling genes are involved in various regulatory mechanisms and interdependent processes that influence growth, development, and stress response in rice. Different transcription factor-binding sites and cis-regulatory elements in the gene promoters were identified which are involved in regulation of the genes' expression during plant development and reactions to stress conditions. Thein-silicoanalysis of BR signaling genes inO. sativaprovides information about mechanisms which regulate the coordinated expression of these genes during rice development and in response to other phytohormones and environmental factors. Since rice is both an important crop and the model species for other cereals, this information may be important for understanding the regulatory mechanisms that modulate the BR signaling in monocot species.

Cardiovascular disorders, cancers, and serious infectious conditions are less common among women than men. Recent data also indicate that women, particularly before menopause, are less susceptible to severe COVID-19, a viral infection hitting less-healthy individuals. The superiority of women regarding health has not been completely understood and partly been explained by estradiol beneficial effects on the microenvironment of the body, notably cytokine network. Estradiol cycles are aligned with menstruation cycles, a challenge for distinguishing their individual effects on human health. Large-scale, long-term studies indicate that hysterectomy, particularly at younger ages, is associated with an increased risk of mortality, cancer, or heart disorders. The underlying mechanisms for the increased risk in hysterectomized women are hard to be investigated in animal models since only a few primates menstruate. However, blood exchange models could resemble menstruation and provide some insight into possible beneficial effects of menstruation. Sera from animal models (neutral blood exchange) and also humans that have undergone therapeutic plasma exchange enhance the proliferation of progenitor cells in the culture and contain lower levels of proinflammatory factors. If menstruation resembles a blood exchange model, it can contribute to a healthier cytokine network in women. Consequently, menstruation, independently from estradiol health beneficial effects, can contribute to greater longevity and protection against certain disorders, e.g., COVID-19, in women. Investigation of COVID-19 rate/severity in hysterectomized women will provide insight into the possible beneficial effects of menstruation in COVID-19."

Of the 303 participants included in this study, 34 (11.2%) participants had died within five years after baseline data collection. As compared to the survivors, participants who died earlier were more likely (p&lt; 0.05) to be men, smokers, have a lower intake of total dietary fiber and molybdenum, higher intake of manganese, lower zinc levels in toenail samples, lower calcium and higher lead levels in hair samples during baseline. Following the multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis, lower total dietary fiber intake (HR: 0.681; 0.532-0.871), lower calcium (HR: 0.999; 95% CI: 0.999-1.000) and higher lead (HR: 1.309; 95% CI: 1.061-1.616) levels in hair samples appeared as the predictors of mortality.

We hypothesize that by taking the isomiR-mRNA interactions into account and applying a deep learning model to study miRNA-mRNA interaction features, we may improve the accuracy of miRNA target predictions. We developed a deep learning tool called DMISO to capture the intricate features of miRNA/isomiR-mRNA interactions. Based on tenfold cross-validation, DMISO showed high precision (95%) and recall (90%). Evaluated on three independent datasets, DMISO had superior performance to five tools, including three popular conventional tools and two recently developed deep learning-based tools. By applying two popular feature interpretation strategies, we demonstrated the importance of the miRNA regions other than their seeds and the potential contribution of the RNA-binding motifs within miRNAs/isomiRs and mRNAs to the miRNA/isomiR-mRNA interactions.© 2022.

"35719407","Identification of Feature Genes of a Novel Neural Network Model for Bladder Cancer.","Front Genet","Background:The combination of deep learning methods and oncogenomics can provide an effective diagnostic method for malignant tumors; thus, we attempted to construct a reliable artificial neural network model as a novel diagnostic tool for Bladder cancer (BLCA).Methods:Three expression profiling datasets (GSE61615, GSE65635, and GSE100926) were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. GSE61615 and GSE65635 were taken as the train group, while GSE100926 was set as the test group. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were filtered out based on the logFC and FDR values. We also performed Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses to explore the biological functions of the DEGs. Consequently, we utilized a random forest algorithm to identify feature genes and further constructed a neural network model. The test group was given the same procedures to validate the reliability of the model. We also explored immune cells' infiltration degree and correlation coefficients through the CiberSort algorithm and corrplot R package. The qRT-PCR assay was implemented to examine the expression level of the feature genesin vitro.Results:A total of 265 DEGs were filtered out and significantly enriched in muscle system processes, collagen-containing and focal adhesion signaling pathways. Based on the random forest algorithm, we selected 14 feature genes to construct the neural network model. The area under the curve (AUC) of the training group was 0.950 (95% CI: 0.850-1.000), and the AUC of the test group was 0.667 (95% CI: 0.333-1.000). Besides, we observed significant differences in the content of immune infiltrating cells and the expression levels of the feature genes.Conclusion:After repeated verification, our neural network model had clinical feasibility to identify bladder cancer patients and provided a potential target to improve the management of BLCA.Copyright © 2022 Zhang, Hua, Jiang, Xie, Wu, Wang, Shi, Dong and Jiang."

Chemotherapy contributes to this risk. We aimed to define the mechanisms of long-term vascular dysfunction caused by neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) and identify novel therapeutic targets. We studied arteries from postmenopausal women who had undergone breast cancer treatment using docetaxel, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (NACT) and from women with no history of such treatment matched for key clinical parameters. We explored mechanisms in WT and Nox4-/- mice and in human microvascular endothelial cells. Endothelium-dependent, NO-mediated vasodilatation was severely impaired in patients after NACT, while endothelium-independent responses remained normal. This was mimicked by a 24-hour exposure of arteries to NACT agents ex vivo. When applied individually, only docetaxel impaired endothelial function in human vessels. Mechanistic studies showed that NACT increased inhibitory eNOS phosphorylation of threonine 495 in a Rho-associated protein kinase-dependent (ROCK-dependent) manner and augmented vascular superoxide and hydrogen peroxide production and NADPH oxidase activity. Docetaxel increased expression of the NADPH oxidase NOX4 in endothelial and smooth muscle cells and NOX2 in the endothelium. A NOX4 increase in human arteries may be mediated epigenetically by diminished DNA methylation of the NOX4 promoter. Docetaxel induced endothelial dysfunction and hypertension in mice, and these were prevented in Nox4-/- mice and by pharmacological inhibition of Nox4 or Rock. Commonly used chemotherapeutic agents and, in particular, docetaxel alter vascular function by promoting the inhibitory phosphorylation of eNOS and enhancing ROS production by NADPH oxidases."

Cardiometabolic comorbidities have shown strong associations with COVID-19 severity in epidemiologic studies. Cardiometabolic protein biomarkers, therefore, may provide predictive insight regarding which patients are most susceptible to severe illness from COVID-19.In plasma samples collected from 343 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 during the first wave of the pandemic, we measured 92 circulating protein biomarkers previously implicated in cardiometabolic disease. We performed proteomic analysis and developed predictive models for severe outcomes. We then used these models to predict the outcomes of out-of-sample patients hospitalized with COVID-19 later in the surge (N = 194).We identified a set of seven protein biomarkers predictive of admission to the intensive care unit and/or death (ICU/death) within 28 days of presentation to care. Two of the biomarkers, ADAMTS13 and VEGFD, were associated with a lower risk of ICU/death. The remaining biomarkers, ACE2, IL-1RA, IL6, KIM1, and CTSL1, were associated with higher risk. When used to predict the outcomes of the future, out-of-sample patients, the predictive models built with these protein biomarkers outperformed all models built from standard clinical data, including known COVID-19 risk factors.These findings suggest that proteomic profiling can inform the early clinical impression of a patient's likelihood of developing severe COVID-19 outcomes and, ultimately, accelerate the recognition and treatment of high-risk patients.© 2022.

Immunologists have long been fascinated by understanding the ability to recall and respond faster and more vigorously to a pathogen, known as ""memory"". T-cell populations can be better described by using more sophisticated techniques to define phenotype, transcriptional and epigenetic signatures and metabolic pathways (single-cell resolution), which uncovered the heterogeneity of the memory T-compartment. Phenotype, effector functions, maintenance, and metabolic pathways help identify these different subsets. Here, we examine recent developments in the characterization of the heterogeneity of the memory T cell compartment. In particular, we focus on the emerging role of CD8+TRMand TSCMcells, providing evidence on how their immunometabolism or modulation can play a vital role in their generation and maintenance in chronic conditions such as infections or autoimmune diseases.Copyright © 2022 La Manna, Shekarkar Azgomi, Tamburini, Badami, Mohammadnezhad, Dieli and Caccamo."

The pathogenesis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remains unknown, but the association between cytokine storm and endothelial damage is crucial. This study aimed to evaluate resistin in COVID-19 pathogenesis compared with sepsis.First, we evaluated the association of plasma resistin levels and disease severity and clinical outcome in two large cohorts: a publicly available cohort including 306 COVID-19 patients in the United States (MGH cohort) and our original cohort including only intubated 113 patients in Japan (Osaka cohort 1). Second, to understand pathogenesis, we evaluate resistin, cytokines and endothelial cell adhesion molecules in COVID-19 compared with sepsis. Blood samples were collected from 62 ICU-treated COVID-19 patients and 38 sepsis patients on day 1 (day of ICU admission), days 2-3, days 6-8, and from 18 healthy controls (Osaka cohort 2). The plasma resistin, inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1 and IL-10) and endothelial cell adhesion molecules (ICAM-1 and VCAM-1) were compared between patients and control. Correlations among resistin, inflammatory cytokines and endothelial cell adhesion molecules were evaluated in COVID-19 and sepsis.In the MGH cohort, the day 1 resistin levels were associated with disease severity score. The non-survivors showed significantly greater resistin levels than survivors on days 1, 4 and 8. In the Osaka cohort 1, 28-day non-survivors showed significantly higher resistin levels than 28-day survivors on days 6-8. Patients with late recovery (defined as the day of weaning off mechanical ventilation >12 or death) had significantly higher resistin levels than those with early recovery on day 1 and days 6-8. In the Osaka cohort 2, plasma resistin levels were elevated in COVID-19 and sepsis patients compared to controls at all measurement points and were associated with inflammatory cytokines and endothelial cell adhesion molecules.Resistin was elevated in COVID-19 patients and was associated with cytokines and endothelial cell adhesion molecules. Higher resistin levels were related to worse outcome.Copyright © 2022 Ebihara, Matsumoto, Matsubara, Togami, Nakao, Matsuura, Onishi, Kojima, Sugihara, Okuzaki, Hirata, Yamamura and Ogura."
"35781076","Upcoming and urgent challenges in critical care research based on COVID-19 pandemic experience.","Anaesth Crit Care Pain Med","While the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic placed a heavy burden on healthcare systems worldwide, it also induced urgent mobilisation of research teams to develop treatments preventing or curing the disease and its consequences. It has, therefore, challenged critical care research to rapidly focus on specific fields while forcing critical care physicians to make difficult ethical decisions. This narrative review aims to summarise critical care research -from organisation to research fields- in this pandemic setting and to highlight opportunities to improve research efficiency in the future, based on what is learned from COVID-19. This pressure on research revealed, i.e., i/ the need to harmonise regulatory processes between countries, allowing simplified organisation of international research networks to improve their efficiency in answering large-scale questions; ii/ the importance of developing translational research from which therapeutic innovations can emerge; iii/ the need for improved triage and predictive scores to rationalise admission to the intensive care unit. In this context, key areas for future critical care research and better pandemic preparedness are artificial intelligence applied to healthcare, characterisation of long-term symptoms, and ethical considerations. Such collaborative research efforts should involve groups from both high and low-to-middle income countries to propose worldwide solutions. As a conclusion, stress tests on healthcare organisations should be viewed as opportunities to design new research frameworks and strategies. Worldwide availability of research networks ready to operate is essential to be prepared for next pandemics. Importantly, researchers and physicians should prioritise realistic and ethical goals for both clinical care and research.Copyright © 2022. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS."

The purpose of this study was to compare microvascular injury patterns and proteomic signatures in COVID-19 and bacterial sepsis patients.This multi-center, observational study included 22 hospitalized adult COVID-19 patients, 43 hospitalized bacterial sepsis patients, and 10 healthy controls from 4 hospitals. Microcirculation and glycocalyx dimensions were quantified via intravital sublingual microscopy. Plasma proteins were measured using targeted proteomics (Olink). Coregulation and cluster analysis of plasma proteins was performed using a training-set and confirmed in a test-set. An independent external cohort of 219 COVID-19 patients was used for validation and outcome analysis. Microcirculation and plasma proteome analysis found substantial overlap between COVID-19 and bacterial sepsis. Severity, but not disease entity explained most data variation. Unsupervised correlation analysis identified two main coregulated plasma protein signatures in both diseases that strictly counteract each other. They were associated with microvascular dysfunction and several established markers of clinical severity. The signatures were used to derive new composite biomarkers of microvascular injury that allow to predict 28-day mortality or/and intubation (area under the curve 0.90, p < 0.0001) in COVID-19.Our data imply a common biological host response of microvascular injury in both bacterial sepsis and COVID-19. A distinct plasma signature correlates with endothelial health and improved outcomes, while a counteracting response is associated with glycocalyx breakdown and high mortality. Microvascular health biomarkers are powerful predictors of clinical outcomes.© 2022. The Author(s)."

Looking ahead, our next challenge will be the reliable measurement and understanding of proteins. We describe in this review how to apply new, powerful methods of protein labeling, tracking, and detection. Recent developments of these methods now enable researchers to uncover protein mechanisms in vivo that may previously have only been hypothesized. These methods are also useful for discovering new biology because how proteins regulate systemic interactions is not well understood in most cases, such as how they travel through the bloodstream to distal targets or cross the blood-brain barrier. Genetic sequencing of DNA and RNA have enabled many great discoveries in the past 20 years, and now, the protein methods described here are creating a more complete picture of how cells to whole organisms function. It is likely that these developments will generate another transformation in biomedical research and our understanding of the brain and will ultimately allow for patient-specific medicine on a protein level.© 2022.

"35661859","Alemtuzumab-induced immune phenotype and repertoire changes: implications for secondary autoimmunity.","Brain","Alemtuzumab is a monoclonal antibody that causes rapid depletion of CD52-expressing immune cells. It has proven to be highly efficacious in active relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis; however, the high risk of secondary autoimmune disorders has greatly complicated its use. Thus, deeper insight into the pathophysiology of secondary autoimmunity and potential biomarkers is urgently needed. The most critical time points in the decision-making process for alemtuzumab therapy are before or at Month 12, where the ability to identify secondary autoimmunity risk would be instrumental. Therefore, we investigated components of blood and CSF of up to 106 multiple sclerosis patients before and after alemtuzumab treatment focusing on those critical time points. Consistent with previous reports, deep flow cytometric immune-cell profiling (n = 30) demonstrated major effects on adaptive rather than innate immunity, which favoured regulatory immune cell subsets within the repopulation. The longitudinally studied CSF compartment (n = 18) mainly mirrored the immunological effects observed in the periphery. Alemtuzumab-induced changes including increased numbers of naïve CD4+ T cells and B cells as well as a clonal renewal of CD4+ T- and B-cell repertoires were partly reminiscent of haematopoietic stem cell transplantation; in contrast, thymopoiesis was reduced and clonal renewal of T-cell repertoires after alemtuzumab was incomplete. Stratification for secondary autoimmunity did not show clear immununological cellular or proteomic traits or signatures associated with secondary autoimmunity. However, a restricted T-cell repertoire with hyperexpanded T-cell clones at baseline, which persisted and demonstrated further expansion at Month 12 by homeostatic proliferation, identified patients developing secondary autoimmune disorders (n = 7 without secondary autoimmunity versus n = 5 with secondary autoimmunity). Those processes were followed by an expansion of memory B-cell clones irrespective of persistence, which we detected shortly after the diagnosis of secondary autoimmune disease. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that (i) peripheral immunological alterations following alemtuzumab are mirrored by longitudinal changes in the CSF; (ii) incomplete T-cell repertoire renewal and reduced thymopoiesis contribute to a proautoimmune state after alemtuzumab; (iii) proteomics and surface immunological phenotyping do not identify patients at risk for secondary autoimmune disorders; (iv) homeostatic proliferation with disparate dynamics of clonal T- and B-cell expansions are associated with secondary autoimmunity; and (v) hyperexpanded T-cell clones at baseline and Month 12 may be used as a biomarker for the risk of alemtuzumab-induced autoimmunity.© The Author(s) 2022.

However, direct comparisons of molecular and cellular profiles between contemporaneously enrolled critically ill patients with and without severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) are limited. We sought to identify immune signatures specifically enriched in critically ill patients with COVID-19 compared with patients without COVID-19. We enrolled a multisite prospective cohort of patients admitted under suspicion for COVID-19, who were then determined to be SARS-CoV-2-positive (n= 204) or -negative (n= 122). SARS-CoV-2-positive patients had higher plasma levels of CXCL10, sPD-L1, IFN-γ, CCL26, C-reactive protein (CRP), and TNF-α relative to SARS-CoV-2-negative patients adjusting for demographics and severity of illness (BonferroniPvalue < 0.05). In contrast, the levels of IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and IL-17A were not significantly different between the two groups. In SARS-CoV-2-positive patients, higher plasma levels of sPD-L1 and TNF-α were associated with fewer ventilator-free days (VFDs) and higher mortality rates (BonferroniPvalue < 0.05). Lymphocyte chemoattractants such as CCL17 were associated with more severe respiratory failure in SARS-CoV-2-positive patients, but less severe respiratory failure in SARS-CoV-2-negative patients (Pvalue for interaction < 0.01). Circulating T cells and monocytes from SARS-CoV-2-positive subjects were hyporesponsive to in vitro stimulation compared with SARS-CoV-2-negative subjects. Critically ill SARS-CoV-2-positive patients exhibit an immune signature of high interferon-induced lymphocyte chemoattractants (e.g., CXCL10 and CCL17) and immune cell hyporesponsiveness when directly compared with SARS-CoV-2-negative patients. This suggests a specific role for T-cell migration coupled with an immune-checkpoint regulatory response in COVID-19-related critical illness."

This study demonstrated the association between genetic variants in m6A regulators and T1D risk based on a case-control study in a Chinese population.The tagging SNPs in m6A regulators were genotyped in 1005 autoantibody-positive patients with T1D and 1257 controls using the Illumina Human OmniZhongHua-8 platform. Islet-specific autoantibodies were examined by radioimmunoprecipitation in all the patients. The mixed-meal glucose tolerance test was performed on 355 newly diagnosed patients to evaluate their residual islet function. The functional annotations for the identified SNPs were performed in silico. Using 102 samples from a whole-genome expression microarray, key signaling pathways associated with m6A regulators in T1D were comprehendingly evaluated.Under the additive model, we observed three tag SNPs in the noncoding region of the PRRC2A (rs2260051, rs3130623) and YTHDC2 (rs1862315) gene are associated with T1D risk. Although no association was found between these SNPs and islet function, patients carrying risk variants had a higher positive rate for ZnT8A, GADA, and IA-2A. Further analyses showed that rs2260051[T] was associated with increased expression of PRRC2A mRNA (P= 7.0E-13), and PRRC2A mRNA was significantly higher in peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples from patients with T1D compared to normal samples (P= 0.022). Enrichment analyses indicated that increased PRRC2A expression engages in the most significant hallmarks of cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, cell adhesion and chemotaxis, and neurotransmitter regulation pathways. The potential role of increased PRRC2A in disrupting immune homeostasis is through the PI3K/AKT pathway and neuro-immune interactions.This study found intronic variants in PRRC2A and YTHDC2 associated with T1D risk in a Chinese Han population. PRRC2A rs2260051[T] may be implicated in unbalanced immune homeostasis by affecting the expression of PRRC2A mRNA. These findings enriched our understanding of m6A regulators and their intronic SNPs that underlie the pathogenesis of T1D.Copyright © 2022 Chen, Shen, Ji, Huang, Shi, Ji, Qin, Gu, Fu, Chen, Xu and Yang."

Our genome-wide searches identified (i) seven eGFR loci with significant DM/noDM-difference, (ii) four additional novel loci with suggestive difference and (iii) 28 further novel loci (including CUBN) by allowing for potential difference. GWAS on eGFR among DM individuals identified 2 known and 27 potentially responsible loci for diabetic kidney disease.

Here, we showed that EE exposure enhanced the pool of adult neural stem/progenitor cells (aNSPCs) and promoted neuronal differentiation of aNSPCs. EE exposure also improved cognitive capabilities and altered the expression of genes relating to neuronal development, neurogenesis, and memory.N6-Methyladenosine (m6A) immunoprecipitation combined with deep sequencing (MeRIP-seq) data analysis revealed that EE exposure increased the global level of m6A and led to differential m6A mRNA modification. Differential m6A modification-associated genes are involved in neuronal development, neurogenesis, and so on. Notably, EE exposure decreased the protein level of m6A eraser Fto, but did not affect the protein level of m6A writers METTL3 and METTL14. Taken together, our results suggest that enriched environment exposure induces differential m6A mRNA modification and adds a novel layer to the interaction between the environment and epigenetics in the context of postnatal neuronal development.Copyright © 2022 Qu, Li, Wang, Zhao, Wu, Liu, Hong, Yang, Shu and Li."
"35924237","Immunosenescence: A Critical Factor Associated With Organ Injury After Sepsis.","Front Immunol","Progressive immune dysfunction associated with aging is known as immunosenescence. The age-related deterioration of immune function is accompanied by chronic inflammation and microenvironment changes. Immunosenescence can affect both innate and acquired immunity. Sepsis is a systemic inflammatory response that affects parenchymal organs, such as the respiratory system, cardiovascular system, liver, urinary system, and central nervous system, according to the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA). The initial immune response is characterized by an excess release of inflammatory factors, followed by persistent immune paralysis. Moreover, immunosenescence was found to complement the severity of the immune disorder following sepsis. Furthermore, the immune characteristics associated with sepsis include lymphocytopenia, thymus degeneration, and immunosuppressive cell proliferation, which are very similar to the characteristics of immunosenescence. Therefore, an in-depth understanding of immunosenescence after sepsis and its subsequent effects on the organs may contribute to the development of promising therapeutic strategies. This paper focuses on the characteristics of immunosenescence after sepsis and rigorously analyzes the possible underlying mechanism of action. Based on several recent studies, we summarized the relationship between immunosenescence and sepsis-related organs. We believe that the association between immunosenescence and parenchymal organs might be able to explain the delayed consequences associated with sepsis.Copyright © 2022 Lu, Yang and Lu."

The present study was aimed to determine PAC assessment parameters, either alone or in combination, for predicting clinical outcomes.We retrospectively enrolled stroke adult patients through one PAC network in central Taiwan between January 2014 and December 2020. We collected data on post-stroke patients' functional ability at baseline and after PAC stay. The comprehensive assessment included the following: Modified Rankin Scale (MRS), Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS), Mini-Nutritional Assessment (MNA), Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), aphasia test, and quality of life. The above items were assessed first at baseline and again at discharge from PAC. Logistic regression was used to determine factors that were associated with PAC length of stay (LOS), 14-day hospital readmission, and 1-year mortality.A total of 267 adults (mean age 67.2 ± 14.7 years) with completed data were analyzed. MRS, activities of daily living (ADLs), instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs), BBS, and MMSE all had improved between disease onset and PAC discharge. Higher baseline and greater improvement of physical and cognitive functions between initial and final PAC assessments were significantly associated with less readmission, and lower mortality. Furthermore, the improved ADLs, FOIS, MNA, FMA-motor, and MMSE scores were related to LOS during PAC. Using logistic regression, we found that functional improvements ≥5 items [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 0.16; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.05-0.45] and improved MMSE (aOR = 0.19; 95% CI = 0.05-0.68) were significantly associated with reduced post-PAC mortality or readmission. Whereas, functional improvements ≥7 items, improved FOIS, and MNA significantly prolonged LOS during PAC.Physical performance parameters of patients with acute stroke improved after PAC.

"35625384","Healthy Long-Lived Human Beings-Working on Life Stages to Break the Limitation of Human Lifespans.","Biology (Basel)","The human lifespan has been increasing but will soon reach a plateau. A new direction based on the principal law of lifespan (PLOSP) may enable the human lifespan to be extremely healthy and long by the proper manipulation of the well-defined growing stages of the lifespan. The lifespan of creatures on earth from a single cell to animals can be elongated at different life stages including prenatal development, body growth, reproductivity, and aging. Each life stage has its own specific physiological and metabolic characteristics. Each life stage can be lengthened by either slowing its processes or continuously maintaining the activities of its function. Unfortunately, the current biomedical research on the extension of lifespans has mainly focused on the aging stage. Recognizing and clearly defining the periods of transition and the boundaries of life stages are essential for achieving the goal of long-lived healthy humans based on the PLOSP. The biomedical measures and pharmacological treatments for the extension of lifespans is life-stage-specific. The PLOSP can be tested with modified studies on longevity with a variety of technologies such as castration and ovariectomy. Sex differences in biological functions and the sequential order of the life stages requires different approaches for females and males."

The predictive power of the 13-gene signature was tested in two validation cohorts and a strong positive correlation (Spearman's rank correlation test:ρ = 0.649 for the Validation1 cohort;ρ = 0.693 for the Validation2 cohort) was observed between the glioma grade and 13-gene based severity score in both cohorts. The 13-gene signature was also predictive of glioma prognosis based on Kaplan-Meier survival curve analyses and Cox proportional hazard regression analysis in four cohorts of patients with glioma.Knowledge ofGPCRgene expression in glioma may help researchers gain a better understanding of the pathogenesis of high-grade glioma.

The identification method of cancer-specific biomarkers has important applications for the diagnosis and treatment of cancer types. In this study, we analyzed the pan-cancer DNA methylation data from TCGA and GEO, and proposed a computational method to quantify the degree of specificity based on the level of DNA methylation of G protein-coupled receptor-related genes (GPCRs-related genes) and to identify specific GPCRs DNA methylation biomarkers (GRSDMs) in pan-cancer. Then, a ridge regression-based method was used to discover potential drugs through predicting the drug sensitivities of cancer samples. Finally, we predicted and verified 8 GRSDMs in adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC), rectum adenocarcinoma (READ), uveal Melanoma (UVM), thyroid carcinoma (THCA), and predicted 4 GRSDMs (F2RL3, DGKB, GRK5, PIK3R6) which were sensitive to 12 potential drugs.

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are important regulators of gene expression, and whether they play roles in osteogenic differentiation of DPSCs requires more study.DPSCs were isolated and cultured. The mRNA and lncRNA expression profiles were compared through microarray assay between osteo-differentiated DPSCs and non-differentiated DPSCs. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses, Gene ontology (GO) analyses, and the mRNA-lncRNA co-expression analyses were performed for functional annotation of differentially expressed RNAs. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) was used to interfere the expression of lncRNA ENST00000533992 (also named smooth muscle-induced lncRNA or SMILR), a candidate regulator, then the osteogenic differentiation potential of DPSCs was analyzed.DPSCs were isolated and cultured successfully. The expression of 273 mRNAs and 184 lncRNAs changed significantly in DPSCs after osteogenic induction. KEGG analyses and GO analyses showed that the differentially expressed RNAs were enriched in several pathways and biological processes. The mRNA-lncRNA co-expression network was constructed to reveal the potential relationships between mRNAs and lncRNAs. The osteogenic differentiation potential of DPSCs decreased when SMILR was interfered.The present study provides clues for seeking for lncRNAs that participate in the regulation of osteogenic differentiation in DPSCs. LncRNA SMILR could play a role in regulating osteogenic differentiation of DPSCs.© 2021 Association for Dental Sciences of the Republic of China. Publishing services by Elsevier B.V."

Here, we introduce Forest Fire Clustering, an efficient and interpretable method for cell-type discovery from single-cell data. Forest Fire Clustering makes minimal prior assumptions and, different from current approaches, calculates a non-parametric posterior probability that each cell is assigned a cell-type label. These posterior distributions allow for the evaluation of a label confidence for each cell and enable the computation of ""label entropies"", highlighting transitions along developmental trajectories. Furthermore, we show that Forest Fire Clustering can make robust, inductive inferences in an online-learning context and can readily scale to millions of cells. Finally, we demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art clustering approaches on diverse benchmarks of simulated and experimental data. Overall, Forest Fire Clustering is a useful tool for rare cell type discovery in large-scale single-cell analysis.© 2022. The Author(s)."

The long non-codingMALINC1intergenic RNA was identified as significantly upregulated in breast ductal carcinoma in situ. The aim of this study was to characterizeMALINC1expression, localization, and phenotypic and molecular effects in non-invasive and invasive breast cancer cells. We determined thatMALINC1is an estrogen-estrogen receptor-modulated lncRNA enriched in the cytoplasmic fraction of luminal A/B breast cancer cells that is associated with worse overall survival in patients with primary invasive breast carcinomas. Transcriptomic studies in normal and DCIS cells identified the main signaling pathways modulated byMALINC1, which mainly involve bioprocesses related to innate and adaptive immune responses, extracellular matrix remodeling, cell adhesion, and activation of AP-1 signaling pathway. We determined thatMALINC1induces premalignant phenotypic changes by increasing cell migration in normal breast cells. Moreover, highMALINC1expression in invasive carcinomas was associated with a pro-tumorigenic immune environment and a favorable predicted response to immunotherapy both in luminal and basal-like subtypes compared with low-MALINC1-expression tumors. We conclude thatMALINC1behaves as an oncogenic and immune-related lncRNA involved with early-stage breast cancer progression."

With several regimens now available, the choice of chemotherapy could be best dictated by response to neoadjuvant therapy (as measured by CA19-9 levels and/or pathologic response), a strategy defined herein as adaptive dynamic therapy.To evaluate the association of adaptive dynamic therapy with oncologic outcomes in patients with surgically resected pancreatic cancer.This retrospective cohort study included patients with localized pancreatic cancer who were treated with either gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel or fluorouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX) preoperatively between 2010 and 2019 at a high-volume tertiary care academic center. Participants were identified from a prospectively maintained database and had a median follow-up of 49 months. Data were analyzed from October 17 to November 24, 2020.The adaptive dynamic therapy group included 219 patients who remained on or switched to an alternative regimen as dictated by CA19-9 response and for whom the adjuvant regimen was selected based on CA19-9 and/or pathologic response. The nonadaptive dynamic therapy group included 103 patients who had their chemotherapeutic regimen selected independent of CA19-9 and/or tumoral response.Prognostic implications of dynamic perioperative therapy assessed through Kaplan-Meier analysis, Cox regression, and inverse probability weighted estimators.A total of 322 consecutive patients (mean [SD] age, 65.1 [9] years; 162 [50%] women) were identified. The adaptive dynamic therapy group, compared with the nonadaptive dynamic therapy group, had a more pronounced median (IQR) decrease in CA19-9 levels (-80% [-92% to -56%] vs -45% [-81% to -13%]; P < .001), higher incidence of complete or near-complete tumoral response (25 [12%] vs 2 [2%]; P = .007), and lower median (IQR) number of lymph node metastasis (1 [0 to 4] vs 2 [0 to 4]; P = .046). Overall survival was significantly improved in the dynamic group compared with the nondynamic group (38.7 months [95% CI, 34.0 to 46.7 months] vs 26.5 months [95% CI, 23.5 to 32.9 months]; P = .03), and on adjusted analysis, dynamic therapy was independently associated with improved survival (hazard ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.99; P = .04). On inverse probability weighted analysis of 320 matched patients, the average treatment effect of dynamic therapy was to increase overall survival by 11.1 months (95% CI, 1.5 to 20.7 months; P = .02).In this cohort study that sought to evaluate the role of adaptive dynamic therapy in localized pancreatic cancer, selecting a chemotherapeutic regimen based on response to preoperative therapy was associated with improved survival.

Shortened TL is linked to attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms in school-aged children. The onset of ADHD occurs as early as preschool-age, but the TL-ADHD association in younger children is unknown. We investigated associations between infant TL and ADHD symptoms in children and assessed environmental factors as potential confounders and/or mediators of this association. Relative TL was measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction in cord and 12-month blood in the birth cohort study, the Barwon Infant Study. Early life environmental factors collected antenatally to two years were used to measure confounding. ADHD symptoms at age two years were evaluated by the Child Behavior Checklist Attention Problems (AP) and the Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Problems (ADHP). Associations between early life environmental factors on TL or ADHD symptoms were assessed using multivariable regression models adjusted for relevant factors. Telomere length at 12 months (TL12), but not at birth, was inversely associated with AP (β= -0.56; 95% CI (-1.13, 0.006);p= 0.05) and ADHP (β= -0.66; 95% CI (-1.11, -0.21);p= 0.004). Infant secondhand smoke exposure at one month was independently associated with shorter TL12 and also higher ADHD symptoms. Further work is needed to elucidate the mechanisms that influence TL attrition and early neurodevelopment."

Recent neuroimaging studies have linked aberrant functional connectivity (FC) between the default-mode network (DMN) and the frontoparietal network (FPN) in the resting-state to the underlying neural mechanism of schizophrenia. By using schizotypy as the proxy for genetic-based liability to schizophrenia and methylation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) to represent environmental exposure, this study investigated the impact of the interaction between vulnerability and the environment on the neurobiological substrates of schizophrenia. Participants in this study included 101 healthy adults (HC) and 46 individuals with ultra-high risk for psychosis (UHR). All participants were tested at resting-state by functional magnetic resonance imaging, and group-independent component analysis was used to identify the DMN and the FPN. The Perceptual Aberration Scale (PAS) was used to evaluate the schizotypy level. The methylation status of BDNF was measured by pyrosequencing. For moderation analysis, the final sample consisted of 83 HC and 32 UHR individuals. UHR individuals showed reduced DMN-FPN network FC compared to healthy controls. PAS scores significantly moderated the relationship between the percentage of BDNF methylation and DMN-FPN network FC. The strength of the positive relationship between BDNF methylation and the network FC was reduced when the schizotypy level increased. These findings support the moderating role of schizotypy on the neurobiological mechanism of schizophrenia in conjunction with epigenetic changes.© 2022. The Author(s)."

With the development of new therapeutic agents in prostate cancer (PC) including DNA repair targeted therapies, this is especially attractive. However, there is unclarity on how best to screen for PC, improve risk stratification and ultimately how to treat advanced disease. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop better biomarkers to help guide oncologists' decisions in these settings. Circulating tumour cells (CTCs), exosomes and cell-free DNA/RNA (cfDNA/cfRNA) analysis, including epigenetic features such as methylation, have all shown potential in prognostication, treatment response assessment and detection of emerging mechanisms of resistance. However, there are still challenges to overcome prior to implementing liquid biopsies in routine clinical practice such as preanalytical considerations including blood collection and storage, the cost of CTC isolation and enrichment, low-circulating tumour content as a limitation for genomic analysis and how to better interpret the sequencing data generated.

Clinical assays that utilize ctDNA are commercially available for the identification of actionable mutations prior to treatment and to assess minimal residual disease after treatment. There is currently no clinical ctDNA assay specifically intended to monitor disease response during treatment, partially due to the complex challenge of understanding the biological sources of ctDNA and the underlying principles that govern its release. Although studies have shown pre- and post-treatment ctDNA levels can be prognostic, there is evidence that early, on-treatment changes in ctDNA levels are more accurate in predicting response. Yet, these results also vary widely among cohorts, cancer type, and treatment, likely due to the driving biology of tumor cell proliferation, cell death, and ctDNA clearance kinetics. To realize the full potential of ctDNA monitoring in cancer care, we may need to reorient our thinking toward the fundamental biological underpinnings of ctDNA release and dissemination from merely seeking convenient clinical correlates.Copyright © 2022 Boniface and Spellman."

"35899071","Sporadic, late-onset, and multistage diseases.","PNAS Nexus","Multistage disease processes are often characterized by a linear relationship between the log of incidence rates and the log of age. Examples include sequences of somatic mutations, that can cause cancer, and have recently been linked with a range of non-malignant diseases. Using a Weibull distribution to model diseases that occur through an ordered sequence of stages, and another model where stages can occur in any order, we characterized the age-related onset of disease in UK Biobank data. Despite their different underlying assumptions, both models accurately described the incidence of over 450 diseases, demonstrating that multistage disease processes cannot be inferred from this data alone. The parametric models provided unique insights into age-related disease, that conventional studies of relative risks cannot. The rate at which disease risk increases with age was used to distinguish between ""sporadic"" diseases, with an initially low and slowly increasing risk, and ""late-onset"" diseases whose negligible risk when young rapidly increases with age. ""Relative aging rates"" were introduced to quantify how risk factors modify age-related risk, finding the effective age-at-risk of sporadic diseases is strongly modified by common risk factors. Relative aging rates are ideal for risk-stratification, allowing the identification of ages with equivalent-risk in groups with different exposures. Most importantly, our results suggest that a substantial burden of sporadic diseases can be substantially delayed or avoided by early lifestyle interventions.© The Author(s) 2022.

Exposure to AA is a significant risk factor for severe nephropathy, and urological and hepatobiliary cancers (among others) that are often recurrent and characterized by the prominent mutational fingerprint of AA. However, herbal medicinal products that contain AA continue to be manufactured and marketed worldwide with inadequate regulation, and possible environmental exposure routes receive little attention. As the trade of food and dietary supplements becomes increasingly globalized, we propose that further inaction on curtailing AA exposure will have far-reaching negative effects on the disease trends of AA-associated cancers. Our Review aims to systematically present the historical and current evidence for the mutagenicity and carcinogenicity of AA, and the effect of removing sources of AA exposure on cancer incidence trends. We discuss the persisting challenges of assessing the scale of AA-related carcinogenicity, and the obstacles that must be overcome in curbing AA exposure and preventing associated cancers. Overall, this Review aims to strengthen the case for the implementation of prevention measures against AA's multifaceted, detrimental and potentially fully preventable effects on human cancer development.© 2022.

"35725896","A clinically annotated post-mortem approach to study multi-organ somatic mutational clonality in normal tissues.","Sci Rep","Recent research on normal human tissues identified omnipresent clones of cells, driven by somatic mutations known to be responsible for carcinogenesis (e.g., in TP53 or NOTCH1). These new insights are fundamentally changing current tumor evolution models, with broad oncological implications. Most studies are based on surgical remnant tissues, which are not available for many organs and rarely in a pan-organ setting (multiple organs from the same individual). Here, we describe an approach based on clinically annotated post-mortem tissues, derived from whole-body donors that are routinely used for educational purposes at human anatomy units. We validated this post-mortem approach using UV-exposed and unexposed epidermal skin tissues and confirm the presence of positively selected NOTCH1/2-, TP53- and FAT1-driven clones. No selection signals were detected in a set of immune genes or housekeeping genes. Additionally, we provide the first evidence for smoking-induced clonal changes in oral epithelia, likely underlying the origin of head and neck carcinogenesis. In conclusion, the whole-body donor-based approach provides a nearly unlimited healthy tissue resource to study mutational clonality and gain fundamental mutagenic insights in the presumed earliest stages of tumor evolution.© 2022.

Promoter hypermethylation, promoter SNP, microRNA, and inhibition of upstream pathways (e.g., NOTCH) result in PAX9 silencing or downregulation, whereas gene amplification and an epigenetic axis upregulate PAX9 expression.

"35912015","Mutation or not, what directly establishes a neoplastic state, namely cellular immortality and autonomy, still remains unknown and should be prioritized in our research.","J Cancer","Although the concept that cancer is caused by mutations has been widely accepted, there still are ample data deprecating it. For example, embryonic cells displaced in non-embryonic environments may develop to cancer, whereas cancer cells placed in embryonic environments may be reverted to phenotypic normal. Although many intracellular or extracellular aberrations are known to be able to initiate a lengthy tumorigenesis, the molecular or cellular alterations that directly establish a neoplastic state, namely cellular immortality and autonomy, still remain unknown. Hereditary traits are encoded not only by gene sequences but also by karyotype and DNA or chromosomal structures that may be altered via non-mutational mechanisms, such as post-translational modifications of nuclear proteins, to initiate tumorigenesis. However, the immortal and autonomous nature of neoplasms makes them ""new"" organisms, meaning that neoplasms should have mutations to distinguish themselves from their host patients in the genome. Neoplasms are malignant if they bear epigenetic or genetic alterations in mutator genes, i.e. the genes whose alterations accelerate other genes to mutate, whereas neoplasms are benign if their epigenetic or genetic aberrations occur only in non-mutator genes. Future mechanistic research should be focused on identifying the alterations that directly establish cellular immortality and autonomy. Benign tumors may have many fewer alterations and thus be much better models than cancers for such research. Future translational research should be aimed at identifying the cellular factors that control cancer cells' phenotypes and at establishing approaches of directing cancer cells towards differentiation, which should be a promising therapeutic tactic.© The author(s)."

In most cases, their function has been attributed to the demethylase activity. However, accumulating evidence demonstrates that these proteins play roles distinct from histone demethylation. This raises the possibility that they might share domains that contribute to their functional outcome. Here, we show that the JMJC-KDMs contain low-complexity domains and intrinsically disordered regions (IDR), which in some cases reached 70% of the protein. Our data revealed that plant homeodomain finger protein (PHF2), KDM2A, and KDM4B cluster by phase separation. Moreover, our molecular analysis implies that PHF2 IDR contributes to transcription regulation. These data suggest that clustering via phase separation is a common feature that JMJC-KDMs utilize to facilitate their functional responses. Our study uncovers a novel potential function for the JMJC-KDM family that sheds light on the mechanisms to achieve the competent concentration of molecules in time and space within the cell nucleus."

Here we identified SIRT1-mediated DNA-binding domain (DBD) deacetylation as a critical step for IRF3/7 activation that is inhibited during aging. Viral-stimulated IRF3 underwent liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) with interferon (IFN)-stimulated response element DNA and compartmentalized IRF7 in the nucleus, thereby stimulating type I IFN (IFN-I) expression. SIRT1 deficiency resulted in IRF3/IRF7 hyperacetylation in the DBD, which inhibited LLPS and innate immunity, resulting in increased viral load and mortality in mice. By developing a genetic code expansion orthogonal system, we demonstrated the presence of an acetyl moiety at specific IRF3/IRF7 DBD site/s abolish IRF3/IRF7 LLPS and IFN-I induction. SIRT1 agonists rescued SIRT1 activity in aged mice, restored IFN signaling and thus antagonized viral replication. These findings not only identify a mechanism by which SIRT1 regulates IFN production by affecting IRF3/IRF7 LLPS, but also provide information on the drivers of innate immunosenescence.© 2022.

One major key to sex-biased differences lies in the sex chromosomes. Although the functions of the X chromosome proteins are well appreciated, how they compare with their Y chromosome homologs remains elusive. Herein, using ensemble and single-molecule techniques, we report that the sex chromosome-encoded RNA helicases DDX3X and DDX3Y are distinct in their propensities for liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), dissolution, and translation repression. We demonstrate that the N-terminal intrinsically disordered region of DDX3Y more strongly promotes LLPS than the corresponding region of DDX3X and that the weaker ATPase activity of DDX3Y, compared with DDX3X, contributes to the slower disassembly dynamics of DDX3Y-positive condensates. Interestingly, DDX3Y-dependent LLPS represses mRNA translation and enhances aggregation of FUS more strongly than DDX3X-dependent LLPS.

"35902960","A critical appraisal of clinical epigenetics.","Clin Epigenetics","Modern epigenetics emerged about 40 years ago. Since then, the field has rapidly grown. Unfortunately, this development has been accompanied by certain misconceptions and methodological shortcomings. A profound misconception is that chromatin modifications are a distinct layer of gene regulation that is directly responsive to the environment and potentially heritable between generations. This view ignores the fact that environmental factors affect gene expression mainly through signaling cascades and the activation or repression of transcription factors, which recruit chromatin regulators. The epigenome is mainly shaped by the DNA sequence and by transcription. Methodological shortcomings include the insufficient consideration of genetic variation and cell mixture distribution. Mis- and overinterpretation of epigenetic data foster genetic denialism (""We can control our genes"") and epigenetic determinism (""You are what your parents ate""). These erroneous beliefs can be overcome by using precise definitions, by raising the awareness about methodological pitfalls and by returning to the basic facts in molecular and cellular biology.© 2022.

"35874548","How Reproducibility Will Accelerate Discovery Through Collaboration in Physio-Logging.","Front Physiol","What new questions could ecophysiologists answer if physio-logging research was fully reproducible? We argue thattechnical debt(computational hurdles resulting from prioritizing short-term goals over long-term sustainability) stemming from insufficientcyberinfrastructure(field-wide tools, standards, and norms for analyzing and sharing data) trapped physio-logging in a scientific silo. This debt stifles comparative biological analyses and impedes interdisciplinary research. Although physio-loggers (e.g., heart rate monitors and accelerometers) opened new avenues of research, the explosion of complex datasets exceeded ecophysiology's informatics capacity. Like many other scientific fields facing a deluge of complex data, ecophysiologists now struggle to share their data and tools. Adapting to this new era requires a change in mindset, from ""data as a noun"" (e.g., traits, counts) to ""data as a sentence"", where measurements (nouns) are associate with transformations (verbs), parameters (adverbs), and metadata (adjectives). Computational reproducibility provides a framework for capturing the entire sentence. Though usually framed in terms of scientific integrity, reproducibility offers immediate benefits by promoting collaboration between individuals, groups, and entire fields. Rather than a tax on our productivity that benefits some nebulous greater good, reproducibility can accelerate the pace of discovery by removing obstacles and inviting a greater diversity of perspectives to advance science and society. In this article, we 1) describe the computational challenges facing physio-logging scientists and connect them to the concepts oftechnical debtandcyberinfrastructure, 2) demonstrate how other scientific fields overcame similar challenges by embracing computational reproducibility, and 3) present a framework to promote computational reproducibility in physio-logging, and bio-logging more generally.Copyright © 2022 Czapanskiy and Beltran."

Enrichment analysis of differential genes in the development of renal fibrosis was carried out using the DAVID database, differential genes were analyzed using the STRING database, and Cytoscape software was used for visual processing.Eighteen up-regulated genes and ten down-regulated genes were screened. Differential genes are mainly involved in the integrin-mediated signaling pathway and mitotic sister chromatid binding, etc. We found that the molecular functions (MFs) of the differential genes are phospholipid binding and regulatory region DNA binding, etc. Moreover, the cellular components (CCs) of the differential genes are mainly related to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles and nuclei. Screening revealed thatADM, ARRB1, AVPR2, CCR1, MTNR1A, PTH, andS1PR2were core genes in the interaction network of renal fibrosis risk-related proteins.In this study, the differential genes in the occurrence of renal fibrosis were screened out via dataset analysis. It was found thatADM, ARRB1, AVPR2, CCR1, MTNR1A, PTH, andS1PR2may be important participants in the development of renal fibrosis, which provides analytical support for the identification of valuable markers of renal fibrosis.2022 Translational Andrology and Urology.

"35762708","Identification of 121 variants of honey bee Vitellogenin protein sequences with structural differences at functional sites.","Protein Sci","Proteins are under selection to maintain central functions and to accommodate needs that arise in ever-changing environments. The positive selection and neutral drift that preserve functions result in a diversity of protein variants. The amount of diversity differs between proteins: multifunctional or disease-related proteins tend to have fewer variants than proteins involved in some aspects of immunity. Our work focuses on the extensively studied protein Vitellogenin (Vg), which in honey bees (Apis mellifera) is multifunctional and highly expressed and plays roles in immunity. Yet, almost nothing is known about the natural variation in the coding sequences of this protein or how amino acid-altering variants might impact structure-function relationships. Here, we map out allelic variation in honey bee Vg using biological samples from 15 countries. The successful barcoded amplicon Nanopore sequencing of 543 bees revealed 121 protein variants, indicating a high level of diversity in Vg. We find that the distribution of non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) differs between protein regions with different functions; domains involved in DNA and protein-protein interactions contain fewer nsSNPs than the protein's lipid binding cavities. We outline how the central functions of the protein can be maintained in different variants and how the variation pattern may inform about selection from pathogens and nutrition.© 2022 The Authors.

"35734098","Mechanistic Understanding of Lung Inflammation: Recent Advances and Emerging Techniques.","J Inflamm Res","Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a life-threatening lung injury characterized by an acute inflammatory response in the lung parenchyma. Hence, it is considered as the most appropriate clinical syndrome to study pathogenic mechanisms of lung inflammation. ARDS is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in the intensive care unit (ICU), while no effective pharmacological treatment exists. It is very important therefore to fully characterize the underlying pathobiology and the related mechanisms, in order to develop novel therapeutic approaches. In vivo and in vitro models are important pre-clinical tools in biological and medical research in the mechanistic and pathological understanding of the majority of diseases. In this review, we will present data from selected experimental models of lung injury/acute lung inflammation, which have been based on clinical disorders that can lead to the development of ARDS and related inflammatory lung processes in humans, including ventilation-induced lung injury (VILI), sepsis, ischemia/reperfusion, smoke, acid aspiration, radiation, transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI), influenza,Streptococcus(S.)pneumoniaeand coronaviruses infection. Data from the corresponding clinical conditions will also be presented. The mechanisms related to lung inflammation that will be covered are oxidative stress, neutrophil extracellular traps, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, surfactant, and water and ion channels. Finally, we will present a brief overview of emerging techniques in the field of omics research that have been applied to ARDS research, encompassing genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, which may recognize factors to help stratify ICU patients at risk, predict their prognosis, and possibly, serve as more specific therapeutic targets.© 2022 Keskinidou et al."

The potential biological functions of these co-DEGs were explored by functional enrichment analysis, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were constructed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of the co-DEGs. Finally, hub genes in the co-DEG network were identified, and correlation analysis was performed.We identified 8320 upregulated genes and 7651 downregulated genes from blood samples of COVID-19 patients and 368 upregulated genes and 240 downregulated genes from blood samples of thrombosis patients. The enriched cellular component terms were mainly related to cytosolic ribosomes and ribosomal subunits. The enriched molecular function terms were mainly related to structural constituents of ribosomes and electron transfer activity. Construction of the PPI network and identification of hub genes ultimately confirmed that RPS7, IGF1R, DICER1, ERH, MCTS1, and TNPO1 were jointly upregulated hub genes, and FLNA and PXN were jointly downregulated hub genes.The identification of novel potential biomarkers provides new options for treating COVID-19-related thrombosis and reducing the rate of severe COVID-19.Copyright © 2022 Qi, Huang and Li."

We validated the effectiveness of an adult radiographic assessment of lung edema (RALE) score in PARDS.To assess the severity and prognosis of PARDS based on a chest radiograph (CXR) RALE scoring method.Pediatric Acute Lung Injury Consensus Conference (PALICC) criteria were used to diagnose PARDS. General demographics, pulmonary complications, and 28-day mortality of the patients were recorded. Subgroups were compared by prognosis (survive and death) and etiology (infection and noninfection). Two observers calculated RALE independently. Each quadrant of CXR was scored by consolidation scores 0 (none alveolar opacity), 1 (extent <25%), 2 (extent 25%-50%), 3 (50%-75%), and 4 (>75%) and density scores 1 (hazy), 2 (moderate), and 3 (dense). Quadrant score equals consolidation score times density score. Total score equals to the sum of four quadrants scores. The ROC curve and survival curve were established, and the optimal cutoff score for discrimination prognosis was set.116 PARDS (72 boys and 44 girls) and 463 CXRs were enrolled. The median age was 25 months (5 months, 60.8 months) and with a mortality of 37.9% (44/116). The agreement between two independent observers was excellent (ICC = 0.98, 95% CI: 0.97-0.99). Day 3 score was independently associated with better survival (p< 0.001). The area under the curve of ROC was 0.773 (95% CI: 0.709-0.838). The cutoff score was 21 (sensitivity 71.7%, specificity 76.5%), and the hazard ratio (HR) was 9.268 (95% CI: 1.257-68.320). The pulmonary complication showed an HR of 3.678 (95% CI: 1.174-11.521) for the discrimination.CXR RALE score can be used in PARDS for discriminating the prognosis and has a better agreement among radiologist and pediatrician. PARDS with pulmonary complications, day 3 score whether greater than 21 points, have a better predictive effectiveness.Copyright © 2022 Yu-Chun Yan et al."
"35913515","Myocardin regulates exon usage in smooth muscle cells through induction of splicing regulatory factors.","Cell Mol Life Sci","Differentiation of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) depends on serum response factor (SRF) and its co-activator myocardin (MYOCD). The role of MYOCD for the SMC program of gene transcription is well established. In contrast, the role of MYOCD in control of SMC-specific alternative exon usage, including exon splicing, has not been explored. In the current work we identified four splicing factors (MBNL1, RBPMS, RBPMS2, and RBFOX2) that correlate with MYOCD across human SMC tissues. Forced expression of MYOCD family members in human coronary artery SMCs in vitro upregulated expression of these splicing factors. For global profiling of transcript diversity, we performed RNA-sequencing after MYOCD transduction. We analyzed alternative transcripts with three different methods. Exon-based analysis identified 1637 features with differential exon usage. For example, usage of 3´ exons in MYLK that encode telokin increased relative to 5´ exons, as did the 17 kDa telokin to 130 kDa MYLK protein ratio. Dedicated event-based analysis identified 239 MYOCD-driven splicing events. Events involving MBNL1, MCAM, and ACTN1 were among the most prominent, and this was confirmed using variant-specific PCR analyses. In support of a role for RBPMS and RBFOX2 in MYOCD-driven splicing we found enrichment of their binding motifs around differentially spliced exons. Moreover, knockdown of either RBPMS or RBFOX2 antagonized splicing events stimulated by MYOCD, including those involving ACTN1, VCL, and MBNL1. Supporting an in vivo role of MYOCD-SRF-driven splicing, we demonstrate altered Rbpms expression and splicing in inducible and SMC-specific Srf knockout mice. We conclude that MYOCD-SRF, in part via RBPMS and RBFOX2, induce a program of differential exon usage and alternative splicing as part of the broader program of SMC differentiation.© 2022.

We have reported that the most prevalent polymorphism of the aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 gene (ALDH2), rs671, may be associated with an attenuated immune system. To test the inverse relationship between rs671 and antibody production after COVID-19 vaccination, the levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein S1 subunit (S1) IgG were repeatedly measured for four months before and after vaccination with BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273, in 88 Japanese workers and students (including 45 females, aged 21-56 years, with an rs671 variant allele frequency of 0.3). The mixed model including fixed effects of the vaccine type, weeks post vaccination (categorical variable), sex, age, height, smoking status, ethanol intake, exercise habit, perceived stress, steroid use, allergic diseases, and dyslipidemia, indicated an inverse association between log-transformed anti-S1 IgG levels and the number of rs671 variant alleles (partial regression coefficient = -0.15,p= 0.002). Our study indicated for the first time that the variant allele ofALDH2, rs671, is associated with the attenuated immunogenicity of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. Our finding may provide a basis for personalized disease prevention based on a genetic polymorphism that is prevalent among East Asians."

However, with the limitation of reverse causality and confounder in observational studies, such relationship remains unclear. This study aims to reveal the causal effect of gut microbiota and metabolites on heart failure and its risk factors.This study collected summary statistics regarding gut microbiota and metabolites, heart failure, diabetes, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, coronary heart disease, valvular heart disease, and myocarditis. Two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis was performed using MR-Egger, inverse variance weighted (IVW), MR-PRESSO, maximum likelihood, and weighted median.Results from gene prediction showed that among all gut microbiota,candida, shigella, andcampylobacterwere not associated with higher incidence of heart failure. However, genetic prediction suggested that for every 1 unit increase inshigellaconcentration, the relative risk increased by 38.1% for myocarditis and 13.3% for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Besides, for every 1 unit increased incandidaconcentration, the relative risk of chronic kidney disease increased by 7.1%. As for intestinal metabolites, genetic prediction results suggested that for every 1 unit increase in betaine, the relative risk of heart failure and myocardial infarction increased by 1.4% and 1.7%, separately.This study suggested new evidence of the relationship between gut microbiota and heart failure and its risk factors, which may shed light on designing microbiome- and microbiome-dependent metabolite interventions on heart failure and its risk factors in clinical trials in the future.Copyright © 2022 Luo, Hu, Chen, Luo, Chen and Wang."

"35765100","Development and validation of a trans-ancestry polygenic risk score for type 2 diabetes in diverse populations.","Genome Med","Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a worldwide scourge caused by both genetic and environmental risk factors that disproportionately afflicts communities of color. Leveraging existing large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS), polygenic risk scores (PRS) have shown promise to complement established clinical risk factors and intervention paradigms, and improve early diagnosis and prevention of T2D. However, to date, T2D PRS have been most widely developed and validated in individuals of European descent. Comprehensive assessment of T2D PRS in non-European populations is critical for equitable deployment of PRS to clinical practice that benefits global populations.We integrated T2D GWAS in European, African, and East Asian populations to construct a trans-ancestry T2D PRS using a newly developed Bayesian polygenic modeling method, and assessed the prediction accuracy of the PRS in the multi-ethnic Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) study (11,945 cases; 57,694 controls), four Black cohorts (5137 cases; 9657 controls), and the Taiwan Biobank (4570 cases; 84,996 controls). We additionally evaluated a post hoc ancestry adjustment method that can express the polygenic risk on the same scale across ancestrally diverse individuals and facilitate the clinical implementation of the PRS in prospective cohorts.The trans-ancestry PRS was significantly associated with T2D status across the ancestral groups examined. The top 2% of the PRS distribution can identify individuals with an approximately 2.5-4.5-fold of increase in T2D risk, which corresponds to the increased risk of T2D for first-degree relatives. The post hoc ancestry adjustment method eliminated major distributional differences in the PRS across ancestries without compromising its predictive performance.By integrating T2D GWAS from multiple populations, we developed and validated a trans-ancestry PRS, and demonstrated its potential as a meaningful index of risk among diverse patients in clinical settings. Our efforts represent the first step towards the implementation of the T2D PRS into routine healthcare.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35749303","ALDH2 variance in disease and populations.","Dis Model Mech","The ALDH2*2 missense variant that commonly causes alcohol flushing reactions is the single genetic polymorphism associated with the largest number of traits in humans. The dysfunctional ALDH2 variant affects nearly 8% of the world population and is highly concentrated among East Asians. Carriers of the ALDH2*2 variant commonly present alterations in a number of blood biomarkers, clinical measurements, biometrics, drug prescriptions, dietary habits and lifestyle behaviors, and they are also more susceptible to aldehyde-associated diseases, such as cancer and cardiovascular disease. However, the interaction between alcohol and ALDH2-related pathology is not clearly delineated. Furthermore, genetic evidence indicates that the ALDH2*2 variant has been favorably selected for in the past 2000-3000 years. It is therefore necessary to consider the disease risk and mechanism associated with ALDH2 deficiency, and to understand the possible beneficial or protective effect conferred by ALDH2 deficiency and whether the pleiotropic effects of ALDH2 variance are all mediated by alcohol use.© 2022.

"35730565","Blocking cell cycle progression through CDK4/6 protects against chronic kidney disease.","JCI Insight","Acute and chronic kidney injuries induce increased cell cycle progression in renal tubules. While increased cell cycle progression promotes repair after acute injury, the role of ongoing tubular cell cycle progression in chronic kidney disease is unknown. Two weeks after initiation of chronic kidney disease, we blocked cell cycle progression at G1/S phase by using an FDA-approved, selective inhibitor of CDK4/6. Blocking CDK4/6 improved renal function and reduced tubular injury and fibrosis in 2 murine models of chronic kidney disease. However, selective deletion of cyclin D1, which complexes with CDK4/6 to promote cell cycle progression, paradoxically increased tubular injury. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) for CCND1 (cyclin D1) and the CDK4/6 inhibitor CDKN2B were associated with eGFR in genome-wide association studies. Consistent with the preclinical studies, reduced expression of CDKN2B correlated with lower eGFR values, and higher levels of CCND1 correlated with higher eGFR values. CDK4/6 inhibition promoted tubular cell survival, in part, through a STAT3/IL-1β pathway and was dependent upon on its effects on the cell cycle. Our data challenge the paradigm that tubular cell cycle progression is beneficial in the context of chronic kidney injury. Unlike the reparative role of cell cycle progression following acute kidney injury, these data suggest that blocking cell cycle progression by inhibiting CDK4/6, but not cyclin D1, protects against chronic kidney injury."

Despite a fundamental understanding of genetic (or environmental) contributions, the detailed mechanisms of how genetic variation impacts molecular or cellular behaviours of a gene, and subsequently leads to such variability remain poorly understood.Here, in addition to phenome-wide correlations, we leveraged multiomics to exploit mechanistic links, from genetic polymorphism to protein structural or functional changes and a cross-omics perturbation landscape of a germline variant.We identified a missense cis-acting expression quantitative trait locus in CLEC18A (rs75776403) in which the altered residue (T151→M151) disrupts the lipid-binding ability of the protein domain. The altered allele carriage led to a metabolic and proliferative shift, as well as immune deactivation, therefore determines human anthropometrics (body height), kidney, and hematological traits.Collectively, we uncovered genetic pleiotropy in human complex traits and diseases via CLEC18A rs75776403-regulated pathways.© 2022.

Antibodies to HNA-3 can be generated following blood transfusion or other factors resulting in exposure to HNA-3 antigens. These antibodies can cause transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) or neonatal alloimmune neutropenia (NAIN). This study describes a sensitive and specific TaqMan real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method to screen for the HNA-3 genotype using specific primers and probes designed to detect allelic polymorphisms. Considering the high sensitivity and accuracy of droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) in the identification of the rareSLC44A2*2allele, we used this technique to identify blood donors with the rare HNA-3B antigen and calculate the allele frequency ofSLC44A2in mixed populations with different proportions.Methods:DNA samples purified from 208 donors in northwest China were subjected to TaqMan real-time PCR to detect allelic polymorphisms inSLC44A2. The results were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. The rare HNA-3B antigen was detected by ddPCR.SLC44A2frequency was determined by two-channel ddPCR.Results:The genotypes of all DNA samples were detected by the TaqMan real-time PCR using specific probes for HNA-3, and the results were consistent with the Sanger sequencing results in respect to the HNA-3A and HNA-3B polymorphisms. The allele frequencies ofSLC44A2*1andSLC44A2*2in the 208 donors in northwest China were 64.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 59%-70.8%) and 35.1% (95% CI, 29.2%-41%), respectively. The ratio ofSLC44A2*2alleles was accurately detected in all blood pools by ddPCR but not by TaqMan real-time PCR. This allowed for theSLC44A2frequency in the population to be accurately inferred.Conclusion:This new method of detectingSLC44A2alleles was highly sensitive and specific, as confirmed by Sanger sequencing. ddPCR using the designed probes resulted in successful detection of the rare HNA-3B antigen.

Cortical neurons are born during embryonic development, and their maturation extends into postnatal life. The regulatory strategies underlying progressive neuronal development and maturation remain unclear. Here we present an integrated single-cell epigenomic and transcriptional analysis of individual mouse and marmoset cortical neuron classes, spanning both early postmitotic stages of identity acquisition and later stages of neuronal plasticity and circuit integration. We found that, in both species, the regulatory strategies controlling early and late stages of pan-neuronal development diverge. Early postmitotic neurons use more widely shared and evolutionarily conserved molecular regulatory programs. In contrast, programs active during later neuronal maturation are more brain- and neuron-specific and more evolutionarily divergent. Our work uncovers a temporal shift in regulatory choices during neuronal diversification and maturation in both mice and marmosets, which likely reflects unique evolutionary constraints on distinct events of neuronal development in the neocortex.© 2022.

The causes of neuroinflammation can be roughly divided into the following domains: viral infection, autoimmune disease, inflammation from peripheral organs, mental stress, metabolic disorders, and lifestyle. In particular, the effects of neuroinflammation caused by inflammation of peripheral organs have yet unclear mechanisms. Many diseases, such as gastrointestinal inflammation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, rheumatoid arthritis, dermatitis, chronic fatigue syndrome, or myalgic encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME), trigger neuroinflammation through several pathways. The mechanisms of action for peripheral inflammation-induced neuroinflammation include disruption of the blood-brain barrier, activation of glial cells associated with systemic immune activation, and effects on autonomic nerves via the organ-brain axis. In this review, we consider previous studies on the relationship between systemic inflammation and neuroinflammation, focusing on the brain regions susceptible to inflammation.Copyright © 2022 Sun, Koyama and Shimada."

We test our method on real and synthetic data and find that the incorporation of related auxiliary clinical outcomes can: 1) significantly improve the TTE prediction performance of conventional Cox model while maintaining its interpretability; 2) further improve the performance of the state-of-the-art deep learning based models. While the auxiliary outcomes are utilized for model training, the model deployment is not limited by the availability of the auxiliary outcome data because the auxiliary outcome information is not required for the prediction of the primary outcome once the model is trained."

The ANN model was trained and tested on an 75/25 split of the dataset. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, area under the curve (AUC) and sensitivity were used to evaluate and compare the ANN model with the random forest model.For distant metastasis in the whole cohort, the ANN model had metrics AUC = 0.759, accuracy = 0.669, sensitivity = 0.906, and specificity = 0.613, which was better than the random forest model. For organ-specific metastasis in the cohort with distant metastasis, the sensitivity in bone metastasis, brain metastasis and liver metastasis were 0.913, 0.906 and 0.925, respectively. The most important variable was separate tumor nodules with 100% importance. The second important variable was visceral pleural invasion for distant metastasis, while histology for organ-specific metastasis.Our study developed a ""two-step"" ANN model for predicting synchronous organ-specific metastasis in LC patients. This ANN model may provide clinicians with more personalized clinical decisions, contribute to rationalize metastasis screening, and reduce the burden on patients and the health care system.Copyright © 2022 Gao, He, Du, Wang and Xiang."

We evaluate user satisfaction and validated the performance accuracy of the SDS in medical staff and patients.The SDS was developed to investigate pain and related psychological issues in patients with spinal diseases based on the pain questionnaire protocol. We recognized patients' various answers, summarized important information, and documented them. User satisfaction and performance accuracy were evaluated in 30 potential users of SDS, including doctors, nurses, and patients and statistically analyzed.The overall satisfaction score of 30 patients was 5.5 ± 1.4 out of 7 points. Satisfaction scores were 5.3 ± 0.8 for doctors, 6.0 ± 0.6 for nurses, and 5.3 ± 0.5 for patients. In terms of performance accuracy, the number of repetitions of the same question was 13, 16, and 33 (13.5%, 16.8%, and 34.7%) for doctors, nurses, and patients, respectively. The number of errors in the summarized comment by the SDS was 5, 0, and 11 (5.2%, 0.0%, and 11.6 %), respectively. The number of summarization omissions was 7, 5, and 7 (7.3%, 5.3%, and 7.4%), respectively.This is the first study in which voice-based conversational artificial intelligence (AI) was developed for a spinal pain questionnaire and validated by medical staff and patients. The conversational AI showed favorable results in terms of user satisfaction and performance accuracy. Conversational AI can be useful for the diagnosis and remote monitoring of various patients as well as for pain questionnaires in the future."
"35574400","Spherical Convolutional Neural Networks for Survival Rate Prediction in Cancer Patients.","Front Oncol","Survival Rate Prediction (SRP) is a valuable tool to assist in the clinical diagnosis and treatment planning of lung cancer patients. In recent years, deep learning (DL) based methods have shown great potential in medical image processing in general and SRP in particular. This study proposes a fully-automated method for SRP from computed tomography (CT) images, which combines an automatic segmentation of the tumor and a DL-based method for extracting rotational-invariant features.In the first stage, the tumor is segmented from the CT image of the lungs. Here, we use a deep-learning-based method that entails a variational autoencoder to provide more information to a U-Net segmentation model. Next, the 3D volumetric image of the tumor is projected onto 2D spherical maps. These spherical maps serve as inputs for a spherical convolutional neural network that approximates the log risk for a generalized Cox proportional hazard model.The proposed method is compared with 17 baseline methods that combine different feature sets and prediction models using three publicly-available datasets: Lung1 (n=422), Lung3 (n=89), and H&N1 (n=136). We observed comparable C-index scores compared to the best-performing baseline methods in a 5-fold cross-validation on Lung1 (0.59 ± 0.03 vs. 0.62 ± 0.04). In comparison, it slightly outperforms all methods in inter-data set evaluation (0.64 vs. 0.63). The best-performing method from the first experiment reduced its performance to 0.61 and 0.62 for Lung3 and H&N1, respectively.The experiments suggest that the performance of spherical features is comparable with previous approaches, but they generalize better when applied to unseen datasets. That might imply that orientation-independent shape features are relevant for SRP. The performance of the proposed method was very similar, using manual and automatic segmentation methods. This makes the proposed model useful in cases where expert annotations are not available or difficult to obtain.Copyright © 2022 Sinzinger, Astaraki, Smedby and Moreno."
"35918402","Targeted inhibition of ubiquitin signaling reverses metabolic reprogramming and suppresses glioblastoma growth.","Commun Biol","Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most frequent and aggressive form of primary brain tumor in the adult population; its high recurrence rate and resistance to current therapeutics urgently demand a better therapy. Regulation of protein stability by the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) represents an important control mechanism of cell growth. UPS deregulation is mechanistically linked to the development and progression of a variety of human cancers, including GBM. Thus, the UPS represents a potentially valuable target for GBM treatment. Using an integrated approach that includes proteomics, transcriptomics and metabolic profiling, we identify praja2, a RING E3 ubiquitin ligase, as the key component of a signaling network that regulates GBM cell growth and metabolism. Praja2 is preferentially expressed in primary GBM lesions expressing the wild-type isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 gene (IDH1). Mechanistically, we found that praja2 ubiquitylates and degrades the kinase suppressor of Ras 2 (KSR2). As a consequence, praja2 restrains the activity of downstream AMP-dependent protein kinase in GBM cells and attenuates the oxidative metabolism. Delivery in the brain of siRNA targeting praja2 by transferrin-targeted self-assembling nanoparticles (SANPs) prevented KSR2 degradation and inhibited GBM growth, reducing the size of the tumor and prolonging the survival rate of treated mice. These data identify praja2 as an essential regulator of cancer cell metabolism, and as a potential therapeutic target to suppress GBM growth.© 2022. The Author(s)."

In comparison to mammalian studies, there are few reports of ovulation in Muscovy ducks, and the molecular mechanism of ovarian development remained unclear. In order to identify candidate genes and metabolites related to Muscovy duck follicular ovulation, the study combined Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) full-length transcriptome and metabolomics to analyze the differences in gene expression and metabolite accumulation in the ovaries between pre-ovulation (PO) and consecutive ovulation (CO) Muscovy ducks. 83 differentially accumulated metabolites (DAMs) were identified using metabolomics analysis, 33 of which are related to lipids. Combined with data from previous transcriptomic analyses found that DEGs and DAMs were particularly enriched in processes including the regulation of glycerophospholipid metabolism pathway, arachidonic acid metabolic pathway and the steroid biosynthetic pathway. In summary, the novel potential mechanisms that affect ovulation in Muscovy ducks may be related to lipid metabolism, and the findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of ovulation in waterfowl and will contribute to a better understanding of changes in the waterfowl ovarian development regulatory network.Copyright © 2022 Lin, Ge, Mei, Niu, Chen, Hou and Liu."

Moreover, reduced sequencing costs and improved long-read sequencing technology allows researchers to readily generate genomic resources for nonmodel species. Here, we apply Oxford Nanopore long-read sequencing and low-coverage (∼1x) whole genome short-read sequencing technology (Illumina) to assemble a genome and examine population genetics of an abundant tropical and subtropical fish, the hardhead silverside (Atherinomorus stipes). These fish are found in shallow coastal waters and are frequently included in ecological models because they serve as abundant prey for commercially and ecologically important species. Despite their importance in sub-tropical and tropical ecosystems, little is known about their population connectivity and genetic diversity. Our A. stipes genome assembly is about 1.2 Gb with comparable repetitive element content (∼47%), number of protein duplication events, and DNA methylation patterns to other teleost fish species. Among five sampled populations spanning 43 km of South Florida and the Florida Keys, we find little population structure suggesting high population connectivity.© The Author(s) 2022.

In this study, we used mixtures of mitochondrial samples with different haplogroups (i.e., a specific set of mitochondrial variants) to investigate the applicability of nanopore sequencing for low-frequency single nucleotide variant detection.Methods:We investigated the impact of base-calling, alignment/mapping, quality control steps, and variant calling by comparing the results to a previously derived short-read gold standard generated on the Illumina NextSeq. For nanopore sequencing, six mixtures of four different haplotypes were prepared, allowing us to reliably check for expected variants at the predefined 5%, 2%, and 1% mixture levels. We used two different versions of Guppy for base-calling, two aligners (i.e., Minimap2 and Ngmlr), and three variant callers (i.e., Mutserve2, Freebayes, and Nanopanel2) to compare low-frequency variants. We used F1score measurements to assess the performance of variant calling.Results:We observed a mean read length of 11 kb and a mean overall read quality of 15. Ngmlr showed not only higher F1scores but also higher allele frequencies (AF) of false-positive calls across the mixtures (mean F1score = 0.83; false-positive allele frequencies < 0.17) compared to Minimap2 (mean F1score = 0.82; false-positive AF < 0.06). Mutserve2 had the highest F1scores (5% level: F1score >0.99, 2% level: F1score >0.54, and 1% level: F1score >0.70) across all callers and mixture levels.Conclusion:We here present the benchmarking for low-frequency variant calling with nanopore sequencing by identifying current limitations.Copyright © 2022 Lüth, Schaake, Grünewald, May, Trinh and Weissensteiner."

Here, we apply our recently developed Bayesian grouped mixture of regressions model (GMRM) in the UK and Estonian Biobanks and obtain the highest genomic prediction accuracy reported to date across 21 heritable traits. When compared to other approaches, GMRM accuracy was greater than annotation prediction models run in the LDAK or LDPred-funct software by 15% (SE 7%) and 14% (SE 2%), respectively, and was 18% (SE 3%) greater than a baseline BayesR model without single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers grouped into minor allele frequency-linkage disequilibrium (MAF-LD) annotation categories. For height, the prediction accuracyR2was 47% in a UK Biobank holdout sample, which was 76% of the estimated [Formula: see text]. We then extend our GMRM prediction model to provide mixed-linear model association (MLMA) SNP marker estimates for genome-wide association (GWAS) discovery, which increased the independent loci detected to 16,162 in unrelated UK Biobank individuals, compared to 10,550 from BoltLMM and 10,095 from Regenie, a 62 and 65% increase, respectively. The average [Formula: see text] value of the leading markers increased by 15.24 (SE 0.41) for every 1% increase in prediction accuracy gained over a baseline BayesR model across the traits. Thus, we show that modeling genetic associations accounting for MAF and LD differences among SNP markers, and incorporating prior knowledge of genomic function, is important for both genomic prediction and discovery in large-scale individual-level studies."

These individual genetic variants on their own typically confer a small effect of disease risk with limited predictive power; however, when aggregated (e.g.,viapolygenic risk score method), they could provide meaningful risk predictions for a myriad of diseases. In this review, we describe the recent advances in GWAS for autoimmune diseases and the practical application of this knowledge to predict an individual's susceptibility/severity for autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)viathe polygenic risk score method. We provide an overview of methods for deriving different polygenic risk scores and discuss the strategies to integrate additional information from correlated traits and diverse ancestries. We further advocate for the need to integrate clinical features (e.g., anti-nuclear antibody status) with genetic profiling to better identify patients at high risk of disease susceptibility/severity even before clinical signs or symptoms develop.

Standard clinical practice is radical orchidectomy of suspicious lumps followed by histopathological diagnosis and tumor subtyping. This practice can lead to complications and quality of life issues for the patients. Liquid biopsies, especially cell-free DNA (cfDNA), promised to be true surrogates for tissue biopsies, which are considered dangerous to perform in cases of testicular tumors. In this study, we have performed a systematic review on the potential of cfDNA in TGCT patient management, its potential challenges in translation to clinical application and possible approaches in further research.The review was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines on EuropePMC and PUBMED electronic databases, with the last update being on October 21, 2021. Due to the high heterogeneity in identified research articles, we have performed an overview of their efficacy.Eight original articles have been identified on cfDNA in TGCT patients published from 2004 to 2021, of which six had more than one TGCT patient enrolled and were included in the final analysis. Three studies investigated cfDNA methylation, one has investigated mutations in cfDNA, two have investigated cfDNA amount, and one has investigated cfDNA integrity in TGCT. The sensitivity of cfDNA for TGCT was found to be higher than in serum tumor markers and lower than miR-371a-3p, with comparable specificity. cfDNA methylation analysis has managed to accurately detect teratoma in TGCT patients.Potential challenges in cfDNA application to TGCT patient management were identified. The challenges relating to the biology of TGCT with its low mutational burden and low cfDNA amounts in blood plasma make next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods especially challenging. We have also proposed possible approaches to help find clinical application, including a focus on cfDNA methylation analysis, and potentially solving the challenge of teratoma detection.© The Author(s), 2022."

Here, we applied in-suspension Breaks Labeling In Situ and Sequencing (sBLISS), RNA-Seq, and Hi-C to chart the genomic landscape of DSBs and relate it to gene expression and genome architecture in 2D cultures of human neuroepithelial stem cells (NES), neural progenitor cells (NPC), and post-mitotic neural cells (NEU). Endogenous DSBs were enriched at the promoter and along the gene body of transcriptionally active genes, at the borders of topologically associating domains (TADs), and around chromatin loop anchors. NDD risk genes harbored significantly more DSBs in comparison to other protein-coding genes, especially in NEU cells. We provide sBLISS, RNA-Seq, and Hi-C datasets for each differentiation stage, and all the scripts needed to reproduce our analyses.

In this study, we analyze the methylation status and the gene expression ofSPG20in different tumors of various histological origins.We analyzed the data generated through Infinium Human Methylation 450 BeadChip arrays and RNA-seq approaches extrapolated from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. The statistics were performed with R 4.0.4.We aimed to assess whether the hypermethylation of this target gene was a common characteristic among different tumors and if there was a correlation between the m-values and the gene expression in paired tumor versus solid tissue normal. Overall, our analysis highlighted thatSPG20open sea upstream the TSS is altogether hypermethylated, and the tumor tissues display a higher methylation heterogeneity compared to the solid tissue normal. The gene expression evidences a reproducible, higher gene expression in normal tissues.Our research, based on data mining from TCGA, evidences that colon and liver tumors display a consistent methylation heterogeneity compared to their normal counterparts. This parallels a downregulation ofSPG20gene expression in tumor samples and suggests a role for this multifunctional protein in the control of tumor progression."

Not only innate system cells, such as macrophages, monocytes, and natural killer cells, but also bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) have been found to gain memories upon transient stimulation, leading to the enhancement of responses to secondary challenges. Various stimuli, including microbial infection, can induce the epigenetic reprogramming of innate immune cells and HSCs, which can result in an augmented response to secondary stimulation. In this review, we introduce novel NGS technologies and their application to unraveling epigenetic memories that are key in trained immunity and summarize the recent findings in trained immunity.

Liquid biopsies have been proposed as a novel method for the early detection of cancer, but low cell-free DNA tumor fraction might pose a problem for the use in population screening. Using breast cancer microsimulation model MISCAN-Fadia, we estimated the outcomes of using liquid biopsies in breast cancer screening in women aged 50 to 74 in the United States. For varying combinations of test sensitivity and specificity, we quantify the impact of the use of liquid biopsies on the harms and benefits of screening, and we estimate the maximum liquid biopsy price for cost-effective implementation in breast cancer screening at a cost-effectiveness threshold of USD 50,000. We investigate under what conditions liquid biopsies could be a suitable alternative to digital mammography and compare these conditions to a CCGA substudy. Outcomes were compared to digital mammography screening, and include mortality reduction, overdiagnoses, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and the maximum price of a liquid biopsy for cost-effective implementation. When liquid biopsies are unable to detect DCIS, a large proportion of overdiagnosed cases is prevented but overall breast cancer mortality reduction and quality of life are lower, and costs are higher compared to digital mammography screening. Liquid biopsies prices should be restricted to USD 187 per liquid biopsy depending on test performance. Overall, liquid biopsies that are unable to detect ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) need to be able to detect small, early-stage tumors, with high specificity, at low costs in order to be an alternative to digital mammography. Liquid biopsies might be more suitable as an addition to digital mammography than as an alternative."

"35865874","Identification of <i>TRAPPC9</i> and <i>BAIAP2</i> Gene Polymorphisms and Their Association With Fat Deposition-Related Traits in Hu Sheep.","Front Vet Sci","Fat deposition is an important economic trait that is closely related to feed efficiency and carcass performance in livestock. In this study, the fat deposition-related traits of 1,293 Hu sheep were measured and descriptive statistical analysis was conducted. The results showed that the coefficient of variation of all fat deposition-related traits was higher than 24%. In addition, single nucleotide polymorphisms and the expression characteristics ofTRAPPC9(encoding trafficking protein particle complex subunit 9) andBAIAP2(encoding brain-specific Angiogenesis inhibitor 1-associated protein 2) genes in Hu sheep were detected using PCR amplification, Sanger sequencing, KASPar genotyping, and quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). The associations between SNPs and fat deposition-related traits were also analyzed. Two intronic mutations,TRAPPC9g.57654 A > G andBAIAP2g.46061 C > T, were identified in Hu sheep. The result of association analysis showed thatTRAPPC9g.57654 A > G andBAIAP2g.46061 C > T were both significantly associated with the weight of tail fat, tail fat relative weight (body weight), and tail fat relative weight (carcass) (P< 0.05). Comprehensive effects analysis showed that there were significant differences between the combined genotypes and tail fat and perirenal fat deposition. Moreover, qRT-PCR analysis showed thatTRAPPC9andBAIAP2are widely expressed, and their expression levels were significantly higher in the small-tail group compared with those in the big-tail group (P< 0.01). These results provided important candidate molecular markers that could be used in strategies to reduce tail fat deposition in Hu sheep.Copyright © 2022 Cui, Wang, Zhang, Li, Huang, Ma, Wang, Zhao, Zhang, Yang, Xu, Cheng, Li, Zeng, Zhao, Li, Wang, Lin, Zhou, Liu, Zhai and Zhang."
"35759118","Modern Biomarkers for Autism Spectrum Disorder: Future Directions.","Mol Diagn Ther","Autism spectrum disorder is an increasingly prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder in the world today, with an estimated 2% of the population being affected in the USA. A major complicating factor in diagnosing, treating, and understanding autism spectrum disorder is that defining the disorder is solely based on the observation of behavior. Thus, recent research has focused on identifying specific biological abnormalities in autism spectrum disorder that can provide clues to diagnosis and treatment. Biomarkers are an objective way to identify and measure biological abnormalities for diagnostic purposes as well as to measure changes resulting from treatment. This current opinion paper discusses the state of research of various biomarkers currently in development for autism spectrum disorder. The types of biomarkers identified include prenatal history, genetics, neurological including neuroimaging, neurophysiologic, and visual attention, metabolic including abnormalities in mitochondrial, folate, trans-methylation, and trans-sulfuration pathways, immune including autoantibodies and cytokine dysregulation, autonomic nervous system, and nutritional. Many of these biomarkers have promising preliminary evidence for prenatal and post-natal pre-symptomatic risk assessment, confirmation of diagnosis, subtyping, and treatment response. However, most biomarkers have not undergone validation studies and most studies do not investigate biomarkers with clinically relevant comparison groups. Although the field of biomarker research in autism spectrum disorder is promising, it appears that it is currently in the early stages of development.© 2022. The Author(s)."

The single nucleotide polymorphism located in the 3'UTR ofMANBA, rs7665090, was found to be associated with multiple sclerosis (MS) susceptibility. We aimed to study the functional impact of this polymorphism in lymphocytes isolated from MS patients and healthy controls. A total of 152 MS patients and 112 controls were genotyped for rs7665090.MANBAmRNA expression was quantified through qPCR and MANBA enzymatic activity was analyzed. Upon phytohemagglutinin stimulation, immune activation was evaluated by flow cytometry detection of CD69, endocytic function, and metabolic rates with Seahorse XFp Analyzer, and results were stratified by variation in rs7665090. A significantly reduced gene expression (p&lt; 0.0001) and enzymatic activity (p= 0.018) of MANBA were found in lymphocytes of MS patients compared to those of controls. The rs7665090*GG genotype led to a significant β-mannosidase enzymatic deficiency correlated with lysosomal dysfunction, as well as decreased metabolic activation in lymphocytes of MS patients compared to those of rs7665090*GG controls. In contrast, lymphocytes of MS patients and controls carrying the homozygous AA genotype behaved similarly. Our work provides new evidence highlighting the impact of the MS-risk variant, rs7665090, and the role ofMANBAin the immunopathology of MS."

It can play an important role in the pathophysiological mechanisms of various diseases. In this regard, different studies have shown that there is a relationship between Melatonin and Multiple Sclerosis (MS). MS is a chronic immune-mediated disease of the Central Nervous System.The objective of this review was to evaluate the mechanisms of action of melatonin on oxidative stress, inflammation and intestinal dysbiosis caused by MS, as well as its interaction with different hormones and factors that can influence the pathophysiology of the disease.Melatonin causes a significant increase in the levels of catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione and can counteract and inhibit the effects of the NLRP3 inflammasome, which would also be beneficial during SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, melatonin increases antimicrobial peptides, especially Reg3β, which could be useful in controlling the microbiota.Melatonin could exert a beneficial effect in people suffering from MS, running as a promising candidate for the treatment of this disease. However, more research in human is needed to help understand the possible interaction between melatonin and certain sex hormones, such as estrogens, to know the potential therapeutic efficacy in both men and women.© 2022.

"35741732","High Resolution Analysis of <i>DMPK</i> Hypermethylation and Repeat Interruptions in Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1.","Genes (Basel)","Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a multisystemic neuromuscular disorder caused by the expansion of a CTG repeat in the 3'-UTR ofDMPK, which is transcribed to a toxic gain-of-function RNA that affects splicing of a range of genes. The expanded repeat is unstable in both germline and somatic cells. The variable age at disease onset and severity of symptoms have been linked to the inherited CTG repeat length, non-CTG interruptions, and methylation levels flanking the repeat. In general, the genetic biomarkers are investigated separately with specific methods, making it tedious to obtain an overall characterisation of the repeat for a given individual. In the present study, we employed Oxford nanopore sequencing in a pilot study to simultaneously determine the repeat lengths, investigate the presence and nature of repeat interruptions, and quantify methylation levels in the regions flanking the CTG-repeats in four patients with DM1. We determined the repeat lengths, and in three patients, we observed interruptions which were not detected using repeat-primed PCR. Interruptions may thus be more common than previously anticipated and should be investigated in larger cohorts. Allele-specific analyses enabled characterisation of aberrant methylation levels specific to the expanded allele, which greatly increased the sensitivity and resolved cases where the methylation levels were ambiguous."
"35758797","An approachable, flexible and practical machine learning workshop for biologists.","Bioinformatics","The increasing prevalence and importance of machine learning in biological research have created a need for machine learning training resources tailored towards biological researchers. However, existing resources are often inaccessible, infeasible or inappropriate for biologists because they require significant computational and mathematical knowledge, demand an unrealistic time-investment or teach skills primarily for computational researchers. We created the Machine Learning for Biologists (ML4Bio) workshop, a short, intensive workshop that empowers biological researchers to comprehend machine learning applications and pursue machine learning collaborations in their own research. The ML4Bio workshop focuses on classification and was designed around three principles: (i) emphasizing preparedness over fluency or expertise, (ii) necessitating minimal coding and mathematical background and (iii) requiring low time investment. It incorporates active learning methods and custom open-source software that allows participants to explore machine learning workflows. After multiple sessions to improve workshop design, we performed a study on three workshop sessions. Despite some confusion around identifying subtle methodological flaws in machine learning workflows, participants generally reported that the workshop met their goals, provided them with valuable skills and knowledge and greatly increased their beliefs that they could engage in research that uses machine learning. ML4Bio is an educational tool for biological researchers, and its creation and evaluation provide valuable insight into tailoring educational resources for active researchers in different domains.Workshop materials are available at https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/ml4bio-workshop and the ml4bio software is available at https://github.com/gitter-lab/ml4bio.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.© The Author(s) 2022.

Recent developments in assay technologies and machine learning (ML) methods have led to significant improvements in predictive performance. However, most high-performing ML methods suffer from complex architectures and lack interpretability.We present the application of a novel symbolic-regression-based algorithm, the QLattice, on a selection of clinical omics datasets. This approach generates parsimonious high-performing models that can both predict disease outcomes and reveal putative disease mechanisms, demonstrating the importance of selecting maximally relevant and minimally redundant features in omics-based machine-learning applications.

"35847949","Prediction of Gastric Cancer-Related Genes Based on the Graph Transformer Network.","Front Oncol","Gastric cancer is a complex multifactorial and multistage process that involves a large number of tumor-related gene structural changes and abnormal expression. Therefore, knowing the related genes of gastric cancer can further understand the pathogenesis of gastric cancer and provide guidance for the development of targeted drugs. Traditional methods to discover gastric cancer-related genes based on biological experiments are time-consuming and expensive. In recent years, a large number of computational methods have been developed to identify gastric cancer-related genes. In addition, a large number of experiments show that establishing a biological network to identify disease-related genes has higher accuracy than ordinary methods. However, most of the current computing methods focus on the processing of homogeneous networks, and do not have the ability to encode heterogeneous networks. In this paper, we built a heterogeneous network using a disease similarity network and a gene interaction network. We implemented the graph transformer network (GTN) to encode this heterogeneous network. Meanwhile, the deep belief network (DBN) was applied to reduce the dimension of features. We call this method ""DBN-GTN"", and it performed best among four traditional methods and five similar methods.Copyright © 2022 Chen, Sun and Yang."

We use exome sequences from 362,679 individuals to identify genes associated with waist-to-hip ratio adjusted for BMI (WHRadjBMI), a surrogate for abdominal fat that is causally linked to type 2 diabetes and coronary heart disease. Predicted loss of function (pLOF) variants in INHBE associate with lower WHRadjBMI and this association replicates in data from AMP-T2D-GENES. INHBE encodes a secreted protein, the hepatokine activin E. In vitro characterization of the most common INHBE pLOF variant in our study, indicates an in-frame deletion resulting in a 90% reduction in secreted protein levels. We detect associations with lower WHRadjBMI for variants in ACVR1C, encoding an activin receptor, further highlighting the involvement of activins in regulating fat distribution. These findings highlight activin E as a potential therapeutic target for abdominal obesity, a phenotype linked to cardiometabolic disease.© 2022. The Author(s)."

As a result, blood-based biomarkers are increasingly being sought as alternatives. In this study, we aimed to evaluate a promising blood biomarker discovery technology, Olink Proximity Extension Assays for technical reproducibility characteristics in order to highlight the advantages and disadvantages of using this technology in biomarker discovery in AD. We evaluated the performance of five Olink Proteomic multiplex proximity extension assays (PEA) in plasma samples. Three technical control samples included on each plate allowed calculation of technical variability. Biotemporal stability was measured in three sequential annual samples from 54 individuals with and without AD. Coefficients of variation (CVs), analysis of variance (ANOVA), and variance component analyses were used to quantify technical and individual variation over time. We show that overall, Olink assays are technically robust, with the largest experimental variation stemming from biological differences between individuals for most analytes. As a powerful illustration of one of the potential pitfalls of using a multi-plexed technology for discovery, we performed power calculations using the baseline samples to demonstrate the size of study required to overcome the need for multiple test correction with this technology. We show that the power of moderate effect size proteins was strongly reduced, and as a result investigators should strongly consider pooling resources to perform larger studies using this multiplexed technique where possible.Copyright © 2022 Carlyle, Kitchen, Mattingly, Celia, Trombetta, Das, Hyman, Kivisäkk and Arnold."

To examine the stomach and fecal microbiome's potential roles, fecal samples from 44 offspring and stomach samples from offspring and their fathers were collected and bacterial community composition was studied by 16 small subunit ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) gene sequencing. Paternal diet (control, high-fat), maternal housing conditions (standard or semi-naturalistic housing), and maternal care (quality of nursing and other maternal behaviors) affected the within-subjects alpha-diversity of the offspring stomach and fecal microbiomes. We provide evidence from beta-diversity analyses that paternal diet and maternal behavior induced community-wide shifts to the adult offspring gut microbiome. Additionally, we show that paternal HFD significantly altered the adult offspring Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio, an indicator of obesogenic potential in the gut microbiome. Additional machine-learning analyses indicated that microbial species driving these differences converged on Bifidobacterium pseudolongum. These results suggest that differences in early-life care induced by paternal diet and maternal care significantly influence the microbiota composition of offspring through the microbiota-gut-brain axis, having implications for adult stress reactivity.© 2022.

"35670836","ZMIZ proteins: partners in transcriptional regulation and risk factors for human disease.","J Mol Med (Berl)","Coregulator proteins interact with signal-dependent transcription factors to modify their transcriptional activity. ZMIZ1 and ZMIZ2 (zinc finger MIZ-type containing 1 and 2) are coregulators with nonredundant functions that share unique structural characteristics. Among other interacting domains, they possess a MIZ (Msx-interacting zinc finger) that relates them to members of the protein inhibitor of activated STAT (PIAS) family and provides them the capacity to function as SUMO E3 ligases. The ZMIZ proteins stimulate the activity of various signaling pathways, including the androgen receptor (AR), P53, SMAD3/4, WNT/β-catenin, and NOTCH1 pathways, and interact with the BAF chromatin remodeling complex. Due to their molecular versatility, ZMIZ proteins have pleiotropic effects and thus are important for embryonic development and for human diseases. Both have been widely associated with cancer, and ZMIZ1 has been very frequently identified as a risk allele for several autoimmune conditions and other disorders. Moreover, mutations in the coding region of the ZMIZ1 gene are responsible for a severe syndromic neurodevelopmental disability. Because the actions of coregulators are highly gene-specific, a better knowledge of the associations that exist between the function of the ZMIZ coregulators and human pathologies is expected to potentiate the use of ZMIZ1 and ZMIZ2 as new drug targets for diseases such as hormone-dependent cancers.© 2022.

We focus on an sncRNA signature enriched in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) to develop a plasma exosome-based noninvasive biomarker for human ACLF.In this work, sncRNAs related to HBV-ACLF were identified by small RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) in plasma exosomes collected from 3 normal subjects, 4 chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients with flare, and 6 HBV-ACLF patients in the discovery cohort. Thereafter, the differentially expressed sncRNAs were further verified in a validation cohort (n = 313) using the newly developed molecular signature incorporating different mi/ts/rsRNAs (named as MTR-RNAs) through qRT-PCR assays. Subsequently, using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression (LR) model analysis, we developed an MTR-RNA classifier for early detection of ACLF.The identified sncRNAs (hsa-miR-23b-3p, hsa-miR-223-3p, hsa-miR-339-5p, tsRNA-20, tsRNA-46, and rsRNA-249) were specifically differentially expressed in plasma exosomes of HBV-ACLF. The MTR-RNA signature (AUC = 0.787) containing the above sncRNAs distinguished HBV-ACLF cases among normal subjects with 71.67% specificity and 74.29% sensitivity, CHB patients with flare (AUC = 0.694, 85.71% sensitivity/59.5% specificity), and patients with CHB/cirrhosis (AUC = 0.785, 57.14% sensitivity/94.59% specificity). Notably, it revealed 100% specificity/94.80% sensitivity in detecting patients or normal people.Our as-constructed plasma-derived exosomal sncRNA signature can serve as a reliable biomarker for ACLF detection and also be adopted to be the pre-triage biomarker for selecting cases that can gain benefits from adjuvant treatment.Copyright © 2022 Xu, Yu, Wu, Jie, Li, Zeng, Yang and Chong."

Studies have shown that RNA modifications, the novel post-transcriptional regulators, are involved in spermatogenesis, and hypoxia-induced alterations in RNA modification in testes and sperm cells may be associated with impaired spermatogenesis in mice. However, the molecular mechanisms via which RNA modifications influence spermatogenesis under hypoxic stress conditions are unclear. In this study, we generated a mouse Germ Cell-2 spermatid (GC-2spd) hypoxia model by culturing cells in a 1% O2incubator for 48 h or treating them with CoCl2for 24 h. The hypoxia treatment significantly inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in GC-2spd cells. The RNA modification signatures of total RNAs (2 types) and differentially sized RNA fragments (7 types of approximately 80 nt-sized tRNAs; 9 types of 17-50 nt-sized sncRNAs) were altered, and tRNA stability was partially affected. Moreover, the expression profiles of sncRNAs, such as microRNAs, tsRNAs, rsRNAs, and ysRNAs, were significantly regulated, and this might be related to the alterations in RNA modification and subsequent transcriptomic changes. We comprehensively analyzed alterations in RNA modification signatures in total RNAs, tRNAs (approximately 80 nt), and small RNAs (17-50 nt) as well as the expression profiles of sncRNAs and transcriptomes in hypoxia-treated GC-2spd cells; our data suggested that RNA modifications may be involved in cellular responses under hypoxic stress conditions and could provide a basis for a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying male infertility.Copyright © 2022 He, Guo, Xia, Shen, Huang, Wu, Jiang, Xu, Tan, Zhang and Tan."

"35874511","A Sedentary and Unhealthy Lifestyle Fuels Chronic Disease Progression by Changing Interstitial Cell Behaviour: A Network Analysis.","Front Physiol","Managing chronic diseases, such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes, chronic lung disease and Alzheimer's disease, account for a large proportion of health care spending, yet they remain in the top causes of premature mortality and are preventable. It is currently accepted that an unhealthy lifestyle fosters a state of chronic low-grade inflammation that is linked to chronic disease progression. Although this is known to be related to inflammatory cytokines, how an unhealthy lifestyle causes cytokine release and how that in turn leads to chronic disease progression are not well known. This article presents a theory that an unhealthy lifestyle fosters chronic disease by changing interstitial cell behavior and is supported by a six-level hierarchical network analysis. The top three networks include the macroenvironment, social and cultural factors, and lifestyle itself. The fourth network includes the immune, autonomic and neuroendocrine systems and how they interact with lifestyle factors and with each other. The fifth network identifies the effects these systems have on the microenvironment and two types of interstitial cells: macrophages and fibroblasts. Depending on their behaviour, these cells can either help maintain and restore normal function or foster chronic disease progression. When macrophages and fibroblasts dysregulate, it leads to chronic low-grade inflammation, fibrosis, and eventually damage to parenchymal (organ-specific) cells. The sixth network considers how macrophages change phenotype. Thus, a pathway is identified through this hierarchical network to reveal how external factors and lifestyle affect interstitial cell behaviour. This theory can be tested and it needs to be tested because, if correct, it has profound implications. Not only does this theory explain how chronic low-grade inflammation causes chronic disease progression, it also provides insight into salutogenesis, or the process by which health is maintained and restored. Understanding low-grade inflammation as a stalled healing process offers a new strategy for chronic disease management. Rather than treating each chronic disease separately by a focus on parenchymal pathology, a salutogenic strategy of optimizing interstitial health could prevent and mitigate multiple chronic diseases simultaneously.Copyright © 2022 Huston."

Neurogenesis is a sophisticated and complex process by which neural stem cells differentiate into specialized brain cell types at specific times and regions of the brain. A growing body of evidence suggests that epigenetic mechanisms, such as histone modifications, allow the fine-tuning and coordination of spatiotemporal gene expressions during neurogenesis. Aberrant histone modifications contribute to the development of neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases.

As somatic KMT2D variants can be found in 5-10% of tumors a tumor predisposition in Kabuki syndrome is discussed. So far less than 20 patients with Kabuki syndrome and a concomitant malignancy have been published. Here we report on a female patient with Kabuki syndrome and a c.2558_2559delCT germline variant in KMT2D who developed an embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (ERMS) at 10 years. On tumor tissue we performed DNA-methylation profiling and exome sequencing (ES). Copy number analyses revealed aneuploidies typical for ERMS including (partial) gains of chromosomes 2, 3, 7, 8, 12, 15, and 20 and 3 focal deletions of chromosome 11p. DNA methylation profiling mapped the case to ERMS by a DNA methylation-based sarcoma classifier. Sequencing suggested gain of the wild-type KMT2D allele in the trisomy 12. Including our patient literature review identified 18 patients with Kabuki syndrome and a malignancy. Overall, the landscape of malignancies in patients with Kabuki syndrome was reminiscent of that of the pediatric population in general. Histopathological and molecular data were only infrequently reported and no report included next generation sequencing and/or DNA-methylation profiling. Although we found no strong arguments pointing towards KS as a tumor predisposition syndrome, based on the small numbers any relation cannot be fully excluded. Further planned studies including profiling of additional tumors and long term follow-up of KS-patients into adulthood could provide further insights.© 2022. The Author(s)."

However, less is known about infant PFAS exposures, primarily because the collection of infant serum samples is less common and frequently avoided. Cord blood samples are often preferred for chemical exposure assessments because this is thought to provide a good representation of infant serum concentrations, at least at the time of birth. In this paper, we will provide a statistical and probabilistic analysis of what can be expected for infants living in the US using NHANES from 2007 to 2008, which contains a rare subset of infant data. Regulatory efforts that require estimation of exposures among the very youth can be challenging, both because of a lack of data in general and because variability among this most vulnerable population can be uncertain. We report that US infant exposures are extremely common and that serum concentrations remain fairly constant, despite infant growth rates and relatively high caloric and fluid intake, with the possible exception of PFOS. Infant serum PFOS concentrations between months 1 and 3 are consistently higher than at less than one month, even though healthy infants at 1 and 2 months weigh more than they did at birth. This suggests that the babies are exposed to greater concentrations of PFOS after birth or that excretion kinetics differ for this PFAS."
"35561191","Driver gene detection through Bayesian network integration of mutation and expression profiles.","Bioinformatics","The identification of mutated driver genes and the corresponding pathways is one of the primary goals in understanding tumorigenesis at the patient level. Integration of multi-dimensional genomic data from existing repositories, e.g., The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), offers an effective way to tackle this issue. In this study, we aimed to leverage the complementary genomic information of individuals and create an integrative framework to identify cancer-related driver genes. Specifically, based on pinpointed differentially expressed genes, variants in somatic mutations and a gene interaction network, we proposed an unsupervised Bayesian network integration (BNI) method to detect driver genes and estimate the disease propagation at the patient and/or cohort levels. This new method first captures inherent structural information to construct a functional gene mutation network and then extracts the driver genes and their controlled downstream modules using the minimum cover subset method.Using other credible sources (e.g. Cancer Gene Census and Network of Cancer Genes), we validated the driver genes predicted by the BNI method in three TCGA pan-cancer cohorts. The proposed method provides an effective approach to address tumor heterogeneity faced by personalized medicine. The pinpointed drivers warrant further wet laboratory validation.The supplementary tables and source code can be obtained from https://xavieruniversityoflouisiana.sharefile.com/d-se6df2c8d0ebe4800a3030311efddafe5.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.© The Author(s) 2022.

"35867128","Assessment of the bi-directional relationship between blood mitochondrial DNA copy number and type 2 diabetes mellitus: a multivariable-adjusted regression and Mendelian randomisation study.","Diabetologia","Mitochondrial dysfunction, which can be approximated by blood mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNA-CN), has been implicated in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Thus far, however, insights from prospective cohort studies and Mendelian randomisation (MR) analyses on this relationship are limited. We assessed the association between blood mtDNA-CN and incident type 2 diabetes using multivariable-adjusted regression analyses, and the associations between blood mtDNA-CN and type 2 diabetes and BMI using bi-directional MR.Multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate the association between blood mtDNA-CN and incident type 2 diabetes in 285,967 unrelated European individuals from UK Biobank free of type 2 diabetes at baseline. Additionally, a cross-sectional analysis was performed to investigate the association between blood mtDNA-CN and BMI. We also assessed the potentially causal relationship between blood mtDNA-CN and type 2 diabetes (N=898,130 from DIAGRAM, N=215,654 from FinnGen) and BMI (N=681,275 from GIANT) using bi-directional two-sample MR.During a median follow-up of 11.87 years, 15,111 participants developed type 2 diabetes. Participants with a higher level of blood mtDNA-CN are at lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes (HR 0.90 [95% CI 0.89, 0.92]). After additional adjustment for BMI and other confounders, these results attenuated moderately and remained present. The multivariable-adjusted cross-sectional analyses showed that higher blood mtDNA-CN was associated with lower BMI (-0.12 [95% CI -0.14, -0.10]) kg/m2. In the bi-directional MR analyses, we found no evidence for causal associations between blood mtDNA-CN and type 2 diabetes, and blood mtDNA-CN and BMI in either direction.The results from the present study indicate that the observed association between low blood mtDNA-CN and higher risk of type 2 diabetes is likely not causal.© 2022.

"35755838","Infections and Pregnancy: Effects on Maternal and Child Health.","Front Cell Infect Microbiol","Pregnancy causes physiological and immunological adaptations that allow the mother and fetus to communicate with precision in order to promote a healthy pregnancy. At the same time, these adaptations may make pregnant women more susceptible to infections, resulting in a variety of pregnancy complications; those pathogens may also be vertically transmitted to the fetus, resulting in adverse pregnancy outcomes. Even though the placenta has developed a robust microbial defense to restrict vertical microbial transmission, certain microbial pathogens have evolved mechanisms to avoid the placental barrier and cause congenital diseases. Recent mechanistic studies have begun to uncover the striking role of the maternal microbiota in pregnancy outcomes. In this review, we discuss how microbial pathogens overcome the placental barrier to cause congenital diseases. A better understanding of the placental control of fetal infection should provide new insights into future translational research.Copyright © 2022 Kumar, Saadaoui and Al Khodor."

We previously described a plasma cell-free RNA panel that between 16 and 20 weeks of pregnancy had potential to predict spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB) ≤ 32 weeks caused by preterm labor (PTL) or preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM). The present study had three objectives:(1)estimate the RNA panel prognostic accuracy for PTL/PPROM ≤ 32 weeks in a larger series;(2)improve accuracy by adding clinical characteristics to the predictive model; and(3)examine the association of the RNA panel with preeclampsia. We studied 289 women from Memphis TN prospectively sampled 16.0-20.7 weeks and found: (1)PSME2andHsa-Let 7gwere differentially expressed in cases of PTL/PPROM ≤ 32 weeks and together provided fair predictive accuracy with AUC of 0.76; (2) combining the two RNAs with clinical characteristics improved good predictive accuracy for PTL/PPROM ≤ 32 weeks (AUC 0.83); (3)NAMPTandAPOA1were differentially expressed in women with 'early-onset preeclampsia' (EOP) and together provided good predictive accuracy with AUC of 0.89; and (4) combining the two RNAs with clinical characteristics provided excellent predictive accuracy (AUC 0.96). Our findings suggest an underlying common pathophysiological relationship between PTL/PPROM ≤ 32 weeks and EOP and open inroads for the prognostication of high-risk pregnancies."

Discovery of robust prognostic markers separating patients who recover from patients with persistent pain and disability is critical for developing patient-specific treatment strategies and conceiving novel approaches that benefit all patients. Given that chronic pain is a biopsychosocial process, this study aims to discover and validate a robust prognostic signature that measures across multiple dimensions in the same adolescent patient cohort with a computational analysis pipeline. This will facilitate risk stratification in adolescent patients with chronic MSK pain and more resourceful allocation of patients to costly and potentially burdensome multidisciplinary pain treatment approaches.Here we describe a multi-institutional effort to collect, curate and analyse a high dimensional data set including epidemiological, psychometric, quantitative sensory, brain imaging and biological information collected over the course of 12 months. The aim of this effort is to derive a multivariate model with strong prognostic power regarding the clinical course of adolescent MSK pain and function.The study complies with the National Institutes of Health policy on the use of a single internal review board (sIRB) for multisite research, with Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center Review Board as the reviewing IRB. Stanford's IRB is a relying IRB within the sIRB. As foreign institutions, the University of Toronto and The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids) are overseen by their respective ethics boards. All participants provide signed informed consent. We are committed to open-access publication, so that patients, clinicians and scientists have access to the study data and the signature(s) derived.

"35885518","Clinical Significance of Clonal Hematopoiesis of Indeterminate Potential in Hematology and Cardiovascular Disease.","Diagnostics (Basel)","Liquid profiling uses circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) for minimal invasive tumor mutational profiling from peripheral blood. The presence of somatic mutations in peripheral blood cells without further evidence of a hematologic neoplasm defines clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP). CHIP-mutations can be found in the cell-free DNA (cfDNA) of plasma, are a potential cause of false positive results in liquid profiling, and thus limit its usage in screening settings. Various strategies are in place to mitigate the effect of CHIP on the performance of ctDNA assays, but the detection of CHIP also represents a clinically significant incidental finding. The sequelae of CHIP comprise the risk of progression to a hematologic neoplasm including therapy-related myeloid neoplasms. While the hematological risk increases with the co-occurrence of unexplained blood count abnormalities, a number of non-hematologic diseases have independently been associated with CHIP. In particular, CHIP represents a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease such as atherosclerosis or heart failure. The management of CHIP requires an interdisciplinary setting and represents a new topic in the field of cardio-oncology. In the future, the information on CHIP may be taken into account for personalized therapy of cancer patients."

GDM, the most common metabolic disorder in pregnancy, can be considered the result of complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors. A critical point in this view is the identification of genes which are epigenetically modified under the influence of GDM. The melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R)gene plays a crucial role in nutritional health by suppressing appetite and participating in energy control regulation. The correlations between pregnant 'women's metabolic profiles and placental epigenetic modifications of this gene have been poorly investigated.The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of GDM and maternal clinical parameters at the third trimester of pregnancy to DNA methylation levels in the placenta at CpG sites ofMC4Rgene.Socio-demographic and clinical characteristics, Mediterranean diet adherence, smoking habits, and physical activity were assessed at the third trimester of pregnancy of 60 Caucasian pregnant women, of which 33 with GDM. Clinical parameters of the newborns were recorded at birth.MC4RDNA methylation on maternal and fetal sides of the placenta was analyzed using bisulfite pyrosequencing.MC4RDNA methylation levels at CpG1 and CpG2 were lower on the fetal side of the placenta in GDM-affected women than in non-GDM-affected recruits (p= 0.033). Moreover, DNA methylation levels on the maternal side at CpG1 were positively related to glucose concentration at 2-h oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). On the other hand, CpG2 DNA methylation was positively related to both 1-h and 2-h during OGTT. Maternal DNA methylation level at CpG2 was also associated with low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) at the third trimester of pregnancy (rho = 0.340,p< 0.05), while CpG1 methylation was negatively related to maternal weight variations at delivery (rho = -0.316,p< 0.05). Significant associations betweenMC4RDNA methylation on the maternal side and lipid profile at third trimester of pregnancy in women smokers were found.Our results suggest thatMC4Rmethylation profile in the placenta is related to maternal metabolic and nutritional conditions, potentially affecting fetal programming and the future metabolic health of the newborn.Copyright © 2022 Franzago, Porreca, D’Ardes, Di Nicola, Di Tizio, Liberati, Stuppia and Vitacolonna."

We compared the effects for alcohol consumption and PRS on CRC risk using the ""Genetic Risk Equivalent (GRE)"" for effective risk communication. Specific analyses were conducted for early-onset CRC (EOCRC, <55 years) and late-onset CRC (LOCRC, ≥55 years).High alcohol consumption, and to a lower extent, also alcohol abstinence were associated with increased CRC risk. Compared to low alcohol consumption (0·1-<25 g/d), lifetime average alcohol consumption ≥25 g/d was more strongly associated with EOCRC [odds ratio (OR) 1·8, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1·2-2·8] than with LOCRC risk (OR 1·3, 95% CI 1·1-1·4) (P-value for interaction with age =0·011). Interactions between alcohol consumption and PRS did not reach statistical significance for either EOCRC or LOCRC risk. The estimated impact of high lifetime alcohol consumption on EOCRC was equivalent to the effect of having 47 percentiles higher PRS (GRE 47, 95% CI 12-82), stronger than the impact on LOCRC (GRE 18, 95% CI 8-29).Excessive alcohol use was strongly associated with EOCRC risk, independent of PRS levels. Abstaining from heavy drinking could reduce risk for CRC, in particular for EOCRC to an extent that would be equivalent to having a much lower genetically determined risk.The first author (X.C.) was supported by the Guangzhou Elite Project (GEP).

Unprecedentedly effective, but complex and costly to manufacture, they are not yet a therapeutic option for all who would benefit. This disparity has motivated worldwide efforts to simplify treatment. Among the proposed solutions, the generation of CAR T cells directly in the patient, i.e., in vivo, is arguably simultaneously the most technically challenging and clinically useful approach to convert CAR therapy from a cell-based autologous medicinal product into a universally applicable off-the-shelf treatment. Here, we review the current state of the art of in vivo CAR therapy, focusing especially on the vector technologies used. These cover lentiviral vectors and adenovirus-associated vectors as well as synthetic polymer nanocarriers and lipid nanoparticles. Proof of concept, i.e., the generation of CAR cells directly in mouse models, has been demonstrated for all vector platforms. Receptor targeting of vector particles is crucial, as it can prevent CAR gene delivery into off-target cells, thus reducing toxicities. We discuss the properties of the vector platforms, such as their immunogenicity, potency, and modes of CAR delivery (permanent versus transient). Finally, we outline the work required to advance in vivo CAR therapy from proof of concept to a robust, scalable technology for clinical testing.Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).

In ALS these alterations are well described and evident not only with the progression of the disease but also years before diagnosis. Still, there are some discrepancies in findings relating to the causal nature of lipid metabolic alterations, partly due to the great clinical heterogeneity in ALS. ALS presentation is within a disorder spectrum with Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD), and many patients present mixed forms of ALS and FTD, thus increasing the variability. Lipid metabolic and other systemic metabolic alterations have not been well studied in FTD, or in ALS-FTD mixed forms, as has been in pure ALS. With the recent development in lipidomics and the integration with other -omics platforms, there is now emerging data that not only facilitates the identification of biomarkers but also enables understanding of the underlying pathological mechanisms. Here, we reviewed the recent literature to compile lipid metabolic alterations in ALS, FTD, and intermediate mixed forms, with a view to appraising key commonalities or differences within the spectrum."

Nonetheless, inflammation can also occur in an uncontrolled, unrestricted manner, leading to chronic disease and organ damage. Mechanisms triggering an inflammatory response, hindering such a response, or leading to its resolution are well-studied but so far insufficiently elucidated with regard to precise therapeutic interventions. Notably, as an immune reaction evolves, requirements and environments for immune cells change, and thus cellular phenotypes adapt and shift, leading to the appearance of distinct cellular subpopulations with new functional features. In this article, we aim to highlight properties of, and overarching regulatory factors involved in, the occurrence of immune cell phenotypes with a special focus on neutrophils, macrophages and platelets.

We carried out experimental T/HS-R (pseudo-fracture plus 2 h of shock followed by 0-22 h of resuscitation) in C57BL/6 (wild type [WT]) and TLR4-null (TLR4-/-) mice, and then defined the dynamics of 20 protein-level inflammatory mediators in the heart, gut, lung, liver, spleen, kidney, and systemic circulation. Cross-correlation and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on data from the 7 tissues sampled suggested that TLR4-/-samples express multiple inflammatory mediators in a small subset of tissue compartments as compared to the WT samples, in which many inflammatory mediators were localized non-specifically to nearly all compartments. We and others have previously defined a central role for type 17 immune cells in human trauma. Accordingly, correlations between IL-17A and GM-CSF (indicative of pathogenic Th17 cells); between IL-17A and IL-10 (indicative of non-pathogenic Th17 cells); and IL-17A and TNF (indicative of memory/effector T cells) were assessed across all tissues studied. In both WT and TLR4-/-mice, positive correlations were observed between IL-17A and GM-CSF, IL-10, and TNF in the kidney and gut. In contrast, the variable and dynamic presence of both pathogenic and non-pathogenic Th17 cells was inferred in the systemic circulation of TLR4-/-mice over time, suggesting a role for TLR4 in efflux of these cells into peripheral tissues. Hypergraph analysis - used to define dynamic, cross compartment networks - in concert with PCA-suggested that IL-17A was present persistently in all tissues at all sampled time points except for its absence in the plasma at 0.5h in the WT group, supporting the hypothesis that T/HS-R induces efflux of Th17 cells from the circulation and into specific tissues. These analyses suggest a complex, context-specific role for TLR4 and type 17 immunity following T/HS-R.Copyright © 2022 Shah, Zamora, Korff, Barclay, Yin, El-Dehaibi, Billiar and Vodovotz."

Assessments will take place prior to beginning GAHT and 6 and 12 months into therapies in adults commencing GAHT. Age-matched individuals will be assessed at the same time points. Assessments will be divided over three examination days, involving (1) aerobic fitness tests, (2) muscle strength assessments and (3) collection of blood and muscle samples, as well as body composition measurements. Standardised diets, fitness watches and questionnaires will be used to control for key confounders in analyses. Primary outcomes are changes in aerobic fitness and muscle strength, as well as changes in skeletal muscle DNA methylation and gene expression profiles. Secondary outcomes include changes in skeletal muscle characteristics, proteomics, body composition and blood markers. Linear mixed models will be used to assess changes in outcomes, while accounting for repeated measures within participants and adjusting for known confounders.The Austin Health Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC) and Victoria University HREC granted approval for this study (HREC/77146/Austin-2021).

"35897073","Glyphosate infiltrates the brain and increases pro-inflammatory cytokine TNFα: implications for neurodegenerative disorders.","J Neuroinflammation","Herbicides are environmental contaminants that have gained much attention due to the potential hazards they pose to human health. Glyphosate, the active ingredient in many commercial herbicides, is the most heavily applied herbicide worldwide. The recent rise in glyphosate application to corn and soy crops correlates positively with increased death rates due to Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders. Glyphosate has been shown to cross the blood-brain barrier in in vitro models, but has yet to be verified in vivo. Additionally, reports have shown that glyphosate exposure increases pro-inflammatory cytokines in blood plasma, particularly TNFα.Here, we examined whether glyphosate infiltrates the brain and elevates TNFα levels in 4-month-old C57BL/6J mice. Mice received either 125, 250, or 500 mg/kg/day of glyphosate, or a vehicle via oral gavage for 14 days. Urine, plasma, and brain samples were collected on the final day of dosing for analysis via UPLC-MS and ELISAs. Primary cortical neurons were derived from amyloidogenic APP/PS1 pups to evaluate in vitro changes in Aβ40-42burden and cytotoxicity. RNA sequencing was performed on C57BL/6J brain samples to determine changes in the transcriptome.Our analysis revealed that glyphosate infiltrated the brain in a dose-dependent manner and upregulated TNFα in both plasma and brain tissue post-exposure. Notably, glyphosate measures correlated positively with TNFα levels. Glyphosate exposure in APP/PS1 primary cortical neurons increases levels of soluble Aβ40-42and cytotoxicity. RNAseq revealed over 200 differentially expressed genes in a dose-dependent manner and cell-type-specific deconvolution analysis showed enrichment of key biological processes in oligodendrocytes including myelination, axon ensheathment, glial cell development, and oligodendrocyte development.Collectively, these results show for the first time that glyphosate infiltrates the brain, elevates both the expression of TNFα and soluble Aβ, and disrupts the transcriptome in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that exposure to this herbicide may have detrimental outcomes regarding the health of the general population.© 2022.

"35818034","A hybrid metaheuristic-deep learning technique for the pan-classification of cancer based on DNA methylation.","BMC Bioinformatics","DNA Methylation is one of the most important epigenetic processes that are crucial to regulating the functioning of the human genome without altering the DNA sequence. DNA Methylation data for cancer patients are becoming more accessible than ever, which is attributed to newer DNA sequencing technologies, notably, the relatively low-cost DNA microarray technology by Illumina Infinium. This technology makes it possible to study DNA methylation at hundreds of thousands of different loci. Currently, most of the research found in the literature focuses on the discovery of DNA methylation markers for specific cancer types. A relatively small number of studies have attempted to find unified DNA methylation biomarkers that can diagnose different types of cancer (pan-cancer classification).In this study, the aim is to conduct a pan-classification of cancer disease. We retrieved individual data for different types of cancer patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) portal. We selected data for many cancer types: Breast Cancer (BRCA), Ovary Cancer (OV), Stomach Cancer (STOMACH), Colon Cancer (COAD), Kidney Cancer (KIRC), Liver Cancer (LIHC), Lung Cancer (LUSC), Prostate Cancer (PRAD) and Thyroid cancer (THCA). The data was pre-processed and later used to build the required dataset. The system that we developed consists of two main stages. The purpose of the first stage is to perform feature selection and, therefore, decrease the dimensionality of the DNA methylation loci (features). This is accomplished using an unsupervised metaheuristic technique. As for the second stage, we used supervised machine learning and developed deep neural network (DNN) models to help classify the samples' malignancy status and cancer type. Experimental results showed that compared to recently published methods, our proposed system achieved better classification results in terms of recall, and similar and higher results in terms of precision and accuracy. The proposed system also achieved an excellent receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (ROC AUC) values varying from 0.85 to 0.89.This research presented an effective new approach to classify different cancer types based on DNA methylation data retrieved from TCGA. The performance of the proposed system was compared to recently published works, using different performance metrics. It provided better results, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed method for classifying different cancer types based on DNA methylation data.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35628309","One of the Primary Functions of Tissue-Resident Pluripotent Pericytes Cells May Be to Regulate Normal Organ Growth and Maturation: Implications for Attempts to Repair Tissues Later in Life.","Int J Mol Sci","Adult mesenchymal stem cells were reported more than 30 years ago. Since then, their potential to repair and regenerate damaged or diseased tissues has been studied intensively in both preclinical models and human trials. Most of the need for such tissue repair/regeneration is in older populations, so much of the effort has been performed with autologous cells in older patients. However, success has been difficult to achieve. In the literature, it has been noted that such progenitor cells from younger individuals often behave with more vigorous activity and are functionally enhanced compared to those from older individuals or animals. In addition, cells with the characteristics of mesenchymal stem cells or pluripotent mesenchymal regulatory cells exist in nearly all tissues and organs as pericytes since fetal life. Such evidence raises the possibility that one of the primary roles of these organ-specific cells is to regulate organ growth and maturation, and then subsequently play a role in the maintenance of organ integrity. This review will discuss the evidence to support this concept and the implications of such a concept regarding the use of these progenitor cells for the repair and regeneration of tissues damaged by injury or disease later in life. For the latter, it may be necessary to return the organ-specific progenitor cells to the functional state that contributed to their effectiveness during growth and maturation rather than attempting to use them after alterations imposed during the aging process have been established and their function compromised."
"35562659","Application of Bayesian genomic prediction methods to genome-wide association analyses.","Genet Sel Evol","Bayesian genomic prediction methods were developed to simultaneously fit all genotyped markers to a set of available phenotypes for prediction of breeding values for quantitative traits, allowing for differences in the genetic architecture (distribution of marker effects) of traits. These methods also provide a flexible and reliable framework for genome-wide association (GWA) studies. The objective here was to review developments in Bayesian hierarchical and variable selection models for GWA analyses.By fitting all genotyped markers simultaneously, Bayesian GWA methods implicitly account for population structure and the multiple-testing problem of classical single-marker GWA. Implemented using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, Bayesian GWA methods allow for control of error rates using probabilities obtained from posterior distributions. Power of GWA studies using Bayesian methods can be enhanced by using informative priors based on previous association studies, gene expression analyses, or functional annotation information. Applied to multiple traits, Bayesian GWA analyses can give insight into pleiotropic effects by multi-trait, structural equation, or graphical models. Bayesian methods can also be used to combine genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and other -omics data to infer causal genotype to phenotype relationships and to suggest external interventions that can improve performance.Bayesian hierarchical and variable selection methods provide a unified and powerful framework for genomic prediction, GWA, integration of prior information, and integration of information from other -omics platforms to identify causal mutations for complex quantitative traits.© 2022.

Moreover, we summarize the chemical, RNAi, and CRISPR-cas9 high throughput screens conducted in EwS with the goal of assisting in the development of novel therapies to treat this aggressive disease."
"35727470","Correlative links between natural radiation and life expectancy in the US population.","Biogerontology","The linear no-threshold (LNT) hypothesis is still the ruling concept which dictates the radiation protection health policy and regulations. However, more and more studies show that not only that low dose radiation pose no danger to our health, but also exhibits clear beneficial health effects. Here, we evaluated the correlative links of the natural sources of radiation-terrestrial radiation (TR), cosmic radiation (CR), and Radon-222, with life expectancy, the most integrative index of population health. The results of this study show that the different sources of natural radiation display positive correlative links to life expectancy, which is in line with the hypothesis of radiation hormesis.© 2022.
