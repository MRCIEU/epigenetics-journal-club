## EWAS: gene expression 

> Yao C, ... Levy D.**Epigenome-wide association study of whole blood gene expression in Framingham Heart Study participants provides molecular insight into the potential role of CHRNA5 in cigarette smoking-related lung diseases**. *Clin Epigenetics*. 2021 Mar 22;13(1):60. 

**tissue** whole blood

**size** n=6000

**dataset** matching DNA methylation and gene expression

**cohorts** FHS, KORA, InCHIANTI, BLSA

**results**
- 148-1741 gene-CpG pairs per cohort
- closer pair = larger effect
- 36% of pairs share the same causal genetic variant
- MR shows reduced methylation and expression of CHRNA5 causally linked to COPD and lung cancer (validated in lung tissue)

## EWAS: lung cancer

> Sun Yi-Qian, Richmond RC, ... Relton CL, Mai XM. **Assessing the role of genome-wide DNA methylation between smoking and risk of lung cancer using repeated measurements: the HUNT study**. *Int J Epidemiol*. 2021
Mar 17:dyab044. 

**variable** lung cancer risk and smoking

**tissue** whole blood

**size** 140 lung cancer cases and 140 controls

**cohorts** HUNT2

**results**
- 76 associations with smoking (16 novel) 
- MR: smoking cases DNA methylation changes 
- no associations with future lung cancer
- MR: no evidence DNA methylation changes (smoking or otherwise) cause lung cancer

## EWAS: opioid intoxication

> Shu C, ... Maher BS. **Epigenome-wide study of brain DNA methylation following acute opioid intoxication**. *Drug Alcohol Depend*. 2021 Feb 26;221:108658. 

**variable** death from acute opioid intoxication

**tissue** dorsolateral prefrontal cortex

**size** 153 (72 cases, 53 psychiatric controls, 28 controls)

**results**
- No associations
- PhenoAge accelerated by 2.24 years (p=0.045)

## EWAS: birthweight 

> Moccia C, ... Richiardi L. **Birthweight DNA methylation signatures in infant saliva**. *Clin Epigenetics*. 2021 Mar 19;13(1):57. 

**variable** birthweight

**tissue** infant saliva at average age 10.8 months

**size** 135

**results**
- 44 associations
- 44 associations with small for gestational age (1 overlap with birthweight)
- no overlap with PACE cord blood study

---

## EWAS: maternal smoking and birthweight 

> Xu R, ... Ji H. **DNA methylation mediates the effect of maternal smoking on offspring birthweight: a birth cohort study of multi-ethnic US mother-newborn pairs**. *Clin Epigenetics*. 2021 Mar 4;13(1):47. 

**variable** maternal smoking

**tissue** cord blood

**cohort** "a US predominantly urban, low-income multi-ethnic birth cohort"

**size** 954

**results**
- 38 associations with maternal smoking
- ... of which 8 associated with birthweight
- ... these explain 67.8% of maternal smoking-birthweight association
- ... most linked to the GFI1 gene and also found to be mediators in Kupers et al (PMID 25862628)

## DNAm age: weight-loss intervention

> Yaskolka Meir A, ... Shai I. **Lifestyle weight-loss intervention may attenuate methylation aging: the CENTRAL MRI randomized controlled trial**. *Clin Epigenetics*. 2021 Mar 4;13(1):48. 

**intervention** 18-month low fat vs mediterranean/low carbohydrate diets + physical activity (aerobic)

**sample size** 30 LF, 30LF+PA, 30 MED/LC, 30 MED/LC+PA

**dataset** DNAm age calculated from 240 CpG sites (Li et al EHP 2018) and blood DNA methylation measured at baseline and 18 months later

**results**
- DNAm age increased between baseline and 18 months 
- DNAm age increase did not differ between groups
- DNAm age increase doubled in those who failed to lose weight (1.1 vs 0.6, p=0.04)
- DNAm age increase tripled in those with fatty liver (1.8 vs 0.6, p=0.0003)

## DNAm age: CVD in African Americans

> Ammous F, ... Smith JA. **Epigenetic age acceleration is associated with cardiometabolic risk factors and clinical cardiovascular disease risk scores in African Americans**. *Clin Epigenetics*. 2021 Mar 16;13(1):55. 

**sample size** 1100 hypertensive AA 

**cohort** Genetic Epidemiology Network of Arteriopathy (GENOA)

**results** Increased epigenetic age acceleration was associated with:
- higher systolic blood pressure (IEAA), 
- higher pulse pressure (EEAA and GrimAA), 
- higher fasting glucose (PhenoAA and GrimAA), 
- higher fasting insulin (EEAA), 
- lower low density cholesterol (GrimAA), and 
- higher triglycerides (GrimAA). 

five-year increase in GrimAA = CVD incidence HR=1.54 (95% CI 1.22-2.01) 
(partly independent of CVD risk factors)

--

*"Our findings are in line with the literature in cohorts of European ancestry, showing that GrimAA outperforms other measures in its association with CVD incidence"*

## Need more cell types in blood references?

> Pellegrino-Coppola D, ... Franke L. **Correction for both common and
rare cell types in blood is important to identify genes that correlate with age**.
*BMC Genomics*. 2021 Mar 15;22(1):184.

**data** 3165 gene expression profiles (RNA-seq) from blood (age 18-81)

**methods**
- model 1: counts for 5 major blood cell types
- model 2: counts for 5 major + 33 additional white blood cell types

**results**

Model 1 has **2808** vs model 2 **625** genes associated with age (511 in common).

*Is this just a power difference?* Model 2 has
- lower mean-squared errors in regression models
- more normally distributed residuals
- 'less' heteroskedasticity
- model 1 age-associated genes show evidence of differential methylation between cell types
- functional enrichment of genes from each model generally distinct

## Reference data: peripheral cells and tissues

> Hannon E, ... Mill J. **Assessing the co-variability of DNA methylation across peripheral cells and tissues: Implications for the interpretation of findings in epigenetic epidemiology**. *PLoS Genet*. 2021 Mar 19;17(3):e1009443.

**tissues** whole blood (monocytes, granulocytes, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and B cells), buccal epithelial and nasal epithelial cells

**cohort** E-Risk

**size** thirty individuals

**results**
- lots of cell-type specific methylation levels and variation
- DNAm estimates of age and smoking varied by cell type
- variance in blood cell types *weakly* predictive of variance in blood
- for some CpG sites, variation occurs in a single blood cell type (useful for determining cell-type-specific associations)

## Reference data: placenta

> Rondinone O, ... Miozzo M. **Extensive Placental Methylation Profiling in Normal Pregnancies**. *Int J Mol Sci*. 2021 Feb 21;22(4):2136.

**sample size** 154 placentas and cord blood samples

**results** 
- placenta methylation more variable

*Unclear how to access the data. Possibly ask 
"Fondazione IRCCS Caâ€™ Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy"*
