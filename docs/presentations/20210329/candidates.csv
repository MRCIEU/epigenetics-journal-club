"33765311","A Method to Investigate the Helicobacter pylori-Associated DNA Methylome.","Methods Mol Biol","The protocol described here for methylome profiling consists of two parts. One is the experimental part for a genome-wide analysis of methylation level, and the other is the bioinformatics analysis of the methylome data. DNA methylation measurement is conducted using the commercially available array-based ""Infinium Human Methylation 450K BeadChip"" kit (or its updated version, Infinium MethylationEPICBeadChip). This BeadChip allows the high-throughput DNA methylation analysis suitable for genome-wide studies with large sample size. The results give intensities of the beads providing information on the unmethylated and methylated CpG sites. Bioinformatics data analysis involves reading the intensities as methylation values using R packages. Here, we provide a detailed analysis tool for each of the data analysis steps."
"33763662","Placental <i>OPRM1</i> DNA methylation and associations with neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, a pilot study.","Explor Med","Epigenetic variation of DNA methylation of the mu-opioid receptor gene (OPRM1) has been identified in the blood and saliva of individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD) and infants with neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS). It is unknown whether epigenetic variation inOPRM1exists within placental tissue in women with OUD and whether it is associated with NOWS outcomes. In this pilot study, the authors aimed to 1) examine the association between placentalOPRM1DNA methylation levels and NOWS outcomes, and 2) compareOPRM1methylation levels in opioid-exposedversusnon-exposed control placentas.Placental tissue was collected from eligible opioid (n= 64) and control (n= 29) women after delivery. Placental DNA was isolated and methylation levels at six cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites within theOPRM1promoter were quantified. Methylation levels were evaluated for associations with infant NOWS outcome measures: need for pharmacologic treatment, length of hospital stay (LOS), morphine treatment days, and treatment with two medications. Regression models were created and adjusted for clinical co-variates. Methylation levels between opioid and controls placentas were also compared.The primary opioid exposures were methadone and buprenorphine. Forty-nine (76.6%) of the opioid-exposed infants required pharmacologic treatment, 10 (15.6%) two medications, and average LOS for all opioid-exposed infants was 16.5 (standard deviation 9.7) days. There were no significant associations betweenOPRM1DNA methylation levels in the six CpG sites and any NOWS outcome measures. No significant differences were found in methylation levels between the opioid and control samples.No significant associations were found betweenOPRM1placental DNA methylation levels and NOWS severity in this pilot cohort. In addition, no significant differences were seen inOPRM1methylation in opioidversuscontrol placentas. Future association studies examining methylation levels on a genome-wide level are warranted."

"33762635","Genome-wide association study of psychiatric and substance use comorbidity in Mexican individuals.","Sci Rep","The combination of substance use and psychiatric disorders is one of the most common comorbidities. The objective of this study was to perform a genome-wide association study of this comorbidity (Com), substance use alone (Subs), and psychiatric symptomatology alone (Psych) in the Mexican population. The study included 3914 individuals of Mexican descent. Genotyping was carried out using the PsychArray microarray and genome-wide correlations were calculated. Genome-wide associations were analyzed using multiple logistic models, polygenic risk scores (PRSs) were evaluated using multinomial models, and vertical pleiotropy was evaluated by generalized summary-data-based Mendelian randomization. Brain DNA methylation quantitative loci (brain meQTL) were also evaluated in the prefrontal cortex. Genome-wide correlation and vertical pleiotropy were found between all traits. No genome-wide association signals were found, but 64 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) reached nominal associations (p < 5.00e-05). The SNPs associated with each trait were independent, and the individuals with high PRSs had a higher prevalence of tobacco and alcohol use. In the multinomial models all of the PRSs (Subs-PRS, Com-PRS, and Psych-PRS) were associated with all of the traits. Brain meQTL of the Subs-associated SNPs had an effect on the genes enriched in insulin signaling pathway, and that of the Psych-associated SNPs had an effect on the Fc gamma receptor phagocytosis pathway."
"33762478","Genome-wide association analysis reveals regulation of at-risk loci by DNA methylation in prostate cancer.","Asian J Androl","Epigenetic changes are potentially important for the ontogeny and progression of tumors but are not usually studied because of the complexity of analyzing transcript regulation resulting from epigenetic alterations. Prostate cancer (PCa) is characterized by variable clinical manifestations and frequently unpredictable outcomes. We performed an expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis to identify the genomic regions that regulate gene expression in PCa and identified a relationship between DNA methylation and clinical information. Using multi-level information published in The Cancer Genome Atlas, we performed eQTL-based analyses on DNA methylation and gene expression. To better interpret these data, we correlated loci and clinical indexes to identify the important loci for both PCa development and progression. Our data demonstrated that although only a small proportion of genes are regulated via DNA methylation in PCa, these genes are enriched in important cancer-related groups. In addition, single nucleotide polymorphism analysis identified the locations of CpG sites and genes within at-risk loci, including the 19q13.2-q13.43 and 16q22.2-q23.1 loci. Further, an epigenetic association study of clinical indexes detected risk loci and pyrosequencing for site validation. Although DNA methylation-regulated genes across PCa samples are a small proportion, the associated genes play important roles in PCa carcinogenesis."
"33762305","Noncanonical immune response to the inhibition of DNA methylation by Staufen1 via stabilization of endogenous retrovirus RNAs.","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","DNA-methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTis), such as azacitidine and decitabine, are used clinically to treat myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Decitabine activates the transcription of endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), which can induce immune response by acting as cellular double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs). Yet, the posttranscriptional regulation of ERV dsRNAs remains uninvestigated. Here, we find that the viral mimicry and subsequent cell death in response to decitabine require the dsRNA-binding protein Staufen1 (Stau1). We show that Stau1 directly binds to ERV RNAs and stabilizes them in a genome-wide manner. Furthermore, Stau1-mediated stabilization requires a long noncoding RNA TINCR, which enhances the interaction between Stau1 and ERV RNAs. Analysis of a clinical patient cohort reveals that MDS and AML patients with lower Stau1 and TINCR expressions exhibit inferior treatment outcomes to DNMTi therapy. Overall, our study reveals the posttranscriptional regulatory mechanism of ERVs and identifies the Stau1-TINCR complex as a potential target for predicting the efficacy of DNMTis and other drugs that rely on dsRNAs."
"33761969","Genome-wide impact of hydrogen peroxide on maintenance DNA methylation in replicating cells.","Epigenetics Chromatin","Environmental factors, such as oxidative stress, have the potential to modify the epigenetic landscape of cells. We have previously shown that DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) activity can be inhibited by sublethal doses of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). However, site-specific changes in DNA methylation and the reversibility of any changes have not been explored. Using bead chip array technology, differential methylation was assessed in Jurkat T-lymphoma cells following exposure to H2O2.Sublethal H2O2exposure was associated with an initial genome-wide decrease in DNA methylation in replicating cells, which was largely corrected 72 h later. However, some alterations were conserved through subsequent cycles of cell division. Significant changes to the variability of DNA methylation were also observed both globally and at the site-specific level.This research indicates that increased exposure to H2O2can result in long-term alterations to DNA methylation patterns, providing a mechanism for environmental factors to have prolonged impact on gene expression."

We studied genome-wide DNA methylation in nasal samples from infants (<6 months) applying whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) to characterize epigenome response to 10 different respiratory viral infections including SARS-CoV-2.We identified virus-specific differentially methylated regions (vDMR) with human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and SARS-CoV-2 followed by Influenza B (Flu B) causing the weakest vs. strongest epigenome response with 496 vs. 78541 and 14361 vDMR, respectively. We found a strong replication rate of FluB (52%) and SARS-CoV-2 (42%) vDMR in independent samples indicating robust epigenome perturbation upon infection. Among the FluB and SARS-CoV-2 vDMRs, around 70% were hypomethylated and significantly enriched among epithelial cell-specific regulatory elements whereas the hypermethylated vDMRs for these viruses mapped more frequently to immune cell regulatory elements, especially those of the myeloid lineage. The hypermethylated vDMRs were also enriched among genes and genetic loci in monocyte activation pathways and monocyte count. Finally, we perform single-cell RNA-sequencing characterization of nasal mucosa in response to these two viruses to functionally analyze the epigenome perturbations. Which supports the trends we identified in methylation data and highlights and important role for monocytes.All together, we find evidence indicating genetic predisposition to innate immune response upon a respiratory viral infection. Our genome-wide monitoring of infant viral response provides first catalogue of associated host regulatory elements. Assessing epigenetic variation in individual patients may reveal evidence for viral triggers of childhood disease."
"33758253","Distinct DNA methylation patterns associated with treatment resistance in metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer.","Sci Rep","Androgens are a major driver of prostate cancer (PCa) and continue to be a critical treatment target for advanced disease, which includes castration therapy and antiandrogens. However, resistance to these therapies leading to metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), and the emergence of treatment-induced neuroendocrine disease (tNEPC) remains an ongoing challenge. Instability of the DNA methylome is well established as a major hallmark of PCa development and progression. Therefore, investigating the dynamics of the methylation changes going from the castration sensitive to the tNEPC state would provide insights into novel mechanisms of resistance. Using an established xenograft model of CRPC, genome-wide methylation analysis was performed on cell lines representing various stages of PCa progression. We confirmed extensive methylation changes with the development of CRPC and tNEPC using this model. This included key genes and pathways associated with cellular differentiation and neurodevelopment. Combined analysis of methylation and gene expression changes further highlighted genes that could potentially serve as therapeutic targets. Furthermore, tNEPC-related methylation signals from this model were detectable in circulating cell free DNA (cfDNA) from mCRPC patients undergoing androgen-targeting therapies and were associated with a faster time to clinical progression. These potential biomarkers could help with identifying patients with aggressive disease."
"33754013","Comprehensive investigation of the clinical significance of long non-coding RNA HOXA-AS2 in acute myeloid leukemia using genome-wide RNA sequencing dataset.","J Cancer","Objective:The present study aimed to determine the prognostic value of HOXA cluster antisense RNA2 (HOXA-AS2) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and to explore its potential molecular mechanisms. We also screening of potential drugs targeting HOXA-AS2 in AML.Methods:The level 3 raw genome-wide RNA sequencing dataset of AML was download from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Data Portal, and the potential molecular mechanisms and drugs prediction of HOXA-AS2 in AML were explored using multiple bioinformatics analysis approaches.Results:TCGA AML cohort dataset indicated that HOXA-AS2 was significantly up-regulated in AML bone marrow tissues, and high HOXA-AS2 expression was related to poor overall survival (log-rankP=0.0284, hazard ratio 1.640, 95% confidence interval 1.046-2.573). Functional enrichment of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) suggested that the difference in prognosis between AML patients with high- and low-HOXA-AS2 expression may be due to differences in biological processes and pathways, including cell adhesion, angiogenesis, mitogen-activated protein kinase, cell differentiation, and other biological processes, and phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase-protein kinase B and Wnt signaling pathways. We also screened out three potential HOXA-AS2-targeted therapeutic drugs for AML, megestrol, carmustine, and cefoxitin, based on these DEGs. Functional enrichment analysis of HOXA-AS2-co-expressed genes revealed that HOXA-AS2 may act a part in AML by regulating nuclear factor-κB transcription factor activity, DNA methylation, angiogenesis, apoptosis, cell migration, Toll-like receptor 4, and Wnt signaling pathways.Conclusion:Our findings suggest that HOXA-AS2 is up-regulated in the bone marrow in patients with AML, and may serve as a novel prognostic biomarker for AML.© The author(s)."
"33752734","Epigenome-wide association study of whole blood gene expression in Framingham Heart Study participants provides molecular insight into the potential role of CHRNA5 in cigarette smoking-related lung diseases.","Clin Epigenetics","DNA methylation is a key epigenetic modification that can directly affect gene regulation. DNA methylation is highly influenced by environmental factors such as cigarette smoking, which is causally related to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer. To date, there have been few large-scale, combined analyses of DNA methylation and gene expression and their interrelations with lung diseases.We performed an epigenome-wide association study of whole blood gene expression in ~ 6000 individuals from four cohorts. We discovered and replicated numerous CpGs associated with the expression of cis genes within 500 kb of each CpG, with 148 to 1,741 cis CpG-transcript pairs identified across cohorts. We found that the closer a CpG resided to a transcription start site, the larger its effect size, and that 36% of cis CpG-transcript pairs share the same causal genetic variant. Mendelian randomization analyses revealed that hypomethylation and lower expression of CHRNA5, which encodes a smoking-related nicotinic receptor, are causally linked to increased risk of COPD and lung cancer. This putatively causal relationship was further validated in lung tissue data.Our results provide a large and comprehensive association study of whole blood DNA methylation with gene expression. Expression platform differences rather than population differences are critical to the replication of cis CpG-transcript pairs. The low reproducibility of trans CpG-transcript pairs suggests that DNA methylation regulates nearby rather than remote gene expression. The putatively causal roles of methylation and expression of CHRNA5 in relation to COPD and lung cancer provide evidence for a mechanistic link between patterns of smoking-related epigenetic variation and lung diseases, and highlight potential therapeutic targets for lung diseases and smoking cessation."
"33752591","Nonlinear ridge regression improves cell-type-specific differential expression analysis.","BMC Bioinformatics","Epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) and differential gene expression analyses are generally performed on tissue samples, which consist of multiple cell types. Cell-type-specific effects of a trait, such as disease, on the omics expression are of interest but difficult or costly to measure experimentally. By measuring omics data for the bulk tissue, cell type composition of a sample can be inferred statistically. Subsequently, cell-type-specific effects are estimated by linear regression that includes terms representing the interaction between the cell type proportions and the trait. This approach involves two issues, scaling and multicollinearity.First, although cell composition is analyzed in linear scale, differential methylation/expression is analyzed suitably in the logit/log scale. To simultaneously analyze two scales, we applied nonlinear regression. Second, we show that the interaction terms are highly collinear, which is obstructive to ordinary regression. To cope with the multicollinearity, we applied ridge regularization. In simulated data, nonlinear ridge regression attained well-balanced sensitivity, specificity and precision. Marginal model attained the lowest precision and highest sensitivity and was the only algorithm to detect weak signal in real data.Nonlinear ridge regression performed cell-type-specific association test on bulk omics data with well-balanced performance. The omicwas package for R implements nonlinear ridge regression for cell-type-specific EWAS, differential gene expression and QTL analyses.

We assessed four measures of ETV and chronic stress in children (ETV scale, gun violence, and perceived stress) and their mothers (perceived stress). Each EWAS was conducted using linear regression, with CpGs as dependent variables and the stress/violence measure as a predictor, adjusting for age, sex, the top five principal components, and SVA latent factors. We then selected the top 100 CpGs (by p value) associated with each stress/violence measure in EVA-PR and conducted a meta-analysis of the selected CpGs and atopic asthma using data from EVA-PR and two additional cohorts (Project Viva and PIAMA).Three CpGs (in SNN, PTPRN2, and LINC01164) were associated with maternal perceived stress or gun violence (p = 1.28-3.36 × 10-7), but not with atopic asthma, in EVA-PR. In a meta-analysis of three cohorts, which included the top CpGs associated with stress/violence measures in EVA-PR, 12 CpGs (in STARD3NL, SLC35F4, TSR3, CDC42SE2, KLHL25, PLCB1, BUD13, OR2B3, GALR1, TMEM196, TEAD4, and ANAPC13) were associated with atopic asthma at FDR-p < .05.Pending confirmation in longitudinal studies, our findings suggest that nasal epithelial methylation markers associated with measures of ETV and chronic stress may be linked to atopic asthma in children and adolescents.© 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC."
"33750960","Recent loss of the Dim2 DNA methyltransferase decreases mutation rate in repeats and changes evolutionary trajectory in a fungal pathogen.","PLoS Genet","DNA methylation is found throughout all domains of life, yet the extent and function of DNA methylation differ among eukaryotes. Strains of the plant pathogenic fungus Zymoseptoria tritici appeared to lack cytosine DNA methylation (5mC) because gene amplification followed by Repeat-Induced Point mutation (RIP) resulted in the inactivation of the dim2 DNA methyltransferase gene. 5mC is, however, present in closely related sister species. We demonstrate that inactivation of dim2 occurred recently as some Z. tritici isolates carry a functional dim2 gene. Moreover, we show that dim2 inactivation occurred by a different path than previously hypothesized. We mapped the genome-wide distribution of 5mC in strains with or without functional dim2 alleles. Presence of functional dim2 correlates with high levels of 5mC in transposable elements (TEs), suggesting a role in genome defense. We identified low levels of 5mC in strains carrying non-functional dim2 alleles, suggesting that 5mC is maintained over time, presumably by an active Dnmt5 DNA methyltransferase. Integration of a functional dim2 allele in strains with mutated dim2 restored normal 5mC levels, demonstrating de novo cytosine methylation activity of Dim2. To assess the importance of 5mC for genome evolution, we performed an evolution experiment, comparing genomes of strains with high levels of 5mC to genomes of strains lacking functional dim2. We found that presence of a functional dim2 allele alters nucleotide composition by promoting C to T transitions (C→T) specifically at CpA (CA) sites during mitosis, likely contributing to TE inactivation. Our results show that 5mC density at TEs is a polymorphic trait in Z. tritici populations that can impact genome evolution."
"33750457","Genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation in Hirschsprung enteric precursor cells: unraveling the epigenetic landscape of enteric nervous system development.","Clin Epigenetics","Hirschsprung disease (HSCR, OMIM 142623) is a rare congenital disorder that results from a failure to fully colonize the gut by enteric precursor cells (EPCs) derived from the neural crest. Such incomplete gut colonization is due to alterations in EPCs proliferation, survival, migration and/or differentiation during enteric nervous system (ENS) development. This complex process is regulated by a network of signaling pathways that is orchestrated by genetic and epigenetic factors, and therefore alterations at these levels can lead to the onset of neurocristopathies such as HSCR. The goal of this study is to broaden our knowledge of the role of epigenetic mechanisms in the disease context, specifically in DNA methylation. Therefore, with this aim, a Whole-Genome Bisulfite Sequencing assay has been performed using EPCs from HSCR patients and human controls.This is the first study to present a whole genome DNA methylation profile in HSCR and reveal a decrease of global DNA methylation in CpG context in HSCR patients compared with controls, which correlates with a greater hypomethylation of the differentially methylated regions (DMRs) identified. These results agree with the de novo Methyltransferase 3b downregulation in EPCs from HSCR patients compared to controls, and with the decrease in the global DNA methylation level previously described by our group. Through the comparative analysis of DMRs between HSCR patients and controls, a set of new genes has been identified as potential susceptibility genes for HSCR at an epigenetic level. Moreover, previous differentially methylated genes related to HSCR have been found, which validates our approach.This study highlights the relevance of an adequate methylation pattern for a proper ENS development. This is a research area that provides a novel approach to deepen our understanding of the etiopathogenesis of HSCR."

The molecular mechanisms involve the overexpression of genes related to DNA methylation on chromosome 21. Here, we stably overexpressed the chromosome 21 gene DNA methyltransferase 3L (DNMT3L) in the human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line and assayed DNA methylation at over 26 million CpGs by whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) at three different developmental phases (undifferentiated, differentiating, and differentiated).DNMT3L overexpression resulted in global CpG and CpG island hypermethylation as well as thousands of differentially methylated regions (DMRs). The DNMT3L DMRs were skewed towards hypermethylation and mapped to genes involved in neurodevelopment, cellular signaling, and gene regulation. Consensus DNMT3L DMRs showed that cell lines clustered by genotype and then differentiation phase, demonstrating sets of common genes affected across neuronal differentiation. The hypermethylated DNMT3L DMRs from all pairwise comparisons were enriched for regions of bivalent chromatin marked by H3K4me3 as well as differentially methylated sites from previous DS studies of diverse tissues. In contrast, the hypomethylated DNMT3L DMRs from all pairwise comparisons displayed a tissue-specific profile enriched for regions of heterochromatin marked by H3K9me3 during embryonic development.Taken together, these results support a mechanism whereby regions of bivalent chromatin that lose H3K4me3 during neuronal differentiation are targeted by excess DNMT3L and become hypermethylated. Overall, these findings demonstrate that DNMT3L overexpression during neurodevelopment recreates a facet of the genome-wide DS DNA methylation signature by targeting known genes and gene clusters that display pan-tissue differential methylation in DS."

However, little is known about the epigenetic factors that influence impaired gas exchange at the lung.To identify the epigenetic signatures of the diffusing capacity of the lung measured by carbon monoxide uptake (the diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO)).An epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) was performed on diffusing capacity, measured by carbon monoxide uptake (DLCO) and per alveolar volume (VA) (asDLCO/VA), using the single-breath technique in 2674 individuals from two population-based cohort studies. These were the Rotterdam Study (RS, the ""discovery panel"") and the Framingham Heart Study (FHS, the ""replication panel""). We assessed the clinical relevance of our findings by investigating the identified sites in whole blood and by lung tissue specific gene expression.We identified and replicated two CpG sites (cg05575921 and cg05951221) that were significantly associated withDLCO/VAand one (cg05575921) suggestively associated withDLCO. Furthermore, we found a positive association between aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor (AHRR) gene (cg05575921) hypomethylation and gene expression of exocyst complex component 3 (EXOC3) in whole blood. We confirmed that the expression ofEXOC3in lung tissue is positively associated withDLCO/VAandDLCO.We report on epigenome-wide associations with diffusing capacity in the general population.

"33747361","Global DNA hypermethylation pattern and unique gene expression signature in liver cancer from patients with Indigenous American ancestry.","Oncotarget","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) usually afflicts individuals in their maturity after a protracted liver disease. Contrasting with this pattern, the age structure of HCC in Andean people displays a bimodal distribution with half of the patients developing HCC in adolescence and early adulthood. To deepen our understanding of the molecular determinants of the disease in this population, we conducted an integrative analysis of gene expression and DNA methylation in HCC developed by 74 Peruvian patients, including 39 adolescents and young adults. While genome-wide hypomethylation is considered as a paradigm in human HCCs, our analysis revealed that Peruvian tumors are associated with a global DNA hypermethylation. Moreover, pathway enrichment analysis of transcriptome data characterized an original combination of signatures. Peruvian HCC forgoes canonical activations of IGF2, Notch, Ras/MAPK, and TGF-β signals to depend instead on Hippo/YAP1, MYC, and Wnt/β-catenin pathways. These signatures delineate a homogeneous subtype of liver tumors at the interface of the proliferative and non-proliferative classes of HCCs. Remarkably, the development of this HCC subtype occurs in patients with one of the four Native American mitochondrial haplogroups A-D. Finally, integrative characterization revealed that Peruvian HCC is apparently controlled by the PRC2 complex that mediates cell reprogramming with massive DNA methylation modulating gene expression and pinpointed retinoid signaling as a potential target for epigenetic therapy.Copyright: © 2021 Cerapio et al."

Statistical analyses used Student's t test, 1-way ANOVA, Fisher's exact test, and pairwise-fixed reallocation randomization test, where appropriate.The methylome analysis of individual blastocysts revealed significant alterations at 6,609 CpG sites associated with prolonged infertility (≥60 months) compared with those of fertile controls (0 months). Significant CpG alterations were localized to numerous imprinting control regions and imprinted genes, and several signaling pathways were highly represented among genes that were differentially methylated. Targeted imprinting methylation analysis uncovered significant hypomethylation at KvDMR and MEST imprinting control regions, with significant decreases in the gene expression levels upon extended TTP (≥36 months) compared to minimal TTP (≤24 months).The prolonged disease state of infertility correlates with an altered methylome in euploid blastocysts, with particular emphasis on genomic imprinting regulation, compared with assisted reproductive technologies alone.Copyright © 2021 American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

Chromatin organization and dynamics are regulated by several epigenetic mechanisms involving DNA (de-)methylation, posttranslational modifications (PTMs) of histones, chromatin-associated structural proteins, and higher-order structural changes and interactions. This review addresses examples of recent developments in several areas delineating the interface of chromatin regulation and erythroid-specific lineage transcription.We survey and discuss recent studies that focus on the erythroid chromatin landscape, erythroid enhancer-promotor interactions, super-enhancer functionality, the role of chromatin modifiers and epigenetic crosstalk, as well as the progress in mapping red blood cell (RBC) trait-associated genetic variants within cis-regulatory elements (CREs) identified in genome-wide association study (GWAS) efforts as a step toward determining their impact on erythroid-specific gene expression.As one of the best characterized and accessible cell differentiation systems, erythropoiesis has been at the forefront of studies aiming to conceptualize how chromatin dynamics regulate transcription. New emerging technologies that bring a significantly enhanced spatial and temporal resolution of chromatin structure, and allow investigation of small cell numbers, have advanced our understanding of chromatin dynamics during erythroid differentiation in vivo.Copyright © 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Here we studied tumor-specific DNAme in ESCC cases from nine high-incidence countries of Africa, Asia, and South America. Infinium MethylationEPIC array was performed on 108 tumors and 51 normal tissue adjacent to the tumors (NAT) in the discovery phase, and targeted pyrosequencing was performed on 132 tumors and 36 NAT in the replication phase. Top genes for replication were prioritizied by weighting methylation results using RNA-seq data from TCGA and GTEx and validated by qPCR. Methylome analysis comparing tumor and NAT identified 6,796 differentially methylated positions (DMP) and 866 differential methylated regions (DMR) with a 30% methylation (Δβ) difference. The majority of identified DMPs and DMRs were hypermethylated in tumors, particularly in promoters and gene-body regions of genes involved in transcription activation. The top three prioritized genes for replication, PAX9, SIM2 and THSD4 had similar methylation differences in the discovery and replication sets. These genes were exclusively expressed in normal esophageal tissues in GTEx and downregulated in tumors. The specificity and sensitivity of these DNAme events in discriminating tumors from NAT were assessed. Our study identified novel, robust, and crucial tumor-specific DNAme events in ESCC tumors across several high incidence populations of the world. Methylome changes identified in this study may serve as potential targets for biomarker discovery and warrant further functional characterization.Copyright ©2021, American Association for Cancer Research."

The association analyses between birthweight and DNA methylation variations were carried out using robust linear regression models both in the exploratory EWAS analyses and in the look-up of the PACE findings in infant saliva.None of the cord blood birthweight-associated CpGs identified by the PACE Consortium was associated with birthweight when analysed in infant saliva. In saliva EWAS analyses, considering a false discovery rate p-values < 0.05, birthweight as continuous variable was associated with DNA methylation in 44 CpG sites; being born small for gestational age (SGA, lower 10thpercentile of birthweight for gestational age according to WHO reference charts) was associated with DNA methylation in 44 CpGs, with only one overlapping CpG between the two analyses. Despite no overlap with PACE results at the CpG level, two of the top saliva birthweight CpGs mapped at genes associated with birthweight with the same direction of the effect also in the PACE Consortium (MACROD1 and RPTOR).Our study provides an indication of the birthweight and SGA epigenetic salivary signatures in children around 10 months of age. DNA methylation signatures in cord blood may not be comparable with saliva DNA methylation signatures at about 10 months of age, suggesting that the birthweight epigenetic marks are likely time and tissue specific."
"33740099","Non-IDH1-R132H IDH1/2 mutations are associated with increased DNA methylation and improved survival in astrocytomas, compared to IDH1-R132H mutations.","Acta Neuropathol","Somatic mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase genes IDH1 and IDH2 occur at high frequency in several tumour types. Even though these mutations are confined to distinct hotspots, we show that gliomas are the only tumour type with an exceptionally high percentage of IDH1R132Hmutations. Patients harbouring IDH1R132Hmutated tumours have lower levels of genome-wide DNA-methylation, and an associated increased gene expression, compared to tumours with other IDH1/2 mutations (""non-R132H IDH1/2 mutations""). This reduced methylation is seen in multiple tumour types and thus appears independent of the site of origin. For 1p/19q non-codeleted glioma (astrocytoma) patients, we show that this difference is clinically relevant: in samples of the randomised phase III CATNON trial, patients harbouring tumours with IDH mutations other than IDH1R132Hhave a better outcome (hazard ratio 0.41, 95% CI [0.24, 0.71], p = 0.0013). Such non-R132H IDH1/2-mutated tumours also had a significantly lower proportion of tumours assigned to prognostically poor DNA-methylation classes (p < 0.001). IDH mutation-type was independent in a multivariable model containing known clinical and molecular prognostic factors. To confirm these observations, we validated the prognostic effect of IDH mutation type on a large independent dataset. The observation that non-R132H IDH1/2-mutated astrocytomas have a more favourable prognosis than their IDH1R132Hmutated counterpart indicates that not all IDH-mutations are identical. This difference is clinically relevant and should be taken into account for patient prognostication."
"33739972","Assessing the co-variability of DNA methylation across peripheral cells and tissues: Implications for the interpretation of findings in epigenetic epidemiology.","PLoS Genet","Most epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) quantify DNA methylation (DNAm) in peripheral tissues such as whole blood to identify positions in the genome where variation is statistically associated with a trait or exposure. As whole blood comprises a mix of cell types, it is unclear whether trait-associated DNAm variation is specific to an individual cellular population. We collected three peripheral tissues (whole blood, buccal epithelial and nasal epithelial cells) from thirty individuals. Whole blood samples were subsequently processed using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to purify five constituent cell-types (monocytes, granulocytes, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and B cells). DNAm was profiled in all eight sample-types from each individual using the Illumina EPIC array. We identified significant differences in both the level and variability of DNAm between different sample types, and DNAm data-derived estimates of age and smoking were found to differ dramatically across sample types from the same individual. We found that for the majority of loci variation in DNAm in individual blood cell types was only weakly predictive of variance in DNAm measured in whole blood, although the proportion of variance explained was greater than that explained by either buccal or nasal epithelial samples. Covariation across sample types was much higher for DNAm sites influenced by genetic factors. Overall, we observe that DNAm variation in whole blood is additively influenced by a combination of the major blood cell types. For a subset of sites, however, variable DNAm detected in whole blood can be attributed to variation in a single blood cell type providing potential mechanistic insight about EWAS findings. Our results suggest that associations between whole blood DNAm and traits or exposures reflect differences in multiple cell types and our data will facilitate the interpretation of findings in epigenetic epidemiology."

Rare secondary AT/RT developing from other tumors such as pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma (PXA) are on record, but AT/RT presenting with molecular features of PXA have not been described. Here, we report 3 malignant central nervous system tumors in children (10, 13, and 18 y old). All tumors were located in the temporal lobe. In 2 cases, there was no history of a low-grade precursor lesion; in 1 case anaplastic PXA had been diagnosed 3 months earlier. Histopathologically, all tumors were composed of RT cells and showed frank signs of malignancy as well as loss of nuclear SMARCB1/INI1 protein expression. Two cases displayed homozygous deletions of the SMARCB1 region while the third case showed an exon 7 mutation (c.849_850delGT; p.Met283Ilefs*77). Of note, DNA methylation profiles did not group with AT/RT or other tumor entities using the Heidelberg Brain Tumor Classifier (version v11b4). By unsupervised t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding analysis and hierarchical clustering analysis, however, all tumors clearly grouped with PXA. Genome-wide copy number analysis revealed homozygous CDNK2A/B deletions and gains of whole chromosome 7. BRAF V600E mutations could be demonstrated in all cases. In conclusion, the possibility of AT/RT with molecular features of PXA needs to be taken into account and warrants molecular characterization of AT/RT especially in older children. Since treatments targeting mutated BRAF are available, identification of such cases may also have therapeutic consequences."

Serogroup W isolates belonging to the sequence type (ST)-11 clonal complex have been associated with atypical symptoms and increased case fatality rates. The continued expansion of this clonal complex in the later part of the 2010s has been largely due to a shift from the so-called original UK strain to the 2013 strain. Here we used single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing to determine the methylomes of the two major serogroup W strains belonging to ST-11 clonal complex. Five methylated motifs were identified in this study, and three of the motifs, namely 5'-GATC-3', 5'-GAAGG-3', 5'-GCGCGC-3', were found in all 13 isolates investigated. The results showed no strain-specific motifs or difference in active restriction modification systems between the two strains. Two phase variable methylases were identified and the enrichment or depletion of the methylation motifs generated by these methylases varied between the two strains. Results from this work give further insight into the low diversity of methylomes in highly related strains and encourage further research to decipher the role of regions with under- or overrepresented methylation motifs."

Our recent findings implicate oncogenic transformative events in chronic iron-exposed FTSECs, including increased expression of oncogenic mediators, increased telomerase transcripts, and increased growth/migratory potential. Herein, we extend these studies by implementing an integrated transcriptomic and mass spectrometry-based proteomics approach to identify global miRNA and protein alterations, for which we also investigate a subset of these targets to iron-induced functional alterations. Proteomic analysis identified > 4500 proteins, of which 243 targets were differentially expressed. Sixty-five differentially expressed miRNAs were identified, of which 35 were associated with the ""top"" proteomic molecules (> fourfold change) identified by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. Twenty of these 35 miRNAs are at the 14q32 locus (encoding a cluster of 54 miRNAs) with potential to be regulated by DNA methylation and histone deacetylation. At 14q32, miR-432-5p and miR-127-3p were ~ 100-fold downregulated whereas miR-138-5p was 16-fold downregulated at 3p21 in chronic iron-exposed FTSECs. Combinatorial treatment with methyltransferase and deacetylation inhibitors reversed expression of these miRNAs, suggesting chronic iron exposure alters miRNA expression via epigenetic alterations. In addition, PAX8, an important target in HGSOC and a potential miRNA target (from IPA) was epigenetically deregulated in iron-exposed FTSECs. However, both PAX8 and ALDH1A2 (another IPA-predicted target) were experimentally identified to be independently regulated by these miRNAs although TERT RNA was partially regulated by miR-138-5p. Interestingly, overexpression of miR-432-5p diminished cell numbers induced by long-term iron exposure in FTSECs. Collectively, our global profiling approaches uncovered patterns of miRNA and proteomic alterations that may be regulated by genome-wide epigenetic alterations and contribute to functional alterations induced by chronic iron exposure in FTSECs. This study may provide a platform to identify future biomarkers for early ovarian cancer detection and new targets for therapy."

However, the underlying dysfunctions of molecular mechanisms in KBD and OA remain unclear. Here, we primarily performed the various genome-wide differential methylation analyses to reveal the distinct differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in conjunction with corresponding differentially methylated genes (DMGs), and enriched functional pathways in KBD and OA. We identified a total of 131 DMRs in KBD vs. Control, and 58 DMRs in OA vs. Controls, and the results demonstrate that many interesting DMRs are linked to DMGs, such asSMOC2andHOXD3, which are all key genes to regulate cartilage/skeletal physiologic and pathologic process, and are further enriched in skeletal system and limb-associated pathways. Our DMR analysis indicates that KBD-associated DMRs has higher proportion than OA-associated DMRs in gene body regions. KBD-associated DMGs were enriched in wounding and coagulation-related functional pathways that may be stimulated by trace elements. The identified molecular features provide novel clues for understanding the pathogenetic and therapeutic studies of both KBD and OA.Copyright © 2021 Fan, Gao, Zhang, Zhu, Zhang, Wang, Wen, Guo and Sun."

We sought to determine the age and origin of adult human PAs using two types of ""marks"" in the genomic DNA. First, we analyzed the DNA methylation patterns of adult and pediatric PAs to distinguish between PAs of different anatomic locations (n = 257 PA and control brain tissues). Second, we measured the concentration of nuclear bomb test-derived14C in genomic DNA (n = 14 cases), which indicates the time point of the formation of human cell populations. Our data suggest that adult and pediatric PAs developing in the infratentorial brain are closely related and potentially develop from precursor cells early in life, whereas supratentorial PAs might show age and location-specific differences."

We sought to identify novel smoking-related DNA methylation sites in blood, with repeated measurements, and to appraise the putative role of DNA methylation in the pathway between smoking and lung cancer development.We derived a nested case-control study from the Trøndelag Health Study (HUNT), including 140 incident patients who developed lung cancer during 2009-13 and 140 controls. We profiled 850 K DNA methylation sites (Illumina Infinium EPIC array) in DNA extracted from blood that was collected in HUNT2 (1995-97) and HUNT3 (2006-08) for the same individuals. Epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) were performed for a detailed smoking phenotype and for lung cancer. Two-step Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses were performed to assess the potential causal effect of smoking on DNA methylation as well as of DNA methylation (13 sites as putative mediators) on risk of lung cancer.The EWAS for smoking in HUNT2 identified associations at 76 DNA methylation sites (P < 5 × 10-8), including 16 novel sites. Smoking was associated with DNA hypomethylation in a dose-response relationship among 83% of the 76 sites, which was confirmed by analyses using repeated measurements from blood that was collected at 11 years apart for the same individuals. Two-step MR analyses showed evidence for a causal effect of smoking on DNA methylation but no evidence for a causal link between DNA methylation and the risk of lung cancer.DNA methylation modifications in blood did not seem to represent a causal pathway linking smoking and the lung cancer risk.© The Author(s) 2021.

"33722698","Genetics of Osteoarthritis.","Osteoarthritis Cartilage","Osteoarthritis genetics has been transformed in the past decade through the application of large-scale genome-wide association scans. So far, over 100 polymorphic DNA variants have been associated with this common and complex disease. These genetic risk variants account for over 20% of osteoarthritis heritability and the vast majority map to non-protein coding regions of the genome where they are presumed to act by regulating the expression of target genes. Statistical fine mapping, in silico analyses of genomics data, and laboratory-based functional studies have enabled the identification of some of these targets, which encode proteins with diverse roles, including extracellular signaling molecules, intracellular enzymes, transcription factors, and cytoskeletal proteins. A large number of the risk variants correlate with epigenetic factors, in particular cartilage DNA methylation changes in cis, implying that epigenetics may be a conduit through which genetic effects on gene expression are mediated. Some of the variants also appear to have been selected as humans adapted to bipedalism, suggesting that a proportion of osteoarthritis genetic susceptibility results from antagonistic pleiotropy, with risk variants having a positive role in joint formation but a negative role in the long-term health of the joint. Although data from an osteoarthritis genetic study has not yet directly led to a novel treatment, some of the osteoarthritis associated genes code for proteins that have available therapeutics. Genetic investigations are therefore revealing fascinating fundamental insights into osteoarthritis and can expose options for translational intervention.Copyright © 2021. Published by Elsevier Ltd."

Through a genome-wide methylation profiling of tissue samples from patients with RB, normal retina and other retinal diseases, we shortlisted two CpG loci were only methylated in RB but not in normal retina or other retinal diseases. Both of these two CpG loci were located in the genome of TFAP2A. Through the screening, a primer and probe set for the two CpG loci were tested in fully methylated standards and RB tissues with a significant differentiation of RB. Our results of this assay tested in aqueous humor from RB revealed an accuracy of 92.7% for RB diagnosis.

Recent studies demonstrated that DNA modification could contribute to the pathogenesis of disease. This study aims to identify epigenetic perturbations that may contribute to the pathogenesis of CS. Four CS patients with hemivertebra were enrolled and underwent spine correction operations. DNA was extracted from the hemivertebrae and spinal process collected from the specimen during the hemivertebra resection. Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling was examined at base-pair resolution using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS). We identified 343 genes with hyper-differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and 222 genes with hypo-DMRs, respectively. These genes were enriched in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, calcium signaling pathway, and axon guidance in Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways and were enriched in positive regulation of cell morphogenesis involved in differentiation, regulation of cell morphogenesis involved in differentiation, and regulation of neuron projection development in Biological Process of Gene Ontology (GO-BP) terms. Hyper-DMR-related genes, includingIGHG1,IGHM,IGHG3,RNF213, andGSE1,and hypo DMR-related genes, includingSORCS2,COL5A1,GRID1,RGS3, andROBO2, may contribute to the pathogenesis of hemivertebra.

Exposome-wide association algorithms were used to draw links between in utero co-exposure to metals and phthalates, metabolic pathways deregulation, and clinically observed phenotypes of neurodevelopmental disorders such as problems in linguistic, motor development and cognitive capacity. Children (n=148) were tested at the first and second year of their life using the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Third Edition (Bayley-III). Their mothers had been exposed to metals and phthalates during the pregnancy, according to human biomonitoring results from previously performed studies. Untargeted metabolomics analysis of biobanked urine samples from the mothers was performed using a combination of the high throughput analytical methods liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Most perturbed metabolic pathways from co-exposure heavy metals and phthalates were pathways related to the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) and oxidative phosphorylation, indicating the possibility of disruption of mitochondrial respiration. Overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS); the presence of glutathione peroxidase 3 (GPx3) during pregnancy and presence of glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPx1) in the umbilical cord were linked to verbal development problems. Another finding of the study is that in real life, adverse outcomes occur as a combination of environmental and social factors, all of them acting synergistically towards the deployment of an observed phenotype. Finally, the two-steps association process (exposure to pathways and pathways to adverse outcomes) was able to (a) provide associations that are not evident by directly associating exposure to outcomes and (b) provides additional insides on the mechanisms of environmental disease.Copyright © 2021.

"33713106","Evolutionary contribution of duplicated genes to genome evolution in the ginseng species complex.","Genome Biol Evol","Genes duplicated by whole genome duplication (WGD) and small-scale duplication (SSD) have played important roles in adaptive evolution of all flowering plants. However, it still remains under-investigated how the distinct models of duplication events and their contending evolutionary patterns have shaped the genome and epigenomes of extant plant species. In this study, we investigated the contribution of the WGD- and SSD-derived duplicate genes to the genome evolution of one diploid and three closely related allotetraploid Panax species based on genome, methylome and proteome datasets. Our genome-wide comparative analyses revealed that while the ginseng species complex were recently diverged, they have evolved distinct overall patterns of nucleotide variation, cytosine methylation and protein-level expression. In particular, genetic and epigenetic asymmetries observed in the recent WGD-derived genes are largely consistent across the ginseng species complex. In addition, our results revealed that gene duplicates generated by ancient WGD and SSD mechanisms exhibited distinct evolutionary patterns. We found the ancient WGD-derived genes (i.e., ancient collinear gene) are genetically more conserved and hypo-methylated at the cytosine sites. In contrast, some of the SSD-derived genes (i.e., dispersal duplicated gene) showed hyper-methylation and high variance in nucleotide variation pattern. Functional enrichment analyses of the duplicated genes indicated that adaptation-related traits (i.e., photosynthesis) created during the distant ancient WGDs are further strengthened by both the more recent WGD and SSD. Together, our findings suggest that different types of duplicated genes may have played distinct but relaying evolutionary roles in the polyploidization and speciation processes in the ginseng species complex.© The Author(s) 2021.

An emerging and promising complementary approach to investigate cancer etiology is the study of somatic ""mutational signatures"" that endogenous and exogenous processes imprint on the cellular genome. These signatures can be identified from a complex web of somatic mutations thanks to advances in DNA sequencing technology and analytical algorithms. This approach is at the core of the Sherlock-Lung study (2018-ongoing), a retrospective case-only study of over 2,000 lung cancers in never-smokers (LCINS), using different patterns of mutations observed within LCINS tumors to trace back possible exposures or endogenous processes. Whole genome and transcriptome sequencing, genome-wide methylation, microbiome, and other analyses are integrated with data from histological and radiological imaging, lifestyle, demographic characteristics, environmental and occupational exposures, and medical records to classify LCINS into subtypes that could reveal distinct risk factors. To date, we have received samples and data from 1,370 LCINS cases from 17 study sites worldwide and whole-genome sequencing has been completed on 1,257 samples.

Numerous studies in plants, rodents, and humans have provided evidence of the regulatory roles of epigenetic processes in health and disease. There is increasing pressure to increase livestock production in light of increasing food needs of an expanding human population and environment challenges, but there is limited related epigenetic data on livestock to complement genomic information and support advances in improvement breeding and health management. This review examines the recent discoveries on epigenetic processes due to DNA methylation, histone modification, and chromatin remodeling and their impacts on health and production traits in farm animals, including bovine, swine, sheep, goat, and poultry species. Most of the reports focused on epigenome profiling at the genome-wide or specific genic regions in response to developmental processes, environmental stressors, nutrition, and disease pathogens. The bulk of available data mainly characterized the epigenetic markers in tissues/organs or in relation to traits and detection of epigenetic regulatory mechanisms underlying livestock phenotype diversity. However, available data is inadequate to support gainful exploitation of epigenetic processes for improved animal health and productivity management. Increased research effort, which is vital to elucidate how epigenetic mechanisms affect the health and productivity of livestock, is currently limited due to several factors including lack of adequate analytical tools. In this review, we (1) summarize available evidence of the impacts of epigenetic processes on livestock production and health traits, (2) discuss the application of epigenetics data in livestock production, and (3) present gaps in livestock epigenetics research.

"33707228","DNA methylation epitypes highlight underlying developmental and disease pathways in acute myeloid leukemia.","Genome Res","Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a molecularly complex disease characterized by heterogeneous tumor genetic profiles and involving numerous pathogenic mechanisms and pathways. Integration of molecular data types across multiple patient cohorts may advance current genetic approaches for improved sub-classification and understanding of the biology of the disease. Here we analyzed genome-wide DNA methylation in 649 AML patients using Illumina arrays and identified a configuration of 13 subtypes (termed 'epitypes') using unbiased clustering. Integration of genetic data revealed that most epitypes were associated with a certain recurrent mutation (or combination) in a majority of patients, yet other epitypes were largely independent. Epitypes demonstrated developmental blockage at discrete stages of myeloid differentiation, revealing epitypes that retain arrested hematopoietic stem cell-like phenotypes. Detailed analyses of DNA methylation patterns identified unique patterns of aberrant hyper- and hypomethylation among epitypes, with variable involvement of transcription factors influencing promoter, enhancer, and repressed regions. Patients in epitypes with stem cell-like methylation features showed inferior overall survival along with upregulated stem cell gene expression signatures. We further identified a DNA methylation signature involving STAT motifs associated withFLT3-ITD mutations. Finally, DNA methylation signatures were stable at relapse for the large majority of patients, and rare epitype switching accompanied loss of the dominant epitype mutations and reversion to stem cell-like methylation patterns. These results demonstrate that DNA methylation-based classification integrates important molecular features of AML to reveal the diverse pathogenic and biological aspects of the disease.Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press."

It has been known for a long time that the Human Leucocyte Antigen (HLA) molecules DQ2 and DQ8 are necessary, although not sufficient, for the disease development, and therefore other susceptibility genes and (epi)genetic events must participate in CeD pathogenesis. The advances in Genomics during the last 15 years have made CeD one of the immune-related disorders with the best-characterized genetic component. In the present work, we will first review the main Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) carried out in the disorder, and emphasize post-GWAS discoveries, including diverse integrative strategies, SNP prioritization approaches, and insights into the Microbiome through the host Genomics. Second, we will explore CeD-related Epigenetics and Epigenomics, mostly focusing on the emerging knowledge of the celiac methylome, and the vast but yet under-explored non-coding RNA (ncRNA) landscape.

"33705711","Cooperative binding between distant transcription factors is a hallmark of active enhancers.","Mol Cell","Enhancers harbor binding motifs that recruit transcription factors (TFs) for gene activation. While cooperative binding of TFs at enhancers is known to be critical for transcriptional activation of a handful of developmental enhancers, the extent of TF cooperativity genome-wide is unknown. Here, we couple high-resolution nuclease footprinting with single-molecule methylation profiling to characterize TF cooperativity at active enhancers in the Drosophila genome. Enrichment of short micrococcal nuclease (MNase)-protected DNA segments indicates that the majority of enhancers harbor two or more TF-binding sites, and we uncover protected fragments that correspond to co-bound sites in thousands of enhancers. From the analysis of co-binding, we find that cooperativity dominates TF binding in vivo at the majority of active enhancers. Cooperativity is highest between sites spaced 50 bp apart, indicating that cooperativity occurs without apparent protein-protein interactions. Our findings suggest nucleosomes promoting cooperativity because co-binding may effectively clear nucleosomes and promote enhancer function.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

Bronchial epithelial cells, which line the airway of the respiratory tract, undergo genome-wide level changes in gene expression and DNA methylation particularly when exposed to fine (<2.5 µm) PM (PM2.5). Although some of these changes have been reported in other studies, a comparison of how different concentrations and duration of exposure affect both the gene transcriptome and DNA methylome has not been done. Here, we exposed BEAS-2B, a bronchial epithelial cell line, to different concentrations of PM2.5, and compared how single or repeated doses of PM2.5affect both the transcriptome and methylome of cells. Widespread changes in gene expression occurred after cells were exposed to a single treatment of high-concentration (30 µg/cm2) PM2.5for 24 h. These genes were enriched in pathways regulating cytokine-cytokine interactions, Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) signaling, PI3K-Akt signaling, IL6, and P53. DNA methylomic analysis showed that nearly half of the differentially expressed genes were found to also have DNA methylation changes, with just a slightly greater trend toward overall hypomethylation across the genome. Cells exposed to a lower concentration (1 µg/cm2) of PM2.5demonstrated a comparable, but more attenuated change in gene expression compared to cells exposed to higher concentrations. There were also many genes affected by lower concentrations of PM2.5, but not higher concentrations. Additionally, repeated exposure to PM2.5(1 µg/cm2) for seven days resulted in transcriptomic and DNA methylomic changes that were distinct from cells treated with PM2.5for only one day. Compared to single exposure, repeated exposure to PM2.5caused a more notable degree of hypomethylation across the genome, though certain genes and regions demonstrated increased DNA methylation. The overall increase in hypomethylation, especially with repeated exposure to PM2.5, was associated with an increase in expression of ten-eleven translocation enzymes. These data demonstrate how variations in concentration and duration of PM2.5exposure induce distinct differences in the transcriptomic and DNA methylomic profile of bronchial epithelial cells, which may have important implications in the development of both acute and chronic lung disease.© The Author(s) 2021.

"33691021","Incorporation of DNA methylation into eQTL mapping in African Americans.","Pac Symp Biocomput","Epigenetics is a reversible molecular mechanism that plays a critical role in many developmental, adaptive, and disease processes. DNA methylation has been shown to regulate gene expression and the advent of high throughput technologies has made genome-wide DNA methylation analysis possible. We investigated the effect of DNA methylation on eQTL mapping (methylation-adjusted eQTLs), by incorporating DNA methylation as a SNP-based covariate in eQTL mapping in African American derived hepatocytes. We found that the addition of DNA methylation uncovered new eQTLs and eGenes. Previously discovered eQTLs were significantly altered by the addition of DNA methylation data suggesting that methylation may modulate the association of SNPs to gene expression. We found that methylation-adjusted eQTLs that were less significant compared to PC-adjusted eQTLs were enriched in lipoprotein measurements (FDR=0.0040), immune system disorders (FDR = 0.0042), and liver enzyme measurements (FDR=0.047), suggesting that DNA methylation modulates the genetic regulation of these phenotypes. Our methylation-adjusted eQTL analysis also uncovered novel SNP-gene pairs. For example, we found that the SNP, rs1332018, was associated to GSTM3. GSTM3 expression has been linked to Hepatitis B which African Americans suffer from disproportionately. Our methylation-adjusted method adds new understanding to the genetic basis of complex diseases that disproportionally affect African Americans."

During this period, environmental exposures may result in long-lasting epigenetic imprints that contribute to future developmental trajectories. The present review reports on the effects of adverse and protective environmental conditions occurring during the first 1000 days on glucocorticoid receptor gene (NR3C1) regulation in humans. Thirty-four studies were included. Wide variations emerged for biological tissues, number and position of analyzed CpG sites, and age at methylation and outcomes assessment. Increased NR3C1 methylation associated with first 1000 days stress exposures. Maternal caregiving behaviors significantly buffered precocious stress exposures. A less robust pattern of findings emerged for the association of NR3C1 methylation with physical health, neurobehavioral and neuroendocrine outcomes. Although drawing comprehensive conclusions is partially hindered by methodological limitations, the present review underlines the relevance of the first 1000 days from conception as a time window for developmental plasticity. Prospective cohort studies and epigenome-wide approaches may increase our understanding of dynamics epigenetic changes and their consequences for child development.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

"33686947","FAM72 serves as a biomarker of poor prognosis in human lung adenocarcinoma.","Aging (Albany NY)","FAM72A-D promote the self-renewal of neural progenitor cells. There is accumulating evidence that FAM72 promotes tumorigenicity. However, its effects in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) have not been determined. Thus, we evaluated the prognostic value ofFAM72A-Din LUAD using bioinformatics approaches. In particular, we evaluated the relationship between FAM72 and LUAD using a wide range of databases and analysis tools, including TCGA, GEO, GEPIA, Metascape, cBioPortal, and MethSurv. Compared with its expression in normal lung tissues, FAM72 expression was significantly increased in LUAD tissues. A univariate Cox analysis showed that high FAM72 expression levels were correlated with a poor OS in LUAD. Additionally, FAM72 expression was independently associated with OS through a multivariate Cox analysis. GO and GSEA revealed enrichment in mitotic nuclear division and cell cycle. Moreover, high FAM72 expression was associated with poor survival. An analysis of immune infiltration showed that FAM72 is correlated with immune cell infiltration. Finally, we found that the methylation level was associated with prognosis in patients with LUAD. In summary, these results indicate that FAM72 is a potential molecular marker for poor prognosis in LUAD and provide additional insight for the development of therapies and prognostic markers."
"33683369","Heritability of DNA methylation in threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus).","Genetics","Epigenetic mechanisms underlying phenotypic change are hypothesized to contribute to population persistence and adaptation in the face of environmental change. To date, few studies have explored the heritability of intergenerationally stable methylation levels in natural populations, and little is known about the relative contribution of cis- and trans-regulatory changes to methylation variation. Here, we explore the heritability of DNA methylation, and conduct methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTLs) analysis to investigate the genetic architecture underlying methylation variation between marine and freshwater ecotypes of threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). We quantitatively measured genome-wide DNA methylation in fin tissue using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing of F1 and F2 crosses, and their marine and freshwater source populations. We identified cytosines (CpG sites) that exhibited stable methylation levels across generations. We found that additive genetic variance explained an average of 24-35% of the methylation variance, with a number of CpG sites possibly autonomous from genetic control. We also detected both cis- and trans-meQTLs, with only trans-meQTLs overlapping with previously identified genomic regions of high differentiation between marine and freshwater ecotypes. Finally, we identified the genetic architecture underlying two key CpG sites that were differentially methylated between ecotypes. These findings demonstrate a potential role for DNA methylation in facilitating adaptation to divergent environments and improve our understanding of the heritable basis of population epigenomic variation.© The Author(s) 2021.

We describe changes in the environment and lifestyle of school children in Cyprus before the lockdown and during school re-opening, and assess compliance to NPI, using the exposome concept.During June 2020, parents completed an online questionnaire about their children's lifestyle/behaviours for two periods; school re-opening (May 21-June 26) following the population-wide lockdown, and the school period before lockdown (before March).Responses were received for 1509 children from over 180 primary schools. More than 72% of children complied with most NPI measures; however, only 48% decreased the number of vulnerable contacts at home. Sugary food consumption was higher in the post-lockdown period with 37% and 26% of the children eating sugary items daily and 4-6 times/week, compared to 33% and 19%, respectively, for the pre-lockdown period (p<0.001). Children's physical activity decreased compared to pre-lockdown (p<0.001), while screen time increased in the post-lockdown period, with 25% of children spending 4-7 hours/day in front of screens vs. 10% in the pre-lockdown period (p<0.001). About half of the children washed their hands with soap 4-7 times/day post-lockdown vs. 30% in the pre-lockdown period (p<0.001).This national survey showed a high degree of compliance to NPI measures among school children. Furthermore, the exposome profile of children may be affected in the months following NPI measures due to alterations in diet, physical activity, sedentary behaviour, and hand hygiene habits.Partial funding by the EXPOSOGAS project, H2020 Research and Innovation Programme (grant #810995).© 2021 The Author(s)."

Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of vitiligo have identified approximately 100 genetic variants. However, the identification of functional genes and their regulatory elements remains a challenge. To prioritize putative functional genes and DNAm sites, we performed a Summary data-based Mendelian Randomization (SMR) and heterogeneity in dependent instruments (HEIDI) test to integrate omics summary statistics from GWAS, expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL), and methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTL) analysis of large sample size. By integrating omics data, we identified two newly putative functional genes (SPATA2LandCDK10) associated with vitiligo and further validatedCDK10by qRT-PCR in independent samples. We also identified 17 vitiligo-associated DNA methylation (DNAm) sites in Chr16, of which cg05175606 was significantly associated with the expression ofCDK10and vitiligo. Colocalization analyses detected transcript ofCDK10in the blood and skin colocalizing with cg05175606 at single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs77651727. Our findings revealed that a shared genetic variant rs77651727 alters the cg05175606 as well as up-regulates gene expression ofCDK10and further decreases the risk of vitiligo.Copyright © 2021 Cai, Yuan, Huang, Gui, Zhang, Meng, Wu, Sheng and Zhang."
"33676569","Association of expression of epigenetic molecular factors with DNA methylation and sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents in cancer cell lines.","Clin Epigenetics","Altered DNA methylation patterns play important roles in cancer development and progression. We examined whether expression levels of genes directly or indirectly involved in DNA methylation and demethylation may be associated with response of cancer cell lines to chemotherapy treatment with a variety of antitumor agents.We analyzed 72 genes encoding epigenetic factors directly or indirectly involved in DNA methylation and demethylation processes. We examined association of their pretreatment expression levels with methylation beta-values of individual DNA methylation probes, DNA methylation averaged within gene regions, and average epigenome-wide methylation levels. We analyzed data from 645 cancer cell lines and 23 cancer types from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia and Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer datasets. We observed numerous correlations between expression of genes encoding epigenetic factors and response to chemotherapeutic agents. Expression of genes encoding a variety of epigenetic factors, including KDM2B, DNMT1, EHMT2, SETDB1, EZH2, APOBEC3G, and other genes, was correlated with response to multiple agents. DNA methylation of numerous target probes and gene regions was associated with expression of multiple genes encoding epigenetic factors, underscoring complex regulation of epigenome methylation by multiple intersecting molecular pathways. The genes whose expression was associated with methylation of multiple epigenome targets encode DNA methyltransferases, TET DNA methylcytosine dioxygenases, the methylated DNA-binding protein ZBTB38, KDM2B, SETDB1, and other molecular factors which are involved in diverse epigenetic processes affecting DNA methylation. While baseline DNA methylation of numerous epigenome targets was correlated with cell line response to antitumor agents, the complex relationships between the overlapping effects of each epigenetic factor on methylation of specific targets and the importance of such influences in tumor response to individual agents require further investigation.Expression of multiple genes encoding epigenetic factors is associated with drug response and with DNA methylation of numerous epigenome targets that may affect response to therapeutic agents. Our findings suggest complex and interconnected pathways regulating DNA methylation in the epigenome, which may both directly and indirectly affect response to chemotherapy."

We performed genome wide methylation and whole transcriptome analyses to elucidate the early pathogenesis of CP in extremely low gestational age neonates (ELGANs). We evaluated peripheral blood cell specimens collected during a randomized trial of erythropoietin for neuroprotection in the ELGAN (PENUT Trial, NCT# 01378273). DNA methylation data were generated from 94 PENUT subjects (n = 47 CP vs. n = 47 Control) on day 1 and 14 of life. Gene expression data were generated from a subset of 56 subjects. Only one differentially methylated region was identified for the day 1 to 14 change between CP versus no CP, without evidence for differential gene expression of the associated gene RNA Pseudouridine Synthase Domain Containing 2. iPathwayGuide meta-analyses identified a relevant upregulation of JAK1 expression in the setting of decreased methylation that was observed in control subjects but not CP subjects. Evaluation of whole transcriptome data identified several top pathways of potential clinical relevance including thermogenesis, ferroptossis, ribosomal activity and other neurodegenerative conditions that differentiated CP from controls."
"33673725","Genetics and Epigenetics in Asthma.","Int J Mol Sci","Asthma is one of the most common respiratory disease that affects both children and adults worldwide, with diverse phenotypes and underlying pathogenetic mechanisms poorly understood. As technology in genome sequencing progressed, scientific efforts were made to explain and predict asthma's complexity and heterogeneity, and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) quickly became the preferred study method. Several gene markers and loci associated with asthma susceptibility, atopic and childhood-onset asthma were identified during the last few decades. Markers near theORMDL3/GSDMBgenes were associated with childhood-onset asthma, interleukin (IL)33 andIL1RL1SNPs were associated with atopic asthma, and theThymic Stromal Lymphopoietin (TSLP)gene was identified as protective against the risk to TH2-asthma. The latest efforts and advances in identifying and decoding asthma susceptibility are focused on epigenetics, heritable characteristics that affect gene expression without altering DNA sequence, with DNA methylation being the most described mechanism. Other less studied epigenetic mechanisms include histone modifications and alterations of miR expression. Recent findings suggest that the DNA methylation pattern is tissue and cell-specific. Several studies attempt to describe DNA methylation of different types of cells and tissues of asthmatic patients that regulate airway remodeling, phagocytosis, and other lung functions in asthma. In this review, we attempt to briefly present the latest advancements in the field of genetics and mainly epigenetics concerning asthma susceptibility."

Our understanding of how 1C pathways operate, however, pertains mostly to the (rat) liver. Here we report that transcripts for all bar two genes (i.e.,BHMT,MAT1A) encoding enzymes in the linked methionine-folate cycles are expressed in all cell types within the ovarian follicle, oocyte, and blastocyst in the cow, sheep, and pig; as well as in rat granulosa cells (GCs) and human KGN cells (a granulosa-like tumor cell line). Betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT) protein was absent in bovine theca and GCs, as was activity of this enzyme in GCs. Mathematical modeling predicted that absence of this enzyme would lead to more volatile S-adenosylmethionine-mediated transmethylation in response to 1C substrate (e.g., methionine) or cofactor provision. We tested the sensitivity of bovine GCs to reduced methionine (from 50 to 10 µM) and observed a diminished flux of 1C units through the methionine cycle. We then used reduced-representation bisulfite sequencing to demonstrate that this reduction in methionine during bovine embryo culture leads to genome-wide alterations to DNA methylation in >1600 genes, including a cohort of imprinted genes linked to an abnormal fetal-overgrowth phenotype. Bovine ovarian and embryonic cells are acutely sensitive to methionine, but further experimentation is required to determine the significance of interspecific variation in BHMT expression."
"33669975","Extensive Placental Methylation Profiling in Normal Pregnancies.","Int J Mol Sci","The placental methylation pattern is crucial for the regulation of genes involved in trophoblast invasion and placental development, both key events for fetal growth. We investigated LINE-1 methylation and methylome profiling using a methylation EPIC array and the targeted methylation sequencing of 154 normal, full-term pregnancies, stratified by birth weight percentiles. LINE-1 methylation showed evidence of a more pronounced hypomethylation in small neonates compared with normal and large for gestational age. Genome-wide methylation, performed in two subsets of pregnancies, showed very similar methylation profiles among cord blood samples while placentae from different pregnancies appeared very variable. A unique methylation profile emerged in each placenta, which could represent the sum of adjustments that the placenta made during the pregnancy to preserve the epigenetic homeostasis of the fetus. Investigations into the 1000 most variable sites between cord blood and the placenta showed that promoters and gene bodies that are hypermethylated in the placenta are associated with blood-specific functions, whereas those that are hypomethylated belong mainly to pathways involved in cancer. These features support the functional analogies between a placenta and cancer. Our results, which provide a comprehensive analysis of DNA methylation profiling in the human placenta, suggest that its peculiar dynamicity can be relevant for understanding placental plasticity in response to the environment."

Current evidence, however, is mostly limited to candidate gene analysis in whole blood. To clarify the association between opioid abuse and DNA methylation, we conducted an epigenome-wide analysis of DNA methylation in brain samples of individuals who died from acute opioid intoxication and group-matched controls.Tissue samples were extracted from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of 153 deceased individuals (Mage= 35.42; 62 % male; 77 % European ancestry). The study included 72 opioid samples, 53 psychiatric controls, and 28 normal controls. The epigenome-wide analysis was implemented using the Illumina MethylationEPIC BeadChip; analyses adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics, negative control principal components, ancestry principal components, cellular composition, and surrogate variables. Horvath's epigenetic age and Levine's PhenoAge were calculated, and gene set enrichment analyses were performed.Although no CpG sites survived false-discovery rate correction for multiple testing, 13 sites surpassed a relaxed significance threshold (p < 1.0 × 10-5). One of these sites was located within Netrin-1, a gene implicated in kappa opioid receptor activity. There was an association between opioid use and accelerated PhenoAge (b = 2.24, se = 1.11, p = .045). Gene set enrichment analyses revealed enrichment of differential methylation in GO and KEGG pathways broadly related to substance use.Netrin-1 may be associated with opioid overdose, and future research with larger samples across stages of opioid use will elucidate the complex genomics of opioid abuse.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Here we examine the hypothesis that cancer-specific DNA-methylation reflects the tissue of origin or carcinogenic risk factor, and these methylation abnormalities may be used to faithfully classify tumours according to histology. We present an analysis of 7427 tumours representing 19 human malignancies and 708 normal samples demonstrating that specific tumour changes in methylation can correctly determine site of origin and tumour histology with 86% overall accuracy.

"33663600","DNA methylation mediates the effect of maternal smoking on offspring birthweight: a birth cohort study of multi-ethnic US mother-newborn pairs.","Clin Epigenetics","Maternal smoking affects more than half a million pregnancies each year in the US and is known to result in fetal growth restriction as measured by lower birthweight and its associated long-term consequences. Maternal smoking also has been linked to altered fetal DNA methylation (DNAm). However, what remains largely unexplored is whether these DNAm alterations are merely markers of smoking exposure or if they also have implications for health outcomes. This study tested the hypothesis that fetal DNAm mediates the effect of maternal smoking on newborn birthweight.This study included mother-newborn pairs from a US predominantly urban, low-income multi-ethnic birth cohort. DNAm in cord blood were determined using the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip. After standard quality control and normalization procedures, an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of maternal smoking was performed using linear regression models, controlling for maternal age, education, race, parity, pre-pregnancy body mass index, alcohol consumption, gestational age, maternal pregestational/gestational diabetes, child sex, cord blood cell compositions and batch effects. To quantify the degree to which cord DNAm mediates the smoking-birthweight association, the VanderWeele-Vansteelandt approach for single mediator and structural equational model for multiple mediators were used, adjusting for pertinent covariates.The study included 954 mother-newborn pairs. Among mothers, 165 (17.3%) ever smoked before or during pregnancy. Newborns with smoking exposure had on average 258 g lower birthweight than newborns without exposure (P < 0.001). Using a false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05 as the significance cutoff, the EWAS identified 38 differentially methylated CpG sites associated with maternal smoking. Of those, 17 CpG sites were mapped to previously reported genes: GFI1, AHRR, CYP1A1, and CNTNAP2; 8 of those, located in the first three genes, were Bonferroni significantly associated with newborn birthweight and mediated the smoking-birthweight association. The combined mediation effect of the three genes explained 67.8% of the smoking-birthweight association.Our study not only lends further support that maternal smoking alters fetal DNAm in a multiethnic population, but also suggests that fetal DNAm substantially mediates the maternal smoking-birthweight association. Our findings, if further validated, indicate that DNAm modification is likely an important pathway by which maternal smoking impairs fetal growth and, perhaps, even long-term health outcomes."

Cognitive performance (Full Scale Intelligence Quotient, Verbal Comprehension, Working Memory, Perceptual Reasoning, and Processing Speed) was assessed using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children. Neuronal function was assessed using magnetoencephalographic (MEG) brain imaging.Of 119 mother-child pairs in the FASSTT trial, 68 children were assessed for neurocognitive performance at 11-year follow-up (Dec 2017 to Nov 2018). Children of mothers randomised to FA compared with placebo scored significantly higher in two Processing Speed tests, i.e. symbol search (mean difference 2.9 points, 95% CI 0.3 to 5.5, p = 0.03) and cancellation (11.3 points, 2.5 to 20.1, p = 0.04), whereas the positive effect on Verbal Comprehension was significant in girls only (6.5 points, 1.2 to 11.8, p = 0.03). MEG assessment of neuronal responses to a language task showed increased power at the Beta (13-30 Hz, p = 0.01) and High Gamma (49-70 Hz, p = 0.04) bands in children from FA-supplemented mothers, suggesting more efficient semantic processing of language.Continued FA supplementation in pregnancy beyond the early period currently recommended to prevent NTD can benefit neurocognitive development of the child.

Peripheral blood DNA methylation was measured (pre/post) with the Illumina HumanMethylationEPIC array and the Hannum, Horvath, and PhenoAge DNA methylation age clocks were used. Linear regression models adjusted for chronological age and sex tested the relationship between DNA methylation age and grip strength, gait speed, sit-to-stand, and 6-min walk.Participant mean weight loss was 4.6 kg, and DNA methylation age decreased 0.8, 1.1, and 0.5 years using the Hannum, Horvath, and PhenoAge DNA methylation clocks respectively. Mean grip strength increased 3.2 kg. Decreased Hannum methylation age was significantly associated with increased grip strength (β = -0.30, p = 0.04), and increased gait speed (β = 0.02, p = 0.05), in adjusted models. Similarly, decreased methylation age using the PhenoAge clock was associated with significantly increased gait speed (β = 0.02, p = 0.04). A decrease in Horvath DNA methylation age and increase in physical functional ability did not demonstrate a significant association.The observed relationship between increased physical functional ability and decreased biological age using DNA methylation clocks demonstrate the potential utility of DNA methylation clocks to assess interventional approaches to improve health in older obese adults.National Institute on Aging (NIA), NCT03104192.

"33658387","Predicting transcriptional responses to cold stress across plant species.","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","Although genome-sequence assemblies are available for a growing number of plant species, gene-expression responses to stimuli have been cataloged for only a subset of these species. Many genes show altered transcription patterns in response to abiotic stresses. However, orthologous genes in related species often exhibit different responses to a given stress. Accordingly, data on the regulation of gene expression in one species are not reliable predictors of orthologous gene responses in a related species. Here, we trained a supervised classification model to identify genes that transcriptionally respond to cold stress. A model trained with only features calculated directly from genome assemblies exhibited only modest decreases in performance relative to models trained by using genomic, chromatin, and evolution/diversity features. Models trained with data from one species successfully predicted which genes would respond to cold stress in other related species. Cross-species predictions remained accurate when training was performed in cold-sensitive species and predictions were performed in cold-tolerant species and vice versa. Models trained with data on gene expression in multiple species provided at least equivalent performance to models trained and tested in a single species and outperformed single-species models in cross-species prediction. These results suggest that classifiers trained on stress data from well-studied species may suffice for predicting gene-expression patterns in related, less-studied species with sequenced genomes.Copyright © 2021 the Author(s).

"33672064","Implementing Precision Medicine in Human Frailty through Epigenetic Biomarkers.","Int J Environ Res Public Health","The main epigenetic features in aging are: reduced bulk levels of core histones, altered pattern of histone post-translational modifications, changes in the pattern of DNA methylation, replacement of canonical histones with histone variants, and altered expression of non-coding RNA. The identification of epigenetic mechanisms may contribute to the early detection of age-associated subclinical changes or deficits at the molecular and/or cellular level, to predict the development of frailty, or even more interestingly, to improve health trajectories in older adults. Frailty reflects a state of increased vulnerability to stressors as a result of decreased physiologic reserves, and even dysregulation of multiple physiologic systems leading to adverse health outcomes for individuals of the same chronological age. A key approach to overcome the challenges of frailty is the development of biomarkers to improve early diagnostic accuracy and to predict trajectories in older individuals. The identification of epigenetic biomarkers of frailty could provide important support for the clinical diagnosis of frailty, or more specifically, to the evaluation of its associated risks. Interventional studies aimed at delaying the onset of frailty and the functional alterations associated with it, would also undoubtedly benefit from the identification of frailty biomarkers.

Single-cell sequencing technologies are powerful tools to explore cells, however analysis is typically gene-centric and TE expression has not been addressed. Here, we develop a single-cell TE processing pipeline, scTE, and report the expression of TEs in single cells in a range of biological contexts. Specific TE types are expressed in subpopulations of embryonic stem cells and are dynamically regulated during pluripotency reprogramming, differentiation, and embryogenesis. Unexpectedly, TEs are expressed in somatic cells, including human disease-specific TEs that are undetectable in bulk analyses. Finally, we apply scTE to single-cell ATAC-seq data, and demonstrate that scTE can discriminate cell type using chromatin accessibly of TEs alone. Overall, our results classify the dynamic patterns of TEs in single cells and their contributions to cell heterogeneity."
"33669384","DNA Methylation, Mechanisms of <i>FMR1</i> Inactivation and Therapeutic Perspectives for Fragile X Syndrome.","Biomolecules","Among the inherited causes of intellectual disability and autism, Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most frequent form, for which there is currently no cure. In most FXS patients, theFMR1gene is epigenetically inactivated following the expansion over 200 triplets of a CGG repeat (FM: full mutation).FMR1encodes the Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP), which binds several mRNAs, mainly in the brain. When the FM becomes methylated at 10-12 weeks of gestation, theFMR1gene is transcriptionally silent. The molecular mechanisms involved in the epigenetic silencing are not fully elucidated. Among FXS families, there is a rare occurrence of males carrying a FM, which remains active because it is not methylated, thus ensuring enough FMRPs to allow for an intellectual development within normal range. Which mechanisms are responsible for sparing these individuals from being affected by FXS? In order to answer this critical question, which may have possible implications for FXS therapy, several potential epigenetic mechanisms have been described. Here, we focus on current knowledge about the role of DNA methylation and other epigenetic modifications inFMR1gene silencing."

Eighty volunteers were recruited, including 30 pairs of RA patients and their spouses, and 20 healthy individuals. Fresh stool samples were collected, processed, and 16S rRNA-sequencing was performed. Data were analyzed using an operational taxonomic units-based method, and community structure assessments were performed. Community composition analysis indicated that there were similar intestinal microbiota structures in RA and in their respective spouses. Gut microbiota in spouses of RA were different from those of the healthy controls group, but these differences were not significant. We found thatBlautiaspp. andStreptococcusspp. were two most associated species in RA and these taxa were significantly higher in comparison to healthy controls. In contrast, our findings suggested thatRoseburiaspp. andLachnoclostridiumspp. were significantly lower in the RA in comparison to healthy controls. In conclusion, RA patients shared similar gut microbiota pattern with their spouses which were different from healthy individuals. The findings suggest that disturbance of the balance of gut microbiota may play an important role in the dynamics of pathogenesis of RA.Copyright © 2020 Liu, Wu, Luo, Wei, Lu, Zhou, Wang, Miao, Lin, Zhao, Liu and Liu."

These thermogenic fat cells were originally considered to function solely in heat generation through the action of the mitochondrial protein uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). In recent years, significant advances have been made in our understanding of the ontogeny, bioenergetics and physiological functions of thermogenic fat. Distinct subtypes of thermogenic adipocytes have been identified with unique developmental origins, which have been increasingly dissected in cellular and molecular detail. Moreover, several UCP1-independent thermogenic mechanisms have been described, expanding the role of these cells in energy homeostasis. Recent studies have also delineated roles for these cells beyond the regulation of thermogenesis, including as dynamic secretory cells and as a metabolic sink. This Review presents our current understanding of thermogenic adipocytes with an emphasis on their development, biological functions and roles in systemic physiology."

We developed a new method (case-case genome-wide association study; CC-GWAS) to test for differences in allele frequency between cases of two disorders using summary statistics from the respective case-control GWAS, transcending current methods that require individual-level data. Simulations and analytical computations confirm that CC-GWAS is well powered with effective control of type I error. We applied CC-GWAS to publicly available summary statistics for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder and five other psychiatric disorders. CC-GWAS identified 196 independent case-case loci, including 72 CC-GWAS-specific loci that were not significant at the genome-wide level in the input case-control summary statistics; two of the CC-GWAS-specific loci implicate the genes KLF6 and KLF16 (from the Krüppel-like family of transcription factors), which have been linked to neurite outgrowth and axon regeneration. CC-GWAS loci replicated convincingly in applications to datasets with independent replication data."

Here, we seek to quantify the proportion of genetic variation for a complex trait shared between continental populations. We estimated the between-population correlation of genetic effects at all SNPs ([Formula: see text]) or genome-wide significant SNPs ([Formula: see text]) for height and body mass index (BMI) in samples of European (EUR; [Formula: see text]) and African (AFR; [Formula: see text]) ancestry.

There was no evidence that [Formula: see text] differs in SNP groups with different levels of between-population difference in allele frequency or linkage disequilibrium, which, however, can be due to the lack of power."
"33712570","Integration of Alzheimer's disease genetics and myeloid genomics identifies disease risk regulatory elements and genes.","Nat Commun","Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified more than 40 loci associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the causal variants, regulatory elements, genes and pathways remain largely unknown, impeding a mechanistic understanding of AD pathogenesis. Previously, we showed that AD risk alleles are enriched in myeloid-specific epigenomic annotations. Here, we show that they are specifically enriched in active enhancers of monocytes, macrophages and microglia. We integrated AD GWAS with myeloid epigenomic and transcriptomic datasets using analytical approaches to link myeloid enhancer activity to target gene expression regulation and AD risk modification. We identify AD risk enhancers and nominate candidate causal genes among their likely targets (including AP4E1, AP4M1, APBB3, BIN1, MS4A4A, MS4A6A, PILRA, RABEP1, SPI1, TP53INP1, and ZYX) in twenty loci. Fine-mapping of these enhancers nominates candidate functional variants that likely modify AD risk by regulating gene expression in myeloid cells. In the MS4A locus we identified a single candidate functional variant and validated it in human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived microglia and brain. Taken together, this study integrates AD GWAS with multiple myeloid genomic datasets to investigate the mechanisms of AD risk alleles and nominates candidate functional variants, regulatory elements and genes that likely modulate disease susceptibility."

We highlight the use of genome editing technologies in GWAS functional studies to modify genomic sequences, with proof-of-principle examples.

"33664492","Transcriptional mediators of treatment resistance in lethal prostate cancer.","Nat Med","Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer is typically lethal, exhibiting intrinsic or acquired resistance to second-generation androgen-targeting therapies and minimal response to immune checkpoint inhibitors1. Cellular programs driving resistance in both cancer and immune cells remain poorly understood. We present single-cell transcriptomes from 14 patients with advanced prostate cancer, spanning all common metastatic sites. Irrespective of treatment exposure, adenocarcinoma cells pervasively coexpressed multiple androgen receptor isoforms, including truncated isoforms hypothesized to mediate resistance to androgen-targeting therapies2,3. Resistance to enzalutamide was associated with cancer cell-intrinsic epithelial-mesenchymal transition and transforming growth factor-β signaling. Small cell carcinoma cells exhibited divergent expression programs driven by transcriptional regulators promoting lineage plasticity and HOXB5, HOXB6 and NR1D2 (refs.4-6). Additionally, a subset of patients had high expression of dysfunction markers on cytotoxic CD8+T cells undergoing clonal expansion following enzalutamide treatment. Collectively, the transcriptional characterization of cancer and immune cells from human metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer provides a basis for the development of therapeutic approaches complementing androgen signaling inhibition."

Yet, little is understood about how the environment shapes children's genetic predisposition for these behaviors during this time. The Baylor Infant Twin Study (BITS) is a two phase study, initiated to study obesity risk factors from infancy. Data collection has been completed for Phase 1 in which three sub-studies pilot central measures for Phase 2. A novel infant temperament assessment, based on observations made by trained researchers was piloted inBehavior Observation Pilot Protocol(BOPP) study, a new device for measuring infant feeding parameters (the ""orometer"") in theBaylor Infant Orometer(BIO), and methods for analyzing DNA methylation in twins of unknown chorionicity inEpiTwin.EpiTwin was a cross-sectional study of neonatal twins, while up to three study visits occurred for the other studies, at 4- (BOPP, BIO), 6- (BOPP), and 12- (BOPP, BIO) of age. Measurements for BOPP and BIO included temperament observations, feeding observations, and body composition assessments while EpiTwin focused on collecting samples of hair, urine, nails, and blood for quantifying methylation levels at 10 metastable epialleles. Additional data collected include demographic information, zygosity, chorionicity, and questionnaire-based measures of infant behaviors.Recruitment for all three studies was completed in early 2020. EpiTwin recruited 80 twin pairs (50% monochorionic), 31 twin pairs completed the BOPP protocol, and 68 singleton infants participated in BIO.The psychometric properties of the data from all three studies are being analyzed currently. The resulting findings will inform the development of the full BITS protocol, with the goal of completing assessments at 4-, 6-, 12-, and 14-month of age for 400 twin pairs.© 2020 The Authors.

"33723435","Long-term behavioral and cell-type-specific molecular effects of early life stress are mediated by H3K79me2 dynamics in medium spiny neurons.","Nat Neurosci","Animals susceptible to chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) exhibit depression-related behaviors, with aberrant transcription across several limbic brain regions, most notably in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Early life stress (ELS) promotes susceptibility to CSDS in adulthood, but associated enduring changes in transcriptional control mechanisms in the NAc have not yet been investigated. In this study, we examined long-lasting changes to histone modifications in the NAc of male and female mice exposed to ELS. Dimethylation of lysine 79 of histone H3 (H3K79me2) and the enzymes (DOT1L and KDM2B) that control this modification are enriched in D2-type medium spiny neurons and are shown to be crucial for the expression of ELS-induced stress susceptibility. We mapped the site-specific regulation of this histone mark genome wide to reveal the transcriptional networks it modulates. Finally, systemic delivery of a small molecule inhibitor of DOT1L reversed ELS-induced behavioral deficits, indicating the clinical relevance of this epigenetic mechanism."
"33723220","Depression treatment response to ketamine: sex-specific role of interleukin-8, but not other inflammatory markers.","Transl Psychiatry","Inflammation plays a role in depression pathophysiology and treatment response, with effects varying by sex and therapeutic modality. Lower levels of interleukin(IL)-8 predict depression response to antidepressant medication and to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), although ECT effects are specific to females. Whether IL-8 predicts depression response to ketamine and in a sex-specific manner is not known. Here, depressed patients (n = 46; female, n = 17) received open label infusion of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg over 40 min; NCT02165449). Plasma levels of IL-8 were evaluated at baseline and post-treatment. Baseline levels of IL-8 had a trending association with response to ketamine, depending upon sex (responder status × sex interaction: p = 0.096), in which lower baseline levels of IL-8 in females (p = 0.095) but not males (p = 0.96) trended with treatment response. Change in levels of IL-8 from baseline to post-treatment differed significantly by responder status (defined as ≥50% reduction in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale [HAM-D] Score), depending upon sex (responder status × sex × time interaction: F(1,42)=6.68, p = 0.01). In addition, change in IL-8 interacted with sex to predict change in HAM-D score (β = -0.63, p = 0.003); increasing IL-8 was associated with decreasing HAM-D score in females (p = 0.08) whereas the inverse was found in males (p = 0.02). Other inflammatory markers (IL-6, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor-α, C-reactive protein) were explored with no significant relationships identified. Given these preliminary findings, further evaluation of sex differences in the relationship between IL-8 and treatment response is warranted to elucidate mechanisms of response and aid in the development of personalized approaches to depression treatment."
"33637528","Diversified transcriptional responses of myeloid and glial cells in spinal cord injury shaped by HDAC3 activity.","Sci Adv","The innate immune response influences neural repair after spinal cord injury (SCI). Here, we combined myeloid-specific transcriptomics and single-cell RNA sequencing to uncover not only a common core but also temporally distinct gene programs in injury-activated microglia and macrophages (IAM). Intriguingly, we detected a wide range of microglial cell states even in healthy spinal cord. Upon injury, IAM progressively acquired overall reparative, yet diversified transcriptional profiles, each comprising four transcriptional subtypes with specialized tasks. Notably, IAM have both distinct and common gene signatures as compared to neurodegeneration-associated microglia, both engaging phagocytosis, autophagy, and TyroBP pathways. We also identified an immediate response microglia subtype serving as a source population for microglial transformation and a proliferative subtype controlled by the epigenetic regulator histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3). Together, our data unveil diversification of myeloid and glial subtypes in SCI and an extensive influence of HDAC3, which may be exploited to enhance functional recovery.Copyright © 2021 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

African Americans have higher burden of CVD morbidity and mortality compared to any other racial group. Identifying biomarkers for clinical risk prediction of CVD offers an opportunity for precision prevention and earlier intervention.Using linear mixed models, we investigated the cross-sectional association between four measures of epigenetic age acceleration (intrinsic (IEAA), extrinsic (EEAA), PhenoAge (PhenoAA), and GrimAge (GrimAA)) and ten cardiometabolic markers of hypertension, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia in 1,100 primarily hypertensive African Americans from sibships in the Genetic Epidemiology Network of Arteriopathy (GENOA). We then assessed the association between epigenetic age acceleration and time to self-reported incident CVD using frailty hazard models and investigated CVD risk prediction improvement compared to models with clinical risk scores (Framingham risk score (FRS) and the atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk equation). After adjusting for sex and chronological age, increased epigenetic age acceleration was associated with higher systolic blood pressure (IEAA), higher pulse pressure (EEAA and GrimAA), higher fasting glucose (PhenoAA and GrimAA), higher fasting insulin (EEAA), lower low density cholesterol (GrimAA), and higher triglycerides (GrimAA). A five-year increase in GrimAA was associated with CVD incidence with a hazard ratio of 1.54 (95% CI 1.22-2.01) and remained significant after adjusting for CVD risk factors. The addition of GrimAA to risk score models improved model fit using likelihood ratio tests (P = 0.013 for FRS and P = 0.008 for ASCVD), but did not improve C statistics (P > 0.05). Net reclassification index (NRI) showed small but significant improvement in reassignment of risk categories with the addition of GrimAA to FRS (NRI: 0.055, 95% CI 0.040-0.071) and the ASCVD equation (NRI: 0.029, 95% CI 0.006-0.064).Epigenetic age acceleration measures are associated with traditional CVD risk factors in an African-American cohort with a high prevalence of hypertension. GrimAA was associated with CVD incidence and slightly improved prediction of CVD events over clinical risk scores."
"33712580","DNA methylation predicts age and provides insight into exceptional longevity of bats.","Nat Commun","Exceptionally long-lived species, including many bats, rarely show overt signs of aging, making it difficult to determine why species differ in lifespan. Here, we use DNA methylation (DNAm) profiles from 712 known-age bats, representing 26 species, to identify epigenetic changes associated with age and longevity. We demonstrate that DNAm accurately predicts chronological age. Across species, longevity is negatively associated with the rate of DNAm change at age-associated sites. Furthermore, analysis of several bat genomes reveals that hypermethylated age- and longevity-associated sites are disproportionately located in promoter regions of key transcription factors (TF) and enriched for histone and chromatin features associated with transcriptional regulation. Predicted TF binding site motifs and enrichment analyses indicate that age-related methylation change is influenced by developmental processes, while longevity-related DNAm change is associated with innate immunity or tumorigenesis genes, suggesting that bat longevity results from augmented immune response and cancer suppression."

We evaluated the role of multiple factors, including fat deposition, cardiometabolic risk factors and lifestyle weight-loss intervention, on the deviation of mAge from chronological age (mAge deviation) or 18-month change in mAge (∆mAge). In this sub-study of the CENTRAL magnetic resonance imaging weight-loss trial, we evaluated mAge by a validated 240-CpG-based prediction formula at baseline and after 18-month intervention of either low fat (LF) or mediterranean/low carbohydrate (MED/LC) diets.Among 120 CENTRAL participants with abdominal obesity or dyslipidemia, mAge (mean ± SD: 60.3 ± 7.5 years) was higher than the chronological age (48.6 ± 9.3 years) but strongly correlated (r = 0.93; p = 3.1 × 10-53). Participants in the lowest tertile of mAge deviation from their chronological age had significantly lower waist-circumference, visceral adipose tissue, intrahepatic fat (IHF) content, fasting-glucose and HOMA-IR, as compared with participants in the highest sex-specific residual tertile (p < 0.05 for all). IHF% remained associated with greater mAge deviation after further adjustments (β = 0.23; p = 0.02). After 18-month weight-loss lifestyle intervention, mAge remained significantly correlated with chronological age (r = 0.94, p = 1.5 × 10-55). mAging occurred, with no difference between lifestyle intervention groups (∆ = 0.9 ± 1.9 years in MED/LC vs. ∆ = 1.3 ± 1.9 years in LF; p = 0.2); however, we observed a mAging attenuation in successful weight losers (> 5% weight loss) vs. weight-loss failures ( ∆ = 0.6 years vs. ∆ = 1.1 years; p = 0.04), and in participants who completed the trial with healthy liver fat content (< 5% IHF) vs. participants with fatty liver (∆ = 0.6 years vs. ∆ = 1.8 years; p = 0.003). Overall, 18 months of weight-loss lifestyle intervention attenuated the mAging of the men, mainly the older, by 7.1 months than the expected (p < 0.05).Lifestyle weight-loss intervention may attenuate mAging.

"33741907","Identification of disease treatment mechanisms through the multiscale interactome.","Nat Commun","Most diseases disrupt multiple proteins, and drugs treat such diseases by restoring the functions of the disrupted proteins. How drugs restore these functions, however, is often unknown as a drug's therapeutic effects are not limited to the proteins that the drug directly targets. Here, we develop the multiscale interactome, a powerful approach to explain disease treatment. We integrate disease-perturbed proteins, drug targets, and biological functions into a multiscale interactome network. We then develop a random walk-based method that captures how drug effects propagate through a hierarchy of biological functions and physical protein-protein interactions. On three key pharmacological tasks, the multiscale interactome predicts drug-disease treatment, identifies proteins and biological functions related to treatment, and predicts genes that alter a treatment's efficacy and adverse reactions. Our results indicate that physical interactions between proteins alone cannot explain treatment since many drugs treat diseases by affecting the biological functions disrupted by the disease rather than directly targeting disease proteins or their regulators. We provide a general framework for explaining treatment, even when drugs seem unrelated to the diseases they are recommended for."

Other algorithms rooted in DNA sequence predict potential polyadenylation sites; however, in vivo expression of a particular site varies based on a myriad of conditions. Here, we introduce aptardi (alternative polyadenylation transcriptome analysis from RNA-Seq data and DNA sequence information), which leverages both DNA sequence and RNA sequencing in a machine learning paradigm to predict expressed polyadenylation sites. Specifically, as input aptardi takes DNA nucleotide sequence, genome-aligned RNA-Seq data, and an initial transcriptome. The program evaluates these initial transcripts to identify expressed polyadenylation sites in the biological sample and refines transcript 3'-ends accordingly. The average precision of the aptardi model is twice that of a standard transcriptome assembler. In particular, the recall of the aptardi model (the proportion of true polyadenylation sites detected by the algorithm) is improved by over three-fold. Also, the model-trained using the Human Brain Reference RNA commercial standard-performs well when applied to RNA-sequencing samples from different tissues and different mammalian species. Finally, aptardi's input is simple to compile and its output is easily amenable to downstream analyses such as quantitation and differential expression."

Here, we establish anin silicopipeline to identify specific PPI sub-networks containing mutated proteins as potential targets, which we apply to mutation data of four different leukaemias. Our method is based on extracting cyclic interactions of a small number of proteins topologically and functionally linked in the Protein-Protein Interaction Network (PPIN), which we call short loop network motifs (SLM). We uncover a new property of PPINs named 'short loop commonality' to measure indirect PPIs occurring via common SLM interactions. This detects 'modules' of PPI networks enriched with annotated biological functions of proteins containing mutation hotspots, exemplified by FLT3 and other receptor tyrosine kinase proteins. We further identify functional dependency or mutual exclusivity of short loop commonality pairs in large-scale cellular CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screening data.

While this phenomenon has been attributed to complementation and epistatic effects, the physiological and developmental synergism involved have not been fully illuminated by the QTL mapping approach alone, especially for stress-adaptive traits involving highly complex interactions. By systems-level profiling of the IR29 × Pokkali recombinant inbred population of rice, we addressed the hypothesis that novel salinity tolerance phenotypes are created by reconfigured physiological networks due to positive or negative coupling-uncoupling of developmental and physiological attributes of each parent. Real-time growth and hyperspectral profiling distinguished the transgressive individuals in terms of stress penalty to growth. Non-parental network signatures that led to either optimal or non-optimal integration of developmental with stress-related mechanisms were evident at the macro-physiological, biochemical, metabolic, and transcriptomic levels. Large positive net gain in super-tolerant progeny was due to ideal complementation of beneficial traits while shedding antagonistic traits. Super-sensitivity was explained by the stacking of multiple antagonistic traits and loss of major beneficial traits. The synergism uncovered by the phenomics approach in this study supports the modern views of the Omnigenic Theory, emphasizing the synergy or lack thereof between core and peripheral components. This study also supports a breeding paradigm rooted on genomic modeling from multi-dimensional genetic, physiological, and phenotypic profiles to create novel adaptive traits for new crop varieties of the 21st century.Copyright © 2021 Pabuayon, Kitazumi, Cushman, Singh, Gregorio, Dhatt, Zabet-Moghaddam, Walia and de los Reyes."

We used the time and season of death of 932 individuals from GTEx to jointly investigate transcriptomic changes associated with those cycles across multiple tissues. For most tissues, we found little overlap between genes changing expression during day-night and among seasons. Although all tissues remodeled their transcriptomes, brain and gonadal tissues exhibited the highest seasonality, whereas those in the thoracic cavity showed stronger day-night regulation. Core clock genes displayed marked day-night differences across multiple tissues, which were largely conserved in baboon and mouse, but adapted to their nocturnal or diurnal habits. Seasonal variation of expression affected multiple pathways and were enriched among genes associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, they unveiled cytoarchitectural changes in brain subregions. Altogether, our results provide the first combined atlas of how transcriptomes from human tissues adapt to major cycling environmental conditions."

Stage 2 is followed by the development of extreme hyperphagia, also known as insatiable eating and fixation on food that often leads to obesity in early childhood. Other major features of PWS include obsessive-compulsive and hoarding behaviors, intellectual disability, and sleep abnormalities. PWS is genetic disorder mapping to imprinted 15q11.2-q13.3 locus, specifically at the paternally expressedSNORD116locus of small nucleolar RNAs and noncoding host gene transcripts.SNORD116is processed into several noncoding components and is hypothesized to orchestrate diurnal changes in metabolism through epigenetics, according to functional studies. Here, we review the current status of epigenetic mechanisms in PWS, with an emphasis on an emerging role forSNORD116in circadian and sleep phenotypes. We also summarize current ongoing therapeutic strategies, as well as potential implications for more common human metabolic and psychiatric disorders.Copyright © 2021 Mendiola and LaSalle."

This study aims to investigate the role of CYP2C19 gene DNA methylation as one of the epigenetic factors for the risk of clopidogrel resistance in STEMI patients undergoing PPCI. ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients undergoing PPCI were pretreated with clopidogrel, and their platelet function was measured using VerifyNow™ assay. The criteria for high on-treatment platelet reactivity (HPR) were defined according to the expert consensus criteria (PRU >208). DNA methylation of the CYP2C19 gene was performed using bisulfite genomic sequencing technology. Furthermore, clinical, laboratory, and angiographic data including TIMI flow were collected. Among 122 patients, clopidogrel resistance was found in 22%. DNA methylation level percentage was lower in the clopidogrel resistance group (76.7 vs. 88.8, p-value .038). But, the <50% methylation group was associated with increased risk of clopidogrel resistance (OR =4.5, 95%CI =2.1-9.3, p-value = .018). This group was also found to have suboptimal post-PCI TIMI flow (OR =3.4 95%CI =1.3-8.7, p-value =.045). The lower DNA methylation level of the CYP2C19 gene increases the risk of clopidogrel resistance and subsequent poorer clinical outcome.© 2021 The Authors.

Human amyloid precursor protein knock-in (KI) mice contain the Swedish and Iberian mutations (AppNL-F) or those two and also the Arctic mutation (AppNL-G-F). In this study, we assessed whether behavioral and cognitive performance in 6-month-old AppNL-F, AppNL-G-F, and C57BL/6J wild-type (WT) mice was associated with the gut microbiome, and whether the genotype modulates this association. The genotype effects observed in behavioral tests were test-dependent. The biodiversity and composition of the gut microbiome linked to various aspects of mouse behavioral and cognitive performance but differences in genotype modulated these relationships. These genotype-dependent associations include members of the Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae families. In a subset of female mice, we assessed DNA methylation in the hippocampus and investigated whether alterations in hippocampal DNA methylation were associated with the gut microbiome. Among other differentially methylated regions, we identified a 1 Kb region that overlapped ing 3'UTR of the Tomm40 gene and the promoter region of the Apoe gene that and was significantly more methylated in the hippocampus of AppNL-G-Fthan WT mice. The integrated gut microbiome hippocampal DNA methylation analysis revealed a positive relationship between amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) within the Lachnospiraceae family and methylation at the Apoe gene. Hence, these microbes may elicit an impact on AD-relevant behavioral and cognitive performance via epigenetic changes in AD-susceptibility genes in neural tissue or that such changes in the epigenome can elicit alterations in intestinal physiology that affect the growth of these taxa in the gut microbiome."

TCGA database was also used to analyze the expression of Girdin and its methylation status, as well as the relationship between Girdin DNA methylation and HCC prognosis. The Tumor IMmune Estimation Resource (TIMER) database was used to explore the correlation between Girdin expression and HCC immune infiltration.Girdin expression was elevated in HCC tissues compared with that in normal tissues. The degree of methylation at cg03188526, a CpG site in the Girdin gene body, was positively correlated with Girdin mRNA expression, while high Girdin expression and cg03188526 hypermethylation were both correlated with poor HCC prognosis. Additionally, HCC tissue with high Girdin expression exhibited abundant immune infiltration, and the high Girdin expression was associated with a worse prognosis in macrophage-enriched HCC specimens.Our findings indicated that Girdin likely functions as an oncogene in HCC and that hypermethylation at cg03188526 in the Girdin gene body may explain the high Girdin expression levels in HCC tissue. Furthermore, we report for the first time that the adverse effects of high Girdin expression in HCC patients may be partially mediated by tumor macrophage infiltration.© 2021 The Author(s)."
"33737884","DNA Methylation Sustains ""Inflamed"" Memory of Peripheral Immune Cells Aggravating Kidney Inflammatory Response in Chronic Kidney Disease.","Front Physiol","The incidence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) has rapidly increased in the past decades. A progressive loss of kidney function characterizes a part of CKD even with intensive supportive treatment. Irrespective of its etiology, CKD progression is generally accompanied with the development of chronic kidney inflammation that is pathologically featured by the low-grade but chronic activation of recruited immune cells. Cumulative evidence support that aberrant DNA methylation pattern of diverse peripheral immune cells, including T cells and monocytes, is closely associated with CKD development in many chronic disease settings. The change of DNA methylation profile can sustain for a long time and affect the future genes expression in the circulating immune cells even after they migrate from the circulation into the involved kidney. It is of clinical interest to reveal the underlying mechanism of how altered DNA methylation regulates the intensity and the time length of the inflammatory response in the recruited effector cells. We and others recently demonstrated that altered DNA methylation occurs in peripheral immune cells and profoundly contributes to CKD development in systemic chronic diseases, such as diabetes and hypertension. This review will summarize the current findings about the influence of aberrant DNA methylation on circulating immune cells and how it potentially determines the outcome of CKD.Copyright © 2021 Chen, Zhang, Yang, Liu and Chen."

However, in their pluripotent state, the disease impact of genetic variants is less well known. Here, we integrate data from 1,367 human iPSC lines to comprehensively map common and rare regulatory variants in human pluripotent cells. Using this population-scale resource, we report hundreds of new colocalization events for human traits specific to iPSCs, and find increased power to identify rare regulatory variants compared with somatic tissues. Finally, we demonstrate how iPSCs enable the identification of causal genes for rare diseases."
"33752729","Impact of sex in the prevalence and progression of glioblastomas: the role of gonadal steroid hormones.","Biol Sex Differ","As in other types of cancers, sex is an essential factor in the origin and progression of glioblastomas. Research in the field of endocrinology and cancer suggests that gonadal steroid hormones play an important role in the progression and prevalence of glioblastomas. In the present review, we aim to discuss the actions and mechanism triggered by gonadal steroid hormones in glioblastomas.Glioblastoma is the most common malignant primary brain tumor. According to the epidemiological data, glioblastomas are more frequent in men than in women in a 1.6/1 proportion both in children and adults. This evidence, and the knowledge about sex influence over the prevalence of countless diseases, suggest that male gonadal steroid hormones, such as testosterone, promote glioblastomas growth. In contrast, a protective role of female gonadal steroid hormones (estradiol and progesterone) against glioblastomas has been questioned. Several pieces of evidence demonstrate a variety of effects induced by female and male gonadal steroid hormones in glioblastomas. Several studies indicate that pregnancy, a physiological state with the highest progesterone and estradiol levels, accelerates the progression of low-grade astrocytomas to glioblastomas and increases the symptoms associated with these tumors. In vitro studies have demonstrated that progesterone has a dual role in glioblastoma cells: physiological concentrations promote cell proliferation, migration, and invasion while very high doses (out physiological range) reduce cell proliferation and increases cell death.Gonadal steroid hormones can stimulate the progression of glioblastomas through the increase in proliferation, migration, and invasion. However, the effects mentioned above depend on the concentrations of these hormones and the receptor involved in hormone actions. Estradiol and progesterone can exert promoter or protective effects while the role of testosterone has been always associated to glioblastomas progression."
"33686200","Genetic correlates of socio-economic status influence the pattern of shared heritability across mental health traits.","Nat Hum Behav","Epidemiological studies show high comorbidity between different mental health problems, indicating that individuals with a diagnosis of one disorder are more likely to develop other mental health problems. Genetic studies reveal substantial sharing of genetic factors across mental health traits. However, mental health is also genetically correlated with socio-economic status (SES), and it is therefore important to investigate and disentangle the genetic relationship between mental health and SES. We used summary statistics from large genome-wide association studies (average N ~ 160,000) to estimate the genetic overlap across nine psychiatric disorders and seven substance use traits and explored the genetic influence of three different indicators of SES. Using genomic structural equation modelling, we show significant changes in patterns of genetic correlations after partialling out SES-associated genetic variation. Our approach allows the separation of disease-specific genetic variation and genetic variation shared with SES, thereby improving our understanding of the genetic architecture of mental health."
"33666839","Direct Reprogramming of Somatic Cells to Neurons: Pros and Cons of Chemical Approach.","Neurochem Res","Translating successful preclinical research in neurodegenerative diseases into clinical practice has been difficult. The preclinical disease models used for testing new drugs not always appear predictive of the effects of the agents in the human disease state. Human induced pluripotent stem cells, obtained by reprogramming of adult somatic cells, represent a powerful system to study the molecular mechanisms of the disease onset and pathogenesis. However, these cells require a long time to differentiate into functional neural cells and the resetting of epigenetic information during reprogramming, might miss the information imparted by age. On the contrary, the direct conversion of somatic cells to neuronal cells is much faster and more efficient, it is safer for cell therapy and allows to preserve the signatures of donors' age. Direct reprogramming can be induced by lineage-specific transcription factors or chemical cocktails and represents a powerful tool for modeling neurological diseases and for regenerative medicine. In this Commentary we present and discuss strength and weakness of several strategies for the direct cellular reprogramming from somatic cells to generate human brain cells which maintain age-related features. In particular, we describe and discuss chemical strategy for cellular reprogramming as it represents a valuable tool for many applications such as aged brain modeling, drug screening and personalized medicine."

The potential applications of hiPSCs are especially relevant to neurology, as brain cells from patients are rarely available for research. hiPSCs from individuals with neuropsychiatric or neurodegenerative diseases have facilitated biological and multi-omics studies as well as large-scale screening of chemical libraries. However, researchers are struggling to improve the scalability, reproducibility and quality of this descriptive disease modelling. Addressing these limitations will be the first step towards a new era in hiPSC research - that of predictive disease modelling - involving the correlation and integration of in vitro experimental data with longitudinal clinical data. This approach is a key element of the emerging precision medicine paradigm, in which hiPSCs could become a powerful diagnostic and prognostic tool. Here, we consider the steps necessary to achieve predictive modelling of neurodegenerative disease with hiPSCs, using Huntington disease as an example."

"33658053","Aging in psoriasis vulgaris: female patients are epigenetically older than healthy controls.","Immun Ageing","Psoriasis vulgaris is a skin autoimmune disease. Psoriatic patients have significantly lowered life expectancy and suffer from various comorbidities. The main goal of the study was to determine whether psoriatic patients experience accelerated aging. As accelerated aging might be the reason for the higher prevalence of comorbidities at lower chronological ages, we also wanted to investigate the relationship between aging and selected parameters of frequent psoriatic comorbidities - endocan, vascular endothelial growth factor and interleukin-17. Samples were obtained from 28 patients and 42 healthy controls. Epigenetic age measurement was based on the Horvath clock. The levels of endocan, vascular endothelial growth factor and interleukin-17 were analyzed using standardized ELISA methods.The difference between the epigenetic age and the chronological age of each individual subject did not increase with the increasing chronological age of patients. We cannot conclude that psoriasis causes accelerated aging. However, the epigenetic and chronological age difference was significantly higher in female patients than in female controls, and the difference was correlated with endocan (r = 0.867, p = 0.0012) and vascular endothelial growth factor (r = 0.633, p = 0.0365) only in female patients.The findings suggest a possible presence of pathophysiological processes that occur only in female psoriatic patients. These processes make psoriatic females biologically older and might lead to an increased risk of comorbidity occurrence. This study also supports the idea that autoimmune diseases cause accelerated aging, which should be further explored in the future."
"33669862","Deciphering Biochemical and Molecular Signatures Associated with Obesity in Context of Metabolic Health.","Genes (Basel)","This study aims to identify the clinical and genetic markers related to the two uncommon nutritional statuses-metabolically unhealthy normal-weight (MUNW) and metabolically healthy overweight/obese (MHOW) individuals in the physically active individuals. Physically active male volunteers (n= 120) were recruited, and plasma samples were analyzed for the clinical parameters. Triglycerides, HDL-Cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, total cholesterol, C-reactive protein, and insulin resistance were considered as markers of metabolic syndrome. The subjects were classified as 'healthy' (0 metabolic abnormalities) or 'unhealthy' (≥1 metabolic abnormalities) in their respective BMI group with a cut-off at 24.9 kg/m2. Analysis of biochemical variables was done using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits with further confirmation using western blot analysis. The microarray was conducted, followed by quantitative real-time PCR to identify and analyze differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The MHOW group constituted 12.6%, while the MUNW group constituted 32.4% of the total study population. Pro-inflammatory markers like interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and ferritin were increased in metabolically unhealthy groups in comparison to metabolically healthy groups. Gene expression profiling of MUNW and MHOW individuals resulted in differential expression of 7470 and 5864 genes, respectively. The gene ontology (GO) biological pathway analysis showed significant enrichment of the 'JAK/STAT signaling pathway' in MUNW and 'The information-processing pathway at the IFN-β enhancer' pathway in MHOW. TheG6PC3gene has genetically emerged as a new distinct gene showing its involvement in insulin resistance. Biochemical, as well as genetic analysis, revealed that MUNW and MHOW are the transition state between healthy and obese individuals with simply having fewer metabolic abnormalities. Moreover, it is possible that the state of obesity is a biological adaptation to cope up with the unhealthy parameters."
"33712564","A computer-guided design tool to increase the efficiency of cellular conversions.","Nat Commun","Human cell conversion technology has become an important tool for devising new cell transplantation therapies, generating disease models and testing gene therapies. However, while transcription factor over-expression-based methods have shown great promise in generating cell types in vitro, they often endure low conversion efficiency. In this context, great effort has been devoted to increasing the efficiency of current protocols and the development of computational approaches can be of great help in this endeavor. Here we introduce a computer-guided design tool that combines a computational framework for prioritizing more efficient combinations of instructive factors (IFs) of cellular conversions, called IRENE, with a transposon-based genomic integration system for efficient delivery. Particularly, IRENE relies on a stochastic gene regulatory network model that systematically prioritizes more efficient IFs by maximizing the agreement of the transcriptional and epigenetic landscapes between the converted and target cells. Our predictions substantially increased the efficiency of two established iPSC-differentiation protocols (natural killer cells and melanocytes) and established the first protocol for iPSC-derived mammary epithelial cells with high efficiency."
"33691763","Integrating transcriptome-wide association study and mRNA expression profile identified candidate genes related to hand osteoarthritis.","Arthritis Res Ther","Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common skeletal system disease that has been partially attributed to genetic factors. The hand is frequently affected, which seriously affects the patient's quality of life. However, the pathogenetic mechanism of hand osteoarthritis (hand OA) is still elusive.A genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary of hand OA was obtained from the UK Biobank dataset, which contains data from a total of 452,264 White British individuals, including 37,782 OA patients. The transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) of hand OA was performed using FUnctional Summary-based ImputatiON (FUSION) with the skeletal muscle and blood as gene expression references. The significant genes identified by TWAS were further subjected to gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) with the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) tool. Furthermore, we compared the genes and gene sets identified by our TWAS with that of a knee OA mRNA expression profile to detect the genes and gene sets shared by TWAS and mRNA expression profiles in OA. The mRNA expression profiles of 18 normal knee cartilages and 20 OA knee cartilages were acquired from the Gene Expression Omnibus database (accession number: GSE114007).TWAS identified 177 genes with P < 0.05 for the skeletal muscle, including ANKRD44 (P = 0.0001), RIC3 (P = 0.0003), and AC005154.6 (P = 0.0004). TWAS identified 423 genes with P < 0.05 for the blood, including CRIM1 (P = 0.0002), ZNF880 (P = 0.0002), and NCKIPSD (P = 0.0003). After comparing the results of the TWAS to those of the mRNA expression profiling of OA, we identified 5 common genes, including DHRS3 (log2fold = - 1.85, P = 3.31 × 10- 9) and SKP2 (log2fold = 1.36, P = 1.62 × 10- 8). GSEA of TWAS identified 51 gene ontology (GO) terms for hand OA, for example, protein binding (P = 0.0003) and cytosol (P = 0.0020). We also detected 6 common GO terms shared by TWAS and mRNA expression profiling, including protein binding (PTWAS = 2.54 × 10- 4, PmRNA = 3.42 × 10- 8), extracellular exosome (PTWAS = 0.02, PmRNA = 1.18 × 10- 4), and cytoplasm (PTWAS = 0.0183, PmRNA = 0.0048).In this study, we identified 5 candidate genes and 6 GO terms related to hand OA, which may help to uncover the pathogenesis of hand OA. It should be noted that the possible difference in the gene expression profiles between hand OA and knee OA may affect our study results, which should be interpreted with caution."
"33673083","Identification of Germline Genetic Variants that Increase Prostate Cancer Risk and Influence Development of Aggressive Disease.","Cancers (Basel)","Prostate cancer (PrCa) is a heterogeneous disease, which presents in individual patients across a diverse phenotypic spectrum ranging from indolent to fatal forms. No robust biomarkers are currently available to enable routine screening for PrCa or to distinguish clinically significant forms, therefore late stage identification of advanced disease and overdiagnosis plus overtreatment of insignificant disease both remain areas of concern in healthcare provision. PrCa has a substantial heritable component, and technological advances since the completion of the Human Genome Project have facilitated improved identification of inherited genetic factors influencing susceptibility to development of the disease within families and populations. These genetic markers hold promise to enable improved understanding of the biological mechanisms underpinning PrCa development, facilitate genetically informed PrCa screening programmes and guide appropriate treatment provision. However, insight remains largely lacking regarding many aspects of their manifestation; especially in relation to genes associated with aggressive phenotypes, risk factors in non-European populations and appropriate approaches to enable accurate stratification of higher and lower risk individuals. This review discusses the methodology used in the elucidation of genetic loci, genes and individual causal variants responsible for modulating PrCa susceptibility; the current state of understanding of the allelic spectrum contributing to PrCa risk; and prospective future translational applications of these discoveries in the developing eras of genomics and personalised medicine."

However, the association of hippocampal gene expression with AD and the underlying neurobiological pathways remain largely unknown. Based on the genomic and transcriptomic data of 111 hippocampal samples and the summary data of two large-scale meta-analyses of GWASs, a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) was performed to identify genes with significant associations between hippocampal expression and AD. We identified 54 significantly associated genes using an AD-GWAS meta-analysis of 455,258 individuals; 36 of the genes were confirmed in another AD-GWAS meta-analysis of 63,926 individuals. Fine-mapping models further prioritized 24 AD-related genes whose effects on AD were mediated by hippocampal expression, including APOE and two novel genes (PTPN9 and PCDHA4). These genes are functionally related to amyloid-beta formation, phosphorylation/dephosphorylation, neuronal apoptosis, neurogenesis and telomerase-related processes. By integrating the predicted hippocampal expression and neuroimaging data, we found that the hippocampal expression of QPCTL and ERCC2 showed significant difference between AD patients and cognitively normal elderly individuals as well as correlated with hippocampal volume. Mediation analysis further demonstrated that hippocampal volume mediated the effect of hippocampal gene expression (QPCTL and ERCC2) on AD. This study identifies two novel genes associated with AD by integrating hippocampal gene expression and genome-wide association data and reveals candidate hippocampus-mediated neurobiological pathways from gene expression to AD."

Understanding South Asians' awareness, attitudes and experiences of early measures for the prevention of COVID-19 is key to improving the effectiveness and mitigating the social and economic impacts of pandemic responses at a critical time for the Region.We assessed the knowledge, behaviours, health and socio-economic circumstances of 29,809 adult men and women, at 93 locations across four South Asian countries. Data were collected during the national lockdowns implemented from March to July 2020, and compared with data collected prior to the pandemic as part of an ongoing prospective surveillance initiative.Participants were 61% female, mean age 45.1 years. Almost half had one or more chronic disease, including diabetes (16%), hypertension (23%) or obesity (16%). Knowledge of the primary COVID-19 symptoms and transmission routes was high, but access to hygiene and personal protection resources was low (running water 63%, hand sanitisers 53%, paper tissues 48%). Key preventive measures were not widely adopted. Knowledge, access to, and uptake of COVID-19 prevention measures were low amongst people from disadvantaged socio-economic groups. Fifteen percent of people receiving treatment for chronic diseases reported loss of access to long-term medications; 40% reported symptoms suggestive of anxiety or depression. The prevalence of unemployment rose from 9.3% to 39.4% (P < 0.001), and household income fell by 52% (P < 0.001) during the lockdown. Younger people and those from less affluent socio-economic groups were most severely impacted. Sedentary time increased by 32% and inadequate fruit and vegetable intake increased by 10% (P < 0.001 for both), while tobacco and alcohol consumption dropped by 41% and 80%, respectively (P < 0.001), during the lockdown.Our results identified important knowledge, access and uptake barriers to the prevention of COVID-19 in South Asia, and demonstrated major adverse impacts of the pandemic on chronic disease treatment, mental health, health-related behaviours, employment and household finances. We found important sociodemographic differences for impact, suggesting a widening of existing inequalities. Our findings underscore the need for immediate large-scale action to close gaps in knowledge and access to essential resources for prevention, along with measures to safeguard economic production and mitigate socio-economic impacts on the young and the poor.© 2021 The Authors."

Multiple genetic risk factors have been identified, implicating RNA and protein metabolism and intracellular transport, among other biological mechanisms. To achieve a systems-level understanding of the mechanisms governing ALS pathophysiology, we built gene co-expression networks using RNA-sequencing data from control human spinal cord samples, identifying 13 gene co-expression modules, each of which represents a distinct biological process or cell type. Analysis of four RNA-seq datasets from a range of ALS disease-associated contexts reveal dysregulation in numerous modules related to ribosomal function, wound response, and leukocyte activation, implicating astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, endothelia, and microglia in ALS pathophysiology. To identify potentially causal processes, we partitioned heritability across the genome, finding that ALS common genetic risk is enriched within two specific modules, SC.M4, representing genes related to RNA processing and gene regulation, and SC.M2, representing genes related to intracellular transport and autophagy and enriched in oligodendrocyte markers. Top hub genes of this latter module include ALS-implicated risk genes such as KPNA3, TMED2, and NCOA4, the latter of which regulates ferritin autophagy, implicating this process in ALS pathophysiology. These unbiased, genome-wide analyses confirm the utility of a systems approach to understanding the causes and drivers of ALS."
"33655247","A single-cell and spatial atlas of autopsy tissues reveals pathology and cellular targets of SARS-CoV-2.","bioRxiv","The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has caused over 1 million deaths globally, mostly due to acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome, or direct complications resulting in multiple-organ failures. Little is known about the host tissue immune and cellular responses associated with COVID-19 infection, symptoms, and lethality. To address this, we collected tissues from 11 organs during the clinical autopsy of 17 individuals who succumbed to COVID-19, resulting in a tissue bank of approximately 420 specimens. We generated comprehensive cellular maps capturing COVID-19 biology related to patients' demise through single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-Seq of lung, kidney, liver and heart tissues, and further contextualized our findings through spatial RNA profiling of distinct lung regions. We developed a computational framework that incorporates removal of ambient RNA and automated cell type annotation to facilitate comparison with other healthy and diseased tissue atlases. In the lung, we uncovered significantly altered transcriptional programs within the epithelial, immune, and stromal compartments and cell intrinsic changes in multiple cell types relative to lung tissue from healthy controls. We observed evidence of: alveolar type 2 (AT2) differentiation replacing depleted alveolar type 1 (AT1) lung epithelial cells, as previously seen in fibrosis; a concomitant increase in myofibroblasts reflective of defective tissue repair; and, putative TP63+intrapulmonary basal-like progenitor (IPBLP) cells, similar to cells identified in H1N1 influenza, that may serve as an emergency cellular reserve for severely damaged alveoli. Together, these findings suggest the activation and failure of multiple avenues for regeneration of the epithelium in these terminal lungs. SARS-CoV-2 RNA reads were enriched in lung mononuclear phagocytic cells and endothelial cells, and these cells expressed distinct host response transcriptional programs. We corroborated the compositional and transcriptional changes in lung tissue through spatial analysis of RNA profilesin situand distinguished unique tissue host responses between regions with and without viral RNA, and in COVID-19 donor tissues relative to healthy lung. Finally, we analyzed genetic regions implicated in COVID-19 GWAS with transcriptomic data to implicate specific cell types and genes associated with disease severity. Overall, our COVID-19 cell atlas is a foundational dataset to better understand the biological impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection across the human body and empowers the identification of new therapeutic interventions and prevention strategies."
"33664438","Shared associations identify causal relationships between gene expression and immune cell phenotypes.","Commun Biol","Genetic mapping studies have identified thousands of associations between common variants and hundreds of human traits. Translating these associations into mechanisms is complicated by two factors: they fall into gene regulatory regions; and they are rarely mapped to one causal variant. One way around these limitations is to find groups of traits that share associations, using this genetic link to infer a biological connection. Here, we assess how many trait associations in the same locus are due to the same genetic variant, and thus shared; and if these shared associations are due to causal relationships between traits. We find that only a subset of traits share associations, with many due to causal relationships rather than pleiotropy. We therefore suggest that simply observing overlapping associations at a genetic locus is insufficient to infer causality; direct evidence of shared associations is required to support mechanistic hypotheses in genetic studies of complex traits."

We report the results of the largest genome-wide association study for eye color to date, involving up to 192,986 European participants from 10 populations. We identify 124 independent associations arising from 61 discrete genomic regions, including 50 previously unidentified. We find evidence for genes involved in melanin pigmentation, but we also find associations with genes involved in iris morphology and structure. Further analyses in 1636 Asian participants from two populations suggest that iris pigmentation variation in Asians is genetically similar to Europeans, albeit with smaller effect sizes. Our findings collectively explain 53.2% (95% confidence interval, 45.4 to 61.0%) of eye color variation using common single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Overall, our study outcomes demonstrate that the genetic complexity of human eye color considerably exceeds previous knowledge and expectations, highlighting eye color as a genetically highly complex human trait.Copyright © 2021 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

In this article, we review the epigenetic analyses (DNA methylation, histone modification, chromatin remodeling, and non-coding RNAs) of germ cells and embryos in mammalian livestock species (cattle, sheep, goats, and pigs) and the epigenetic determinants of gamete and embryo viability. We also discuss the effects of parental environmental exposures on the epigenetics of gametes and the early embryo, and evidence for transgenerational inheritance in livestock.Copyright © 2021 Zhu, Marjani and Jiang."
"33651978","Germ cell differentiation requires Tdrd7-dependent chromatin and transcriptome reprogramming marked by germ plasm relocalization.","Dev Cell","In many animal models, primordial germ cell (PGC) development depends on maternally deposited germ plasm, which prevents somatic cell fate. Here, we show that PGCs respond to regulatory information from the germ plasm in two distinct phases using two distinct mechanisms in zebrafish. We demonstrate that PGCs commence zygotic genome activation together with the somatic blastocysts with no demonstrable differences in transcriptional and chromatin opening. Unexpectedly, both PGC and somatic blastocysts activate germ-cell-specific genes, which are only stabilized in PGCs by cytoplasmic germ plasm determinants. Disaggregated perinuclear relocalization of germ plasm during PGC migration is regulated by the germ plasm determinant Tdrd7 and is coupled to dramatic divergence between PGC and somatic transcriptomes. This transcriptional divergence relies on PGC-specific cis-regulatory elements characterized by promoter-proximal distribution. We show that Tdrd7-dependent reconfiguration of chromatin accessibility is required for elaboration of PGC fate but not for PGC migration.Copyright © 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

"33718266","Higher-Order Chromatin Structures of Chromosomally Integrated HHV-6A Predict Integration Sites.","Front Cell Infect Microbiol","Human herpesvirus -6A and 6B (HHV-6A/B) can integrate their genomes into the telomeres of human chromosomes. Viral integration can occur in several cell types, including germinal cells, resulting in individuals that harbor the viral genome in every cell of their body. The integrated genome is efficiently silenced but can sporadically reactivate resulting in various clinical symptoms. To date, the integration mechanism and the subsequent silencing of HHV-6A/B genes remains poorly understood. Here we investigate the genome-wide chromatin contacts of the integrated HHV-6A in latently-infected cells. We show that HHV-6A becomes transcriptionally silent upon infection of these cells over the course of seven days. In addition, we established an HHV-6-specific 4C-seq approach, revealing that the HHV-6A 3D interactome is associated with quiescent chromatin states in cells harboring integrated virus. Furthermore, we observed that the majority of virus chromatin interactions occur toward the distal ends of specific human chromosomes. Exploiting this finding, we established a 4C-seq method that accurately detects the chromosomal integration sites. We further implement long-read minION sequencing in the 4C-seq assay and developed a method to identify HHV-6A/B integration sites in clinical samples.Copyright © 2021 Mariani, Zimmerman, Rodriguez, Hasenohr, Aimola, Gerrard, Richman, Dest, Flamand, Kaufer and Frietze."
"33748137","Developmental Accumulation of Gene Body and Transposon Non-CpG Methylation in the Zebrafish Brain.","Front Cell Dev Biol","DNA methylation predominantly occurs at CG dinucleotides in vertebrate genomes; however, non-CG methylation (mCH) is also detectable in vertebrate tissues, most notably in the nervous system. In mammals it is well established that mCH is targeted to CAC trinucleotides by DNMT3A during nervous system development where it is enriched in gene bodies and associated with transcriptional repression. Nevertheless, the conservation of developmental mCH accumulation and its deposition by DNMT3A is largely unexplored and has yet to be functionally demonstrated in other vertebrates. In this study, by analyzing DNA methylomes and transcriptomes of zebrafish brains, we identified enrichment of mCH at CAC trinucleotides (mCAC) at defined transposon motifs as well as in developmentally downregulated genes associated with developmental and neural functions. We further generated and analyzed DNA methylomes and transcriptomes of developing zebrafish larvae and demonstrated that, like in mammals, mCH accumulates during post-embryonic brain development. Finally, by employing CRISPR/Cas9 technology, we unraveled a conserved role for Dnmt3a enzymes in developmental mCAC deposition. Overall, this work demonstrates the evolutionary conservation of developmental mCH dynamics and highlights the potential of zebrafish as a model to study mCH regulation and function during normal and perturbed development.Copyright © 2021 Ross, Hesselson and Bogdanovic."
"33691026","A multi-scale integrated analysis identifies KRT8 as a pan-cancer early biomarker.","Pac Symp Biocomput","An early biomarker would transform our ability to screen and treat patients with cancer. The large amount of multi-scale molecular data in public repositories from various cancers provide unprecedented opportunities to find such a biomarker. However, despite identification of numerous molecular biomarkers using these public data, fewer than 1% have proven robust enough to translate into clinical practice. One of the most important factors affecting the successful translation to clinical practice is lack of real-world patient population heterogeneity in the discovery process. Almost all biomarker studies analyze only a single cohort of patients with the same cancer using a single modality. Recent studies in other diseases have demonstrated the advantage of leveraging biological and technical heterogeneity across multiple independent cohorts to identify robust disease biomarkers. Here we analyzed 17149 samples from patients with one of 23 cancers that were profiled using either DNA methylation, bulk and single-cell gene expression, or protein expression in tumor and serum. First, we analyzed DNA methylation profiles of 9855 samples across 23 cancers from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We then examined the gene expression profile of the most significantly hypomethylated gene, KRT8, in 6781 samples from 57 independent microarray datasets from NCBI GEO. KRT8 was significantly over-expressed across cancers except colon cancer (summary effect size=1.05; p < 0.0001). Further, single-cell RNAseq analysis of 7447 single cells from lung tumors showed that genes that significantly correlated with KRT8 (p < 0.05) were involved in p53-related pathways. Immunohistochemistry in tumor biopsies from 294 patients with lung cancer showed that high protein expression of KRT8 is a prognostic marker of poor survival (HR = 1.73, p = 0.01). Finally, detectable KRT8 in serum as measured by ELISA distinguished patients with pancreatic cancer from healthy controls with an AUROC=0.94. In summary, our analysis demonstrates that KRT8 is (1) differentially expressed in several cancers across all molecular modalities and (2) may be useful as a biomarker to identify patients that should be further tested for cancer."

Here, we experimentally elevated prenatal testosterone in the eggs of zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) and measured male aggression in adulthood along with patterns of neural gene expression (RNA-seq) and DNA methylation (MethylC-Seq) in two socially relevant brain regions (hypothalamus and nucleus taenia of the amygdala). We used enrichment analyses and protein-protein interaction networks to find candidate processes and hub genes potentially affected by the treatment. We additionally identified differentially expressed genes that contained differentially methylated regions.We found that males from testosterone-injected eggs displayed more aggressive behaviors compared to males from control eggs. Hundreds of genes were differentially expressed, particularly in the hypothalamus, including potential aggression-related hub genes (e.g., brain derived neurotrophic factor). There were also enriched processes with well-established links to aggressive phenotypes (e.g., somatostatin and glutamate signaling). Furthermore, several highly connected genes identified in protein-protein interaction networks also showed differential methylation, including adenylate cyclase 2 and proprotein convertase 2.These results highlight genes and processes that may play an important role in mediating the effects of prenatal testosterone on long-term phenotypic outcomes, thereby providing insights into the molecular mechanisms that facilitate hormone-mediated maternal effects."

However, since inflammatory interactions with the colon involve various modes of action, the biological mechanism linking inflammation and CRC prognosis has not been fully elucidated. We comprehensively evaluated the predictive roles of the expression and methylation levels of inflammation-related genes for CRC prognosis and their pathophysiological associations.An integrative analysis of 247 patients with stage I-III CRC from The Cancer Genome Atlas was conducted. Lasso-penalized Cox proportional hazards regression (Lasso-Cox) and statistical Cox proportional hazard regression (CPH) were used for the analysis.Models to predict overall survival were designed with respective combinations of clinical variables, including age, sex, stage, gene expression, and methylation. An integrative model combining expression, methylation, and clinical features performed better (median C-index = 0.756) than the model with clinical features alone (median C-index = 0.726). Based on multivariate CPH with features from the best model, the methylation levels of CEP250, RAB21, and TNPO3 were significantly associated with overall survival. They did not share any biological process in functional networks. The 5-year survival rate was 29.8% in the low methylation group of CEP250 and 79.1% in the high methylation group (p< 0.001).Our study results implicate the importance of integrating expression and methylation information along with clinical information in the prediction of survival. CEP250, RAB21, and TNPO3 in the prediction model might have a crucial role in CRC prognosis and further improve our understanding of potential mechanisms linking inflammatory reactions and CRC progression."

The Functional Annotation of Animal Genomes consortium was formed to collaboratively annotate the functional elements in animal genomes, starting with domesticated animals. Here we present an expansive collection of datasets from eight diverse tissues in three important agricultural species: chicken (Gallus gallus), pig (Sus scrofa), and cattle (Bos taurus). Comparative analysis of these datasets and those from the human and mouse Encyclopedia of DNA Elements projects reveal that a core set of regulatory elements are functionally conserved independent of divergence between species, and that tissue-specific transcription factor occupancy at regulatory elements and their predicted target genes are also conserved. These datasets represent a unique opportunity for the emerging field of comparative epigenomics, as well as the agricultural research community, including species that are globally important food resources."

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified mainly four DTC susceptibility loci at 9q22.33, 14q13.3, 2q35 and 8p12. Here we performed fine-mapping of the 2q35 and 8p12 loci in the population of the EPITHYR consortium that includes Europeans, Melanesians and Polynesians to identify likely causal variants for DTC risk. We conducted a colocalization analysis using eQTLs data to determine the SNPs with the highest probability of causality. At 2q35, we highlighted rs16857609 located inDIRC3. This SNP has a high probability of causality in the three populations, and a significant association in Europeans (OR = 1.4,p= 1.9 x 10-10). It is also associated with expression ofDIRC3and of the nearby geneIGFBP5in thyroid tumour cells. At 8p12, we identified rs7844425 which was significantly associated with DTC in Europeans (OR = 1.32,p= 7.6 x 10-8) and rs2439304, which was highlighted by the colocalization analysis but only moderately associated with DTC in our dataset (OR = 1.2,p= 0.001). These SNPs are linked to the expression ofNRG1in thyroid tissue. Hence, our study identified novel variants at 2q35 and 8p12 to be prioritized for further functional studies.Copyright: © 2021 Guibon et al."

We here present the analysis of blood specimens of 3,388 adult individuals, together with phenotype characteristics such as disease history, medication status, lifestyle factors, and body mass index (BMI). The size and heterogeneity of this data challenges analytics in terms of dimension reduction, knowledge mining, feature extraction, and data integration.Methods:Self-organizing maps (SOM)-machine learning was applied to study transcriptional states on a population-wide scale. This method permits a detailed description and visualization of the molecular heterogeneity of transcriptomes and of their association with different phenotypic features.Results:The diversity of transcriptomes is described by personalized SOM-portraits, which specify the samples in terms of modules of co-expressed genes of different functional context. We identified two major blood transcriptome types where type 1 was found more in men, the elderly, and overweight people and it upregulated genes associated with inflammation and increased heme metabolism, while type 2 was predominantly found in women, younger, and normal weight participants and it was associated with activated immune responses, transcriptional, ribosomal, mitochondrial, and telomere-maintenance cell-functions. We find a striking overlap of signatures shared by multiple diseases, aging, and obesity driven by an underlying common pattern, which was associated with the immune response and the increase of inflammatory processes.Conclusions:Machine learning applications for large and heterogeneous omics data provide a holistic view on the diversity of the human blood transcriptome. It provides a tool for comparative analyses of transcriptional signatures and of associated phenotypes in population studies and medical applications.Copyright © 2020 Schmidt, Hopp, Arakelyan, Kirsten, Engel, Wirkner, Krohn, Burkhardt, Thiery, Loeffler, Loeffler-Wirth and Binder."

With the aim of identifying such potential cancer-predisposing variants, we performed whole exome sequencing on three CRC cases and three unaffected members of a Polish family and identified two novel heterozygous variants: a coding variant in APC downregulated 1 gene (APCDD1, p.R299H) and a non-coding variant in the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of histone deacetylase 5 gene (HDAC5). Sanger sequencing confirmed the variants segregating with the disease and Taqman assays revealed 8 additionalAPCDD1variants in a cohort of 1705 familial CRC patients and no furtherHDAC5variants. Proliferation assays indicated an insignificant proliferative impact for theAPCDD1variant. Luciferase reporter assays using theHDAC5variant resulted in an enhanced promoter activity. Targeting of transcription factor binding sites of SNAI-2 and TCF4 interrupted by theHDAC5variant showed a significant impact of TCF4 on promoter activity of mutatedHDAC5. Our findings contribute not only to the identification of unrecognized genetic causes of familial CRC but also underline the importance of 5'UTR variants affecting transcriptional regulation and the pathogenesis of complex disorders."

However, with technological advancements and the increasing understanding of the role of DNA sensing receptors in inflammation and autoimmunity, interest in cfDNA and autoimmune diseases has not expanded until recently. In this review, we provide an overview of the basic biology of cfDNA in the context of autoimmune diseases as a biomarker of disease activity, progression, and prediction of the treatment response.

"33707472","EMeth: An EM algorithm for cell type decomposition based on DNA methylation data.","Sci Rep","We introduce a new computational method named EMeth to estimate cell type proportions using DNA methylation data. EMeth is a reference-based method that requires cell type-specific DNA methylation data from relevant cell types. EMeth improves on the existing reference-based methods by detecting the CpGs whose DNA methylation are inconsistent with the deconvolution model and reducing their contributions to cell type decomposition. Another novel feature of EMeth is that it allows a cell type with known proportions but unknown reference and estimates its methylation. This is motivated by the case of studying methylation in tumor cells while bulk tumor samples include tumor cells as well as other cell types such as infiltrating immune cells, and tumor cell proportion can be estimated by copy number data. We demonstrate that EMeth delivers more accurate estimates of cell type proportions than several other methods using simulated data and in silico mixtures. Applications in cancer studies show that the proportions of T regulatory cells estimated by DNA methylation have expected associations with mutation load and survival time, while the estimates from gene expression miss such associations."

Epigenetic, transcriptional, and functional changes in monocytes occur with aging, though most studies to date have focused on differences between young adults and the elderly in populations with European ancestry; few data exist regarding changes that occur in circulating monocytes during the first few decades of life or in African populations. We analyzed DNA methylation profiles, cytokine production, and inflammatory gene expression profiles in monocytes from young adults and children from western Kenya.We identified several hypo- and hyper-methylated CpG sites in monocytes from Kenyan young adults vs. children that replicated findings in the current literature of differential DNA methylation in monocytes from elderly persons vs. young adults across diverse populations. Differentially methylated CpG sites were also noted in gene regions important to inflammation and innate immune responses. Monocytes from Kenyan young adults vs. children displayed increased production of IL-8, IL-10, and IL-12p70 in response to TLR4 and TLR2/1 stimulation as well as distinct inflammatory gene expression profiles.These findings complement previous reports of age-related methylation changes in isolated monocytes and provide novel insights into the role of age-associated changes in innate immune functions."
"33671123","The MHC Class-I Transactivator NLRC5: Implications to Cancer Immunology and Potential Applications to Cancer Immunotherapy.","Int J Mol Sci","The immune system constantly monitors the emergence of cancerous cells and eliminates them. CD8+cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), which kill tumor cells and provide antitumor immunity, select their targets by recognizing tumor antigenic peptides presented by MHC class-I (MHC-I) molecules. Cancer cells circumvent immune surveillance using diverse strategies. A key mechanism of cancer immune evasion is downregulation of MHC-I and key proteins of the antigen processing and presentation machinery (APM). Even though impaired MHC-I expression in cancers is well-known, reversing the MHC-I defects remains the least advanced area of tumor immunology. The discoveries that NLRC5 is the key transcriptional activator of MHC-I and APM genes, and genetic lesions and epigenetic modifications ofNLRC5are the most common cause of MHC-I defects in cancers, have raised the hopes for restoring MHC-I expression. Here, we provide an overview of cancer immunity mediated by CD8+T cells and the functions of NLRC5 in MHC-I antigen presentation pathways. We describe the impressive advances made in understanding the regulation of NLRC5 expression, the data supporting the antitumor functions of NLRC5 and a few reports that argue for a pro-tumorigenic role. Finally, we explore the possible avenues of exploiting NLRC5 for cancer immunotherapy."

To gain insights into aggression biology, we studied relationships with aggression of 11 low-molecular-weight metabolites (amino acids, ketone bodies), processed using1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. We used a discovery sample of young adults and an independent adult replication sample. We studied 725 young adults from a population-based Finnish twin cohort born 1983-1987, with aggression levels rated in adolescence (ages 12, 14, 17) by multiple raters and blood plasma samples at age 22. Linear regression models specified metabolites as the response variable and aggression ratings as predictor variables, and included several potential confounders. All metabolites showed low correlations with aggression, with only one-3-hydroxybutyrate, a ketone body produced during fasting-showing significant (negative) associations with aggression. Effect sizes for different raters were generally similar in magnitude, while teacher-rated (age 12) and self-rated (age 14) aggression were both significant predictors of 3-hydroxybutyrate in multi-rater models. In an independent replication sample of 960 adults from the Netherlands Twin Register, higher aggression (self-rated) was also related to lower levels of 3-hydroxybutyrate. These exploratory epidemiologic results warrant further studies on the role of ketone metabolism in aggression."

DNA hypermethylation of host genes' promoter in cervical lesions has also been recognized as a contributor to cervical cancer progression.Methods:For this purpose we analyzed promoter methylation of four tumor suppressor genes (RARB, CADM1, DAPK1andPAX1) and explored their possible association with cervical cancer in Botswana among women of known HIV status. Overall, 228 cervical specimens (128 cervical cancers and 100 non-cancer subjects) were used. Yates-corrected chi-square test and Fisher's exact test were used to explore the association of promoter methylation for each host gene and cancer status. Subsequently, a logistic regression analysis was performed to find which factors, HIV status, high risk-HPV genotypes, patient's age and promoter methylation, were associated with the following dependent variables: cancer status, cervical cancer stage and promoter methylation rate.Results:In patients with cervical cancer the rate of promoter methylation observed was greater than 64% in all the genes studied. Analysis also showed a higher risk of cervical cancer according to the increased number of methylated promoter genes (OR = 6.20; 95% CI: 3.66-10.51;P< 0.001).RARBmethylation showed the strongest association with cervical cancer compared to other genes (OR = 15.25; 95% CI: 6.06-40.0;P< 0.001). Cervical cancer and promoter methylation ofRARBandDAPK1genes were associated with increasing age (OR = 1.12; 95% CI: 1.01-1.26;P= 0.037 and OR = 1.05; 95% CI: 1.00-1.10;P= 0.040). The presence of epigenetic changes at those genes appeared to be independent of HIV status among subjects with cervical cancer. Moreover, we found that cervical cancer stage was influenced byRARB(χ2= 7.32;P= 0.002) andCADM1(χ2=12.68;P= 0.013) hypermethylation, and HIV status (χ2= 19.93;P= 0.001).Conclusion:This study confirms the association between invasive cervical cancer and promoter gene methylation of tumor suppressing genes at the site of cancer.

Little is understood about the impact of smoking status on perioperative morbidity and mortality and the long-term outcome of patients following esophagectomy.This study aimed to evaluate morbidity and mortality according to smoking status in patients undergoing esophagectomy for esophageal cancer.Consecutive patients undergoing two-stage transthoracic esophagectomy (TTE) for esophageal cancers (adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma) between January 1997 and December 2016 at the Northern Oesophagogastric Unit were included from a prospectively maintained database. The main explanatory variable was smoking status, defined as current smoker, ex-smoker, and non-smoker. The primary outcome was overall survival (OS), while secondary outcomes included perioperative complications (overall, anastomotic leaks, and pulmonary complications) and survival (cancer-specific survival [CSS], recurrence-free survival [RFS]).During the study period, 1168 patients underwent esophagectomy for cancer. Of these, 24% (n = 282) were current smokers and only 30% (n = 356) had never smoked. The median OS of current smokers was significantly shorter than ex-smokers and non-smokers (median 36 vs. 42 vs. 48 months; p = 0.015). However, on adjusted analysis, there was no significant difference in long-term OS between smoking status in the entire cohort. The overall complication rates were significantly higher with current smokers compared with ex-smokers or non-smokers (73% vs. 66% vs. 62%; p = 0.018), and there were no significant differences in anastomotic leaks and pulmonary complications between the groups. On subgroup analysis by receipt of neoadjuvant therapy and tumor histology, smoking status did not impact long-term survival in adjusted multivariable analyses.Although smoking is associated with higher rates of short-term perioperative morbidity, it does not affect long-term OS, CSS, and RFS following esophagectomy for esophageal cancer. Therefore, implementation of perioperative pathways to optimize patients may help reduce the risk of complications."

We aimed to evaluate DNA methylation changes and miRNA pattern in obese subjects associated with high serum FGF21 levels. The study included 136 participants with BMI 27-45 kg/m2. Fasting FGF21, glucose, insulin, GIP, lipids, adipokines, miokines and cytokines were measured and compared in high serum FGF21 (n= 68) group to low FGF21 (n= 68) group. Human DNA Methylation Microarrays were analysed in leukocytes from each group (n= 16). Expression of miRNAs was evaluated using quantitative PCR-TLDA. The study identified differentially methylated genes in pathways related to glucose transport, insulin secretion and signalling, lipid transport and cellular metabolism, response to nutrient levels, thermogenesis, browning of adipose tissue and bone mineralisation. Additionally, it detected transcription factor genes regulating FGF21 and fibroblast growth factor receptor and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor pathways regulation. Increased expression of hsa-miR-875-5p and decreased expression of hsa-miR-133a-3p, hsa-miR-185-5p and hsa-miR-200c-3p were found in the group with high serum FGF21. These changes were associated with high FGF21, VEGF and low adiponectin serum levels. Our results point to a significant role of the epigenetic regulation of genes involved in metabolic pathways related to FGF21 action."

Examining these compounds as a complex mixture may clarify inconsistent relationships between individual chemicals and childhood adiposity. Using data from the Center for the Health Assessment of Mothers and Children of Salinas (CHAMACOS) study, a longitudinal cohort of children in Salinas Valley, California (n= 309), we examined biomarkers of 11 phthalate metabolites and 9 phenols, including several parabens and bisphenol A, measured in maternal urine at two time points during pregnancy. We measured child height and weight at age five to calculate the body mass index (BMI)z-scores and overweight/obesity status. The association between prenatal urinary concentrations of biomarkers with the childhood BMIz-score and overweight/obesity status was analyzed using single-pollutant models and two mixture methods: Bayesian hierarchical modeling (BMH) and Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR). Urinary concentrations of monoethyl phthalate, monocarboxy-isononly phthalate (metabolites of diethyl phthalate and di-isodecyl phthalate, respectively), and propylparaben were consistently associated with an increased BMIz-score and overweight/obesity status across all modeling approaches. Higher prenatal exposures to the cumulative biomarker mixture also trended with greater childhood adiposity. These results, robust across two methods that control for co-pollutant confounding, suggest that prenatal exposure to certain phthalates and parabens may increase the risk for obesity in early childhood."

These transcripts were integrated using ingenuity pathway analysis to determine significant pathways directly related to cancer, suggesting that lncRNAs play a crucial role in carcinogenesis. When comparing normal lung tissues and smoker LUAD tissues, 86 candidate genes were identified, including six lncRNAs. Of the 43 candidate genes revealed by comparing never-smoker LUAD tissues and smoker LUAD tissues, 13 were also different when compared to normal lung tissues. We then investigated the expression of these genes using the Gene Expression of Normal and Tumor Tissues (GENT) and Methylation and Expression Database of Normal and Tumor Tissues (MENT) databases. We observed an inverse correlation between the expression of 13 genes in normal lung tissues and smoker LUAD tissues, and the expression of five genes between the never-smoker and smoker LUAD tissues. These findings were further validated in clinical specimens using bisulfite sequencing, revealing that AGR2, AURKB, FOXP3, and HMGA1 displayed borderline differences in methylation. Finally, we explored the functional connections between DNA methylation, lncRNAs, and gene expression to identify possible targets that may contribute toward the pathogenesis of cigarette smoking-associated LUAD. Together, our findings suggested that differentially expressed lncRNAs and their target transcripts could serve as potential biomarkers for LUAD."
"33681094","Genetic Testing in Neurodevelopmental Disorders.","Front Pediatr","Neurodevelopmental disorders are the most prevalent chronic medical conditions encountered in pediatric primary care. In addition to identifying appropriate descriptive diagnoses and guiding families to evidence-based treatments and supports, comprehensive care for individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders includes a search for an underlying etiologic diagnosis, primarily through a genetic evaluation. Identification of an underlying genetic etiology can inform prognosis, clarify recurrence risk, shape clinical management, and direct patients and families to condition-specific resources and supports. Here we review the utility of genetic testing in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders and describe the three major testing modalities and their yields - chromosomal microarray, exome sequencing (with/without copy number variant calling), andFMR1CGG repeat analysis for fragile X syndrome. Given the diagnostic yield of genetic testing and the potential for clinical and personal utility, there is consensus that genetic testing should be offered to all patients with global developmental delay, intellectual disability, and/or autism spectrum disorder. Despite this recommendation, data suggest that a minority of children with autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability have undergone genetic testing. To address this gap in care, we describe a structured but flexible approach to facilitate integration of genetic testing into clinical practice across pediatric specialties and discuss future considerations for genetic testing in neurodevelopmental disorders to prepare pediatric providers to care for patients with such diagnoses today and tomorrow.Copyright © 2021 Savatt and Myers."
"33747045","STATegra: Multi-Omics Data Integration - A Conceptual Scheme With a Bioinformatics Pipeline.","Front Genet","Technologies for profiling samples using different omics platforms have been at the forefront since the human genome project. Large-scale multi-omics data hold the promise of deciphering different regulatory layers. Yet, while there is a myriad of bioinformatics tools, each multi-omics analysis appears to start from scratch with an arbitrary decision over which tools to use and how to combine them. Therefore, it is an unmet need to conceptualize how to integrate such data and implement and validate pipelines in different cases. We have designed a conceptual framework (STATegra), aiming it to be as generic as possible for multi-omics analysis, combining available multi-omic anlaysis tools (machine learning component analysis, non-parametric data combination, and a multi-omics exploratory analysis) in a step-wise manner. While in several studies, we have previously combined those integrative tools, here, we provide a systematic description of the STATegra framework and its validation using two The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) case studies. For both, the Glioblastoma and the Skin Cutaneous Melanoma (SKCM) cases, we demonstrate an enhanced capacity of the framework (and beyond the individual tools) to identify features and pathways compared to single-omics analysis. Such an integrative multi-omics analysis framework for identifying features and components facilitates the discovery of new biology. Finally, we provide several options for applying the STATegra framework when parametric assumptions are fulfilled and for the case when not all the samples are profiled for all omics. The STATegra framework is built using several tools, which are being integrated step-by-step as OpenSource in the STATegRa Bioconductor package.Copyright © 2021 Planell, Lagani, Sebastian-Leon, van der Kloet, Ewing, Karathanasis, Urdangarin, Arozarena, Jagodic, Tsamardinos, Tarazona, Conesa, Tegner and Gomez-Cabrero."
"33708244","Effects of DNA Methylation on TFs in Human Embryonic Stem Cells.","Front Genet","DNA methylation is an important epigenetic mechanism for gene regulation. The conventional view of DNA methylation is that DNA methylation could disrupt protein-DNA interactions and repress gene expression. Several recent studies reported that DNA methylation could alter transcription factors (TFs) binding sequence specificityin vitro. Here, we took advantage of the large sets of ChIP-seq data for TFs and whole-genome bisulfite sequencing data in many cell types to perform a systematic analysis of the protein-DNA methylationin vivo. We observed that many TFs could bind methylated DNA regions, especially in H1-hESC cells. By locating binding sites, we confirmed that some TFs could bind to methylated CpGs directly. The different proportion of CpGs at TF binding specificity motifs in different methylation statuses shows that some TFs are sensitive to methylation and some could bind to the methylated DNA with different motifs, such as CEBPB and CTCF. At the same time, TF binding could interactively alter local DNA methylation. The TF hypermethylation binding sites extensively overlap with enhancers. And we also found that some DNase I hypersensitive sites were specifically hypermethylated in H1-hESC cells. At last, compared with TFs' binding regions in multiple cell types, we observed that CTCF binding to high methylated regions in H1-hESC were not conservative. These pieces of evidence indicate that TFs that bind to hypermethylation DNA in H1-hESC cells may associate with enhancers to regulate special biological functions.Copyright © 2021 Luo, Zhang, Zhai, Wang, Zhang and Wang."

In the recent decade, emerging roles of piRNAs have been revealed, including the roles in sterility, tumorigenesis, metabolic homeostasis, neurodevelopment, and neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we summarize piRNA biogenesis in C. elegans, Drosophila, and mice, and further elaborate upon how piRNAs mitigate the harmful effects of transposons. Lastly, the most recent findings on piRNA participation in neurological diseases are highlighted. We speculate on the mechanisms of piRNA action in the development and progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Understanding the roles of piRNAs in neurological diseases may facilitate their applications in diagnostic and therapeutic practice."

Specific insights into the role of gender differences and secondary comorbidities, such as type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cancer risk, are yet to be fully identified. The aim of this study is thus to find a correlation between the transcriptional deregulation present in the subcutaneous adipose tissue of obese patients and the oncogenic signature present in multiple cancers, in the presence of T2D, and considering gender differences. The subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) of five healthy, normal-weight women, five obese women, five obese women with T2D and five obese men were subjected to RNA-sequencing, leading to the identification of deregulated coding and non-coding RNAs, classified for their oncogenic score. A panel of DE RNAs was validated via Real-Time PCR and oncogene expression levels correlated the oncogenes with anthropometrical parameters, highlighting significant trends. For each analyzed condition, we identified the deregulated pathways associated with cancer, the prediction of possible prognosis for different cancer types and the lncRNAs involved in oncogenic networks and tissues. Our results provided a comprehensive characterization of oncogenesis correlation in SAT, providing specific insights into the possible molecular targets implicated in this process. Indeed, the identification of deregulated oncogenes also in SAT highlights hypothetical targets implicated in the increased oncogenic risk in highly obese subjects. These results could shed light on new molecular targets to be specifically modulated in obesity and highlight which cancers should receive the most attention in terms of better prevention in obesity-affected patients."

GDM affects approximately 14% of pregnancies globally, and without effective treatment, is associated with short- and long-term complications in mother and child. Lower serum adiponectin(ADIPOQ)concentrations and aberrant DNA methylation have been reported during GDM. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between theADIPOQ-11377C>G and -11391G>A, and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase(MTHFR)677C>T polymorphisms and GDM in a population of black South African women.DNA was isolated from the peripheral blood of 447 pregnant women with (n=116) or without (n=331) GDM, where afterADIPOQ(rs266729 and rs17300539) andMTHFR(rs1801133) polymorphisms were genotyped using TaqMan Quantitative Real-Time PCR analysis.Women with GDM had a higher body mass index (p=0.012), were more insulin resistant (p<0.001) and had lower adiponectin levels (p=0.013) compared to pregnant women with normoglycemia. Genotypic, dominant and recessive genetic models showed no association betweenADIPOQrs266729 and rs17300539 andMTHFRrs1801133 polymorphisms and GDM. Intriguingly, the risk G allele ofADIPOQrs266729 was associated with higher fasting glucose and insulin concentrations, while the T allele inMTHFRrs1801133 was associated with higher fasting insulin concentrations only.ADIPOQrs266729 and rs17300539 andMTHFRrs1801133 polymorphisms are not associated with GDM in a population of black South African women. These findings suggest that these single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) do not individually increase GDM risk in the African population. However, the role of these SNPs in possible gene-gene or gene-environment interactions remain to be established.© 2021 Dias et al."

Changes in DNA methylation reflect the genomic variation. Since liver transplant (LT) reverts HPS we hypothesized that it may be associated with specific liver epigenetic changes. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the role of the liver epigenome in patients with HPS. We extracted DNA from paraffin embedded liver tissue samples from 10 patients with HPS and 10 age-, sex- and MELD (Model for End-stage Liver Disease)-matched controls. DNA methylation was determined using the 850K array (Illumina). Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) was used to identify modules related to defining physiologic characteristics of HPS. Only 12 out of the 20 liver biopsies (7 HPS and 5 controls) had sufficient quality to be analyzed. None of the 802,688 DNA probes analyzed in the case control comparison achieved a significant False Discovery Rate (FDR). WGCNA identified 5 co-methylated gene-modules associated to HPS markers, mainly related to nervous and neuroendocrine system, apoptotic processes, gut bacterial translocation, angiogenesis and vascular remodeling ontologies. To conclude, HPS is associated with nervous/neuroendocrine system and vascular remodeling related liver epigenetic changes."

With the ability of spaceflight though, came the realization that exposure to microgravity has lasting effects on the human body. To counteract these, many studies were and are undertaken, on multiple levels. Changes in cell growth, gene, and protein expression have been described in different models on Earth and in space. Extracellular vesicles, and in particular exosomes, are important cell-cell communicators, being secreted from almost all the cells and therefore, are a perfect target to further investigate the underlying reasons of the organism's adaptations to microgravity. Here, we studied supernatants harvested from the CellBox-1 experiment, which featured human thyroid cancer cells flown to the International Space Station during the SpaceX CRS-3 cargo mission. The initial results show differences in the number of secreted exosomes, as well as in the distribution of subpopulations in regards to their surface protein expression. Notably, alteration of their population regarding the tetraspanin surface expression was observed. This is a promising step into a new area of microgravity research and will potentially lead to the discovery of new biomarkers and pathways of cellular cross-talk."

Here, we exploited the unique experimental advantages of the nematodeCaenorhabditis elegansto explore how spaceflight affects adult neuronsin vivo. We found that animals that lived 5 days of adulthood on the International Space Station exhibited hyperbranching in PVD and touch receptor neurons. We also found that, in the presence of a neuronal proteotoxic stress, spaceflight promotes a remarkable accumulation of neuronal-derived waste in the surrounding tissues, suggesting an impaired transcellular degradation of debris released from neurons.

Although flexible cystoscopy is widely employed in bladder cancer detection, it is expensive, invasive, and uncomfortable to the patients. Recently, urinary cell-free DNA (ucfDNA) isolated from urine supernatant has been shown to have great potential in bladder cancer detection and surveillance. Molecular features, such as integrity and concentration of ucfDNA, have been shown to be useful for differentiating bladder cancer patients from healthy controls. Besides, bladder cancer also exhibits unique genetic features that can be identified from sequencing and expression of ucfDNA. Apart from bladder cancer detection, ucfDNA is also useful for molecular classification. For example, ucfDNA exhibits significant differences, both molecularly and genetically, in non-muscle-invasive and muscle-invasive bladder cancers. There is no doubt that ucfDNA is a very promising tool for future applications in the field of bladder cancer."
"33664588","Low-Coverage Sequencing of Urine Sediment DNA for Detection of Copy Number Aberrations in Bladder Cancer.","Cancer Manag Res","Chromosomal copy number aberrations (CNAs) are a hallmark of bladder cancer and a useful target for diagnostic explorations. Here we constructed a low-coverage whole-genome sequencing method for the detection of CNAs in urine sediment DNA from patients with bladder cancer.We conducted a prospective study using urine sediment samples from 65 patients with bladder tumors, including 54 patients with bladder cancer and 11 patients with benign bladder tumors. Forty-three healthy individuals were included as normal controls. DNA was extracted from urine sediments and analyzed by low-coverage whole-genome sequencing to compare differences in CNAs among these three groups. CNAs are defined by arbitrary R values (normal range ± 2). When these values exceed ± 0.2 of normal range, gain/duplication or loss/deletion are suspected.With this method, CNAs were detected in 39 of 51 patients with bladder cancer, 2 of 10 patients with benign bladder tumors, and 8 of 39 normal controls. The lengths of DNA deletion and duplication were significantly larger in patients with bladder cancer than in patients with benign tumors or normal controls (P < 0.05). Bladder cancer duplicate CNAs mainly occurred on chromosomes 1q, 5p, 6p, 7p, 8q, and 13q, while deletions mainly occurred on 2q, 8p, 9q, 9p, and 11p. Those regions contained bladder cancer tumor-related genes, such as STK3, COX6C, SPAG1, CDKAL1, C9orf53, CDKN2A, CDKN2B, MIR31, and IFNA1. The number of CNAs detected in urine sediment DNA during the follow-up period was significantly reduced.Our sequencing method is highly sensitive and can detect a minimal chromosome repeat/microdeletion change of 0.15 Mb. The use of 0.1~0.3× low-coverage whole-genome sequencing can be used to detect bladder cancer CNAs in urine sediment DNA. This method provides a promising method for noninvasive diagnosis of bladder cancer, but still needs further verification in a larger sample size.© 2021 Cai et al."

Using prospectively collected plasma samples from the population-based Northern Sweden Health and Disease Study, we evaluated protein biomarkers in relation to colorectal cancer risk. Applying a two-tiered approach, we analyzed 160 proteins in matched sequential samples from 58 incident colorectal cancer case-control pairs. Twenty-one proteins selected from both this discovery phase and the literature were then analyzed in a validation set of 450 case-control pairs. Odds ratios were estimated by conditional logistic regression. LASSO regression and ROC analysis were used for multi-marker analyses. In the main validation analysis, no proteins retained statistical significance. However, exploratory subgroup analyses showed associations between FGF-21 and colon cancer risk (multivariable OR per 1 SD: 1.23 95% CI 1.03-1.47) as well as between PPY and rectal cancer risk (multivariable OR per 1 SD: 1.47 95% CI 1.12-1.92). Adding protein markers to basic risk predictive models increased performance modestly. Our results highlight the challenge of developing biomarkers that are effective in the asymptomatic, prediagnostic window of opportunity for early detection of colorectal cancer. Distinguishing between cancer subtypes may improve prediction accuracy. However, single biomarkers or small panels may not be sufficient for effective precision screening."

RNA-seq data of melanoma cell lines were obtained from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia, and sensitivity of cell lines to therapeutic agents is available in the Cancer Therapeutics Response Portal. TMB was calculated based on somatic mutation data. Differentially expressed gene analysis, weighted gene co-expression network analysis, protein-protein interaction networks, Minimal Common Oncology Data Elements, and survival analysis were leveraged to determine TMB-related hub genes. Competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks were constructed to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying hub gene function. The influence of key genes on drug sensitivity was analyzed to investigate their clinical significance.Results:Elevated TMB levels were significantly correlated with improved survival outcomes. In addition, six tumor-infiltrating immune cells, including naive B cells, regulatory T cells, memory resting CD4 T cells, memory B cells, activated mast cells, and resting NK cells, were significantly overexpressed in the low-TMB group relative to the high-TMB group. Furthermore, we identifiedFLNC, NEXN,andTNNT3as TMB-related hub genes, and constructed their ceRNA networks, including five miRNAs (has-miR-590-3p, has-miR-374b-5p, has-miR-3127-5p, has-miR-1913, and has-miR-1291) and 31 lncRNAs (FAM66C, MIAT, NR2F2AS1, etc.). Finally, we observed that TMB-related genes were associated with distinct therapeutic responses to AKT/mTOR pathway inhibitors.Conclusions:We identified three TMB-associated key genes, established their ceRNA networks, and investigated their influence on therapeutic responses, which could provide insights into future precision medicine.© The author(s)."

Here, we carried out a systematic analysis of nine types of data modalities using meta-analysis of 53 omics studies across 12 research laboratories for 2,018 cell lines. To account for a relatively low consistency observed for certain data modalities, we developed a robust data integration approach that identifies reproducible signals shared among multiple data modalities and studies. We demonstrated the power of the integrative analyses by identifying a novel driver gene, ECHDC1, with tumor suppressive role validated both in breast cancer cells and patient tumors. The multi-modal meta-analysis approach also identified synthetic lethal partners of cancer drivers, including a co-dependency of PTEN deficient endometrial cancer cells on RNA helicases.© 2021 The Authors.

"33743584","SVExpress: identifying gene features altered recurrently in expression with nearby structural variant breakpoints.","BMC Bioinformatics","Combined whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and RNA sequencing of cancers offer the opportunity to identify genes with altered expression due to genomic rearrangements. Somatic structural variants (SVs), as identified by WGS, can involve altered gene cis-regulation, gene fusions, copy number alterations, or gene disruption. The absence of computational tools to streamline integrative analysis steps may represent a barrier in identifying genes recurrently altered by genomic rearrangement.Here, we introduce SVExpress, a set of tools for carrying out integrative analysis of SV and gene expression data. SVExpress enables systematic cataloging of genes that consistently show increased or decreased expression in conjunction with the presence of nearby SV breakpoints. SVExpress can evaluate breakpoints in proximity to genes for potential enhancer translocation events or disruption of topologically associated domains, two mechanisms by which SVs may deregulate genes. The output from any commonly used SV calling algorithm may be easily adapted for use with SVExpress. SVExpress can readily analyze genomic datasets involving hundreds of cancer sample profiles. Here, we used SVExpress to analyze SV and expression data across 327 cancer cell lines with combined SV and expression data in the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE). In the CCLE dataset, hundreds of genes showed altered gene expression in relation to nearby SV breakpoints. Altered genes involved TAD disruption, enhancer hijacking, and gene fusions. When comparing the top set of SV-altered genes from cancer cell lines with the top SV-altered genes previously reported for human tumors from The Cancer Genome Atlas and the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes datasets, a significant number of genes overlapped in the same direction for both cell lines and tumors, while some genes were significant for cell lines but not for human tumors and vice versa.Our SVExpress tools allow computational biologists with a working knowledge of R to integrate gene expression with SV breakpoint data to identify recurrently altered genes. SVExpress is freely available for academic or commercial use at https://github.com/chadcreighton/SVExpress . SVExpress is implemented as a set of Excel macros and R code.

However, the biological function of TMEM52B expression in cancer is largely unknown.The effects of TMEM52B on tumor growth and metastasis were investigated in vitro and in vivo, and the underlying biological and molecular mechanisms involved in this process were evaluated. Clinical datasets from KmPlotter and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were analyzed in relation to TMEM52B expression and function.Suppression of TMEM52B in colon cancer cells promoted cancer cell epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), invasion, and survival in vitro. Similarly, in vivo studies showed increased tumor growth and circulating tumor cell survival (early metastasis). ERK1/2, JNK, and AKT signaling pathways were involved in TMEM52B suppression-induced invasiveness and cell survival. TMEM52B suppression promoted activation and internalization of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) with enhanced downstream signaling activity, leading to enhanced cell survival and invasion. In addition, TMEM52B suppression reduced E-cadherin stability, likely due to a reduced association between it and E-cadherin, which led to enhanced β-catenin transcriptional activity. Concomitantly, TMEM52B suppression promoted generation of soluble E-cadherin fragments, contributing to the activation of EGFR. Clinical data showed that high TMEM52B expression correlated with increased patient survival in multiple types of cancer, including breast, lung, kidney, and rectal cancers, and suggested a correlation between TMEM52B and E-cadherin.These findings suggest that TMEM52B is a novel modulator of the interplay between E-cadherin and EGFR. It is possible that TMEM52B functions as a tumor-suppressor that could potentially be used as a novel prognostic marker for cancer."
"33630864","Impact of between-tissue differences on pan-cancer predictions of drug sensitivity.","PLoS Comput Biol","Increased availability of drug response and genomics data for many tumor cell lines has accelerated the development of pan-cancer prediction models of drug response. However, it is unclear how much between-tissue differences in drug response and molecular characteristics may contribute to pan-cancer predictions. Also unknown is whether the performance of pan-cancer models could vary by cancer type. Here, we built a series of pan-cancer models using two datasets containing 346 and 504 cell lines, each with MEK inhibitor (MEKi) response and mRNA expression, point mutation, and copy number variation data, and found that, while the tissue-level drug responses are accurately predicted (between-tissue ρ = 0.88-0.98), only 5 of 10 cancer types showed successful within-tissue prediction performance (within-tissue ρ = 0.11-0.64). Between-tissue differences make substantial contributions to the performance of pan-cancer MEKi response predictions, as exclusion of between-tissue signals leads to a decrease in Spearman's ρ from a range of 0.43-0.62 to 0.30-0.51. In practice, joint analysis of multiple cancer types usually has a larger sample size, hence greater power, than for one cancer type; and we observe that higher accuracy of pan-cancer prediction of MEKi response is almost entirely due to the sample size advantage. Success of pan-cancer prediction reveals how drug response in different cancers may invoke shared regulatory mechanisms despite tissue-specific routes of oncogenesis, yet predictions in different cancer types require flexible incorporation of between-cancer and within-cancer signals. As most datasets in genome sciences contain multiple levels of heterogeneity, careful parsing of group characteristics and within-group, individual variation is essential when making robust inference."

To systematically screen these variants for allelic transcriptional enhancer activity, we construct a massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) library comprising 12,396 DNA oligonucleotides containing the genomic context around every allele of each SLE variant. Transfection into the Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B cell line GM12878 reveals 482 variants with enhancer activity, with 51 variants showing genotype-dependent (allelic) enhancer activity at 27 risk loci. Comparison of MPRA results in GM12878 and Jurkat T cell lines highlights shared and unique allelic transcriptional regulatory mechanisms at SLE risk loci. In-depth analysis of allelic transcription factor (TF) binding at and around allelic variants identifies one class of TFs whose DNA-binding motif tends to be directly altered by the risk variant and a second class of TFs that bind allelically without direct alteration of their motif by the variant. Collectively, our approach provides a blueprint for the discovery of allelic gene regulation at risk loci for any disease and offers insight into the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms underlying SLE."

In this work, we determined the immune phenotype of monocytes in IPF using multi-colour flow cytometry, RNA sequencing and corresponding serum factors, and mapped the main findings to amount of lung fibrosis and single cell transcriptomic landscape of myeloid cells in IPF lungs. We show that monocytes from IPF patients displayed increased expression of CD64 (FcγR1) which correlated with amount of lung fibrosis, and an amplified type I IFN responseex vivo. These were accompanied by markedly raised CSF-1 levels, IL-6, and CCL-2 in serum of IPF patients. Interrogation of single cell transcriptomic data from human IPF lungs revealed increased proportion of CD64himonocytes and ""transitional macrophages"" with higher expression of CCL-2 and type I IFN genes. Our study shows that monocytes in IPF patients are phenotypically distinct from age-matched controls, with a primed type I IFN pathway that may contribute to driving chronic inflammation and fibrosis.

Spatially-resolved Transcriptomics via Epitope Anchoring (STvEA) performs transcriptome-guided annotation of highly multiplexed cytometry datasets. It increases the level of detail in histological analyses by enabling the systematic annotation of nuanced cell populations, spatial patterns of transcription, and interactions between cell types. We demonstrate the utility of STvEA by uncovering the architecture of poorly characterized cell types in the murine spleen using published cytometry and mIHC data of this organ.Copyright © 2021 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

"33664506","Population-scale single-cell RNA-seq profiling across dopaminergic neuron differentiation.","Nat Genet","Studying the function of common genetic variants in primary human tissues and during development is challenging. To address this, we use an efficient multiplexing strategy to differentiate 215 human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines toward a midbrain neural fate, including dopaminergic neurons, and use single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to profile over 1 million cells across three differentiation time points. The proportion of neurons produced by each cell line is highly reproducible and is predictable by robust molecular markers expressed in pluripotent cells. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) were characterized at different stages of neuronal development and in response to rotenone-induced oxidative stress. Of these, 1,284 eQTL colocalize with known neurological trait risk loci, and 46% are not found in the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) catalog. Our study illustrates how coupling scRNA-seq with long-term iPSC differentiation enables mechanistic studies of human trait-associated genetic variants in otherwise inaccessible cell states."
"33658382","Integration and transfer learning of single-cell transcriptomes via cFIT.","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","Large, comprehensive collections of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets have been generated that allow for the full transcriptional characterization of cell types across a wide variety of biological and clinical conditions. As new methods arise to measure distinct cellular modalities, a key analytical challenge is to integrate these datasets or transfer knowledge from one to the other to better understand cellular identity and functions. Here, we present a simple yet surprisingly effective method named common factor integration and transfer learning (cFIT) for capturing various batch effects across experiments, technologies, subjects, and even species. The proposed method models the shared information between various datasets by a common factor space while allowing for unique distortions and shifts in genewise expression in each batch. The model parameters are learned under an iterative nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) framework and then used for synchronized integration from across-domain assays. In addition, the model enables transferring via low-rank matrix from more informative data to allow for precise identification in data of lower quality. Compared with existing approaches, our method imposes weaker assumptions on the cell composition of each individual dataset; however, it is shown to be more reliable in preserving biological variations. We apply cFIT to multiple scRNA-seq datasets of developing brain from human and mouse, varying by technologies and developmental stages. The successful integration and transfer uncover the transcriptional resemblance across systems. The study helps establish a comprehensive landscape of brain cell-type diversity and provides insights into brain development.Copyright © 2021 the Author(s). Published by PNAS."
"33712030","Reprogrammed mesenchymal stem cells derived from iPSCs promote bone repair in steroid-associated osteonecrosis of the femoral head.","Stem Cell Res Ther","Cellular therapy based on mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is a promising novel therapeutic strategy for the osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH), which is gradually becoming popular, particularly for early-stage ONFH. Nonetheless, the MSC-based therapy is challenging due to certain limitations, such as limited self-renewal capability of cells, availability of donor MSCs, and the costs involved in donor screening. As an alternative approach, MSCs derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), which may lead to further standardized-cell preparations.In the present study, the bone marrow samples of patients with ONFH (n = 16) and patients with the fracture of the femoral neck (n = 12) were obtained during operation. The bone marrow-derived MSCs (BMSCs) were isolated by density gradient centrifugation. BMSCs of ONFH patients (ONFH-BMSCs) were reprogrammed to iPSCs, following which the iPSCs were differentiated into MSCs (iPSC-MSCs). Forty adult male rats were randomly divided into following groups (n = 10 per group): (a) normal control group, (b) methylprednisolone (MPS) group, (c) MPS + BMSCs treated group, and (d) MPS + iPSC-MSC-treated group. Eight weeks after the establishment of the ONFH model, rats in BMSC-treated group and iPSC-MSC-treated group were implanted with BMSCs and iPSC-MSCs through intrabone marrow injection. Bone repair of the femoral head necrosis area was analyzed after MSC transplantation.The morphology, immunophenotype, in vitro differentiation potential, and DNA methylation patterns of iPSC-MSCs were similar to those of normal BMSCs, while the proliferation of iPSC-MSCs was higher and no tumorigenic ability was exhibited. Furthermore, comparing the effectiveness of iPSC-MSCs and the normal BMSCs in an ONFH rat model revealed that the iPSC-MSCs was equivalent to normal BMSCs in preventing bone loss and promoting bone repair in the necrosis region of the femoral head.Reprogramming can reverse the abnormal proliferation, differentiation, and DNA methylation patterns of ONFH-BMSCs. Transplantation of iPSC-MSCs could effectively promote bone repair and angiogenesis in the necrosis area of the femoral head."
"33762648","Alcohol consumption, depression, overweight and cortisol levels as determining factors for NR3C1 gene methylation.","Sci Rep","The NR3C1 glucocorticoid receptor (GR) gene is a component of the stress response system, which can be regulated by epigenetic mechanisms. NR3C1 methylation has been associated with trauma and mental issues, including depression, post-traumatic stress, anxiety, and personality disorders. Previous studies have reported that stressful events are involved in NR3C1 gene methylation, suggesting that its regulation under environmental effects is complex. The present study aimed to analyze associations involving stressors such as socioeconomic status, health conditions, and lifestyle in relation to NR3C1 methylation in adults. This study included 386 individual users of the Brazilian Public Unified Health System (SUS), and evaluated socioeconomic and health conditions, body mass index, cortisol levels, and lifestyle. Data were correlated with NR3C1 methylation, determined using DNA pyrosequencing. The results showed that alcohol consumption, overweight, and high cortisol levels were related to NR3C1 demethylation, while depression was related to its methylation. Habits, lifestyle, and health status may influence NR3C1 gene regulation via methylation, revealing the complexity of environmental impacts on NR3C1 methylation."
"33747641","Epigenetic mechanisms underlying pathobiology of alcohol use disorder.","Curr Pathobiol Rep","Chronic alcohol use is a worldwide problem with multifaceted consequences including multiplying medical costs and sequelae, societal effects like drunk driving and assault, and lost economic productivity. These large-scale outcomes are driven by the consumption of ethanol, a small permeable molecule that has myriad effects in the human body, particularly in the liver and brain. In this review, we have summarized effects of acute and chronic alcohol consumption on epigenetic mechanisms that may drive pathobiology of Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) while identifying areas of need for future research.Epigenetics has emerged as an interesting field of biology at the intersection of genetics and the environment, and ethanol in particular has been identified as a potent modulator of the epigenome with various effects on DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNAs. These changes alter chromatin dynamics and regulate gene expression that contribute to behavioral and physiological changes leading to the development of AUD psychopathology and cancer pathology.Evidence and discussion presented here from preclinical results and available translational studies have increased our knowledge of the epigenetic effects of alcohol consumption. These studies have identified targets that can be used to develop better therapies to reduce chronic alcohol abuse and mitigate its societal burden and pathophysiology."
"33705478","Association between childhood maltreatment, psychopathology and DNA methylation of genes involved in stress regulation: Evidence from a study in Borderline Personality Disorder.","PLoS One","Previous research suggests that childhood maltreatment is associated with epigenetic modification of genes involved in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) functioning, which could cause dysregulation of the stress response system. If pervasive, this may be associated with the development of stress-related disorder in adults, including affective disorders, anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or borderline-personality disorder (BPD). The majority of studies have focused on DNA methylation of the glucocorticoid receptor gene (NR3C1) and the FKBP5 encoding gene, which regulates the sensitivity of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). How methylation of NR3C1 and FKBP5 interferes with childhood adversity and psychopathology as well as empathy is an under-researched issue. Here, we sought to investigate the association of childhood maltreatment in a sample of 89 individuals (44 healthy participants and 45 patients diagnosed with BPD) with the methylation of the 1F promoter region of NR3C1 and the intron 7 of FKBP5 as well as with different measures of psychopathology and empathy. Methylation of FKBP5 (bin 2) correlated with anxiety (SCL-90-R) and the global psychopathological symptom load index (GSI), as well as with lower empathic perspective-taking abilities. Psychopathology and empathy impairments correlated with the level of childhood maltreatment. No difference in FKBP5 methylation was observed between the clinical and the non-clinical group. Methylation of NR3C1 was lower in BPD patients compared to controls, yet with small differences. The results are discussed regarding their biological relevance, including possible evolutionary explanations. In short, the regulation of the GR sensitivity by methylation of FKBP5 correlated with psychopathology and empathy scores, while no correlation emerged with the severity of childhood adversity."

Existing researches have revealed a link between TASP1 expression and carcinogenesis. However, limited data are available regarding the prognosis and functions of TASP1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Western Blotting and qRT-PCR were employed to evaluate the level of TASP1 in HCC cell lines and clinical specimens. TASP1 expression was further calculated in clinical specimens by immunohistochemistry and the mRNA level of TASP1 in HCC was analyzed using Oncomine and UALCAN databases. The TASP1 promoter methylation modification was shown via MEXPRESS and UALCAN. The association between TASP1 expression and postoperative prognosis was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analysis in clinical patients. The effect of TASP1 on HCC prognosis was analyzed via Kaplan-Meier plotter, GEPIA and UALCAN. Additionally, the regulators, kinases, miRNA and transcription factor targets of TASP1 were identified using LinkedOmics. Moreover, cBioPortal was used to detect the genetic alteration of TASP1. Finally, TIMER was utilized to assess the relation between TASP1 and the immune cell infiltration, whereas the correlation of TASP1 with three immune factors was detected through TISIDB.TASP1 expression was increased in HCC cell lines and HCC tissues. CNV and DNA methylation of TASP1 were changed. Survival analysis revealed that high TASP1 expression was correlated with overall survival (OS). Functional network analysis about TASP1 in HCC showed that the double-strand break repair, peptidyl-threonine modification, spindle organization, peptidyl-lysine modification and microtubule-based movement were modulated. Furthermore, TASP1 expression revealed puissant relation to the infiltration of immune cells and three immune factors in HCC.These data indicate that TASP1 may act as a potential prognostic marker in HCC and regulate HCC via multiple mechanisms.© 2021 Jiang et al."

RNA-seq is often performed on heterogeneous samples and the resulting DEGs do not necessarily indicate the cell-types where the differential expression occurred. While single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) methods solve this problem, technical and cost constraints currently limit its widespread use. Here we present single cell Mapper (scMappR), a method that assigns cell-type specificity scores to DEGs obtained from bulk RNA-seq by leveraging cell-type expression data generated by scRNA-seq and existing deconvolution methods. After evaluating scMappR with simulated RNA-seq data and benchmarking scMappR using RNA-seq data obtained from sorted blood cells, we asked if scMappR could reveal known cell-type specific changes that occur during kidney regeneration. scMappR appropriately assigned DEGs to cell-types involved in kidney regeneration, including a relatively small population of immune cells. While scMappR can work with user-supplied scRNA-seq data, we curated scRNA-seq expression matrices for ∼100 human and mouse tissues to facilitate its stand-alone use with bulk RNA-seq data from these species. Overall, scMappR is a user-friendly R package that complements traditional differential gene expression analysis of bulk RNA-seq data.© The Author(s) 2021.

"33669324","Research Supporting a Pilot Study of Metronomic Dapsone during Glioblastoma Chemoirradiation.","Med Sci (Basel)","This short note presents previous research data supporting a pilot study of metronomic dapsone during the entire course of glioblastoma treatment. The reviewed data indicate that neutrophils are an integral part of human glioblastoma pathophysiology, contributing to or facilitating glioblastoma growth and treatment resistance. Neutrophils collect within glioblastoma by chemotaxis along several chemokine/cytokine gradients, prominently among which is interleukin-8. Old data from dermatology research has shown that the old and inexpensive generic drug dapsone inhibits neutrophils' chemotaxis along interleukin-8 gradients. It is on that basis that dapsone is used to treat neutrophilic dermatoses, for example, dermatitis herpetiformis, bullous pemphigoid, erlotinib-related rash, and others. The hypothesis of this paper is that dapsone will reduce glioblastomas' neutrophil accumulations by the same mechanisms by which it reduces dermal neutrophil accumulations in the neutrophilic dermatoses. Dapsone would thereby reduce neutrophils' contributions to glioblastoma growth. Dapsone is not an ideal drug, however. It generates methemoglobinemia that occasionally is symptomatic. This generation is reduced by concomitant use of the antacid drug cimetidine. Given the uniform lethality of glioblastoma as of 2020, the risks of dapsone 100 mg twice daily and cimetidine 400 mg twice daily is low enough to warrant a judicious pilot study."
"33738444","Cerebrospinal fluid liquid biopsy for detecting somatic mosaicism in brain.","Brain Commun","Brain somatic mutations are an increasingly recognized cause of epilepsy, brain malformations and autism spectrum disorders and may be a hidden cause of other neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. At present, brain mosaicism can be detected only in the rare situations of autopsy or brain biopsy. Liquid biopsy using cell-free DNA derived from cerebrospinal fluid has detected somatic mutations in malignant brain tumours. Here, we asked if cerebrospinal fluid liquid biopsy can be used to detect somatic mosaicism in non-malignant brain diseases. First, we reliably quantified cerebrospinal fluid cell-free DNA in 28 patients with focal epilepsy and 28 controls using droplet digital PCR. Then, in three patients we identified somatic mutations in cerebrospinal fluid: in one patient with subcortical band heterotopia theLIS1p. Lys64* variant at 9.4% frequency; in a second patient with focal cortical dysplasia theTSC1p. Phe581His*6 variant at 7.8% frequency; and in a third patient with ganglioglioma theBRAFp. Val600Glu variant at 3.2% frequency. To determine if cerebrospinal fluid cell-free DNA was brain-derived, whole-genome bisulphite sequencing was performed and brain-specific DNA methylation patterns were found to be significantly enriched (P = 0.03). Our proof of principle study shows that cerebrospinal fluid liquid biopsy is valuable in investigating mosaic neurological disorders where brain tissue is unavailable.© The Author(s) (2021).

However, they explain only a fraction of EOAD patients (5% to 10%). Furthermore, only 10% to 15% of EOAD families present with clear autosomal dominant inheritance. Studies showed that only 35% to 60% of EOAD patients have at least one affected first-degree relative. Parent-offspring concordance in EOAD was estimated to be <10%, indicating that full penetrant dominant alleles are not the sole players in EOAD. We aim to summarize current knowledge of rare variants underlying familial and seemingly sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Genetic findings indicate that in addition to the amyloid beta pathway, other pathways are of importance in AD pathophysiology.

No mechanism has yet been identified for establishing the human brain's left-right axis. We performed multivariate genome-wide association scanning of cortical regional surface area and thickness asymmetries, and subcortical volume asymmetries, using data from 32,256 participants from the UK Biobank. There were 21 significant loci associated with different aspects of brain asymmetry, with functional enrichment involving microtubule-related genes and embryonic brain expression. These findings are consistent with a known role of the cytoskeleton in left-right axis determination in other organs of invertebrates and frogs. Genetic variants associated with brain asymmetry overlapped with those associated with autism, educational attainment and schizophrenia. Comparably large datasets will likely be required in future studies, to replicate and further clarify the associations of microtubule-related genes with variation in brain asymmetry, behavioural and psychiatric traits."

We aimed to compare the efficacy of two 6-month personalized MT protocols in terms of better engagement, adherence to follow-up visits and improved anthropometric and lifestyle parameters. MT contacts consisted of three personalized/not automated What's App®self-monitoring or challenge messages per week. Messages, sent by a dedicated coach were inserted between three-monthly in-presence regular visits with (PediaFit 1.2) or without (PediaFit 1.1) monthly free-of charge short recall visits carried out by a specialized pediatric team. The sample included 103 children (mean age 10 years, range 6-14) recruited in the Pediatric Obesity Clinic between January 2017 and February 2019, randomized into Intervention group (IG) (n= 24 PediaFit 1.1;n= 30 PediaFit 1.2) and Control group (CG) (totaln= 49). Controls received standard treatment only (indications for healthy nutrition and physical activity, and three months in presence regular visits). Overall, both IGs achieved significantly better results than the CGs for all considered parameters. Comparison of the two IGs at the sixth month in particular showed an IG 1.2 statistically significantly lower drop-out rate (10% vs. 62%,p= 0.00009), along with significantly improved BMI (p= 0.003), Screen Time (p= 0.04) and fruit and vegetables consumption (p= 0.02).

"33674591","Deciphering the state of immune silence in fatal COVID-19 patients.","Nat Commun","Since the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, COVID-19 appeared as a unique disease with unconventional tissue and systemic immune features. Here we show a COVID-19 immune signature associated with severity by integrating single-cell RNA-seq analysis from blood samples and broncho-alveolar lavage fluids with clinical, immunological and functional ex vivo data. This signature is characterized by lung accumulation of naïve lymphoid cells associated with a systemic expansion and activation of myeloid cells. Myeloid-driven immune suppression is a hallmark of COVID-19 evolution, highlighting arginase-1 expression with immune regulatory features of monocytes. Monocyte-dependent and neutrophil-dependent immune suppression loss is associated with fatal clinical outcome in severe patients. Additionally, our analysis shows a lung CXCR6+effector memory T cell subset is associated with better prognosis in patients with severe COVID-19. In summary, COVID-19-induced myeloid dysregulation and lymphoid impairment establish a condition of 'immune silence' in patients with critical COVID-19."

We performed a multivariate gene-by-environment genome-wide interaction study (GEWIS) of suicidality in 123,633 individuals using a covariance matrix based on 26 environments related to traumatic experiences, posttraumatic stress, social support, and socioeconomic status. We discovered five suicidality risk loci, including the male-associated rs2367967 (CWC22), which replicated in an independent cohort. All GEWIS-significant loci exhibited interaction effects where at least 5% of the sample had environmental profiles conferring opposite SNP effects from the majority. We identified PTSD as a primary driving environment for GxE at suicidality risk loci. The male suicidality GEWIS was enriched for three middle-temporal-gyrus inhibitory neuron transcriptomic profiles:SCUBE- andPVALB-expressing cells (β = 0.028,p = 3.74 × 10-4),OPRM1-expressing cells (β = 0.030,p = 0.001), andSPAG17-expressing cells (β = 0.029,p = 9.80 × 10-4).

Indeed, aging is a multifactorial process that is influenced by a range of environmental, sociodemographic, and biopsychosocial factors, all of which might act in concert to determine the process of aging. The global average life expectancy increased fundamentally over the past century, toward an aging population, correlating with the development and onset of age-related diseases, mainly from cardiovascular and neurological nature. Therefore, the identification of determinants of healthy and unhealthy aging is a major goal to lower the burden and socioeconomic costs of age-related diseases. The role of environmental factors (such as air pollution and noise exposure) as crucial determinants of the aging process are being increasingly recognized. Here, we critically review recent findings concerning the pathomechanisms underlying the aging process and their correlates in cardiovascular and neurological disease, centered on oxidative stress and inflammation, as well as the influence of prominent environmental pollutants, namely air pollution and traffic noise exposure, which is suggested to accelerate the aging process. Insight into these types of relationships and appropriate preventive strategies are urgently needed to promote healthy aging."

To facilitate computational efficiency, a variational Bayes approach is developed to approximate the joint posterior distribution to achieve model inference in high-dimensional settings. We describe a pan-cancer data analysis of genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic alterations in close to 9000 tumor samples across canonical oncogenic signaling pathways, immune and stemness phenotype, with comparisons to state-of-the-art clustering methods. We demonstrate that Nebula has the unique advantage of revealing patterns on the basis of shared pathway alterations, offering biological and clinical insights beyond tumor type and histology in the pan-cancer analysis setting.

The substantial heterogeneity in PCa presents a major challenge with respect to molecular analyses, patient stratification, and treatment. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator was used to select eight risk-CpG sites. Using an unsupervised clustering analysis, called consensus clustering, we found that patients with PCa could be divided into two subtypes (Methylation_H and Methylation_L) based on the DNA methylation status at these CpG sites. Differences in the epigenome, genome, transcriptome, disease status, immune cell composition, and function between the identified subtypes were explored using The Cancer Genome Atlas database. This analysis clearly revealed the risk characteristics of the Methylation_H subtype. Using a weighted correlation network analysis to select risk-related genes and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, we constructed a prediction signature for prognosis based on the subtype classification. We further validated its effectiveness using four public datasets.

Epigenetic alterations could contribute to explaining the metabolic disturbances associated with foetal programming. Although the role of the FTO gene remains unclear, it affects metabolic phenotypes probably mediated by epigenetic mechanisms. The aim of this study was to assess whether placental DNA epigenetic modifications at FTO promoter-associated cysteine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites are correlated with GDM. A secondary aim was to evaluate the association between the placental FTO DNA methylation and the maternal metabolic traits in women with and without GDM.Socio-demographic characteristics, clinical parameters at the third trimester of pregnancy, Mediterranean diet adherence, and physical activity were assessed in 33 GDM women and 27 controls. Clinical information about the newborns was registered at birth. The FTO rs9939609 (T > A) was genotyped.No association between FTO DNA methylation and GDM was found. DNA methylation on the maternal side at the CpG1 was associated with maternal smoking in GDM (p = 0.034), and DNA methylation at the CpG3 was correlated with smoking or former smoking in controls (p = 0.023). A higher level of TGs was correlated with higher foetal placental DNA methylation at the CpG2 (p = 0.036) in GDM. An inverse association between HDL-C and maternal placental DNA methylation at the CpG3 in controls (p = 0.045) was found. An association between FTO rs9939609 and neonatal birthweight (p = 0.033) was detected.In the awareness that the obesity pathophysiology is complex, the study adds a piece to this intricate mosaic."

"33619101","Depletion of H3K36me2 recapitulates epigenomic and phenotypic changes induced by the H3.3K36M oncohistone mutation.","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","Hotspot histone H3 mutations have emerged as drivers of oncogenesis in cancers of multiple lineages. Specifically, H3 lysine 36 to methionine (H3K36M) mutations are recurrently identified in chondroblastomas, undifferentiated sarcomas, and head and neck cancers. While the mutation reduces global levels of both H3K36 dimethylation (H3K36me2) and trimethylation (H3K36me3) by dominantly inhibiting their respective specific methyltransferases, the relative contribution of these methylation states to the chromatin and phenotypic changes associated with H3K36M remains unclear. Here, we specifically deplete H3K36me2 or H3K36me3 in mesenchymal cells, using CRISPR-Cas9 to separately knock out the corresponding methyltransferases NSD1/2 or SETD2. By profiling and comparing the epigenomic and transcriptomic landscapes of these cells with cells expressing the H3.3K36M oncohistone, we find that the loss of H3K36me2 could largely recapitulate H3.3K36M's effect on redistribution of H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) and gene expression. Consistently, knockout ofNsd1/2, but notSetd2, phenocopies the differentiation blockade and hypersensitivity to the DNA-hypomethylating agent induced by H3K36M. Together, our results support a functional divergence between H3K36me2 and H3K36me3 and their nonredundant roles in H3K36M-driven oncogenesis."

Here, we perform CRISPRi screens of 260 rCREs in PCa cell lines. We find that rCREs harboring high risk SNPs are more essential for cell proliferation and H3K27ac occupancy is a strong indicator of essentiality. We also show that cell-line-specific essential rCREs are enriched in the 8q24.21 region, with the rs11986220-containing rCRE regulating MYC and PVT1 expression, cell proliferation and tumorigenesis in a cell-line-specific manner, depending on DNA methylation-orchestrated occupancy of a CTCF binding site in between this rCRE and the MYC promoter. We demonstrate that CTCF deposition at this site as measured by DNA methylation level is highly variable in prostate specimens, and observe the MYC eQTL in the 8q24.21 locus in individuals with low CTCF binding. Together our findings highlight a causal mechanism synergistically driven by a risk SNP and DNA methylation-mediated 3D genome architecture, advocating for the integration of genetics and epigenetics in assessing risks conferred by genetic predispositions."
"33719340","CoExp: A Web Tool for the Exploitation of Co-expression Networks.","Front Genet","Gene co-expression networks are a powerful type of analysis to construct gene groupings based on transcriptomic profiling. Co-expression networks make it possible to discover modules of genes whose mRNA levels are highly correlated across samples. Subsequent annotation of modules often reveals biological functions and/or evidence of cellular specificity for cell types implicated in the tissue being studied. There are multiple ways to perform such analyses with weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) amongst one of the most widely used R packages. While managing a few network models can be done manually, it is often more advantageous to study a wider set of models derived from multiple independently generated transcriptomic data sets (e.g., multiple networks built from many transcriptomic sources). However, there is no software tool available that allows this to be easily achieved. Furthermore, the visual nature of co-expression networks in combination with the coding skills required to explore networks, makes the construction of a web-based platform for their management highly desirable. Here, we present the CoExp Web application, a user-friendly online tool that allows the exploitation of the full collection of 109 co-expression networks provided by the CoExpNets suite of R packages. We describe the usage of CoExp, including its contents and the functionality available through the family of CoExpNets packages. All the tools presented, including the web front- and back-ends are available for the research community so any research group can build its own suite of networks and make them accessible through their own CoExp Web application. Therefore, this paper is of interest to both researchers wishing to annotate their genes of interest across different brain network models and specialists interested in the creation of GCNs looking for a tool to appropriately manage, use, publish, and share their networks in a consistent and productive manner.Copyright © 2021 García-Ruiz, Gil-Martínez, Cisterna, Jurado-Ruiz, Reynolds, Cookson, Hardy, Ryten and Botía."

However, the applicability and access to multi-omics tests are limited. In Italy, this is due to the rapid increase of knowledge and the high levels of skill and economic investment initially necessary. The fields of human genetics and public health have highlighted the relevance of an implementation strategy at a national level in Italy, including integration in sanitary regulations and governance instruments. In this review, the emerging field of public health genomics is discussed, including the polygenic scores approach, epigenetic modulation, nutrigenomics, and microbiomes implications. Moreover, the Italian state of implementation is presented. The omics sciences have important implications for the prevention of both communicable and noncommunicable diseases, especially because they can be used to assess the health status during the whole course of life. An effective population health gain is possible if omics tools are implemented for each person after a preliminary assessment of effectiveness in the medium to long term."
"33673506","Random Forest Modelling of High-Dimensional Mixed-Type Data for Breast Cancer Classification.","Cancers (Basel)","Advances in high-throughput technologies encourage the generation of large amounts of multiomics data to investigate complex diseases, including breast cancer. Given that the aetiologies of such diseases extend beyond a single biological entity, and that essential biological information can be carried by all data regardless of data type, integrative analyses are needed to identify clinically relevant patterns. To facilitate such analyses, we present a permutation-based framework for random forest methods which simultaneously allows the unbiased integration of mixed-type data and assessment of relative feature importance. Through simulation studies and machine learning datasets, the performance of the approach was evaluated. The results showed minimal multicollinearity and limited overfitting. To further assess the performance, the permutation-based framework was applied to high-dimensional mixed-type data from two independent breast cancer cohorts. Reproducibility and robustness of our approach was demonstrated by the concordance in relative feature importance between the cohorts, along with consistencies in clustering profiles. One of the identified clusters was shown to be prognostic for clinical outcome after standard-of-care adjuvant chemotherapy and outperformed current intrinsic molecular breast cancer classifications."
"33665158","Comprehensive Analysis of CDCAs Methylation and Immune Infiltrates in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.","Front Oncol","As essential components of cycle growth, the cell division cycle-associated family genes (CDCAs) have crucial roles in tumor development and progression, especially in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, due to the tumor heterogeneity of HCC, little is known about the methylation variability of CDCAs in mediating phenotypic changes (e.g., immune infiltrates) in HCC. Presently, we aim to comprehensively explore the expression and prognosis of CDCAs methylation with regard to immune infiltrates of HCC.We first identified the correlating differentially expressed genes (co-DEGs) among 19 different types of cancer cohorts (a total of 7,783 patients) and then constructed the weighted gene co-expressed and co-methylated networks. Applying the clustering analysis, significant modules of DEGs including CDCAs were selected and their functional bioinformatics analyses were performed. Besides, using DiseaseMeth and TIMER, the correlation between the methylation levels of CDCAs and tumor immune infiltrates was also analyzed. In final, to assess the influence of CDCAs methylation on clinical prognosis, Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analysis were carried out.A total of 473 co-DEGs are successfully identified, while seven genes of CDCAs (CDCA1-3 and CDCA5-8) have significant over-expression in HCC. Co-expressed and co-methylated networks reveal the strong positive correlations in mRNA expression and methylation levels of CDCAs. Besides, the biological enrichment analysis of CDCAs demonstrates that they are significantly related to the immune function regulation of infiltrating immune cells in HCC. Also, the methylation analysis of CDCAs depicts the strong association with the tumor immunogenicity, i.e., low-methylation of CDCA1, CDCA2, and CDCA8 dramatically reduced the immune infiltrate levels of T cells and cytotoxic lymphocytes. Additionally, CDCA1-6 and CDCA8 with low-methylation levels significantly deteriorate the overall survival of patients in HCC.The co-expressed and co-methylated gene networks of CDCAs show a powerful association with immune function regulation. And the methylation levels of CDCAs suggesting the prognostic value and infiltrating immune differences could be a novel and predictive biomarker for the response of immunotherapy.Copyright © 2021 Wang, Yang, Gao, Ouyang, Zhang, Hu, Hu and Kan."
"33722199","Correction for both common and rare cell types in blood is important to identify genes that correlate with age.","BMC Genomics","Aging is a multifactorial process that affects multiple tissues and is characterized by changes in homeostasis over time, leading to increased morbidity. Whole blood gene expression signatures have been associated with aging and have been used to gain information on its biological mechanisms, which are still not fully understood. However, blood is composed of many cell types whose proportions in blood vary with age. As a result, previously observed associations between gene expression levels and aging might be driven by cell type composition rather than intracellular aging mechanisms. To overcome this, previous aging studies already accounted for major cell types, but the possibility that the reported associations are false positives driven by less prevalent cell subtypes remains.Here, we compared the regression model from our previous work to an extended model that corrects for 33 additional white blood cell subtypes. Both models were applied to whole blood gene expression data from 3165 individuals belonging to the general population (age range of 18-81 years). We evaluated that the new model is a better fit for the data and it identified fewer genes associated with aging (625, compared to the 2808 of the initial model; P ≤ 2.5⨯10-6). Moreover, 511 genes (~ 18% of the 2808 genes identified by the initial model) were found using both models, indicating that the other previously reported genes could be proxies for less abundant cell types. In particular, functional enrichment of the genes identified by the new model highlighted pathways and GO terms specifically associated with platelet activity.We conclude that gene expression analyses in blood strongly benefit from correction for both common and rare blood cell types, and recommend using blood-cell count estimates as standard covariates when studying whole blood gene expression."

In this study, we aimed to identify genes associated with PPD. To do this, we investigated genome-wide gene expression profiles of pregnant women during their third trimester of pregnancy and tested the association of gene expression with perinatal depressive symptoms. A total of 137 women from a cohort from the University of North Carolina, USA were assessed. The main phenotypes analysed were Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) scores at 2 months postpartum and PPD (binary yes/no) based on an EPDS cutoff of 10. Illumina NextSeq500/550 transcriptomic sequencing from whole blood was analysed using the edgeR package. We identified 71 genes significantly associated with postpartum depression scores at 2 months, after correction for multiple testing at 5% FDR. These included several interesting candidates including TNFRSF17, previously reported to be significantly upregulated in women with PPD and MMP8, a matrix metalloproteinase gene, associated with depression in a genome-wide association study. Functional annotation of differentially expressed genes revealed an enrichment of immune response-related biological processes. Additional analysis of genes associated with changes in depressive symptoms from recruitment to 2 months postpartum identified 66 genes significant at an FDR of 5%. Of these genes, 33 genes were also associated with depressive symptoms at 2 months postpartum. Comparing the results with previous studies, we observed that 15.4% of genes associated with PPD in this study overlapped with 700 core maternal genes that showed significant gene expression changes across multiple brain regions (P = 7.9e-05) and 29-53% of the genes were also associated with estradiol changes in a pharmacological model of depression (P values range = 1.2e-4-2.1e-14). In conclusion, we identified novel genes and validated genes previously associated with oestrogen sensitivity in PPD. These results point towards the role of an altered immune transcriptomic landscape as a vulnerability factor for PPD."
"33719336","Bisulfite-Converted DNA Quantity Evaluation: A Multiplex Quantitative Real-Time PCR System for Evaluation of Bisulfite Conversion.","Front Genet","Bisulfite (BS) conversion, which includes a series of chemical reactions using bisulfite, is a prerequisite to most DNA methylation analysis methods, and thus is an essential step in the associated research process. Unfortunately, BS conversion leads to the degradation or loss of DNA, which can hinder further downstream analysis. In addition, it is well known that incomplete BS conversion is crucial, as it causes an exaggeration of the DNA methylation level, which can adversely affect the results. Therefore, there have been many attempts to measure three key features of BS conversion: BS conversion efficiency, recovery, and degradation level. In this study, a multiplex quantitative real-time PCR system named BisQuE was suggested to simultaneously analyze three important aspects of the conversion step. By adopting cytosine-free PCR primers for two differently sized multicopy regions, the short amplicon and long amplicon were obtained from both the genomic and BS-converted DNA, thus enabling the obtaining of reliable and sensitive results and the calculation of the degradation level of the conversion step. Also, probes for detecting converted/unconverted templates and C-T indicators for inducing the formula were included in this assay to quantify BS-converted DNA in order to compute the conversion efficiency and recovery. Six BS conversion kits (EZ DNA Methylation-Lightning Kit, Premium Bisulfite kit, MethylEdge®Bisulfite Conversion System, EpiJET Bisulfite Conversion Kit, EpiTect Fast DNA Bisulfite Kit, and NEBNext®Enzymatic Methyl-seq Conversion Module) were tested in 20 samples using 50 ng of genomic DNA as an input with the BisQuE. The conversion efficiency, degradation levels, as well as recovery rates of the kits were investigated. A total of 99.61-99.90% conversion efficiency was perceived for five of the kits, while the NEBNext kit showed about 94%. The lowest degradation level was shown by the NEBNext kit, whereas the other kits were quite similar. The recovery rates of the kits were found to be within the range of 18-50%. A Qubit assay was also used to compare the recovery rate of BisQuE.Copyright © 2021 Hong and Shin."

However, none of these has yet collected experimental results of compound-related health changes. Since quality of life is often regarded as more valuable than length of life, we aim to fill this gap with the ""Healthy Worm Database"" ( http://healthy-worm-database.eu ). Literature describing health-related compound studies in the aging model Caenorhabditis elegans was screened, and data for 440 compounds collected. The database considers 189 publications describing 89 different phenotypes measured in 2995 different conditions. Besides enabling a targeted search for promising compounds for further investigations, this database also offers insights into the research field of studies on healthy aging based on a frequently used model organism. Some weaknesses of C. elegans-based aging studies, like underrepresented phenotypes, especially concerning cognitive functions, as well as the convenience-based use of young worms as the starting point for compound treatment or phenotype measurement are discussed. In conclusion, the database provides an anchor for the search for compounds affecting health, with a link to public databases, and it further highlights some potential shortcomings in current aging research."
"33712031","X chromosome escapee genes are involved in ischemic sexual dimorphism through epigenetic modification of inflammatory signals.","J Neuroinflammation","Stroke is a sexually dimorphic disease. Previous studies have found that young females are protected against ischemia compared to males, partially due to the protective effect of ovarian hormones, particularly estrogen (E2). However, there are also genetic and epigenetic effects of X chromosome dosage that contribute to stroke sensitivity and neuroinflammation after injury, especially in the aged. Genes that escape from X chromosome inactivation (XCI) contribute to sex-specific phenotypes in many disorders. Kdm5c and kdm6a are X escapee genes that demethylate H3K4me3 and H3K27me3, respectively. We hypothesized that the two demethylases play critical roles in mediating the stroke sensitivity.To identify the X escapee genes involved in stroke, we performed RNA-seq in flow-sorted microglia from aged male and female wild type (WT) mice subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). The expression of these genes (kdm5c/kdm6a) were confirmed in four core genotypes (FCG) mice and in post-mortem human stroke brains by immunohistochemistry (IHC), Western blot, and RT-PCR. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were conducted to detect DNA levels of inflammatory interferon regulatory factor (IRF) 4/5 precipitated by histone H3K4 and H3K27 antibodies. Manipulation of kdm5c/kdm6a expression with siRNA or lentivirus was performed in microglial culture, to determine downstream pathways and examine the regulatory roles in inflammatory cytokine production.Kdm5c and kdm6a mRNA levels were significantly higher in aged WT female vs. male microglia, and the sex difference also existed in ischemic brains from FCG mice and human stroke patients. The ChIP assay showed the IRF 4/5 had higher binding levels to demethylated H3K4 or H3K27, respectively, in female vs. male ischemic microglia. Knockdown or over expression of kdm5c/kdm6a with siRNA or lentivirus altered the methylation of H3K4 or H3K27 at the IRF4/5 genes, which in turn, impacted the production of inflammatory cytokines.The KDM-Histone-IRF pathways are suggested to mediate sex differences in cerebral ischemia. Epigenetic modification of stroke-related genes constitutes an important mechanism underlying the ischemic sexual dimorphism."

This analysis of a cross-sectional population-based study of children and adolescents evaluated demographic and lifestyle determinants of percent liver fat.Healthy participants (123 girls and 99 boys aged 5-17 years) recruited by convenience sampling in three locations completed questionnaires, anthropometric measurements, and dual X-ray absorptiometry and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) assessment. General linear models were applied to estimate the association of demographic, anthropometric, and dietary factors as well as physical activity with MRI-based percent liver fat.The strongest predictor of liver fat was body mass index (BMI;p< 0.0001); overweight and obesity were associated with 0.5% and 1% higher liver fat levels. The respective adjusted mean percent values were 2.9 (95% CI 2.7, 3.1) and 3.4 (95% CI 3.2, 3.6) as compared to normal weight (2.4; 95% CI 2.3, 2.6). Mean percent liver fat was highest in Whites and African Americans, intermediate in Hispanic, and lowest among Asians and Native Hawaiians/Pacific Islanders (p< 0.0001). Age (p= 0.67), sex (p= 0.28), physical activity (p= 0.74), and diet quality (p= 0.70) were not significantly related with liver fat.This study in multiethnic children and adolescents confirms the strong relationship of BMI with percent liver fat even in a population with low liver fat levels without detecting an association with age, sex, and dietary or physical activity patterns.© 2020 The Authors.

Despite the introduction of newer psychotropic drugs, disorder-specific psychotherapy and stimulation techniques, many of those affected still show insufficient symptom remission and a chronic course of the disorder. Conceptual and technological progress in recent years has enabled a new, more flexible and personalized form of mental health care. Both the traditional therapeutic concepts and newer decentralized, modularly structured, track units, together with innovative digital technologies, will offer individualized therapeutic options in order to alleviate symptoms and improve quality of life of patients with mental illnesses. The primary goal of closely combining inpatient care concepts with innovative technologies is to provide comprehensive therapy and aftercare concepts for all individual needs of patients with mental disorders. Last but not least, this also ensures that specialist psychiatric treatment is available regardless of location. In twenty-first century psychiatry, modern care structures must be effectively linked to the current dynamics of digital transformation. This narrative review is dedicated to the theoretical and practical aspects of a cross-sectoral treatment system combined with innovative digital technologies in the psychiatric-psychotherapeutic field.

CIDP can follow a relapsing-remitting or progressive course where the resultant demyelination caused by immune cells (e.g., T cells, macrophages) and antibodies can lead to disability in patients. Importantly, the age of CIDP patients has a role in their symptomology and specific variants have been associated with differing ages of onset. Furthermore, older patients have a decreased frequency of functional recovery after CIDP insult. This may be related to perturbations in immune cell populations that could exacerbate the disease with increasing age. In the present review, the immune profile of typical CIDP will be discussed followed by inferences into the potential role of relevant aging immune cell populations.

HRQoL was regressed on socioeconomic characteristics (age, sex, marital status, educational attainment, employment, poverty status, and availability of savings), social support factors (religion, religious attendance, and caregiving status), community- or societal-level factors (type and major island group of residence), and disease status.Majority of respondents reported that they did not have any problems across all EQ-5D-5L dimensions, namely mobility, self-care, usual activity, pain or discomfort, and anxiety or depression. Pain or discomfort had the highest rate of respondents reporting slight to extreme problems followed by anxiety or depression. Having savings was positively associated with HRQoL, while religious attendance, caregiver status, living in an urban area, living in Visayas or Mindanao, and having a diagnosed disease were negatively associated with HRQoL.This current study confirms that HRQoL varied across socioeconomic statuses and communities in the Philippines."
"33723209","Transcriptome alterations are enriched for synapse-associated genes in the striatum of subjects with obsessive-compulsive disorder.","Transl Psychiatry","Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a chronic and severe psychiatric disorder for which effective treatment options are limited. Structural and functional neuroimaging studies have consistently implicated the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and striatum in the pathophysiology of the disorder. Recent genetic evidence points to involvement of components of the excitatory synapse in the etiology of OCD. However, the transcriptional alterations that could link genetic risk to known structural and functional abnormalities remain mostly unknown. To assess potential transcriptional changes in the OFC and two striatal regions (caudate nucleus and nucleus accumbens) of OCD subjects relative to unaffected comparison subjects, we sequenced messenger RNA transcripts from these brain regions. In a joint analysis of all three regions, 904 transcripts were differentially expressed between 7 OCD versus 8 unaffected comparison subjects. Region-specific analyses highlighted a smaller number of differences, which concentrated in caudate and nucleus accumbens. Pathway analyses of the 904 differentially expressed transcripts showed enrichment for genes involved in synaptic signaling, with these synapse-associated genes displaying lower expression in OCD subjects relative to unaffected comparison subjects. Finally, we estimated that cell type fractions of medium spiny neurons were lower whereas vascular cells and astrocyte fractions were higher in tissue of OCD subjects. Together, these data provide the first unbiased examination of differentially expressed transcripts in both OFC and striatum of OCD subjects. These transcripts encoded synaptic proteins more often than expected by chance, and thus implicate the synapse as a vulnerable molecular compartment for OCD."
"33692996","CTCF Mediates Replicative Senescence Through POLD1.","Front Cell Dev Biol","POLD1, the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase δ, plays a critical role in DNA synthesis and DNA repair processes. Moreover, POLD1 is downregulated in replicative senescence to mediate aging. In any case, the components of age-related downregulation of POLD1 expression have not been fully explained. In this article, we elucidate the mechanism of the regulation of POLD1 at the transcription level and found that the transcription factor CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) was bound to the POLD1 promoter area in two sites. The binding level of CTCF for the POLD1 promoter appeared to be related to aging and was confirmed to be positively controlled by the CTCF level. Additionally, cell senescence characteristics were detected within the cells transfected with short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-CTCF, pLenti-CMV-CTCF, shRNA-POLD1, and pLenti-CMV-POLD1, and the results showed that the CTCF may contribute to the altered expression of POLD1 in aging. In conclusion, the binding level of CTCF for the POLD1 promoter intervened by an age-related decrease in CTCF and downregulated the POLD1 expression in aging. Moreover, the decrease in CTCF-mediated POLD1 transcription accelerates the progression of cell aging.Copyright © 2021 Hou, Song, Gao, Zhang, Wang, Liu, Fu, Cao and Wang."
"33670524","Therapeutic Advances in Oncology.","Int J Mol Sci","Around 77 new oncology drugs were approved by the FDA in the past five years; however, most cancers remain untreated. Small molecules and antibodies are dominant therapeutic modalities in oncology. Antibody-drug conjugates, bispecific antibodies, peptides, cell, and gene-therapies are emerging to address the unmet patient need. Advancement in the discovery and development platforms, identification of novel targets, and emergence of new technologies have greatly expanded the treatment options for patients. Here, we provide an overview of various therapeutic modalities and the current treatment options in oncology, and an in-depth discussion of the therapeutics in the preclinical stage for the treatment of breast cancer, lung cancer, and multiple myeloma."
"33669307","Rationale for Early Detection of <i>EWSR1</i> Translocation-Associated Sarcoma Biomarkers in Liquid Biopsy.","Cancers (Basel)","Sarcomas are mesenchymal tumours that often arise and develop as a result of chromosomal translocations, and for several forms of sarcoma theEWSR1gene is a frequent translocation partner. Sarcomas are a rare form of malignancy, which arguably have a proportionally greater societal burden that their prevalence would suggest, as they are more common in young people, with survivors prone to lifelong disability. For most forms of sarcoma, histological diagnosis is confirmed by molecular techniques such as FISH or RT-PCR. Surveillance after surgical excision, or ablation by radiation or chemotherapy, has remained relatively unchanged for decades, but recent developments in molecular biology have accelerated the progress towards routine analysis of liquid biopsies of peripheral blood. The potential to detect evidence of residual disease or metastasis in the blood has been demonstrated by several groups but remains unrealized as a routine diagnostic for relapse during remission, for disease monitoring during treatment, and for the detection of occult, residual disease at the end of therapy. An update is provided on research relevant to the improvement of the early detection of relapse in sarcomas withEWSR1-associated translocations, in the contexts of biology, diagnosis, and liquid biopsy."
"33641249","Methylation status and long-fragment cell-free DNA are prognostic biomarkers for gastric cancer.","Cancer Med","Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) detected before surgery disappears after complete surgical resection of the cancer. Residual ctDNA indicates minimal residual disease (MRD), which is a cause of recurrence. The presence of long-fragment circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) or methylated cfDNA also implies the presence of cancer. In this study, we evaluated the prognostic value of cfDNA methylation and long-fragment cfDNA concentration in gastric cancer patients undergoing curative surgery METHODS: Ninety-nine gastric cancer patients were included. Peripheral blood samples were collected before and 1 month after surgery. In patients administered chemotherapy, samples were collected before starting chemotherapy. qPCR was performed to detect long- and short-fragment LINE-1. A plasma HELP (HpaII tiny fragment Enrichment by Ligation-mediated PCR) assay to determine the concentration of HpaII small fragments was performed using ligation-mediated PCR and HpaII was quantified as the HpaII:MspI ratio to detect methylation levels of cfDNA.Overall survival (OS) of patients with low methylation levels before starting treatment was significantly worse than that of patients with high methylation levels (P = 0.006). In the 90 patients who underwent curative surgery, recurrence-free survival (RFS) and OS of patients with low methylation levels before surgery were worse than those with high methylation levels (P=0.08 and P = 0.11, respectively). RFS and OS of patients with high concentrations of long-fragment LINE-1 after surgery were significantly worse than those with low concentrations of long-fragment LINE-1 (P = 0.009, P = 0.04).Pre-surgical low methylation levels of LINE-1 are a negative prognostic factor. Post-surgical high concentrations of long-fragment LINE-1 indicate MRD and a high risk of recurrence.© 2021 The Authors. Cancer Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd."
"33722289","Prime editing in mice reveals the essentiality of a single base in driving tissue-specific gene expression.","Genome Biol","Most single nucleotide variants (SNVs) occur in noncoding sequence where millions of transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) reside. Here, a comparative analysis of CRISPR-mediated homology-directed repair (HDR) versus the recently reported prime editing 2 (PE2) system was carried out in mice over a TFBS called a CArG box in the Tspan2 promoter.Quantitative RT-PCR showed loss of Tspan2 mRNA in aorta and bladder, but not heart or brain, of mice homozygous for an HDR-mediated three base pair substitution in the Tspan2 CArG box. Using the same protospacer, mice homozygous for a PE2-mediated single-base substitution in the Tspan2 CArG box displayed similar cell-specific loss of Tspan2 mRNA; expression of an overlapping long noncoding RNA was also nearly abolished in aorta and bladder. Immuno-RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization validated loss of Tspan2 in vascular smooth muscle cells of HDR and PE2 CArG box mutant mice. Targeted sequencing demonstrated variable frequencies of on-target editing in all PE2 and HDR founders. However, whereas no on-target indels were detected in any of the PE2 founders, all HDR founders showed varying levels of on-target indels. Off-target analysis by targeted sequencing revealed mutations in many HDR founders, but none in PE2 founders.PE2 directs high-fidelity editing of a single base in a TFBS leading to cell-specific loss in expression of an mRNA/long noncoding RNA gene pair. The PE2 platform expands the genome editing toolbox for modeling and correcting relevant noncoding SNVs in the mouse."
"33664771","Cancer and Tumour Suppressor p53 Encounters at the Juncture of Sex Disparity.","Front Genet","There are many differences in cancer manifestation between men and women. New understanding of the origin of these point to fundamental distinctions in the genetic code and its demise. Tumour suppressor protein p53 is the chief operating officer of cancer defence and critically acts to safeguard against sustained DNA damaged. P53 cannot be ignored in cancer sex disparity. In this review we discuss the greater prevalence and associated death rates for non-reproductive cancers in males. The major tumour suppressor protein p53, encoded in theTP53gene is our chosen context. It is fitting to ask why somaticTP53mutation incidence is estimated to be disproportionately higher among males in the population for these types of cancers compared with females? We scrutinised the literature for evidence of predisposing genetic and epigenetic alterations that may explain this sex bias. Our second approach was to explore whether redox activity, either externally imposed or inherent to males and females, may define distinct risks that could contribute to the clear cancer sex disparities.Copyright © 2021 Haupt and Haupt."
"33671362","Evidence of the Cellular Senescence Stress Response in Mitotically Active Brain Cells-Implications for Cancer and Neurodegeneration.","Life (Basel)","Cellular stress responses influence cell fate decisions. Apoptosis and proliferation represent opposing reactions to cellular stress or damage and may influence distinct health outcomes. Clinical and epidemiological studies consistently report inverse comorbidities between age-associated neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. This review discusses how one particular stress response, cellular senescence, may contribute to this inverse correlation. In mitotically competent cells, senescence is favorable over uncontrolled proliferation, i.e., cancer. However, senescent cells notoriously secrete deleterious molecules that drive disease, dysfunction and degeneration in surrounding tissue. In recent years, senescent cells have emerged as unexpected mediators of neurodegenerative diseases. The present review uses pre-defined criteria to evaluate evidence of cellular senescence in mitotically competent brain cells, highlights the discovery of novel molecular regulators and discusses how this single cell fate decision impacts cancer and degeneration in the brain. We also underscore methodological considerations required to appropriately evaluate the cellular senescence stress response in the brain."
"33679435","The Comparative Methylome and Transcriptome After Change of Direction Compared to Straight Line Running Exercise in Human Skeletal Muscle.","Front Physiol","The methylome and transcriptome signatures following exercise that are physiologically and metabolically relevant to sporting contexts such as team sports or health prescription scenarios (e.g., high intensity interval training/HIIT) has not been investigated. To explore this, we performed two different sport/exercise relevant high-intensity running protocols in five male sport team members using a repeated measures design of: (1) change of direction (COD) versus; (2) straight line (ST) running exercise with a wash-out period of at least 2 weeks between trials. Skeletal muscle biopsies collected from the vastus lateralis 30 min and 24 h post exercise, were assayed using 850K methylation arrays and a comparative analysis with recent (subject-unmatched) sprint and acute aerobic exercise meta-analysis transcriptomes was performed. Despite COD and ST exercise being matched for classically defined intensity measures (speed × distance and number of accelerations/decelerations), COD exercise elicited greater movement (GPS-Playerload), physiological (HR), metabolic (lactate) as well as central and peripheral (differential RPE) exertion measures compared with ST exercise, suggesting COD exercise evoked a higher exercise intensity. The exercise response alone across both conditions evoked extensive alterations in the methylome 30 min and 24 h post exercise, particularly in MAPK, AMPK and axon guidance pathways. COD evoked a considerably greater hypomethylated signature across the genome compared with ST exercise, particularly at 30 min post exercise, enriched in: Protein binding, MAPK, AMPK, insulin, and axon guidance pathways. Comparative methylome analysis with sprint running transcriptomes identified considerable overlap, with 49% of genes that were altered at the expression level also differentially methylated after COD exercise. After differential methylated region analysis, we observed that VEGFA and its downstream nuclear transcription factor,NR4A1had enriched hypomethylation within their promoter regions.VEGFAandNR4A1were also significantly upregulated in the sprint transcriptome and meta-analysis of exercise transcriptomes. We also confirmed increased gene expression ofVEGFA, and considerably larger increases in the expression of canonical metabolic genesPPARGC1A (that encodes PGC1-α) andNR4A3in COD vs. ST exercise. Overall, we demonstrate that increased physiological/metabolic load via COD exercise in human skeletal muscle evokes considerable epigenetic modifications that are associated with changes in expression of genes responsible for adaptation to exercise.Copyright © 2021 Maasar, Turner, Gorski, Seaborne, Strauss, Shepherd, Cocks, Pillon, Zierath, Hulton, Drust and Sharples."

Here, we review the known functions of 5hmC and TET enzymes in neural progenitor cell biology and embryonic and postnatal neurogenesis. We also discuss how TET enzymes and 5hmC regulate neuronal activity and brain function and highlight their implications in human neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. Finally, we present outstanding questions in the field and envision new research directions into the roles of 5hmC and TET enzymes in neurodevelopment.Copyright © 2021 MacArthur and Dawlaty."
"33757423","Hybrid genome de novo assembly with methylome analysis of the anaerobic thermophilic subsurface bacterium Thermanaerosceptrum fracticalcis strain DRI-13<sup>T</sup>.","BMC Genomics","There is a dearth of sequenced and closed microbial genomes from environments that exceed > 500 m below level terrestrial surface. Coupled with even fewer cultured isolates, study and understanding of how life endures in the extreme oligotrophic subsurface environments is greatly hindered. Using a de novo hybrid assembly of Illumina and Oxford Nanopore sequences we produced a circular genome with corresponding methylome profile of the recently characterized thermophilic, anaerobic, and fumarate-respiring subsurface bacterium, Thermanaerosceptrum fracticalcis, strain DRI-13Tto understand how this microorganism survives the deep subsurface.The hybrid assembly produced a single circular genome of 3.8 Mb in length with an overall GC content of 45%. Out of the total 4022 annotated genes, 3884 are protein coding, 87 are RNA encoding genes, and the remaining 51 genes were associated with regulatory features of the genome including riboswitches and T-box leader sequences. Approximately 24% of the protein coding genes were hypothetical. Analysis of strain DRI-13Tgenome revealed: 1) energy conservation by bifurcation hydrogenase when growing on fumarate, 2) four novel bacterial prophages, 3) methylation profile including 76.4% N6-methyladenine and 3.81% 5-methylcytosine corresponding to novel DNA methyltransferase motifs. As well a cluster of 45 genes of unknown protein families that have enriched DNA mCpG proximal to the transcription start sites, and 4) discovery of a putative core of bacteriophage exclusion (BREX) genes surrounded by hypothetical proteins, with predicted functions as helicases, nucleases, and exonucleases.The de novo hybrid assembly of strain DRI-13Tgenome has provided a more contiguous and accurate view of the subsurface bacterium T. fracticalcis, strain DRI-13T. This genome analysis reveals a physiological focus supporting syntrophy, non-homologous double stranded DNA repair, mobility/adherence/chemotaxis, unique methylome profile/recognized motifs, and a BREX defense system. The key to microbial subsurface survival may not rest on genetic diversity, but rather through specific syntrophy niches and novel methylation strategies."
"33670779","Increased Histone Acetylation and Decreased Expression of Specific Histone Deacetylases in Ultraviolet-Irradiated and Intrinsically Aged Human Skin In Vivo.","Int J Mol Sci","Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are conserved enzymes that remove acetyl groups from lysine side chains in histones and other proteins and play a crucial role in epigenetic regulation. Previously, we showed that histone acetylation is implicated in ultraviolet (UV)-induced inflammation and matrix impairment. To elucidate the histone acetylation status and specific HDACs involved in skin aging, we examined the changes in histone acetylation, global HDAC activity, and the expression of HDACs and sirtuins (SIRTs) in intrinsically aged and photoaged human skin as well as in UV-irradiated human skin in vivo. Following acute UV irradiation, the acetylated histone H3 (AcH3) level was increased, but HDAC activity and the expression levels of HDAC4, HDAC11, and SIRT4 were significantly decreased. In intrinsically aged skin, AcH3 levels were increased, but HDAC activity and the expression levels of HDAC4, HDAC5, HDAC10, HDAC11, SIRT6, and SIRT7 were significantly decreased. However, histone acetylation and HDAC expression in photoaged skin were not significantly different from those in intrinsically aged skin. Collectively, HDAC4 and HDAC11 were decreased in both UV-irradiated and intrinsically aged skin, suggesting that they may play a universal role in increased histone acetylation associated with skin aging."
"33670312","Axonal Organelles as Molecular Platforms for Axon Growth and Regeneration after Injury.","Int J Mol Sci","Investigating the molecular mechanisms governing developmental axon growth has been a useful approach for identifying new strategies for boosting axon regeneration after injury, with the goal of treating debilitating conditions such as spinal cord injury and vision loss. The picture emerging is that various axonal organelles are important centers for organizing the molecular mechanisms and machinery required for growth cone development and axon extension, and these have recently been targeted to stimulate robust regeneration in the injured adult central nervous system (CNS). This review summarizes recent literature highlighting a central role for organelles such as recycling endosomes, the endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, lysosomes, autophagosomes and the proteasome in developmental axon growth, and describes how these organelles can be targeted to promote axon regeneration after injury to the adult CNS. This review also examines the connections between these organelles in developing and regenerating axons, and finally discusses the molecular mechanisms within the axon that are required for successful axon growth."
"33627519","Aging and rejuvenation - a modular epigenome model.","Aging (Albany NY)","The view of aging has evolved in parallel with the advances in biomedical sciences. Long considered as an irreversible process where interventions were only aimed at slowing down its progression, breakthrough discoveries like animal cloning and cell reprogramming have deeply changed our understanding of postnatal development, giving rise to the emerging view that the epigenome is the driver of aging. The idea was significantly strengthened by the converging discovery that DNA methylation (DNAm) at specific CpG sites could be used as a highly accurate biomarker of age defined by an algorithm known as the Horvath clock. It was at this point where epigenetic rejuvenation came into play as a strategy to reveal to what extent biological age can be set back by making the clock tick backwards. Initial evidence suggests that when the clock is forced to tick backwardsin vivo, it is only able to drag the phenotype to a partially rejuvenated condition. In order to explain the results, a bimodular epigenome is proposed, where module A represents the DNAm clock component and module B the remainder of the epigenome. Epigenetic rejuvenation seems to hold the key to arresting or even reversing organismal aging."
"33707481","Visibility graph based temporal community detection with applications in biological time series.","Sci Rep","Temporal behavior is an essential aspect of all biological systems. Time series have been previously represented as networks. Such representations must address two fundamental problems on how to: (1) Create appropriate networks to reflect the characteristics of biological time series. (2) Detect characteristic dynamic patterns or events as network temporal communities. General community detection methods use metrics comparing the connectivity within a community to random models, or are based on the betweenness centrality of edges or nodes. However, such methods were not designed for network representations of time series. We introduce a visibility-graph-based method to build networks from time series and detect temporal communities within these networks. To characterize unevenly sampled time series (typical of biological experiments), and simultaneously capture events associated to peaks and troughs, we introduce the Weighted Dual-Perspective Visibility Graph (WDPVG). To detect temporal communities in individual signals, we first find the shortest path of the network between start and end nodes, identifying high intensity nodes as the main stem of our community detection algorithm that act as hubs for each community. Then, we aggregate nodes outside the shortest path to the closest nodes found on the main stem based on the closest path length, thereby assigning every node to a temporal community based on proximity to the stem nodes/hubs. We demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of our method through simulation and biological applications."
