No,Cancer,33762478,Genome-wide association analysis reveals regulation of at-risk loci by DNA methylation in prostate cancer.,Asian J Androl,"Epigenetic changes are potentially important for the ontogeny and progression of tumors but are not usually studied because of the complexity of analyzing transcript regulation resulting from epigenetic alterations. Prostate cancer (PCa) is characterized by variable clinical manifestations and frequently unpredictable outcomes. We performed an expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis to identify the genomic regions that regulate gene expression in PCa and identified a relationship between DNA methylation and clinical information. Using multi-level information published in The Cancer Genome Atlas, we performed eQTL-based analyses on DNA methylation and gene expression. To better interpret these data, we correlated loci and clinical indexes to identify the important loci for both PCa development and progression. Our data demonstrated that although only a small proportion of genes are regulated via DNA methylation in PCa, these genes are enriched in important cancer-related groups. In addition, single nucleotide polymorphism analysis identified the locations of CpG sites and genes within at-risk loci, including the 19q13.2-q13.43 and 16q22.2-q23.1 loci. Further, an epigenetic association study of clinical indexes detected risk loci and pyrosequencing for site validation. Although DNA methylation-regulated genes across PCa samples are a small proportion, the associated genes play important roles in PCa carcinogenesis."
No,Cancer,33666134,DNA-methylation for the detection and distinction of 19 human malignancies.,Epigenetics,"The contribution of DNA-methylation based gene silencing to carcinogenesis is well established. Increasingly, DNA-methylation is examined using genome-wide techniques, with recent public efforts yielding immense data sets of diverse malignancies representing the vast majority of human cancer related disease burden. Whereas mutation events may group preferentially or in high frequency with a given histology, mutations are poor classifiers of tumour type. Here we examine the hypothesis that cancer-specific DNA-methylation reflects the tissue of origin or carcinogenic risk factor, and these methylation abnormalities may be used to faithfully classify tumours according to histology. We present an analysis of 7427 tumours representing 19 human malignancies and 708 normal samples demonstrating that specific tumour changes in methylation can correctly determine site of origin and tumour histology with 86% overall accuracy. Examination of misclassified tumours reveals underlying shared biology as the source of misclassifications, including common cell of origin or risk factors."
No,Cancer,33707228,DNA methylation epitypes highlight underlying developmental and disease pathways in acute myeloid leukemia.,Genome Res,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a molecularly complex disease characterized by heterogeneous tumor genetic profiles and involving numerous pathogenic mechanisms and pathways. Integration of molecular data types across multiple patient cohorts may advance current genetic approaches for improved sub-classification and understanding of the biology of the disease. Here we analyzed genome-wide DNA methylation in 649 AML patients using Illumina arrays and identified a configuration of 13 subtypes (termed 'epitypes') using unbiased clustering. Integration of genetic data revealed that most epitypes were associated with a certain recurrent mutation (or combination) in a majority of patients, yet other epitypes were largely independent. Epitypes demonstrated developmental blockage at discrete stages of myeloid differentiation, revealing epitypes that retain arrested hematopoietic stem cell-like phenotypes. Detailed analyses of DNA methylation patterns identified unique patterns of aberrant hyper- and hypomethylation among epitypes, with variable involvement of transcription factors influencing promoter, enhancer, and repressed regions. Patients in epitypes with stem cell-like methylation features showed inferior overall survival along with upregulated stem cell gene expression signatures. We further identified a DNA methylation signature involving STAT motifs associated withFLT3-ITD mutations. Finally, DNA methylation signatures were stable at relapse for the large majority of patients, and rare epitype switching accompanied loss of the dominant epitype mutations and reversion to stem cell-like methylation patterns. These results demonstrate that DNA methylation-based classification integrates important molecular features of AML to reveal the diverse pathogenic and biological aspects of the disease.Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press."
No,Cell lines,33676569,Association of expression of epigenetic molecular factors with DNA methylation and sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents in cancer cell lines.,Clin Epigenetics,"Altered DNA methylation patterns play important roles in cancer development and progression. We examined whether expression levels of genes directly or indirectly involved in DNA methylation and demethylation may be associated with response of cancer cell lines to chemotherapy treatment with a variety of antitumor agents.We analyzed 72 genes encoding epigenetic factors directly or indirectly involved in DNA methylation and demethylation processes. We examined association of their pretreatment expression levels with methylation beta-values of individual DNA methylation probes, DNA methylation averaged within gene regions, and average epigenome-wide methylation levels. We analyzed data from 645 cancer cell lines and 23 cancer types from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia and Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer datasets. We observed numerous correlations between expression of genes encoding epigenetic factors and response to chemotherapeutic agents. Expression of genes encoding a variety of epigenetic factors, including KDM2B, DNMT1, EHMT2, SETDB1, EZH2, APOBEC3G, and other genes, was correlated with response to multiple agents. DNA methylation of numerous target probes and gene regions was associated with expression of multiple genes encoding epigenetic factors, underscoring complex regulation of epigenome methylation by multiple intersecting molecular pathways. The genes whose expression was associated with methylation of multiple epigenome targets encode DNA methyltransferases, TET DNA methylcytosine dioxygenases, the methylated DNA-binding protein ZBTB38, KDM2B, SETDB1, and other molecular factors which are involved in diverse epigenetic processes affecting DNA methylation. While baseline DNA methylation of numerous epigenome targets was correlated with cell line response to antitumor agents, the complex relationships between the overlapping effects of each epigenetic factor on methylation of specific targets and the importance of such influences in tumor response to individual agents require further investigation.Expression of multiple genes encoding epigenetic factors is associated with drug response and with DNA methylation of numerous epigenome targets that may affect response to therapeutic agents. Our findings suggest complex and interconnected pathways regulating DNA methylation in the epigenome, which may both directly and indirectly affect response to chemotherapy."
No,DNAm age,33653394,Weight management intervention identifies association of decreased DNA methylation age with improved functional age measures in older adults with obesity.,Clin Epigenetics,"Assessing functional ability is an important component of understanding healthy aging. Objective measures of functional ability include grip strength, gait speed, sit-to-stand time, and 6-min walk distance. Using samples from a weight loss clinical trial in older adults with obesity, we examined the association between changes in physical function and DNA-methylation-based biological age at baseline and 12 weeks in 16 individuals. Peripheral blood DNA methylation was measured (pre/post) with the Illumina HumanMethylationEPIC array and the Hannum, Horvath, and PhenoAge DNA methylation age clocks were used. Linear regression models adjusted for chronological age and sex tested the relationship between DNA methylation age and grip strength, gait speed, sit-to-stand, and 6-min walk.Participant mean weight loss was 4.6 kg, and DNA methylation age decreased 0.8, 1.1, and 0.5 years using the Hannum, Horvath, and PhenoAge DNA methylation clocks respectively. Mean grip strength increased 3.2 kg. Decreased Hannum methylation age was significantly associated with increased grip strength (β = -0.30, p = 0.04), and increased gait speed (β = 0.02, p = 0.05), in adjusted models. Similarly, decreased methylation age using the PhenoAge clock was associated with significantly increased gait speed (β = 0.02, p = 0.04). A decrease in Horvath DNA methylation age and increase in physical functional ability did not demonstrate a significant association.The observed relationship between increased physical functional ability and decreased biological age using DNA methylation clocks demonstrate the potential utility of DNA methylation clocks to assess interventional approaches to improve health in older obese adults.National Institute on Aging (NIA), NCT03104192.

No,DNAm age,33726838,Epigenetic age acceleration is associated with cardiometabolic risk factors and clinical cardiovascular disease risk scores in African Americans.,Clin Epigenetics,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality among US adults. African Americans have higher burden of CVD morbidity and mortality compared to any other racial group. Identifying biomarkers for clinical risk prediction of CVD offers an opportunity for precision prevention and earlier intervention.Using linear mixed models, we investigated the cross-sectional association between four measures of epigenetic age acceleration (intrinsic (IEAA), extrinsic (EEAA), PhenoAge (PhenoAA), and GrimAge (GrimAA)) and ten cardiometabolic markers of hypertension, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia in 1,100 primarily hypertensive African Americans from sibships in the Genetic Epidemiology Network of Arteriopathy (GENOA). We then assessed the association between epigenetic age acceleration and time to self-reported incident CVD using frailty hazard models and investigated CVD risk prediction improvement compared to models with clinical risk scores (Framingham risk score (FRS) and the atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk equation). After adjusting for sex and chronological age, increased epigenetic age acceleration was associated with higher systolic blood pressure (IEAA), higher pulse pressure (EEAA and GrimAA), higher fasting glucose (PhenoAA and GrimAA), higher fasting insulin (EEAA), lower low density cholesterol (GrimAA), and higher triglycerides (GrimAA). A five-year increase in GrimAA was associated with CVD incidence with a hazard ratio of 1.54 (95% CI 1.22-2.01) and remained significant after adjusting for CVD risk factors. The addition of GrimAA to risk score models improved model fit using likelihood ratio tests (P = 0.013 for FRS and P = 0.008 for ASCVD), but did not improve C statistics (P > 0.05). Net reclassification index (NRI) showed small but significant improvement in reassignment of risk categories with the addition of GrimAA to FRS (NRI: 0.055, 95% CI 0.040-0.071) and the ASCVD equation (NRI: 0.029, 95% CI 0.006-0.064).Epigenetic age acceleration measures are associated with traditional CVD risk factors in an African-American cohort with a high prevalence of hypertension. GrimAA was associated with CVD incidence and slightly improved prediction of CVD events over clinical risk scores."
No,DNAm age,33712580,DNA methylation predicts age and provides insight into exceptional longevity of bats.,Nat Commun,"Exceptionally long-lived species, including many bats, rarely show overt signs of aging, making it difficult to determine why species differ in lifespan. Here, we use DNA methylation (DNAm) profiles from 712 known-age bats, representing 26 species, to identify epigenetic changes associated with age and longevity. We demonstrate that DNAm accurately predicts chronological age. Across species, longevity is negatively associated with the rate of DNAm change at age-associated sites. Furthermore, analysis of several bat genomes reveals that hypermethylated age- and longevity-associated sites are disproportionately located in promoter regions of key transcription factors (TF) and enriched for histone and chromatin features associated with transcriptional regulation. Predicted TF binding site motifs and enrichment analyses indicate that age-related methylation change is influenced by developmental processes, while longevity-related DNAm change is associated with innate immunity or tumorigenesis genes, suggesting that bat longevity results from augmented immune response and cancer suppression."
No,DNAm age,33663610,Lifestyle weight-loss intervention may attenuate methylation aging: the CENTRAL MRI randomized controlled trial.,Clin Epigenetics,"DNA methylation age (mAge), a methylation biomarker for the aging process, might serve as a more accurate predictor of morbidity and aging status than chronological age. We evaluated the role of multiple factors, including fat deposition, cardiometabolic risk factors and lifestyle weight-loss intervention, on the deviation of mAge from chronological age (mAge deviation) or 18-month change in mAge (∆mAge). In this sub-study of the CENTRAL magnetic resonance imaging weight-loss trial, we evaluated mAge by a validated 240-CpG-based prediction formula at baseline and after 18-month intervention of either low fat (LF) or mediterranean/low carbohydrate (MED/LC) diets.Among 120 CENTRAL participants with abdominal obesity or dyslipidemia, mAge (mean ± SD: 60.3 ± 7.5 years) was higher than the chronological age (48.6 ± 9.3 years) but strongly correlated (r = 0.93; p = 3.1 × 10-53). Participants in the lowest tertile of mAge deviation from their chronological age had significantly lower waist-circumference, visceral adipose tissue, intrahepatic fat (IHF) content, fasting-glucose and HOMA-IR, as compared with participants in the highest sex-specific residual tertile (p < 0.05 for all). IHF% remained associated with greater mAge deviation after further adjustments (β = 0.23; p = 0.02). After 18-month weight-loss lifestyle intervention, mAge remained significantly correlated with chronological age (r = 0.94, p = 1.5 × 10-55). mAging occurred, with no difference between lifestyle intervention groups (∆ = 0.9 ± 1.9 years in MED/LC vs. ∆ = 1.3 ± 1.9 years in LF; p = 0.2); however, we observed a mAging attenuation in successful weight losers (> 5% weight loss) vs. weight-loss failures ( ∆ = 0.6 years vs. ∆ = 1.1 years; p = 0.04), and in participants who completed the trial with healthy liver fat content (< 5% IHF) vs. participants with fatty liver (∆ = 0.6 years vs. ∆ = 1.8 years; p = 0.003). Overall, 18 months of weight-loss lifestyle intervention attenuated the mAging of the men, mainly the older, by 7.1 months than the expected (p < 0.05).Lifestyle weight-loss intervention may attenuate mAging. Deviation of mAge from chronological age might be related to body fat distribution and glycemic control and could indicate biological age, health status and the risk for premature cardiometabolic diseases.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01530724.

No,DNAm age,33749330,Epigenetic age associates with psychosocial stress and resilience in children of Latinx immigrants.,Epigenomics,"Aim:To investigate associations of psychosocial stressors and resilience factors with DNA methylation age in saliva of Latinx children of immigrants before and after the 2016 presidential election (2015-2018).Materials & methods:We compared psychosocial exposures with four distinct measures of epigenetic age assessed in saliva of children (6-13 years, n = 71 pre-election; n = 35 post-election). Exploratory genome-wide analyses were also conducted.Results:We found distinct associations across epigenetic clocks and time points: for example, greater maternal social status pre-election and fear of parent deportation post-election both associated with decreased Hannum Age (p ≤ 0.01).Conclusion:Though limited in size, our unique study design provides novel hypotheses regarding how the social environment may influence epigenetic aging and genome-wide methylation, potentially contributing to racial/ethnic health inequalities."
No,Metastable epialleles,33680493,Rationale and design of the Baylor Infant Twin Study-A study assessing obesity-related risk factors from infancy.,Obes Sci Pract,"Early childhood (0-3 years) is a critical period for obesity prevention, when tendencies in eating behaviors and physical activity are established. Yet, little is understood about how the environment shapes children's genetic predisposition for these behaviors during this time. The Baylor Infant Twin Study (BITS) is a two phase study, initiated to study obesity risk factors from infancy. Data collection has been completed for Phase 1 in which three sub-studies pilot central measures for Phase 2. A novel infant temperament assessment, based on observations made by trained researchers was piloted inBehavior Observation Pilot Protocol(BOPP) study, a new device for measuring infant feeding parameters (the ""orometer"") in theBaylor Infant Orometer(BIO), and methods for analyzing DNA methylation in twins of unknown chorionicity inEpiTwin.EpiTwin was a cross-sectional study of neonatal twins, while up to three study visits occurred for the other studies, at 4- (BOPP, BIO), 6- (BOPP), and 12- (BOPP, BIO) of age. Measurements for BOPP and BIO included temperament observations, feeding observations, and body composition assessments while EpiTwin focused on collecting samples of hair, urine, nails, and blood for quantifying methylation levels at 10 metastable epialleles. Additional data collected include demographic information, zygosity, chorionicity, and questionnaire-based measures of infant behaviors.Recruitment for all three studies was completed in early 2020. EpiTwin recruited 80 twin pairs (50% monochorionic), 31 twin pairs completed the BOPP protocol, and 68 singleton infants participated in BIO.The psychometric properties of the data from all three studies are being analyzed currently. The resulting findings will inform the development of the full BITS protocol, with the goal of completing assessments at 4-, 6-, 12-, and 14-month of age for 400 twin pairs.© 2020 The Authors.

No,Methods,33707472,EMeth: An EM algorithm for cell type decomposition based on DNA methylation data.,Sci Rep,"We introduce a new computational method named EMeth to estimate cell type proportions using DNA methylation data. EMeth is a reference-based method that requires cell type-specific DNA methylation data from relevant cell types. EMeth improves on the existing reference-based methods by detecting the CpGs whose DNA methylation are inconsistent with the deconvolution model and reducing their contributions to cell type decomposition. Another novel feature of EMeth is that it allows a cell type with known proportions but unknown reference and estimates its methylation. This is motivated by the case of studying methylation in tumor cells while bulk tumor samples include tumor cells as well as other cell types such as infiltrating immune cells, and tumor cell proportion can be estimated by copy number data. We demonstrate that EMeth delivers more accurate estimates of cell type proportions than several other methods using simulated data and in silico mixtures. Applications in cancer studies show that the proportions of T regulatory cells estimated by DNA methylation have expected associations with mutation load and survival time, while the estimates from gene expression miss such associations."
No,Methods,33722199,Correction for both common and rare cell types in blood is important to identify genes that correlate with age.,BMC Genomics,"Aging is a multifactorial process that affects multiple tissues and is characterized by changes in homeostasis over time, leading to increased morbidity. Whole blood gene expression signatures have been associated with aging and have been used to gain information on its biological mechanisms, which are still not fully understood. However, blood is composed of many cell types whose proportions in blood vary with age. As a result, previously observed associations between gene expression levels and aging might be driven by cell type composition rather than intracellular aging mechanisms. To overcome this, previous aging studies already accounted for major cell types, but the possibility that the reported associations are false positives driven by less prevalent cell subtypes remains.Here, we compared the regression model from our previous work to an extended model that corrects for 33 additional white blood cell subtypes. Both models were applied to whole blood gene expression data from 3165 individuals belonging to the general population (age range of 18-81 years). We evaluated that the new model is a better fit for the data and it identified fewer genes associated with aging (625, compared to the 2808 of the initial model; P ≤ 2.5⨯10-6). Moreover, 511 genes (~ 18% of the 2808 genes identified by the initial model) were found using both models, indicating that the other previously reported genes could be proxies for less abundant cell types. In particular, functional enrichment of the genes identified by the new model highlighted pathways and GO terms specifically associated with platelet activity.We conclude that gene expression analyses in blood strongly benefit from correction for both common and rare blood cell types, and recommend using blood-cell count estimates as standard covariates when studying whole blood gene expression."
No,Methods,33752591,Nonlinear ridge regression improves cell-type-specific differential expression analysis.,BMC Bioinformatics,"Epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) and differential gene expression analyses are generally performed on tissue samples, which consist of multiple cell types. Cell-type-specific effects of a trait, such as disease, on the omics expression are of interest but difficult or costly to measure experimentally. By measuring omics data for the bulk tissue, cell type composition of a sample can be inferred statistically. Subsequently, cell-type-specific effects are estimated by linear regression that includes terms representing the interaction between the cell type proportions and the trait. This approach involves two issues, scaling and multicollinearity.First, although cell composition is analyzed in linear scale, differential methylation/expression is analyzed suitably in the logit/log scale. To simultaneously analyze two scales, we applied nonlinear regression. Second, we show that the interaction terms are highly collinear, which is obstructive to ordinary regression. To cope with the multicollinearity, we applied ridge regularization. In simulated data, nonlinear ridge regression attained well-balanced sensitivity, specificity and precision. Marginal model attained the lowest precision and highest sensitivity and was the only algorithm to detect weak signal in real data.Nonlinear ridge regression performed cell-type-specific association test on bulk omics data with well-balanced performance. The omicwas package for R implements nonlinear ridge regression for cell-type-specific EWAS, differential gene expression and QTL analyses.

No,Reference,33739972,Assessing the co-variability of DNA methylation across peripheral cells and tissues: Implications for the interpretation of findings in epigenetic epidemiology.,PLoS Genet,"Most epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) quantify DNA methylation (DNAm) in peripheral tissues such as whole blood to identify positions in the genome where variation is statistically associated with a trait or exposure. As whole blood comprises a mix of cell types, it is unclear whether trait-associated DNAm variation is specific to an individual cellular population. We collected three peripheral tissues (whole blood, buccal epithelial and nasal epithelial cells) from thirty individuals. Whole blood samples were subsequently processed using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to purify five constituent cell-types (monocytes, granulocytes, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and B cells). DNAm was profiled in all eight sample-types from each individual using the Illumina EPIC array. We identified significant differences in both the level and variability of DNAm between different sample types, and DNAm data-derived estimates of age and smoking were found to differ dramatically across sample types from the same individual. We found that for the majority of loci variation in DNAm in individual blood cell types was only weakly predictive of variance in DNAm measured in whole blood, although the proportion of variance explained was greater than that explained by either buccal or nasal epithelial samples. Covariation across sample types was much higher for DNAm sites influenced by genetic factors. Overall, we observe that DNAm variation in whole blood is additively influenced by a combination of the major blood cell types. For a subset of sites, however, variable DNAm detected in whole blood can be attributed to variation in a single blood cell type providing potential mechanistic insight about EWAS findings. Our results suggest that associations between whole blood DNAm and traits or exposures reflect differences in multiple cell types and our data will facilitate the interpretation of findings in epigenetic epidemiology."
No,Reference,33669975,Extensive Placental Methylation Profiling in Normal Pregnancies.,Int J Mol Sci,"The placental methylation pattern is crucial for the regulation of genes involved in trophoblast invasion and placental development, both key events for fetal growth. We investigated LINE-1 methylation and methylome profiling using a methylation EPIC array and the targeted methylation sequencing of 154 normal, full-term pregnancies, stratified by birth weight percentiles. LINE-1 methylation showed evidence of a more pronounced hypomethylation in small neonates compared with normal and large for gestational age. Genome-wide methylation, performed in two subsets of pregnancies, showed very similar methylation profiles among cord blood samples while placentae from different pregnancies appeared very variable. A unique methylation profile emerged in each placenta, which could represent the sum of adjustments that the placenta made during the pregnancy to preserve the epigenetic homeostasis of the fetus. Investigations into the 1000 most variable sites between cord blood and the placenta showed that promoters and gene bodies that are hypermethylated in the placenta are associated with blood-specific functions, whereas those that are hypomethylated belong mainly to pathways involved in cancer. These features support the functional analogies between a placenta and cancer. Our results, which provide a comprehensive analysis of DNA methylation profiling in the human placenta, suggest that its peculiar dynamicity can be relevant for understanding placental plasticity in response to the environment."

We here present the analysis of blood specimens of 3,388 adult individuals, together with phenotype characteristics such as disease history, medication status, lifestyle factors, and body mass index (BMI). The size and heterogeneity of this data challenges analytics in terms of dimension reduction, knowledge mining, feature extraction, and data integration.Methods:Self-organizing maps (SOM)-machine learning was applied to study transcriptional states on a population-wide scale. This method permits a detailed description and visualization of the molecular heterogeneity of transcriptomes and of their association with different phenotypic features.Results:The diversity of transcriptomes is described by personalized SOM-portraits, which specify the samples in terms of modules of co-expressed genes of different functional context. We identified two major blood transcriptome types where type 1 was found more in men, the elderly, and overweight people and it upregulated genes associated with inflammation and increased heme metabolism, while type 2 was predominantly found in women, younger, and normal weight participants and it was associated with activated immune responses, transcriptional, ribosomal, mitochondrial, and telomere-maintenance cell-functions. We find a striking overlap of signatures shared by multiple diseases, aging, and obesity driven by an underlying common pattern, which was associated with the immune response and the increase of inflammatory processes.Conclusions:Machine learning applications for large and heterogeneous omics data provide a holistic view on the diversity of the human blood transcriptome. It provides a tool for comparative analyses of transcriptional signatures and of associated phenotypes in population studies and medical applications.Copyright © 2020 Schmidt, Hopp, Arakelyan, Kirsten, Engel, Wirkner, Krohn, Burkhardt, Thiery, Loeffler, Loeffler-Wirth and Binder."

DNA methylation is highly influenced by environmental factors such as cigarette smoking, which is causally related to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer. To date, there have been few large-scale, combined analyses of DNA methylation and gene expression and their interrelations with lung diseases.We performed an epigenome-wide association study of whole blood gene expression in ~ 6000 individuals from four cohorts. We discovered and replicated numerous CpGs associated with the expression of cis genes within 500 kb of each CpG, with 148 to 1,741 cis CpG-transcript pairs identified across cohorts. We found that the closer a CpG resided to a transcription start site, the larger its effect size, and that 36% of cis CpG-transcript pairs share the same causal genetic variant. Mendelian randomization analyses revealed that hypomethylation and lower expression of CHRNA5, which encodes a smoking-related nicotinic receptor, are causally linked to increased risk of COPD and lung cancer. This putatively causal relationship was further validated in lung tissue data.Our results provide a large and comprehensive association study of whole blood DNA methylation with gene expression. Expression platform differences rather than population differences are critical to the replication of cis CpG-transcript pairs. The low reproducibility of trans CpG-transcript pairs suggests that DNA methylation regulates nearby rather than remote gene expression. The putatively causal roles of methylation and expression of CHRNA5 in relation to COPD and lung cancer provide evidence for a mechanistic link between patterns of smoking-related epigenetic variation and lung diseases, and highlight potential therapeutic targets for lung diseases and smoking cessation."

We assessed four measures of ETV and chronic stress in children (ETV scale, gun violence, and perceived stress) and their mothers (perceived stress). Each EWAS was conducted using linear regression, with CpGs as dependent variables and the stress/violence measure as a predictor, adjusting for age, sex, the top five principal components, and SVA latent factors. We then selected the top 100 CpGs (by p value) associated with each stress/violence measure in EVA-PR and conducted a meta-analysis of the selected CpGs and atopic asthma using data from EVA-PR and two additional cohorts (Project Viva and PIAMA).Three CpGs (in SNN, PTPRN2, and LINC01164) were associated with maternal perceived stress or gun violence (p = 1.28-3.36 × 10-7), but not with atopic asthma, in EVA-PR.

Furthermore, we found a positive association between aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor (AHRR) gene (cg05575921) hypomethylation and gene expression of exocyst complex component 3 (EXOC3) in whole blood. We confirmed that the expression ofEXOC3in lung tissue is positively associated withDLCO/VAandDLCO.We report on epigenome-wide associations with diffusing capacity in the general population.

Yes,EWAS,33741061,Birthweight DNA methylation signatures in infant saliva.,Clin Epigenetics,"Low birthweight has been repeatedly associated with long-term adverse health outcomes and many non-communicable diseases. Our aim was to look-up cord blood birthweight-associated CpG sites identified by the PACE Consortium in infant saliva, and to explore saliva-specific DNA methylation signatures of birthweight.DNA methylation was assessed using Infinium HumanMethylation450K array in 135 saliva samples collected from children of the NINFEA birth cohort at an average age of 10.8 (range 7-17) months. The association analyses between birthweight and DNA methylation variations were carried out using robust linear regression models both in the exploratory EWAS analyses and in the look-up of the PACE findings in infant saliva.None of the cord blood birthweight-associated CpGs identified by the PACE Consortium was associated with birthweight when analysed in infant saliva. In saliva EWAS analyses, considering a false discovery rate p-values < 0.05, birthweight as continuous variable was associated with DNA methylation in 44 CpG sites; being born small for gestational age (SGA, lower 10thpercentile of birthweight for gestational age according to WHO reference charts) was associated with DNA methylation in 44 CpGs, with only one overlapping CpG between the two analyses. Despite no overlap with PACE results at the CpG level, two of the top saliva birthweight CpGs mapped at genes associated with birthweight with the same direction of the effect also in the PACE Consortium (MACROD1 and RPTOR).Our study provides an indication of the birthweight and SGA epigenetic salivary signatures in children around 10 months of age. DNA methylation signatures in cord blood may not be comparable with saliva DNA methylation signatures at about 10 months of age, suggesting that the birthweight epigenetic marks are likely time and tissue specific."

We sought to identify novel smoking-related DNA methylation sites in blood, with repeated measurements, and to appraise the putative role of DNA methylation in the pathway between smoking and lung cancer development.We derived a nested case-control study from the Trøndelag Health Study (HUNT), including 140 incident patients who developed lung cancer during 2009-13 and 140 controls. We profiled 850 K DNA methylation sites (Illumina Infinium EPIC array) in DNA extracted from blood that was collected in HUNT2 (1995-97) and HUNT3 (2006-08) for the same individuals. Epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) were performed for a detailed smoking phenotype and for lung cancer. Two-step Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses were performed to assess the potential causal effect of smoking on DNA methylation as well as of DNA methylation (13 sites as putative mediators) on risk of lung cancer.The EWAS for smoking in HUNT2 identified associations at 76 DNA methylation sites (P < 5 × 10-8), including 16 novel sites. Smoking was associated with DNA hypomethylation in a dose-response relationship among 83% of the 76 sites, which was confirmed by analyses using repeated measurements from blood that was collected at 11 years apart for the same individuals. Two-step MR analyses showed evidence for a causal effect of smoking on DNA methylation but no evidence for a causal link between DNA methylation and the risk of lung cancer.DNA methylation modifications in blood did not seem to represent a causal pathway linking smoking and the lung cancer risk.© The Author(s) 2021.

Current evidence, however, is mostly limited to candidate gene analysis in whole blood. To clarify the association between opioid abuse and DNA methylation, we conducted an epigenome-wide analysis of DNA methylation in brain samples of individuals who died from acute opioid intoxication and group-matched controls.Tissue samples were extracted from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of 153 deceased individuals (Mage= 35.42; 62 % male; 77 % European ancestry). The study included 72 opioid samples, 53 psychiatric controls, and 28 normal controls. The epigenome-wide analysis was implemented using the Illumina MethylationEPIC BeadChip; analyses adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics, negative control principal components, ancestry principal components, cellular composition, and surrogate variables. Horvath's epigenetic age and Levine's PhenoAge were calculated, and gene set enrichment analyses were performed.Although no CpG sites survived false-discovery rate correction for multiple testing, 13 sites surpassed a relaxed significance threshold (p < 1.0 × 10-5). One of these sites was located within Netrin-1, a gene implicated in kappa opioid receptor activity. There was an association between opioid use and accelerated PhenoAge (b = 2.24, se = 1.11, p = .045). Gene set enrichment analyses revealed enrichment of differential methylation in GO and KEGG pathways broadly related to substance use.Netrin-1 may be associated with opioid overdose, and future research with larger samples across stages of opioid use will elucidate the complex genomics of opioid abuse.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Yes,EWAS,33663600,DNA methylation mediates the effect of maternal smoking on offspring birthweight: a birth cohort study of multi-ethnic US mother-newborn pairs.,Clin Epigenetics,"Maternal smoking affects more than half a million pregnancies each year in the US and is known to result in fetal growth restriction as measured by lower birthweight and its associated long-term consequences. Maternal smoking also has been linked to altered fetal DNA methylation (DNAm). However, what remains largely unexplored is whether these DNAm alterations are merely markers of smoking exposure or if they also have implications for health outcomes. This study tested the hypothesis that fetal DNAm mediates the effect of maternal smoking on newborn birthweight.This study included mother-newborn pairs from a US predominantly urban, low-income multi-ethnic birth cohort. DNAm in cord blood were determined using the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip. After standard quality control and normalization procedures, an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of maternal smoking was performed using linear regression models, controlling for maternal age, education, race, parity, pre-pregnancy body mass index, alcohol consumption, gestational age, maternal pregestational/gestational diabetes, child sex, cord blood cell compositions and batch effects. To quantify the degree to which cord DNAm mediates the smoking-birthweight association, the VanderWeele-Vansteelandt approach for single mediator and structural equational model for multiple mediators were used, adjusting for pertinent covariates.The study included 954 mother-newborn pairs. Among mothers, 165 (17.3%) ever smoked before or during pregnancy. Newborns with smoking exposure had on average 258 g lower birthweight than newborns without exposure (P < 0.001). Using a false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05 as the significance cutoff, the EWAS identified 38 differentially methylated CpG sites associated with maternal smoking. Of those, 17 CpG sites were mapped to previously reported genes: GFI1, AHRR, CYP1A1, and CNTNAP2; 8 of those, located in the first three genes, were Bonferroni significantly associated with newborn birthweight and mediated the smoking-birthweight association. The combined mediation effect of the three genes explained 67.8% of the smoking-birthweight association.Our study not only lends further support that maternal smoking alters fetal DNAm in a multiethnic population, but also suggests that fetal DNAm substantially mediates the maternal smoking-birthweight association. Our findings, if further validated, indicate that DNAm modification is likely an important pathway by which maternal smoking impairs fetal growth and, perhaps, even long-term health outcomes."
