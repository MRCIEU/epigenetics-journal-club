"37254650","Epigenome-wide DNA methylation analysis of myasthenia gravis.","FEBS Open Bio","Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a common neuromuscular junction (NMJ) disorder and autoimmune disease mediated by several antibodies. Several studies have shown that genetic factors play an important role in MG pathogenesis. To gain insight into the epigenetic factors affecting MG, we report here genome-scale DNA methylation profiles of MG. DNA was extracted from 8 MG patients and 4 healthy controls for genome-wide DNA methylation analysis using the Illumina HumanMethylation 850K BeadChip. Verification of pyrosequencing was conducted based on differential methylation positions (DMPs). Subsequently, C2C12 and HT22 cell lines (derived from mouse) were treated with demethylation drugs. Transcribed mRNA of the screened differential genes were detected using quantitative Real-time PCR. The control and MG group were compared, and two key probe positions were selected. The corresponding genes were CAMK1D and CREB5 (P<0.05). Similarly, the myasthenic crisis (MC) and non-MC group were compared and four key probe positions were selected. The corresponding genes were SAV1, STK3, YAP1 and WWTR1 (P<0.05). Subsequently, pyrosequencing was performed for verification, revealing that hypomethylation of CAMK1D was significantly different between the MG and control group (P<0.001). Moreover, transcription of CREB5, PKD, YAP1 and STK3 genes in the C2C12 cells was downregulated (P<0.05) after drug treatment, but only YAP1 mRNA was downregulated in HT22 cells (P<0.05). This is the first study to investigate genome-scale DNA methylation profiles of MG using 850K BeadChip. The identified molecular markers of methylation may aid in the prevention, diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of MG.This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

Here, we describe computational pipelines for analysis of bulk mepigenomic profiling data, including whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) to detect DNA methylation patterns, chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) to detect genomic patterns of either specific histone modifications or bound transcription factors, the assay for transposase-accessible chromatin-sequencing (ATAC-seq) to detect genomic patterns of chromatin accessibility, and high-throughput chromosome conformation capture-sequencing (Hi-C-seq) to detect 3-dimensional interactions among distant genomic regions. In addition, we describe Chromatin State Discovery and Characterization (ChromHMM) methodology to integrate data from these individual analyses, plus that from RNA-seq analysis of gene expression, to obtain the most comprehensive overall assessment of epigenetic programming associated with gene expression.© 2023.

"37249603","Oncogenic Transformation Drives DNA Methylation Loss and Transcriptional Activation of Transposable Element Loci.","Cancer Res","Transposable elements (TEs) are typically silenced by DNA methylation and repressive histone modifications in differentiated healthy human tissues. However, TE expression increases in a wide range of cancers and is correlated with global hypomethylation of cancer genomes. We assessed expression and DNA methylation of TEs in fibroblast cells that were serially transduced with hTERT, SV40, and HRASR24C to immortalize and then transform them, which models the different steps of the tumorigenesis process. RNA-sequencing and whole-genome bisulfite sequencing were performed at each stage of transformation. TE expression significantly increased as cells progressed through transformation, with the largest increase in expression after the final stage of transformation, consistent with data from human tumors. The upregulated TEs were dominated by endogenous retroviruses (LTRs). Most differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in all stages were hypomethylated, with the greatest hypomethylation in the final stage of transformation. A majority of the DMRs overlapped TEs from the RepeatMasker database, indicating that TEs are preferentially demethylated. Many hypomethylated TEs displayed a concordant increase in expression. Demethylation began during immortalization and continued into transformation, while upregulation of TE transcription occurred in transformation. Numerous LTR elements upregulated in the model were also identified in TCGA datasets of breast, colon, and prostate cancer. Overall, these findings indicate that transposable elements, specifically endogenous retroviruses, are demethylated and transcribed during transformation."
"37249002","DNA methylation episignatures are sensitive and specific biomarkers for detection of patients with KAT6A/KAT6B variants.","Epigenomics","Accurate diagnosis for patients living with neurodevelopmental disorders is often met with numerous challenges, related to the ambiguity of findings and lack of specificity in genetic variants leading to pathology. Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis has been used to develop highly sensitive and specific 'episignatures' as biomarkers capable of differentiating and classifying complex neurodevelopmental disorders. In this study we describe distinct episignatures for KAT6A syndrome, caused by pathogenic variants in the lysine acetyltransferase A gene (KAT6A), and for the two neurodevelopmental disorders associated with lysine acetyl transferase B (KAT6B). We demonstrate the ability of our models to differentiate between highly overlapping episignatures, increasing the ability to effectively identify and diagnose these conditions."
"37248459","Genome-wide identification and comparative analysis of DNA methyltransferase and demethylase gene families in two ploidy Cyclocarya paliurus and their potential function in heterodichogamy.","BMC Genomics","DNA methylation is one of the most abundant epigenetic modifications, which plays important roles in flower development, sex differentiation, and regulation of flowering time. Its pattern is affected by cytosine-5 DNA methyltransferase (C5-MTase) and DNA demethylase (dMTase). At present, there are no reports on C5-MTase and dMTase genes in heterodichogamous Cyclocarya paliurus.In this study, 6 CpC5-MTase and 3 CpdMTase genes were identified in diploid (2n = 2 ×  = 32) C. paliurus, while 20 CpC5-MTase and 13 CpdMTase genes were identified in autotetraploid (2n = 4 ×  = 64). 80% of identified genes maintained relatively fixed positions on chromosomes during polyploidization. In addition, we found that some DRM subfamily members didn't contain the UBA domain. The transcript abundance of CpC5-MTase and CpdMTase in male and female flowers of two morphs (protandry and protogyny) from diploidy was analyzed. Results showed that all genes were significantly up-regulated at the stage of floral bud break (S2), but significantly down-regulated at the stage of flower maturation (S4). At S2, some CpC5-MTase genes showed higher expression levels in PG-M than in PG-F, whereas some CpdMTase genes showed higher expression levels in PA-M than in PA-F. In addition, these genes were significantly associated with gibberellin synthesis-related genes (e.g. DELLA and GID1), suggesting that DNA methylation may play a role in the asynchronous floral development process through gibberellin signal.These results broaden our understanding of the CpC5-MTase and CpdMTase genes in diploid and autotetraploid C. paliurus, and provide a novel insight into regulatory mechanisms of DNA methylation in heterodichogamy.© 2023.

"37248219","Direct haplotype-resolved 5-base HiFi sequencing for genome-wide profiling of hypermethylation outliers in a rare disease cohort.","Nat Commun","Long-read HiFi genome sequencing allows for accurate detection and direct phasing of single nucleotide variants, indels, and structural variants. Recent algorithmic development enables simultaneous detection of CpG methylation for analysis of regulatory element activity directly in HiFi reads. We present a comprehensive haplotype resolved 5-base HiFi genome sequencing dataset from a rare disease cohort of 276 samples in 152 families to identify rare (~0.5%) hypermethylation events. We find that 80% of these events are allele-specific and predicted to cause loss of regulatory element activity. We demonstrate heritability of extreme hypermethylation including rare cis variants associated with short (~200 bp) and large hypermethylation events (>1 kb), respectively. We identify repeat expansions in proximal promoters predicting allelic gene silencing via hypermethylation and demonstrate allelic transcriptional events downstream. On average 30-40 rare hypermethylation tiles overlap rare disease genes per patient, providing indications for variation prioritization including a previously undiagnosed pathogenic allele in DIP2B causing global developmental delay. We propose that use of HiFi genome sequencing in unsolved rare disease cases will allow detection of unconventional diseases alleles due to loss of regulatory element activity.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37247186","A Self-attention Graph Convolutional Network for Precision Multi-tumor Early Diagnostics with DNA Methylation Data.","Interdiscip Sci","DNA methylation-based precision tumor early diagnostics is emerging as state-of-the-art technology that could capture early cancer signs 3 ~ 5 years in advance, even for clinically homogenous groups. Presently, the sensitivity of early detection for many tumors is ~ 30%, which needs significant improvement. Nevertheless, based on the genome-wide DNA methylation data, one could comprehensively characterize tumors' entire molecular genetic landscape and their subtle differences. Therefore, novel high-performance methods must be modeled by considering unbiased information using excessively available DNA methylation data. To fill this gap, we have designed a computational model involving a self-attention graph convolutional network and multi-class classification support vector machine to identify the 11 most common cancers using DNA methylation data. The self-attention graph convolutional network automatically learns key methylation sites in a data-driven way. Then, multi-tumor early diagnostics is realized by training a multi-class classification support vector machine based on the selected methylation sites. We evaluated our model's performance through several data sets of experiments, and our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the selected key methylation sites, which are highly relevant for blood diagnosis.

"37245006","Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling of HPV-negative leukoplakia and gingivobuccal complex cancers.","Clin Epigenetics","Gingivobuccal complex oral squamous cell carcinoma (GBC-OSCC) is an aggressive malignancy with high mortality often preceded by premalignant lesions, including leukoplakia. Previous studies have reported genomic drivers in OSCC, but much remains to be elucidated about DNA methylation patterns across different stages of oral carcinogenesis.There is a serious lack of biomarkers and clinical application of biomarkers for early detection and prognosis of gingivobuccal complex cancers. Hence, in search of novel biomarkers, we measured genome-wide DNA methylation in 22 normal oral tissues, 22 leukoplakia, and 74 GBC-OSCC tissue samples. Both leukoplakia and GBC-OSCC had distinct methylation profiles as compared to normal oral tissue samples. Aberrant DNA methylation increases during the different stages of oral carcinogenesis, from premalignant lesions to carcinoma. We identified 846 and 5111 differentially methylated promoters in leukoplakia and GBC-OSCC, respectively, with a sizable fraction shared between the two sets. Further, we identified potential biomarkers from integrative analysis in gingivobuccal complex cancers and validated them in an independent cohort. Integration of genome, epigenome, and transcriptome data revealed candidate genes with gene expression synergistically regulated by copy number and DNA methylation changes. Regularised Cox regression identified 32 genes associated with patient survival. In an independent set of samples, we validated eight genes (FAT1, GLDC, HOXB13, CST7, CYB5A, MLLT11, GHR, LY75) from the integrative analysis and 30 genes from previously published reports. Bisulfite pyrosequencing validated GLDC (P = 0.036), HOXB13 (P < 0.0001) promoter hypermethylation, and FAT1 (P < 0.0001) hypomethylation in GBC-OSCC compared to normal controls.Our findings identified methylation signatures associated with leukoplakia and gingivobuccal complex cancers. The integrative analysis in GBC-OSCC identified putative biomarkers that enhance existing knowledge of oral carcinogenesis and may potentially help in risk stratification and prognosis of GBC-OSCC.© 2023.

Epigenetics is one subject that holds a lot of promise, despite being relatively new. The study of potentially heritable variations in gene expression that do not require modifications to the underlying DNA sequence is known as epigenetics. Here, we used Illumina MethylationEPIC BeadChip Array to identify differentially methylated regions in DNA isolated from saliva between normal weight (NW) and overweight/obese (OW/OB) children and between European American (EA) and African American (AA) children. A total of 3133 target IDs (associated with 2313 genes) were differentially methylated (p< 0.05) between NW and OW/OB children. In OW/OB children, 792 target IDs were hypermethylated and 2341 were hypomethylated compared to NW. Similarly, in the racial groups EA and AA, a total of 1239 target IDs corresponding to 739 genes were significantly differentially methylated in which 643 target IDs were hypermethylated and 596 were hypomethylated in the AA compared to EA participants. Along with this, the study identified novel genes that could contribute to the epigenetic regulation of childhood obesity."

In mammals, genomic imprinting plays essential roles in embryogenesis. In my strategy, peaks in plots mark the locations of known, inferred, and candidate ICRs. Genes in the vicinity of candidate ICRs correspond to potential imprinted genes. By displaying my datasets on the UCSC genome browser, one could view peak positions with respect to genomic landmarks. I give two examples of candidate ICRs in loci that influence spermatogenesis in bulls:CNNM1andCNR1. I also give examples of candidate ICRs in loci that influence muscle development:SIX1andBCL6. By examining the ENCODE data reported for mice, I deduced regulatory clues about cattle. I focused on DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs). Such sites reveal accessibility of chromatin to regulators of gene expression. For inspection, I chose DHSs in chromatin from mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) ES-E14, mesoderm, brain, heart, and skeletal muscle. The ENCODE data revealed that theSIX1promoter was accessible to the transcription initiation apparatus in mouse ESCs, mesoderm, and skeletal muscles. The data also revealed accessibility ofBCL6locus to regulatory proteins in mouse ESCs and examined tissues."
"37239390","Differential Methylation of Telomere-Related Genes Is Associated with Kidney Disease in Individuals with Type 1 Diabetes.","Genes (Basel)","Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) represents a major global health problem. Accelerated ageing is a key feature of DKD and, therefore, characteristics of accelerated ageing may provide useful biomarkers or therapeutic targets. Harnessing multi-omics, features affecting telomere biology and any associated methylome dysregulation in DKD were explored. Genotype data for nuclear genome polymorphisms in telomere-related genes were extracted from genome-wide case-control association data (n = 823 DKD/903 controls; n = 247 end-stage kidney disease (ESKD)/1479 controls). Telomere length was established using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Quantitative methylation values for 1091 CpG sites in telomere-related genes were extracted from epigenome-wide case-control association data (n = 150 DKD/100 controls). Telomere length was significantly shorter in older age groups (p= 7.6 × 10-6). Telomere length was also significantly reduced (p= 6.6 × 10-5) in DKD versus control individuals, with significance remaining after covariate adjustment (p= 0.028). DKD and ESKD were nominally associated with telomere-related genetic variation, with Mendelian randomisation highlighting no significant association between genetically predicted telomere length and kidney disease. A total of 496 CpG sites in 212 genes reached epigenome-wide significance (p≤ 10-8) for DKD association, and 412 CpG sites in 193 genes for ESKD. Functional prediction revealed differentially methylated genes were enriched for Wnt signalling involvement. Harnessing previously published RNA-sequencing datasets, potential targets where epigenetic dysregulation may result in altered gene expression were revealed, useful as potential diagnostic and therapeutic targets for intervention."
"37239377","Exploring the Diet-Gut Microbiota-Epigenetics Crosstalk Relevant to Neonatal Diabetes.","Genes (Basel)","Neonatal diabetes (NDM) is a rare monogenic disorder that presents as hyperglycemia during the first six months of life. The link between early-life gut microbiota dysbiosis and susceptibility to NDM remains uncertain. Experimental studies have demonstrated that gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) could develop into meconium/gut microbiota dysbiosis in newborns, and thus, it is thought to be a mediator in the pathogenesis of NDM. Epigenetic modifications have been considered as potential mechanisms by which the gut microbiota and susceptibility genes interact with the neonatal immune system. Several epigenome-wide association studies have revealed that GDM is associated with neonatal cord blood and/or placental DNA methylation alterations. However, the mechanisms linking diet in GDM with gut microbiota alterations, which may in turn induce the expression of genes linked to NDM, are yet to be unraveled. Therefore, the focus of this review is to highlight the impacts of diet, gut microbiota, and epigenetic crosstalk on altered gene expression in NDM."
"37233989","Dietary and supplemental intake of vitamins C and E is associated with altered DNA methylation in an epigenome-wide association study meta-analysis.","Epigenetics","Dietary intake of antioxidants such as vitamins C and E protect against oxidative stress, and may also be associated with altered DNA methylation patterns.We meta-analysed epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) results from 11,866 participants across eight population-based cohorts to evaluate the association between self-reported dietary and supplemental intake of vitamins C and E with DNA methylation. EWAS were adjusted for age, sex, BMI, caloric intake, blood cell type proportion, smoking status, alcohol consumption, and technical covariates. Significant results of the meta-analysis were subsequently evaluated in gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and expression quantitative trait methylation (eQTM) analysis.In meta-analysis, methylation at 4,656 CpG sites was significantly associated with vitamin C intake at FDR ≤ 0.05. The most significant CpG sites associated with vitamin C (at FDR ≤ 0.01) were enriched for pathways associated with systems development and cell signalling in GSEA, and were associated with downstream expression of genes enriched in the immune response in eQTM analysis. Furthermore, methylation at 160 CpG sites was significantly associated with vitamin E intake at FDR ≤ 0.05, but GSEA and eQTM analysis of the top most significant CpG sites associated with vitamin E did not identify significant enrichment of any biological pathways investigated.We identified significant associations of many CpG sites with vitamin C and E intake, and our results suggest that vitamin C intake may be associated with systems development and the immune response."
"37231515","Epigenomic profiling of isolated blood cell types reveals highly specific B cell smoking signatures and links to disease risk.","Clin Epigenetics","Tobacco smoking alters the DNA methylation profiles of immune cells which may underpin some of the pathogenesis of smoking-associated diseases. To link smoking-driven epigenetic effects in specific immune cell types with disease risk, we isolated six leukocyte subtypes, CD14+ monocytes, CD15+ granulocytes, CD19+ B cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and CD56+ natural killer cells, from whole blood of 67 healthy adult smokers and 74 nonsmokers for epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) using Illumina 450k and EPIC methylation arrays.Numbers of smoking-associated differentially methylated sites (smCpGs) at genome-wide significance (p < 1.2 × 10-7) varied widely across cell types, from 5 smCpGs in CD8+ T cells to 111 smCpGs in CD19+ B cells. We found unique smoking effects in each cell type, some of which were not apparent in whole blood. Methylation-based deconvolution to estimate B cell subtypes revealed that smokers had 7.2% (p = 0.033) less naïve B cells. Adjusting for naïve and memory B cell proportions in EWAS and RNA-seq allowed the identification of genes enriched for B cell activation-related cytokine signaling pathways, Th1/Th2 responses, and hematopoietic cancers. Integrating with large-scale public datasets, 62 smCpGs were among CpGs associated with health-relevant EWASs. Furthermore, 74 smCpGs had reproducible methylation quantitative trait loci single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were in complete linkage disequilibrium with genome-wide association study SNPs, associating with lung function, disease risks, and other traits.We observed blood cell-type-specific smCpGs, a naïve-to-memory shift among B cells, and by integrating genome-wide datasets, we identified their potential links to disease risks and health traits.© 2023.

"37230663","Maternal Periconceptional Folic Acid Supplementation and DNA Methylation Patterns in Adolescent Offspring.","J Nutr","Folate, including the folic acid form, is a key component of the one-carbon metabolic pathway used for DNA methylation. Changes in DNA methylation patterns during critical development periods are associated with disease outcomes and are associated with changes in nutritional status in pregnancy. The long-term impact of periconceptional folic acid supplementation on DNA methylation patterns is unknown.To determine the long-term impact of periconceptional folic acid supplementation on DNA methylation patterns, we examined the association of the recommended dosage (400 μg/d) and time period (periconceptional before pregnancy through first trimester) of folic acid supplementation with the DNA methylation patterns in the offspring at age 14-17 y compared with offspring with no supplementation.Two geographic sites in China from the 1993-1995 Community Intervention Program of folic acid supplementation were selected for the follow-up study. DNA methylation at 402,730 CpG sites was assessed using saliva samples from 89 mothers and 179 adolescents (89 male). The mean age at saliva collection was 40 y among mothers (range: 35-54 y) and 15 y among adolescents (range: 14-17 y). Epigenome-wide analyses were conducted to assess the interactions of periconceptional folic acid exposure, the 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR)-C677T genotype, and epigenome-wide DNA methylation controlling for offspring sex, geographic region, and background cell composition in the saliva.In the primary outcome, no significant differences were observed in epigenome-wide methylation patterns between adolescents exposed and those non-exposed to maternal periconceptional folic acid supplementation after adjustment for potential confounders [false discovery rate (FDR) P values < 0.05]. The MTHFR-C677T genotype did not modify this lack of association (FDR P values < 0.05).Overall, there were no differences in DNA methylation between adolescents who were exposed during the critical developmental window and those not exposed to the recommended periconceptional/first-trimester dosage of folic acid.Copyright © 2022 American Society for Nutrition."

Although vitamin D has anti-cancer effects, its effectiveness and mechanism of action against osteosarcomas are poorly understood. In this study, we assessed the impact of vitamin D and its receptor (VDR) on NMD-ROS-EMT signaling inin vitroandin vivoosteosarcoma animal models. Initiation of VDR signaling facilitated the enrichment of EMT pathway genes, after which 1,25(OH)2D, the active vitamin D derivative, inhibited the EMT pathway in osteosarcoma subtypes. The ligand-bound VDR directly downregulated the EMT inducerSNAI2, differentiating highly metastatic from low metastatic subtypes and 1,25(OH)2D sensitivity. Moreover, epigenome-wide motif and putative target gene analysis revealed the VDR's integration with NMD tumorigenic and immunogenic pathways. In an autoregulatory manner, 1,25(OH)2D inhibited NMD machinery genes and upregulated NMD target genes implicated in anti-oncogenic activity, immunorecognition, and cell-to-cell adhesion. Dicer substrate siRNA knockdown ofSNAI2revealed superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2)-mediated antioxidative responses and 1,25(OH)2D sensitizationvianon-canonical SOD2 nuclear-to-mitochondrial translocalization leading to overall ROS suppression.

"37228185","NSUN2-mediated m(5) C RNA methylation dictates retinoblastoma progression through promoting PFAS mRNA stability and expression.","Clin Transl Med","The precise temporal and spatial regulation of N5-methylcytosine (m5C) RNA modification plays essential roles in RNA metabolism, and is necessary for the maintenance of epigenome homeostasis. Howbeit, the mechanism underlying the m5C modification in carcinogenesis remains to be fully addressed.Global and mRNA m5C levels were determined by mRNA isolation and anti-m5C dot blot in both retinoblastoma (RB) cells and clinical samples. Orthotopic intraocular xenografts were established to examine the oncogenic behaviours of RB. Genome-wide multiomics analyses were performed to identify the functional target of NSUN2, including proteomic analysis, transcriptome screening and m5C-methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (m5C-meRIP-seq). Organoid-based single-cell analysis and gene-correlation analysis were performed to verify the NSUN2/ALYREF/m5C-PFAS oncogenic cascade.Herein, we report that NSUN2-mediated m5C RNA methylation fuels purine biosynthesis during the oncogenic progression of RB. First, we discovered that global and mRNA m5C levels were significantly enriched in RBs compared to normal retinas. In addition, tumour-specific NSUN2 expression was noted in RB samples and cell lines. Therapeutically, targeted correction of NSUN2 exhibited efficient therapeutic efficacy in RB both in vitro and in vivo. Through multiomics analyses, we subsequently identified phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine synthase (PFAS), a vital enzyme in purine biosynthesis, as a downstream candidate target of NSUN2. The reintroduction of PFAS largely reversed the inhibitory phenotypes in NSUN2-deficient RB cells, indicating that PFAS was a functional downstream target of NSUN2. Mechanistically, we found that the m5C reader protein ALYREF was responsible for the recognition of the m5C modification of PFAS, increasing its expression by enhancing its RNA stability.Conclusively, we initially demonstrated that NSUN2 is necessary for oncogenic gene activation in RB, expanding the current understanding of dynamic m5C function during tumour progression. As the NSUN2/ALYREF/m5C-PFAS oncogenic cascade is an important RB trigger, our study suggests that a targeted m5C reprogramming therapeutic strategy may be a novel and efficient anti-tumour therapy approach.© 2023 The Authors.

This 2-part study aimed to validate whether DNA damage related to 8-OHdG is associated with left atrial (LA) fibrosis in AF patients quantified by voltage mapping (Part I), and to identify the underlying genetic components regulating the 8-OHdG level (Part II).Methods and Results: Plasma 8-OHdG determination, DNA extraction, and genotyping were conducted before catheter ablation. LA voltage mapping was performed under sinus rhythm. According to the percentage of low voltage area (LVA), patients were categorized as stage I (<5%), stage II (5-10%), stage III (10-20%), and stage IV (>20%). Part I included 209 AF patients. The 8-OHdG level showed an upward trend together with advanced LVA stage (stage I 8.1 [6.1, 10.5] ng/mL, stage II 8.5 [5.7, 14.1] ng/mL, stage III 14.3 [12.1, 16.5] ng/mL, stage IV 13.9 [10.5, 16.0] ng/mL, P<0.000). Part II included 175 of the 209 patients from Part I. Gene-set analysis based on genome-wide association study summary data identified that the gene set named 'DNA methylation on cytosine' was the only genetic component significantly associated with 8-OHdG concentration.Higher 8-OHdG levels may predict more advanced LVA of the LA in AF patients. DNA methylation is the putative genetic component underlying oxidative DNA damage in AF patients."

Breast cancer screening is recommended by health authorities in the US, but current screening efforts are often compromised by high false positive rates. Liquid biopsy based on circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) has emerged as a potential approach to screen for cancer. However, the detection of breast cancer, particularly in early stages, is challenging due to the low amount of ctDNA and heterogeneity of molecular subtypes.Here, we employed a multimodal approach, namely Screen for the Presence of Tumor by DNA Methylation and Size (SPOT-MAS), to simultaneously analyze multiple signatures of cell free DNA (cfDNA) in plasma samples of 239 nonmetastatic breast cancer patients and 278 healthy subjects.We identified distinct profiles of genome-wide methylation changes (GWM), copy number alterations (CNA), and 4-nucleotide oligomer (4-mer) end motifs (EM) in cfDNA of breast cancer patients. We further used all three signatures to construct a multi-featured machine learning model and showed that the combination model outperformed base models built from individual features, achieving an AUC of 0.91 (95% CI: 0.87-0.95), a sensitivity of 65% at 96% specificity.Our findings showed that a multimodal liquid biopsy assay based on analysis of cfDNA methylation, CNA and EM could enhance the accuracy for the detection of early- stage breast cancer.Copyright © 2023 Pham, Phan, Jasmine, Tran, Huynh, Vo, Nai, Tran, Truong, Tran, Nguyen, Nguyen, Nguyen, Le, Nguyen, Nguyen, Truong, Do, Phan, Giang, Nguyen and Tran."
"37220618","A Preliminary Comparison of the Methylome and Transcriptome from the Prefrontal Cortex Across Alzheimer's Disease and Lewy Body Dementia.","J Alzheimers Dis Rep","Pathological amyloid-β andα-synuclein are associated with a spectrum of related dementias, ranging from Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) to Parkinson disease dementia (PDD). While these diseases share clinical and pathological features, they also have unique patterns of pathology. However, epigenetic factors that contribute to these pathological differences remain unknown.In this preliminary study, we explore differences in DNA methylation and transcription in five neuropathologically defined groups: cognitively unimpaired controls, AD, pure DLB, DLB with concomitant AD (DLBAD), and PDD.We employed an Illumina Infinium 850k array and RNA-seq to quantify these differences in DNA methylation and transcription, respectively. We then used Weighted Gene Co-Network Expression Analysis (WGCNA) to determine transcriptional modules and correlated these with DNA methylation.We found that PDD was transcriptionally unique and correlated with an unexpected hypomethylation pattern compared to the other dementias and controls. Surprisingly, differences between PDD and DLB were especially notable with 197 differentially methylated regions. WGCNA yielded numerous modules associated with controls and the four dementias: one module was associated with transcriptional differences between controls and all the dementias as well as having significant overlap with differentially methylated probes. Functional enrichment demonstrated that this module was associated with responses to oxidative stress.Future work that extends these joint DNA methylation and transcription analyses will be critical to better understanding of differences that contribute to varying clinical presentation across dementias.© 2023 – The authors.

Importantly, FA is a complex, multi-system, multifactorial disease mediated by food-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) and type 2 immune responses and involving environmental and genetic factors and gene-environment interactions. Early exposure to external and internal environmental factors largely influences the development of immune responses to allergens. Genetic factors and gene-environment interactions have established roles in the FA pathophysiology. To improve diagnosis and identification of FA therapeutic targets, high-throughput omics approaches have emerged and been applied over the past decades to screen for potential FA biomarkers, such as genes, transcripts, proteins, and metabolites. In this article, we provide an overview of the current status of FA omics studies, namely genomic, transcriptomic, epigenomic, proteomic, exposomic, and metabolomic. The current development of multi-omics integration of FA studies is also briefly discussed. As individual omics technologies only provide limited information on the multi-system biological processes of FA, integration of population-based multi-omics data and clinical data may lead to robust biomarker discovery that could translate into advances in disease management and clinical care and ultimately lead to precision medicine approaches.© 2023 The Authors."

To illustrate the diversity of areas affected and the relative interest of the scientific community, we conducted a literature review of the effects of shift work and night work on workers. In particular, we intended to identify the main variables addressed in the field of health, the family sphere, and the organizational context. The literature review was carried out using the Web of Science with the following terms: ""shift work"", ""rotating shifts"", and ""night work"". Inclusion criteria incorporated empirical studies and articles written in Portuguese or English published in 2019. We selected 129 of the 619 articles identified. Regarding the impacts of shift work and night work, there existed a high discrepancy of focus between the three defined areas: health, family life, and organizational context. Specifically, health-related variables were the most studied (83.4%), followed by organizational variables (9.2%), and, lastly, family variables (7.4%). Based on these results, it is essential to extend the study of the two underrepresented impacts to other crucial areas, not only for the worker but also for organizations."
"37254221","Exercise and epigenetic ages in older adults with myeloid malignancies.","Eur J Med Res","Older adults with myeloid malignancies are susceptible to treatment-related toxicities. Accelerated DNAm age, or the difference between DNA methylation (DNAm) age and chronological age, may be used as a biomarker of biological age to predict individuals at risk. In addition, cancer treatment can also lead to accelerated DNAm age. Exercise is a promising intervention to reduce or prevent functional, psychological, and cognitive impairments in older patients with myeloid malignancies, yet there is little evidence of the effects of exercise on DNAm age. We explored (1) the associations of accelerated DNAm age with physical, psychological, and cognitive functions at baseline; (2) changes in DNAm age from baseline to post-intervention; and (3) the associations of changes in accelerated DNAm age with changes in functions from baseline to post-intervention.We enrolled older patients with myeloid malignancies to a single-arm pilot study testing a mobile health (mHealth) exercise intervention that combines an exercise program (EXCAP©®) with a mobile application over 2 cycles of chemotherapy (8-12 weeks). Patients completed measures of physical, psychological, and cognitive functions and provided blood samples for analyses of DNAm age at baseline and post-intervention. Paired t-tests or Wilcoxon signed rank tests assessed changes in DNAm ages, and Spearman's correlation assessed the relationships between accelerated ages and functions.We included 20 patients (mean age: 72 years, range 62-80). Accelerated GrimAge, accelerated PhenoAge, and DunedinPACE were stable from baseline to post-intervention. At baseline, DunedinPACE was correlated with worse grip strength (r = -0.41, p = 0.08). From baseline to post-intervention, decreases in accelerated GrimAge (r = -0.50, p = 0.02), accelerated PhenoAge (r = - 0.39, p = 0.09), and DunedinPace (r = - 0.43, p = 0.06) were correlated with increases in distance walked on 6-min walk test. Decreases in accelerated GrimAge (r = - 0.49, p = 0.03), accelerated PhenoAge (r = - 0.40, p = 0.08), and DunedinPace (r = - 0.41, p = 0.07) were correlated with increases in in grip strength.Among older adults with myeloid malignancies receiving chemotherapy, GrimAge and PhenoAge on average are stable after a mHealth exercise intervention. Decreases in accelerated GrimAge, accelerated PhenoAge, and DunedinPACE over 8-12 weeks of exercise were correlated with increased physical performance. Future trials assessing the effects of exercise on treatment-related toxicities should evaluate DNAm age. Trial registration Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT04981821.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Traditionally, short tandem repeats analysis has been the most powerful method for the identification of individuals. However, in addition, epigenetic changes, i.e., DNA methylation, came into focus of forensic DNA research. Chronological age prediction is one promising application to allow for narrowing the pool of possible individuals who caused a trace, as well as to support the identification of unknown bodies and for age verification of living individuals.This review aims to provide an overview of the current knowledge, possibilities, and (current) limitations about DNA methylation-based chronological age prediction with emphasis on forensic application.The development, implementation and application of age prediction tools requires a deep understanding about the biological background, the analysis methods, the age-dependent DNA methylation markers, as well as the mathematical models for age prediction and their evaluation. Furthermore, additional influences can have an impact. Therefore, the literature was evaluated in respect to these diverse topics.The numerous research efforts in recent years have led to a rapid change in our understanding of the application of DNA methylation for chronological age prediction, which is now on the way to implementation and validation. Knowledge of the various aspects leads to a better understanding and allows a more informed interpretation of DNAm quantification results, as well as the obtained results by the age prediction tools.© 2023.

"37237474","Assessing the Causal Association between Biological Aging Biomarkers and the Development of Cerebral Small Vessel Disease: A Mendelian Randomization Study.","Biology (Basel)","Biological aging biomarkers, such as leukocyte telomere length (LTL) and epigenetic clocks, have been associated with the risk of cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) in several observational studies. However, it is unclear whether LTL or epigenetic clocks play causal roles as prognostic biomarkers in the development of CSVD. We performed a Mendelian randomization (MR) study of LTL and four epigenetic clocks on ten subclinical and clinical CSVD measures. We obtained genome-wide association (GWAS) data for LTL from the UK Biobank (N = 472,174). Data on epigenetic clocks were derived from a meta-analysis (N = 34,710), and CSVD data (N cases =1293-18,381; N controls = 25,806-105,974) were extracted from the Cerebrovascular Disease Knowledge Portal. We found that genetically determined LTL and epigenetic clocks were not individually associated with ten measures of CSVD (IVWp> 0.05), and this result was consistent across sensitivity analyses. Our findings imply that LTL and epigenetic clocks may not help in predicting CSVD development as causal prognostic biomarkers. Further studies are needed to illustrate the potential of reverse biological aging in serving as an effective form of preventive therapy for CSVD."
"37228822","A novel estimate of biological aging by multiple fitness tests is associated with risk scores for age-related diseases.","Front Physiol","Introduction:Recent research highlights the need for a correct instrument for monitoring the individual health status, especially in the elderly. Different definitions of biological aging have been proposed, with a consistent positive association of physical activity and physical fitness with decelerated aging trajectories. The six-minute walking test is considered the current gold standard for estimating the individual fitness status in the elderly.Methods:In this study, we investigated the possibility of overcoming the main limitations of assessing fitness status based on a single measure. As a result, we developed a novel measure of fitness status based on multiple fitness tests. In 176 Sardinian individuals aged 51-80 years we collected the results of eight fitness tests to measure participants' functional mobility, gait, aerobic condition, endurance, upper and lower limb strength, and static and dynamic balance. In addition, the participants' state of health was estimated through validated risk scores for cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, mortality, and a comorbidity index.Results:Six measures contributing to fitness age were extracted, with TUG showing the largest contribution (beta = 2.23 SDs), followed by handgrip strength (beta = -1.98 SDs) and 6MWT distance (beta = -1.11 SDs). Based on fitness age estimates, we developed a biological aging measure using an elastic net model regression as a linear combination of the results of the fitness tests described above. Our newly developed biomarker was significantly associated with risk scores for cardiovascular events (ACC-AHA: r = 0.61;p= 0.0006; MESA: r = 0.21;p= 0.002) and mortality (Levine mortality score: r = 0.90;p= 0.0002) and outperformed the previous definition of fitness status based on the six-minute walking test in predicting an individual health status.Discussion:Our results indicate that a composite measure of biological age based on multiple fitness tests may be helpful for screening and monitoring strategies in clinical practice. However, additional studies are needed to test standardisation and to calibrate and validate the present results.Copyright © 2023 Manca, Fiorito, Morrone, Boi, Mercante, Martinez, Ventura, Delitala, Cano, Catte, Solinas, Melis, Ginatempo and Deriu."

The application of the modified (m)RPWM method, which considers the correlation of adjusting nucleotides, resulted in the identification of 908,072 TR regions with repeat lengths from 2 to 200 bp in the C. annuum genome, where they occupied ~29%. The most common TRs were 2 and 3 bp long followed by those of 21, 4, and 15 bp. We performed clustering analysis of TRs with repeat lengths of 2 and 21 bp and created position-weight matrices (PWMs) for each group; these templates could be used to search for TRs of a given length in any nucleotide sequence. All detected TRs can be accessed through publicly available database (http : //victoria.biengi.ac.ru/capsicum_tr/). Comparison of mRPWM with other TR search methods such as Tandem Repeat Finder, T-REKS, and XSTREAM indicated that mRPWM could detect significantly more TRs at similar false discovery rates, indicating its superior performance. The developed mRPWM method can be successfully applied to the identification of highly divergent TRs, which is important for functional analysis of genomes and evolutionary studies.© The Author(s) 2023.

Known risk variants explain only a small fraction of lung adenocarcinoma heritability. Here, we conducted a two-stage genome-wide association study of lung adenocarcinoma of East Asian ancestry (21,658 cases and 150,676 controls; 54.5% never-smokers) and identified 12 novel susceptibility variants, bringing the total number to 28 at 25 independent loci. Transcriptome-wide association analyses together with colocalization studies using a Taiwanese lung expression quantitative trait loci dataset (n = 115) identified novel candidate genes, including FADS1 at 11q12 and ELF5 at 11p13. In a multi-ancestry meta-analysis of East Asian and European studies, four loci were identified at 2p11, 4q32, 16q23, and 18q12. At the same time, most of our findings in East Asian populations showed no evidence of association in European populations. In our studies drawn from East Asian populations, a polygenic risk score based on the 25 loci had a stronger association in never-smokers vs. individuals with a history of smoking (Pinteraction = 0.0058). These findings provide new insights into the etiology of lung adenocarcinoma in individuals from East Asian populations, which could be important in developing translational applications.© 2023.

Thus, approaches for experimental and therapeutic DNA demethylation have a great potential to demonstrate mechanistic importance, and even causality of epigenetic alterations, and may open novel avenues to epigenetic cures. However, existing methods based on DNA methyltransferase inhibitors that elicit genome-wide demethylation are not suitable for treatment of diseases with specific epimutations and provide a limited experimental value. Therefore, gene-specific epigenetic editing is a critical approach for epigenetic re-activation of silenced genes. Site-specific demethylation can be achieved by utilizing sequence-dependent DNA-binding molecules such as zinc finger protein array (ZFA), transcription activator-like effector (TALE) and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat-associated dead Cas9 (CRISPR/dCas9). Synthetic proteins, where these DNA-binding domains are fused with the DNA demethylases such as ten-eleven translocation (Tet) and thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) enzymes, successfully induced or enhanced transcriptional responsiveness at targeted loci. However, a number of challenges, including the dependence on transgenesis for delivery of the fusion constructs, remain issues to be solved. In this review, we detail current and potential approaches to gene-specific DNA demethylation as a novel epigenetic editing-based therapeutic strategy."

Congenital factors include genetic mutations and epigenetic events; acquired factors include birth patterns, feeding patterns, dietary patterns, childhood experiences, education and economic levels, isolation due to epidemics, and many other complex factors. According to studies, these factors play important roles in depression. Therefore, here, we analyze and study the factors from two aspects, describe their influence on individual depression, and analyze their underlying mechanisms.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have proven successful in identifying migraine risk loci; however, much work remains to identify the causal variants and genes. In this paper, we compared three transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) imputation models-MASHR, elastic net, and SMultiXcan-to characterise established genome-wide significant (GWS) migraine GWAS risk loci, and to identify putative novel migraine risk gene loci. We compared the standard TWAS approach of analysing 49 GTEx tissues with Bonferroni correction for testing all genes present across all tissues (Bonferroni), to TWAS in five tissues estimated to be relevant to migraine, and TWAS with Bonferroni correction that took into account the correlation between eQTLs within each tissue (Bonferroni-matSpD). Elastic net models performed in all 49 GTEx tissues using Bonferroni-matSpD characterised the highest number of established migraine GWAS risk loci (n = 20) with GWS TWAS genes having colocalisation (PP4 > 0.5) with an eQTL. SMultiXcan in all 49 GTEx tissues identified the highest number of putative novel migraine risk genes (n = 28) with GWS differential expression at 20 non-GWS GWAS loci. Nine of these putative novel migraine risk genes were later found to be at and in linkage disequilibrium with true (GWS) migraine risk loci in a recent, more powerful migraine GWAS. Across all TWAS approaches, a total of 62 putative novel migraine risk genes were identified at 32 independent genomic loci. Of these 32 loci, 21 were true risk loci in the recent, more powerful migraine GWAS. Our results provide important guidance on the selection, use, and utility of imputation-based TWAS approaches to characterise established GWAS risk loci and identify novel risk gene loci.© 2023.

"37228747","Amplification is the primary mode of gene-by-sex interaction in complex human traits.","Cell Genom","Sex differences in complex traits are suspected to be in part due to widespread gene-by-sex interactions (GxSex), but empirical evidence has been elusive. Here, we infer the mixture of ways in which polygenic effects on physiological traits covary between males and females. We find that GxSex is pervasive but acts primarily through systematic sex differences in the magnitude of many genetic effects (""amplification"") rather than in the identity of causal variants. Amplification patterns account for sex differences in trait variance. In some cases, testosterone may mediate amplification. Finally, we develop a population-genetic test linking GxSex to contemporary natural selection and find evidence of sexually antagonistic selection on variants affecting testosterone levels. Our results suggest that amplification of polygenic effects is a common mode of GxSex that may contribute to sex differences and fuel their evolution.© 2023 The Author(s)."

However, the cellular and molecular substrates underlying this dysfunction remain unknown. Here, cell-population-specific chromatin accessibility profiling in human OFC unexpectedly mapped genetic risk for MDD exclusively to non-neuronal cells, and transcriptomic analyses revealed significant glial dysregulation in this region. Characterization of MDD-specific cis-regulatory elements identified ZBTB7A - a transcriptional regulator of astrocyte reactivity - as an important mediator of MDD-specific chromatin accessibility and gene expression. Genetic manipulations in mouse OFC demonstrated that astrocytic Zbtb7a is both necessary and sufficient to promote behavioral deficits, cell-type-specific transcriptional and chromatin profiles, and OFC neuronal hyperexcitability induced by chronic stress - a major risk factor for MDD. These data thus highlight a critical role for OFC astrocytes in stress vulnerability and pinpoint ZBTB7A as a key dysregulated factor in MDD that mediates maladaptive astrocytic functions driving OFC hyperexcitability."

To construct a reference database, we downloaded Illumina Human 450K array data for more than 2,000 normal samples, characterized the distribution of DNA methylation and derived probe-specific thresholds for identifying aberrations. We made the decision to restrict our reference database to solid normal tissue and morphologically normal tissue found adjacent to solid tumours, excluding blood which has very distinctive patterns of DNA methylation. Next, we explored the utility of our outlier thresholds in several analyses that are commonly performed on DNA methylation data. Outliers are as effective as the full continuous dataset for simple tasks, like distinguishing tumour tissue from normal, but becomes less useful as the complexity of the problem increases. We developed an R package called OutlierMeth containing our thresholds, as well as functions for applying them to data."
"37254169","Inferring cell-type-specific causal gene regulatory networks during human neurogenesis.","Genome Biol","Genetic variation influences both chromatin accessibility, assessed in chromatin accessibility quantitative trait loci (caQTL) studies, and gene expression, assessed in expression QTL (eQTL) studies. Genetic variants can impact either nearby genes (cis-eQTLs) or distal genes (trans-eQTLs). Colocalization between caQTL and eQTL, or cis- and trans-eQTLs suggests that they share causal variants. However, pairwise colocalization between these molecular QTLs does not guarantee a causal relationship. Mediation analysis can be applied to assess the evidence supporting causality versus independence between molecular QTLs. Given that the function of QTLs can be cell-type-specific, we performed mediation analyses to find epigenetic and distal regulatory causal pathways for genes within two major cell types of the developing human cortex, progenitors and neurons.We find that the expression of 168 and 38 genes is mediated by chromatin accessibility in progenitors and neurons, respectively. We also find that the expression of 11 and 12 downstream genes is mediated by upstream genes in progenitors and neurons. Moreover, we discover that a genetic locus associated with inter-individual differences in brain structure shows evidence for mediation of SLC26A7 through chromatin accessibility, identifying molecular mechanisms of a common variant association to a brain trait.In this study, we identify cell-type-specific causal gene regulatory networks whereby the impacts of variants on gene expression were mediated by chromatin accessibility or distal gene expression. Identification of these causal paths will enable identifying and prioritizing actionable regulatory targets perturbing these key processes during neurodevelopment.© 2023. The Author(s)."

By examining mitochondrial DNA in 269,506 individuals, we show mitochondrial haplogroups explain 0.07-0.01% of variance in neuroticism and identify five haplogroup and 15 mitochondria-marker associations across a general factor of neuroticism, and two special factors of anxiety/tension, and worry/vulnerability with effect sizes of the same magnitude as autosomal variants. Within-haplogroup genome-wide association studies identified H-haplogroup-specific autosomal effects explaining 1.4% variance of worry/vulnerability. These H-haplogroup-specific autosomal effects show a pleiotropic relationship with cognitive, physical and mental health that differs from that found when assessing autosomal effects across haplogroups. We identify interactions between chromosome 9 regions and mitochondrial haplogroups at P < 5 × 10-8, revealing associations between general neuroticism and anxiety/tension with brain-specific gene co-expression networks. These results indicate that the mitochondrial genome contributes toward neuroticism and the autosomal links between neuroticism and health.© 2023. The Author(s)."

A popular method for ct-eQTL mapping is to assess the interaction between the genotype of a genetic locus and the abundance of a specific cell type using a linear model. However, this approach requires transforming RNA-seq count data, which distorts the relation between gene expression and cell type proportions and results in reduced power and/or inflated type I error. To address this issue, we have developed a statistical method called CSeQTL that allows for ct-eQTL mapping using bulk RNA-seq count data while taking advantage of allele-specific expression. We validated the results of CSeQTL through simulations and real data analysis, comparing CSeQTL results to those obtained from purified bulk RNA-seq data or single cell RNA-seq data.

We identified 145 genes that alter chondrocyte proliferation and maturation at early and/or late time points in culture, with 90% of genes validating in secondary screening. These genes are enriched in monogenic growth disorder genes and in KEGG pathways critical for skeletal growth and endochondral ossification. Further, common variants near these genes capture height heritability independent of genes computationally prioritized from GWASs.

In addition, there are other genes with mutations that have weak tumor-promoting effects, known as mini-drivers, which could aggravate the development of oncogenesis when they occur together. The aim of our work was to use computer analysis to explore the survival impact, frequency, and incidence of mutations of possible mini-driver genes to be used for the prognosis of CRC.We retrieved data from three sources of CRC samples using the cBioPortal platform and analyzed the mutational frequency to exclude genes with driver features and those mutated in less than 5% of the original cohort. We also observed that the mutational profile of these mini-driver candidates is associated with variations in the expression levels. The candidate genes obtained were subjected to Kaplan-Meier curve analysis, making a comparison between mutated and wild-type samples for each gene using ap-value threshold of 0.01.After gene filtering by mutational frequency, we obtained 159 genes of which 60 were associated with a high accumulation of total somatic mutations with Log2(fold change) > 2 andpvalues < 10-5. In addition, these genes were enriched to oncogenic pathways such as epithelium-mesenchymal transition, hsa-miR-218-5p downregulation, and extracellular matrix organization. Our analysis identified five genes with possible implications as mini-drivers:DOCK3, FN1, PAPPA2, DNAH11, andFBN2. Furthermore, we evaluated a combined classification where CRC patients with at least one mutation in any of these genes were separated from the main cohort obtaining ap-value < 0.001 in the evaluation of CRC prognosis.Our study suggests that the identification and incorporation of mini-driver genes in addition to known driver genes could enhance the accuracy of prognostic biomarkers for CRC.© 2023 Campos Segura et al."

Communities separated by more than 30,000 generations of evolutionary time rediversify in similar ways. The rediversified ecotype appears to share a number of growth traits with the ecotype it replaces. However, the rediversified community is also different compared to the original community in ways relevant to the mechanism of ecotype coexistence, for example in stationary phase response and survival. We found substantial variation in the transcriptional states between the two original ecotypes, whereas the differences within the rediversified community were comparatively smaller, but with unique patterns of differential expression. Our results suggest that evolution may leave room for alternative diversification processes even in a maximally reduced community of only two strains. We hypothesize that the presence of alternative evolutionary pathways may be even more pronounced in communities of many species, highlighting an important role for perturbations, such as species removal, in evolving ecological communities."
"37223479","Characterizing Cellular Differentiation Potency and Waddington Landscape via Energy Indicator.","Research (Wash D C)","The precise characterization of cellular differentiation potency remains an open question, which is fundamentally important for deciphering the dynamics mechanism related to cell fate transition. We quantitatively evaluated the differentiation potency of different stem cells based on the Hopfield neural network (HNN). The results emphasized that cellular differentiation potency can be approximated by Hopfield energy values. We then profiled the Waddington energy landscape of embryogenesis and cell reprogramming processes. The energy landscape at single-cell resolution further confirmed that cell fate decision is progressively specified in a continuous process. Moreover, the transition of cells from one steady state to another in embryogenesis and cell reprogramming processes was dynamically simulated on the energy ladder. These two processes can be metaphorized as the motion of descending and ascending ladders, respectively. We further deciphered the dynamics of the gene regulatory network (GRN) for driving cell fate transition. Our study proposes a new energy indicator to quantitatively characterize cellular differentiation potency without prior knowledge, facilitating the further exploration of the potential mechanism of cellular plasticity."

Meanwhile, an initial CRC patient cohort was used to assess the effect ofIGF2methylation on CRC prognosis and then the finding was validated in the EPIC-Italy CRC cohort and TCGA datasets. A propensity score (PS) analysis was performed to control for confounders, and extensive sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness of our findings.PBLIGF2hypermethylation was associated with an increased risk of CRC in the initial study (ORPS-adjusted, 2.57, 95% CI: 1.65 to 4.03,P<0.0001), and this association was validated using two independent external datasets (ORPS-adjusted, 2.21, 95% CI: 1.28 to 3.81,P=0.0042 and ORPS-adjusted, 10.65, 95% CI: 1.26 to 89.71,P=0.0295, respectively). CRC patients withIGF2hypermethylation in PBLs had significantly improved overall survival compared to those patients withIGF2hypomethylation (HRPS-adjusted, 0.47, 95% CI: 0.29 to 0.76,P=0.0019). The prognostic signature was also observed in the EPIC-Italy CRC cohort, although the HR did not reach statistical significance (HRPS-adjusted, 0.69, 95% CI: 0.37 to 1.27,P=0.2359).IGF2hypermethylation may serve as a potential blood-based predictive biomarker for the identification of individuals at high risk of developing CRC and for CRC prognosis.Copyright © 2023 Sun, Liu, Zhang, Wang, Zhao and Liu."

Recent methodological developments have advanced understanding of the central role of skeletal muscle in many exercise-associated health benefits and have uncovered the molecular underpinnings driving adaptive responses to training regimens. In this Review, we provide a contemporary view of the metabolic flexibility and functional plasticity of skeletal muscle in response to exercise. First, we provide background on the macrostructure and ultrastructure of skeletal muscle fibres, highlighting the current understanding of sarcomeric networks and mitochondrial subpopulations. Next, we discuss acute exercise skeletal muscle metabolism and the signalling, transcriptional and epigenetic regulation of adaptations to exercise training. We address knowledge gaps throughout and propose future directions for the field.

"37215576","Technologies and applications of single-cell DNA methylation sequencing.","Theranostics","DNA methylation is the most stable epigenetic modification. In mammals, it usually occurs at the cytosine of CpG dinucleotides. DNA methylation is essential for many physiological and pathological processes. Aberrant DNA methylation has been observed in human diseases, particularly cancer. Notably, conventional DNA methylation profiling technologies require a large amount of DNA, often from a heterogeneous cell population, and provide an average methylation level of many cells. It is often not realistic to collect sufficient numbers of cells, such as rare cells and circulating tumor cells in peripheral blood, for bulk sequencing assays. It is therefore essential to develop sequencing technologies that can accurately profile DNA methylation using small numbers of cells or even single cells. Excitingly, many single-cell DNA methylation sequencing and single-cell omics sequencing technologies have been developed, and applications of these methods have greatly expanded our understanding of the molecular mechanism of DNA methylation. Here, we summaries single-cell DNA methylation and multi-omics sequencing methods, delineate their applications in biomedical sciences, discuss technical challenges, and present our perspective on future research directions.© The author(s)."
"37215528","Comparative analysis reveals epigenomic evolution related to species traits and genomic imprinting in mammals.","Innovation (Camb)","DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification that plays a crucial role in various regulatory processes, including gene expression regulation, transposable element repression, and genomic imprinting. However, most studies on DNA methylation have been conducted in humans and other model species, whereas the dynamics of DNA methylation across mammals remain poorly explored, limiting our understanding of epigenomic evolution in mammals and the evolutionary impacts of conserved and lineage-specific DNA methylation. Here, we generated and gathered comparative epigenomic data from 13 mammalian species, including two marsupial species, to demonstrate that DNA methylation plays critical roles in several aspects of gene evolution and species trait evolution. We found that the species-specific DNA methylation of promoters and noncoding elements correlates with species-specific traits such as body patterning, indicating that DNA methylation might help establish or maintain interspecies differences in gene regulation that shape phenotypes. For a broader view, we investigated the evolutionary histories of 88 known imprinting control regions across mammals to identify their evolutionary origins. By analyzing the features of known and newly identified potential imprints in all studied mammals, we found that genomic imprinting may function in embryonic development through the binding of specific transcription factors. Our findings show that DNA methylation and the complex interaction between the genome and epigenome have a significant impact on mammalian evolution, suggesting that evolutionary epigenomics should be incorporated to develop a unified evolutionary theory.© 2023 The Author(s)."
"37211559","Macrophages in immunoregulation and therapeutics.","Signal Transduct Target Ther","Macrophages exist in various tissues, several body cavities, and around mucosal surfaces and are a vital part of the innate immune system for host defense against many pathogens and cancers. Macrophages possess binary M1/M2 macrophage polarization settings, which perform a central role in an array of immune tasks via intrinsic signal cascades and, therefore, must be precisely regulated. Many crucial questions about macrophage signaling and immune modulation are yet to be uncovered. In addition, the clinical importance of tumor-associated macrophages is becoming more widely recognized as significant progress has been made in understanding their biology. Moreover, they are an integral part of the tumor microenvironment, playing a part in the regulation of a wide variety of processes including angiogenesis, extracellular matrix transformation, cancer cell proliferation, metastasis, immunosuppression, and resistance to chemotherapeutic and checkpoint blockade immunotherapies. Herein, we discuss immune regulation in macrophage polarization and signaling, mechanical stresses and modulation, metabolic signaling pathways, mitochondrial and transcriptional, and epigenetic regulation. Furthermore, we have broadly extended the understanding of macrophages in extracellular traps and the essential roles of autophagy and aging in regulating macrophage functions. Moreover, we discussed recent advances in macrophages-mediated immune regulation of autoimmune diseases and tumorigenesis. Lastly, we discussed targeted macrophage therapy to portray prospective targets for therapeutic strategies in health and diseases.© 2023. The Author(s)."

While chronic stress increases incidence levels of MDD, stress-mediated disruptions in brain function that precipitate the disorder remain elusive. Serotonin-associated antidepressants (ADs) remain the first line of therapy for many with MDD, yet low remission rates and delays between treatment and symptomatic alleviation have prompted skepticism regarding precise roles for serotonin in the precipitation of MDD. Our group recently demonstrated that serotonin epigenetically modifies histone proteins (H3K4me3Q5ser) to regulate transcriptional permissiveness in brain. However, this phenomenon has not yet been explored following stress and/or AD exposures.Here, we employed a combination of genome-wide (ChIP-seq, RNA-seq) and western blotting analyses in dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) of male and female mice exposed to chronic social defeat stress to examine the impact of stress exposures on H3K4me3Q5ser dynamics in DRN, as well as associations between the mark and stress-induced gene expression. Stress-induced regulation of H3K4me3Q5ser levels were also assessed in the context of AD exposures, and viral-mediated gene therapy was employed to manipulate H3K4me3Q5ser levels to examine the impact of reducing the mark in DRN on stress-associated gene expression and behavior.We found that H3K4me3Q5ser plays important roles in stress-mediated transcriptional plasticity in DRN. Mice exposed to chronic stress displayed dysregulated dynamics of H3K4me3Q5ser in DRN, and viral-mediated attenuation of these dynamics rescued stress-mediated gene expression programs and behavior.These findings establish a neurotransmission-independent role for serotonin in stress-associated transcriptional and behavioral plasticity in DRN."

Cleft lip/palate (CLP), the most common craniofacial malformation, has been associated with both genetic and environmental factors, with little gene-environment interaction experimentally demonstrated. Here, we study CLP families harbouring CDH1/E-Cadherin variants with incomplete penetrance and we explore the association of pro-inflammatory conditions to CLP. By studying neural crest (NC) from mouse, Xenopus and humans, we show that CLP can be explained by a 2-hit model, where NC migration is impaired by a combination of genetic (CDH1 loss-of-function) and environmental (pro-inflammatory activation) factors, leading to CLP. Finally, using in vivo targeted methylation assays, we demonstrate that CDH1 hypermethylation is the major target of the pro-inflammatory response, and a direct regulator of E-cadherin levels and NC migration. These results unveil a gene-environment interaction during craniofacial development and provide a 2-hit mechanism to explain cleft lip/palate aetiology.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37199042","Characterisation of X chromosome status of human extended pluripotent stem cells.","Cell Prolif","Different pluripotent cell types have been established by capturing pluripotency in different states. Human extended pluripotent stem cells (hEPSCs), recently established by two independent studies, have the capability of differentiating into both embryonic and extraembryonic lineages, as well as forming human blastoids, showing great potential for early human development modeling and regenerative medicine. Considering that X chromosome status in female human pluripotent stem cells is dynamic and heterogeneous, and often leads to functional consequences, we characterized it in hEPSCs. We derived hEPSCs from primed human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) with defined X chromosome status (pre- or post-X chromosome inactivation) using two previously published methods. We showed that hEPSCs derived using both methods had highly similar transcription profiles and X chromosome status. However, the X chromosome status of hEPSCs is largely determined by the primed hESCs from which they were derived, suggesting a lack of complete reprogramming of X chromosome during primed to extended/expanded pluripotency conversion. Furthermore, we found that the X chromosome status of hEPSCs affected their ability to differentiate into embryonic or extraembryonic lineage cells. Taken together, our work characterized the X chromosome status of hEPSCs, providing important information for the future application of hEPSCs.© 2023 The Authors.

Since the reproductive potential of a woman begins in the fetal ovary, the literature regarding the disruption of its reproductive health by environmental toxicants remains limited. Studies draw attention to follicle development, a major determinant for the quality of the oocyte, and the preimplantation embryo, as both of them are targets for epigenetic reprogramming. The ""Folliculogenesis and Embryo Development EXPOsure to a mixture of toxicants: evaluation in the rabbit model"" (FEDEXPO) project emerged from consideration of these limitations and aims to evaluate in the rabbit model the impacts of an exposure to a mixture of known and suspected endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) during two specific windows, including folliculogenesis and preimplantation embryo development. The mixture combines eight environmental toxicants, namely perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), hexachlorobenzene (HCB), β-hexachlorocyclohexane (β-HCH), 2,2'4,4'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-47), di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and bisphenol S (BPS), at relevant exposure levels for reproductive-aged women based on biomonitoring data. The project will be organized in order to assess the consequences of this exposure on the ovarian function of the directly exposed F0 females and monitor the development and health of the F1 offspring from the preimplantation stage. Emphasis will be made on the reproductive health of the offspring. Lastly, this multigenerational study will also tackle potential mechanisms for the inheritance of health disruption via the oocyte or the preimplantation embryo."

Previous studies have largely focused on identifying genetic risk factors associated with CHDs in individuals with DS, but comprehensive studies of the contribution of epigenetic marks are lacking. We aimed to identify and characterize DNA methylation differences from newborn dried blood spots(NDBS)of DS individuals with major CHDs compared to DS individuals without CHDs.We used the Illumina EPIC array and whole-genome bisulfite sequencing(WGBS)to quantitate DNA methylation for 86 NDBS samples from the California Biobank Program: 1) 45 DS-CHD (27 female, 18 male) and 2) 41 DS non-CHD (27 female, 14 male). We analyzed global CpG methylation and identified differentially methylated regions(DMRs)in DS-CHD vs DS non-CHD comparisons (both sex-combined and sex-stratified) corrected for sex, age of blood collection, and cell type proportions. CHD DMRs were analyzed for enrichment in CpG and genic contexts, chromatin states, and histone modifications by genomic coordinates and for gene ontology enrichment by gene mapping. DMRs were also tested in a replication dataset and compared to methylation levels in DS vs typical development(TD)WGBS NDBS samples.We found global CpG hypomethylation in DS-CHD males compared to DS non-CHD males, which was attributable to elevated levels of nucleated red blood cells and not seen in females. At a regional level, we identified 58, 341, and 3,938 CHD-associated DMRs in the Sex Combined, Females Only, and Males Only groups, respectively, and used machine learning algorithms to select 19 Males Only loci that could distinguish CHD from non-CHD. DMRs in all comparisons were enriched for gene exons, CpG islands, and bivalent chromatin and mapped to genes enriched for terms related to cardiac and immune functions. Lastly, a greater percentage of CHD-associated DMRs than background regions were differentially methylated in DS vs TD samples.A sex-specific signature of DNA methylation was detected in NDBS of DS-CHD compared to DS non-CHD individuals. This supports the hypothesis that epigenetics can reflect the variability of phenotypes in DS, particularly CHDs."

However, the functional role of APOBEC mutagenesis has yet to be fully delineated. To address this, we collect matched multi-omics data of 169 ESCC patients and evaluate characteristics of immune infiltration using multiple bioinformatic approaches based on bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data and verified by functional assays. We find that APOBEC mutagenesis prolongs overall survival (OS) of ESCC patients. The reason for this outcome is probably due to high anti-tumor immune infiltration, immune checkpoints expression and immune related pathway enrichment, such as interferon (IFN) signaling, innate and adaptive immune system. The elevated AOBEC3A (A3A) activity paramountly contributes to the footprints of APOBEC mutagenesis and is first discovered to be transactivated by FOSL1. Mechanistically, upregulatedA3Aexacerbates cytosolic double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) accumulation, thus stimulating cGAS-STING pathway. Simultaneously,A3Ais associated with immunotherapy response which is predicted by TIDE algorithm, validated in a clinical cohort and further confirmed in mouse models.

It is not known to what extent SCAD is genetically distinct from other cardiovascular diseases, including atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (CAD). Here we present a genome-wide association meta-analysis (1,917 cases and 9,292 controls) identifying 16 risk loci for SCAD. Integrative functional annotations prioritized genes that are likely to be regulated in vascular smooth muscle cells and artery fibroblasts and implicated in extracellular matrix biology. One locus containing the tissue factor gene F3, which is involved in blood coagulation cascade initiation, appears to be specific for SCAD risk. Several associated variants have diametrically opposite associations with CAD, suggesting that shared biological processes contribute to both diseases, but through different mechanisms. We also infer a causal role for high blood pressure in SCAD. Our findings provide novel pathophysiological insights involving arterial integrity and tissue-mediated coagulation in SCAD and set the stage for future specific therapeutics and preventions.© 2023.

We integrated data from the Third China National Stroke Registry, including clinical phenotypes, biomarkers, and whole-genome sequencing data for 7695 patients with NCIS. We identified 30 molecular clusters based on 63 biomarkers and explored the comprehensive landscape of biological heterogeneity and subpopulations in NCIS. Dimensionality reduction revealed fine-scale subpopulation structures associated with specific biomarkers. The subpopulations with biomarkers for inflammation, abnormal liver and kidney function, homocysteine metabolism, lipid metabolism, and gut microbiota metabolism were associated with a high risk of unfavorable clinical outcomes, including stroke recurrence, disability, and mortality. Several genes encoding potential drug targets were identified as putative causal genes that drive the clusters, such as CDK10, ERCC3, and CHEK2. We comprehensively characterized the genetic architecture of these subpopulations, identified their molecular signatures, and revealed the potential of the polybiomarkers and polygenic prediction for assessing clinical outcomes.

Nevertheless, the etiology of epilepsy remains poorly understood. Meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies involving 15,212 epilepsy cases and 29,677 controls of the ILAE Consortium cohort were used to conduct transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) and protein-wide association studies (PWAS). Furthermore, a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was generated using the STRING database, and significant epilepsy-susceptible genes were verified using chip data. Chemical-related gene set enrichment analysis (CGSEA) was performed to determine novel drug targets for epilepsy. TWAS analysis identified 21,170 genes, of which 58 were significant (TWASfdr< 0.05) in ten brain regions, and 16 differentially expressed genes were verified based on mRNA expression profiles. The PWAS identified 2249 genes, of which 2 were significant (PWASfdr< 0.05). Through chemical-gene set enrichment analysis, 287 environmental chemicals associated with epilepsy were identified. We identified five significant genes (WIPF1, IQSEC1, JAM2, ICAM3, and ZNF143) that had causal relationships with epilepsy. CGSEA identified 159 chemicals that were significantly correlated with epilepsy (Pcgsea< 0.05), such as pentobarbital, ketone bodies, and polychlorinated biphenyl. In summary, we performed TWAS, PWAS (for genetic factors), and CGSEA (for environmental factors) analyses and identified several epilepsy-associated genes and chemicals.

The SMR analyses were based on summarized data from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on IOP. We conducted separate SMR analyses using Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) and Consortium for the Architecture of Gene Expression (CAGE) expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data. Additionally, we performed a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) to identify genes whose cis-regulated expression levels were associated with IOP.We identified 19 and 25 genes showing pleiotropic association with IOP using the GTEx and CAGE eQTL data, respectively.RP11-259G18.3(PSMR= 2.66 × 10-6),KANSL1-AS1(PSMR= 2.78 × 10-6), andRP11-259G18.2(PSMR= 2.91 × 10-6) were the top three genes using the GTEx eQTL data.LRRC37A4(PSMR= 1.19 × 10-5),MGC57346(PSMR= 1.19 × 10-5), andRNF167(PSMR= 1.53 × 10-5) were the top three genes using the CAGE eQTL data.

Predicting liver injury and subsequent hepatic regeneration in patients taking therapeutic doses of APAP may be possible using new 'omic methods such as metabolomics and genomics. Multi'omic techniques increase our ability to find new mechanisms of injury and regeneration.We used metabolomic and genomic data from a randomized controlled trial of patients administered 4 g of APAP per day for 14 days or longer with blood samples obtained at 0 (baseline), 4, 7, 10, 13 and 16 days. We used the highest ALT as the clinical outcome to be predicted in our integrated analysis. We used penalized regression to model the relationship between genetic variants and day 0 metabolite level, and then performed a metabolite-wide colocalization scan to associate the genetically regulated component of metabolite expression with ALT elevation. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) analyses were conducted for ALT elevation and metabolite level using linear regression, with age, sex, and the first five principal components included as covariates. Colocalization was tested via a weighted sum test.Out of the 164 metabolites modeled, 120 met the criteria for predictive accuracy and were retained for genetic analyses. After genomic examination, eight metabolites were found to be under genetic control and predictive of ALT elevation due to therapeutic acetaminophen. The metabolites were: 3-oxalomalate, allantoate, diphosphate, L-carnitine, L-proline, maltose, and ornithine. These genes are important in the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA), urea breakdown pathway, glutathione production, mitochondrial energy production, and maltose metabolism.This multi'omic approach can be used to integrate metabolomic and genomic data allowing identification of genes that control downstream metabolites. These findings confirm prior work that have identified mitochondrial energy production as critical to APAP induced liver injury and have confirmed our prior work that demonstrate the importance of the urea cycle in therapeutic APAP liver injury.© 2023.

Traditionally, BD II has been conceptualized as a less severe presentation of BD I, however, extant literature to investigate this claim has been mixed.We apply Genomic Structural Equation Modeling (Genomic SEM) to investigate divergent genetic pathways across BD's two major subtypes using the most recent GWAS summary statistics from the PGC. We begin by identifying divergences in genetic correlations across 89 external traits using a Bonferroni corrected threshold. We also use a theoretically informed follow-up model to examine the extent to which the genetic variance in each subtype is explained by schizophrenia and major depression. Lastly, Transcriptome-wide SEM (T-SEM) was used to identify gene expression patterns associated with the BD subtypes.BD II was characterized by significantly larger genetic overlap with internalizing traits (e.g., neuroticism, insomnia, physical inactivity), while significantly stronger associations for BD I were limited. Consistent with these findings, the follow-up model revealed a much larger major depression component for BD II. T-SEM results revealed 41 unique genes associated with risk pathways across BD subtypes.Divergent patterns of genetic relationships across external traits provide support for the distinction of the bipolar subtypes. However, our results also challenge the illness severity conceptualization of BD given stronger genetic overlap across BD II and a range of clinically relevant traits and disorders."

However, translating these associations into biological mechanisms contributing to disease etiology and heterogeneity has been challenging. Here, we hypothesize that the effects of disease-associated genetic variants converge onto distinct cell type specific molecular pathways within distinct subgroups of patients. In order to test this hypothesis, we develop the CASTom-iGEx pipeline to operationalize individual level genotype data to interpret personal polygenic risk and identify the genetic basis of clinical heterogeneity. The paradigmatic application of this approach to coronary artery disease and schizophrenia reveals a convergence of disease associated variant effects onto known and novel genes, pathways, and biological processes. The biological process specific genetic liabilities are not equally distributed across patients. Instead, they defined genetically distinct groups of patients, characterized by different profiles across pathways, endophenotypes, and disease severity. These results provide further evidence for a genetic contribution to clinical heterogeneity and point to the existence of partially distinct pathomechanisms across patient subgroups. Thus, the universally applicable approach presented here has the potential to constitute an important component of future personalized medicine concepts."

For the identification of risk genes among GWAS loci we did a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) and expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) study from gastric corpus and antrum mucosa. To test whether cardia GC and OAC/BO share genetic aetiology we also used a European GWAS sample with OAC/BO.Our GWAS consisting of 5816 patients and 10,999 controls highlights the genetic heterogeneity of GC according to its subtypes. We newly identified two and replicated five GC risk loci, all of them with subtype-specific association. The gastric transcriptome data consisting of 361 corpus and 342 antrum mucosa samples revealed that an upregulated expression of MUC1, ANKRD50, PTGER4, and PSCA are plausible GC-pathomechanisms at four GWAS loci. At another risk locus, we found that the blood-group 0 exerts protective effects for non-cardia and diffuse GC, while blood-group A increases risk for both GC subtypes. Furthermore, our GWAS on cardia GC and OAC/BO (10,279 patients, 16,527 controls) showed that both cancer entities share genetic aetiology at the polygenic level and identified two new risk loci on the single-marker level.Our findings show that the pathophysiology of GC is genetically heterogenous according to location and histopathology.

We thus conducted a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) of PSA levels using genome-wide summary statistics from 95,768 PCa-free men, the MetaXcan framework, and gene prediction models trained in Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project data. Tissue-specific analyses identified 41 statistically significant (p < 0.05/12,192 = 4.10e-6) associations in whole blood and 39 statistically significant (p < 0.05/13,844 = 3.61e-6) associations in prostate tissue, with 18 genes associated in both tissues. Cross-tissue analyses that combined associations across 45 tissues identified 155 genes that were statistically significantly (p < 0.05/22,249 = 2.25e-6) associated with PSA levels. Based on conditional analyses that assessed whether TWAS associations were attributable to a lead GWAS variant, we found 20 novel genes (11 single-tissue, 9 cross-tissue) that were associated with PSA levels in the TWAS. Of these novel genes, five showed evidence of colocalization (colocalization probability > 0.5):EXOSC9, CCNA2, HIST1H2BN, RP11-182L21.6, andRP11-327J17.2. Six of the 20 novel genes are not known to impact PCa risk. These findings yield new hypotheses for genetic factors underlying PSA levels that should be further explored toward improving our understanding of PSA biology."
"37244925","Targeting protein modifications in metabolic diseases: molecular mechanisms and targeted therapies.","Signal Transduct Target Ther","The ever-increasing prevalence of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) represents a major public health burden worldwide. The most common form of NCD is metabolic diseases, which affect people of all ages and usually manifest their pathobiology through life-threatening cardiovascular complications. A comprehensive understanding of the pathobiology of metabolic diseases will generate novel targets for improved therapies across the common metabolic spectrum. Protein posttranslational modification (PTM) is an important term that refers to biochemical modification of specific amino acid residues in target proteins, which immensely increases the functional diversity of the proteome. The range of PTMs includes phosphorylation, acetylation, methylation, ubiquitination, SUMOylation, neddylation, glycosylation, palmitoylation, myristoylation, prenylation, cholesterylation, glutathionylation, S-nitrosylation, sulfhydration, citrullination, ADP ribosylation, and several novel PTMs. Here, we offer a comprehensive review of PTMs and their roles in common metabolic diseases and pathological consequences, including diabetes, obesity, fatty liver diseases, hyperlipidemia, and atherosclerosis. Building upon this framework, we afford a through description of proteins and pathways involved in metabolic diseases by focusing on PTM-based protein modifications, showcase the pharmaceutical intervention of PTMs in preclinical studies and clinical trials, and offer future perspectives. Fundamental research defining the mechanisms whereby PTMs of proteins regulate metabolic diseases will open new avenues for therapeutic intervention.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37225790","A longitudinal study of the association between attending cultural events and coronary heart disease.","Commun Med (Lond)","The experiences of art and music are an essential part of human life and this study aimed to examine the longitudinal association between cultural participation and coronary heart disease.This was a longitudinal study on a randomly selected representative adult cohort (n = 3296) of the Swedish population. The study period was over 36 years (1982-2017) with three separate eight-year interval measurements of cultural exposure (for example, visiting theatres and museums) starting in 1982/83. The outcome was coronary heart disease during the study period. Marginal structural Cox models with inverse probability weighting were used to account for time-varying weights of the exposure and potential confounders during the follow-up. The associations were also examined through a time-varying Cox proportional hazard regression model.Cultural participation shows a graded association, the higher the exposure the lower the risk of coronary heart disease; the hazard ratio was 0.66 (95% confidence interval, 0.50 to 0.86) for coronary heart disease in participants with the highest level of cultural exposure compared with the lowest level.Although causality cannot be determined due to the remaining risk of residual confounding and bias, the use of marginal structural Cox models with inverse probability weighting strengthens the evidence for a potentially causal association with cardiovascular health, which warrants further studies.© 2023.

"37205331","Efficient differential expression analysis of large-scale single cell transcriptomics data using dreamlet.","Res Sq","Advances in single-cell and -nucleus transcriptomics have enabled generation of increasingly large-scale datasets from hundreds of subjects and millions of cells. These studies promise to give unprecedented insight into the cell type specific biology of human disease. Yet performing differential expression analyses across subjects remains difficult due to challenges in statistical modeling of these complex studies and scaling analyses to large datasets. Our open-source R package dreamlet (DiseaseNeurogenomics.github.io/dreamlet) uses a pseudobulk approach based on precision-weighted linear mixed models to identify genes differentially expressed with traits across subjects for each cell cluster. Designed for data from large cohorts, dreamlet is substantially faster and uses less memory than existing workflows, while supporting complex statistical models and controlling the false positive rate. We demonstrate computational and statistical performance on published datasets, and a novel dataset of 1.4M single nuclei from postmortem brains of 150 Alzheimer's disease cases and 149 controls."
"37253881","A non-coding variant linked to metabolic obesity with normal weight affects actin remodelling in subcutaneous adipocytes.","Nat Metab","Recent large-scale genomic association studies found evidence for a genetic link between increased risk of type 2 diabetes and decreased risk for adiposity-related traits, reminiscent of metabolically obese normal weight (MONW) association signatures. However, the target genes and cellular mechanisms driving such MONW associations remain to be identified. Here, we systematically identify the cellular programmes of one of the top-scoring MONW risk loci, the 2q24.3 risk locus, in subcutaneous adipocytes. We identify a causal genetic variant, rs6712203, an intronic single-nucleotide polymorphism in the COBLL1 gene, which changes the conserved transcription factor motif of POU domain, class 2, transcription factor 2, and leads to differential COBLL1 gene expression by altering the enhancer activity at the locus in subcutaneous adipocytes. We then establish the cellular programme under the genetic control of the 2q24.3 MONW risk locus and the effector gene COBLL1, which is characterized by impaired actin cytoskeleton remodelling in differentiating subcutaneous adipocytes and subsequent failure of these cells to accumulate lipids and develop into metabolically active and insulin-sensitive adipocytes. Finally, we show that perturbations of the effector gene Cobll1 in a mouse model result in organismal phenotypes matching the MONW association signature, including decreased subcutaneous body fat mass and body weight along with impaired glucose tolerance. Taken together, our results provide a mechanistic link between the genetic risk for insulin resistance and low adiposity, providing a potential therapeutic hypothesis and a framework for future identification of causal relationships between genome associations and cellular programmes in other disorders.© 2023.

"37238719","Emerging Role and Mechanism of the FTO Gene in Cardiovascular Diseases.","Biomolecules","The fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) gene was the first obesity-susceptibility gene identified through a genome-wide association study (GWAS). A growing number of studies have suggested that genetic variants ofFTOare strongly associated with the risk of cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension and acute coronary syndrome. In addition, FTO was also the first N6-methyladenosine (m6A) demethylase, suggesting the reversible nature of m6A modification. m6A is dynamically deposited, removed, and recognized by m6A methylases, demethylases, and m6A binding proteins, respectively. By catalyzing m6A demethylation on mRNA, FTO may participate in various biological processes by modulating RNA function. Recent studies demonstrated that FTO plays a pivotal role in the initiation and progression of cardiovascular diseases such as myocardial fibrosis, heart failure, and atherosclerosis and may hold promise as a potential therapeutic target for treating or preventing a variety of cardiovascular diseases. Here, we review the association betweenFTOgenetic variants and cardiovascular disease risk, summarize the role of FTO as an m6A demethylase in cardiovascular disorders, and discuss future research directions and possible clinical implications."
"37223038","Increased meso-striatal connectivity mediates trait impulsivity in FTO variant carriers.","Front Endocrinol (Lausanne)","While variations in the first intron of thefat mass and obesity-associated gene(FTO, rs9939609 T/A variant) have long been identified as a major contributor to polygenic obesity, the mechanisms underlying weight gain in risk allele carriers still remain elusive. On a behavioral level,FTOvariants have been robustly linked to trait impulsivity. The regulation of dopaminergic signaling in the meso-striatal neurocircuitry by theseFTOvariants might represent one mechanism for this behavioral alteration. Notably, recent evidence indicates that variants ofFTOalso modulate several genes involved in cell proliferation and neuronal development. Hence, FTO polymorphisms might establish a predisposition to heightened trait impulsivity during neurodevelopment by altering structural meso-striatal connectivity. We here explored whether the greater impulsivity ofFTOvariant carriers was mediated by structural differences in the connectivity between the dopaminergic midbrain and the ventral striatum.Eighty-seven healthy normal-weight volunteers participated in the study; 42 FTO risk allele carriers (rs9939609 T/A variant,FTO+group: AT, AA) and 39 non-carriers (FTO-group: TT) were matched for age, sex and body mass index (BMI). Trait impulsivity was assessed via the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11) and structural connectivity between the ventral tegmental area/substantia nigra (VTA/SN) and the nucleus accumbens (NAc) was measured via diffusion weighted MRI and probabilistic tractography.We found thatFTOrisk allele carriers compared to non-carriers, demonstrated greater motor impulsivity (p= 0.04) and increased structural connectivity between VTA/SN and the NAc (p< 0.05). Increased connectivity partially mediated the effect of FTO genetic status on motor impulsivity.We report altered structural connectivity as one mechanism by whichFTOvariants contribute to increased impulsivity, indicating thatFTOvariants may exert their effect on obesity-promoting behavioral traits at least partially through neuroplastic alterations in humans.Copyright © 2023 Edwin Thanarajah, Hanssen, Melzer and Tittgemeyer."

Specific promoter(s) that regulates energy balance remain unclear. We show that disruption ofBdnfpromoters I and II but not IV and VI in mice (Bdnf-e1-/-,Bdnf-e2-/-) results in obesity. WhereasBdnf-e1-/-exhibited impaired thermogenesis,Bdnf-e2-/-showed hyperphagia and reduced satiety before the onset of obesity. TheBdnf-e2transcripts were primarily expressed in ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH), a nucleus known to regulate satiety. Re-expressingBdnf-e2transcript in VMH or chemogenetic activation of VMH neurons rescued the hyperphagia and obesity ofBdnf-e2-/-mice. Deletion of BDNF receptor TrkB in VMH neurons in wildtype mice resulted in hyperphagia and obesity, and infusion of TrkB agonistic antibody into VMH ofBdnf-e2-/-mice alleviated these phenotypes. Thus,Bdnf-e2-transcripts in VMH neurons play a key role in regulating energy intake and satiety through TrkB pathway."

Current tools for prediction, prevention and treatment are limited. Here we tested the association of maternal DNA sequence variants with preeclampsia in 20,064 cases and 703,117 control individuals and with gestational hypertension in 11,027 cases and 412,788 control individuals across discovery and follow-up cohorts using multi-ancestry meta-analysis. Altogether, we identified 18 independent loci associated with preeclampsia/eclampsia and/or gestational hypertension, 12 of which are new (for example, MTHFR-CLCN6, WNT3A, NPR3, PGR and RGL3), including two loci (PLCE1 and FURIN) identified in the multitrait analysis. Identified loci highlight the role of natriuretic peptide signaling, angiogenesis, renal glomerular function, trophoblast development and immune dysregulation. We derived genome-wide polygenic risk scores that predicted preeclampsia/eclampsia and gestational hypertension in external cohorts, independent of clinical risk factors, and reclassified eligibility for low-dose aspirin to prevent preeclampsia. Collectively, these findings provide mechanistic insights into the hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and have the potential to advance pregnancy risk stratification.© 2023.

We carried out a genome-wide association analysis of 30,832 UK Biobank individuals of the six fornix diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) traits. The post-GWAS analysis allowed us to identify causal genetic variants in phenotypes at the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), locus, and gene levels, as well as genetic overlap with brain health-related traits. We further generalized our GWAS in adolescent brain cognitive development (ABCD) cohort. The GWAS identified 63 independent significant variants within 20 genomic loci associated (P < 8.33 × 10-9) with the six fornix dMRI traits. Geminin coiled-coil domain containing (GMNC) and NUAK family SNF1-like kinase 1 (NUAK1) gene were highlighted, which were found in UKB and replicated in ABCD. The heritability of the six traits ranged from 10% to 27%. Gene mapping strategies identified 213 genes, where 11 were supported by all of four methods. Gene-based analyses revealed pathways relating to cell development and differentiation, with astrocytes found to be significantly enriched. Pleiotropy analyses with eight neurological and psychiatric disorders revealed shared variants, especially with schizophrenia under the conjFDR threshold of 0.05. These findings advance our understanding of the complex genetic architectures of fornix and their relevance in neurological and psychiatric disorders.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37235137","Genetic variants in HFE are associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in lean individuals.","JHEP Rep","Around 20% of patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are lean. Increasing evidence suggests that lean NAFLD is a unique subtype of the disease. We aimed to explore the metabolic profile, genetic basis, causal risk factors, and clinical sequelae underlying lean NAFLD.NAFLD was diagnosed by whole liver proton density fat fraction ≥5%. Whole liver proton density fat fraction and hepatic iron were quantified using magnetic resonance imaging in the UK Biobank. Individuals in this study were stratified according to the World Health Organization criteria of obesity, into lean, overweight, and obese. Mediation analysis, Mendelian randomisation analysis, and Bayesian networks were used to identify a risk factor or a clinical sequela of lean/obese NAFLD.Lean NAFLD manifested a distinct metabolic profile, featured by elevated hepatic iron and fasting glucose. Four loci, namely,HFErs1800562,SLC17A3-SLC17A2-TRIM38rs9348697,PNPLA3rs738409, andTM6SF2rs58542926, were associated with lean NAFLD (p<5 × 10-8).HFErs1800562 was specifically associated with lean NAFLD and demonstrated a significant mediation effect through elevating hepatic iron. Type 2 diabetes was the most pronounced clinical sequela of lean NAFLD, followed by liver cirrhosis.Our study suggested thatHFEplays a potential steatogenic role rather than regulating iron homoeostasis in patients with lean NAFLD. The increased liver iron deposition is associated with lean NAFLD, whereas obese NAFLD is not related to hepatic iron. The clinical management of patients with lean NAFLD shall be concerned with the prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes and liver cirrhosis.Lean NAFLD has a distinct natural history from obese NAFLD. This study underscored liver iron content and the genetic variant of the iron homoeostasis gene HFE as major risks of lean NAFLD, in addition to the unique metabolic profile. The development of type 2 diabetes or liver cirrhosis shall be closely monitored and prevented in patients with lean NAFLD.© 2023 The Author(s)."
"37226166","The effects of coagulation factors on the risk of endometriosis: a Mendelian randomization study.","BMC Med","Endometriosis is recognized as a complex gynecological disorder that can cause severe pain and infertility, affecting 6-10% of all reproductive-aged women. Endometriosis is a condition in which endometrial tissue, which normally lines the inside of the uterus, deposits in other tissues. The etiology and pathogenesis of endometriosis remain ambiguous. Despite debates, it is generally agreed that endometriosis is a chronic inflammatory disease, and patients with endometriosis appear to be in a hypercoagulable state. The coagulation system plays important roles in hemostasis and inflammatory responses. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to use publicly available GWAS summary statistics to examine the causal relationship between coagulation factors and the risk of endometriosis.To investigate the causal relationship between coagulation factors and the risk of endometriosis, a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analytic framework was used. A series of quality control procedures were followed in order to select eligible instrumental variables that were strongly associated with the exposures (vWF, ADAMTS13, aPTT, FVIII, FXI, FVII, FX, ETP, PAI-1, protein C, and plasmin). Two independent cohorts of European ancestry with endometriosis GWAS summary statistics were used: UK Biobank (4354 cases and 217,500 controls) and FinnGen (8288 cases and 68,969 controls). We conducted MR analyses separately in the UK Biobank and FinnGen, followed by a meta-analysis. The Cochran's Q test, MR-Egger intercept test, and leave-one-out sensitivity analyses were used to assess the heterogeneities, horizontal pleiotropy, and stabilities of SNPs in endometriosis.Our two-sample MR analysis of 11 coagulation factors in the UK Biobank suggested a reliable causal effect of genetically predicted plasma ADAMTS13 level on decreased endometriosis risk. A negative causal effect of ADAMTS13 and a positive causal effect of vWF on endometriosis were observed in the FinnGen. In the meta-analysis, the causal associations remained significant with a strong effect size. The MR analyses also identified potential causal effects of ADAMTS13 and vWF on different sub-phenotypes of endometrioses.Our MR analysis based on GWAS data from large-scale population studies demonstrated the causal associations between ADAMTS13/vWF and the risk of endometriosis. These findings suggest that these coagulation factors are involved in the development of endometriosis and may represent potential therapeutic targets for the management of this complex disease.© 2023.

"37223033","The genetics of autism and steroid-related traits in prenatal and postnatal life.","Front Endocrinol (Lausanne)","Autism likelihood is a largely heritable trait. Autism prevalence has a skewed sex ratio, with males being diagnosed more often than females. Steroid hormones play a mediating role in this, as indicated by studies of both prenatal biology and postnatal medical conditions in autistic men and women. It is currently unclear if the genetics of steroid regulation or production interact with the genetic liability for autism.To address this, two studies were conducted using publicly available datasets, which focused respectively on rare genetic variants linked to autism and neurodevelopmental conditions (study 1) and common genetic variants (study 2) for autism. In Study 1 an enrichment analysis was conducted, between autism-related genes (SFARI database) and genes that are differentially expressed (FDR<0.1) between male and female placentas, in 1sttrimester chorionic villi samples of viable pregnancies (n=39). In Study 2 summary statistics of genome wide association studies (GWAS) were used to investigate the genetic correlation between autism and bioactive testosterone, estradiol and postnatal PlGF levels, as well as steroid-related conditions such as polycystic ovaries syndrome (PCOS), age of menarche, and androgenic alopecia. Genetic correlation was calculated based on LD Score regression and results were corrected for multiple testing with FDR.In Study 1, there was significant enrichment of X-linked autism genes in male-biased placental genes, independently of gene length (n=5 genes, p<0.001). In Study 2, common genetic variance associated with autism did not correlate to the genetics for the postnatal levels of testosterone, estradiol or PlGF, but was associated with the genotypes associated with early age of menarche in females (b=-0.109, FDR-q=0.004) and protection from androgenic alopecia for males (b=-0.135, FDR-q=0.007).The rare genetic variants associated with autism appear to interact with placental sex differences, while the common genetic variants associated with autism appear to be involved in the regulation of steroid-related traits. These lines of evidence indicate that the likelihood for autism is partly linked to factors mediating physiological sex differences throughout development.Copyright © 2023 Tsompanidis, Warrier and Baron-Cohen."

We performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of FECD in the Million Veteran Program (MVP) and meta-analyzed with the previous largest FECD GWAS, finding twelve significant loci (eight novel). We further confirmed the TCF4 locus in admixed African and Hispanic/Latino ancestries, and found an enrichment of European-ancestry haplotypes at TCF4 in FECD cases. Among the novel associations are low frequency missense variants in laminin genes LAMA5 and LAMB1 which, together with previously reported LAMC1, form laminin-511 (LM511). AlphaFold 2 protein modeling suggests that mutations at LAMA5 and LAMB1 may destabilize LM511 by altering inter-domain interactions or extracellular matrix binding. Finally, phenome-wide association scans and co-localization analyses suggest that the TCF4 CTG18.1 trinucleotide repeat expansion leads to dysregulation of ion transport in the corneal endothelium and has pleiotropic effects on renal function."

Multiple epidemiological studies suggest an association between POAG and major neurodegenerative disorders (Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal dementia, and Parkinson's disease). However, the nature of the overlap between neurodegenerative disorders, brain morphology and glaucoma remains inconclusive.In this study, we performed a comprehensive assessment of the genetic and causal relationship between POAG and neurodegenerative disorders, leveraging genome-wide association data from studies of magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, POAG, and four major neurodegenerative disorders.This study found a genetic overlap and causal relationship between POAG and its related phenotypes (i.e., intraocular pressure and optic nerve morphology traits) and brain morphology in 19 regions. We also identified 11 loci with a significant local genetic correlation and a high probability of sharing the same causal variant between neurodegenerative disorders and POAG or its related phenotypes. Of interest, a region on chromosome 17 corresponding to MAPT, a well-known risk locus for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, was shared between POAG, optic nerve degeneration traits, and Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Despite these local genetic overlaps, we did not identify strong evidence of a causal association between these neurodegenerative disorders and glaucoma.Our findings indicate a distinctive and likely independent neurodegenerative process for POAG involving several brain regions although several POAG or optic nerve degeneration risk loci are shared with neurodegenerative disorders, consistent with a pleiotropic effect rather than a causal relationship between these traits.PG was supported by an NHMRC Investigator Grant (#1173390), SM by an NHMRC Senior Research Fellowship and an NHMRC Program Grant (APP1150144), DM by an NHMRC Fellowship, LP is funded by the NEIEY015473 and EY032559 grants, SS is supported by an NIH-Oxford Cambridge Fellowship and NIH T32 grant (GM136577), APK is supported by a UK Research and Innovation Future Leaders Fellowship, an Alcon Research Institute Young Investigator Award and a Lister Institute for Preventive Medicine Award.Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).

Although direct studies are hindered, here, we investigate the dynamics of human primordial germ cell (PGCs) specification using in vitro models with temporally resolved single-cell transcriptomics and in-depth characterisation using in vivo datasets from human and nonhuman primates, including a 3D marmoset reference atlas. We elucidate the molecular signature for the transient gain of competence for germ cell fate during peri-implantation epiblast development. Furthermore, we show that both the PGCs and amnion arise from transcriptionally similar TFAP2A-positive progenitors at the posterior end of the embryo. Notably, genetic loss of function experiments shows that TFAP2A is crucial for initiating the PGC fate without detectably affecting the amnion and is subsequently replaced by TFAP2C as an essential component of the genetic network for PGC fate. Accordingly, amniotic cells continue to emerge from the progenitors in the posterior epiblast, but importantly, this is also a source of nascent PGCs.© 2023 Castillo-Venzor et al."
"37096944","The compleX balancing act of controlling X-chromosome dosage and how it impacts mammalian germline development.","Biochem J","In female mammals, the two X chromosomes are subject to epigenetic gene regulation in order to balance X-linked gene dosage with autosomes and in relation to males, which have one X and one Y chromosome. This is achieved by an intricate interplay of several processes; X-chromosome inactivation and reactivation elicit global epigenetic regulation of expression from one X chromosome in a stage-specific manner, whilst the process of X-chromosome upregulation responds to this by fine-tuning transcription levels of the second X. The germline is unique in its function of transmitting both the genetic and epigenetic information from one generation to the next, and remodelling of the X chromosome is one of the key steps in setting the stage for successful development. Here, we provide an overview of the complex dynamics of X-chromosome dosage control during embryonic and germ cell development, and aim to decipher its potential role for normal germline competency.© 2023 The Author(s).

We have previously identified receptor signaling systems that are specifically associated with controlling molecular pathologies associated with the aging process. Here, we have identified a pseudo-orphan GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor 19 (GPR19), that is sensitive to many molecular aspects of the aging process. Through an in-depth molecular investigation process that involved proteomic, molecular biological, and advanced informatic experimentation, this study found that the functionality of GPR19 is specifically linked to sensory, protective, and remedial signaling systems associated with aging-related pathology. This study suggests that the activity of this receptor may play a role in mitigating the effects of aging-related pathology by promoting protective and remedial signaling systems. GPR19 expression variation demonstrates variability in the molecular activity in this larger process. At low expression levels in HEK293 cells, GPR19 expression regulates signaling paradigms linked with stress responses and metabolic responses to these. At higher expression levels, GPR19 expression co-regulates systems involved in sensing and repairing DNA damage, while at the highest levels of GPR19 expression, a functional link to processes of cellular senescence is seen. In this manner, GPR19 may function as a coordinator of aging-associated metabolic dysfunction, stress response, DNA integrity management, and eventual senescence."

Both the generalised linear regression model (GLM) and Poisson regression model were used to calculate the impact of the declining exposure level of PM2.5 on blood pressure and the incidence of prehypertension and hypertension.The annual mean PM2.5 concentration in 2014 and in 2019 were 65.01 ± 6.46 µgmes per cubic metre (μg / m3), 42.08 ± 2.04 μg / m3respectively, and the decreased PM2.5 concentration between 2014 and 2019 was 22.92 ± 4.51 μg / m3. The effect of decreased PM2.5 concentration by 1μg / m3on systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and the difference of blood pressure (BP) indexes between 2014 and 2019 were all significant (P < 0.001). The absolute differences of SBP (-3.598 mmHg; 95% confidence interval (CI) = -4.47,-2.72 mm Hg), DBP (-2.052 mmHg; 95% CI = -2.80,-1.31 mm Hg) and MAP (-2.568 mmHg; 95% CI = -3.27,-1.87 mm Hg) in the group with a decreased level of ≥25.56 μg / m3were more significant than those in a decreased concentration of PM2.5 for <25.56 μg / m3(P < 0.001). And the incidence of prehypertension and hypertension for three occasions blood pressure diagnose was 2.21% (95% CI = 1.37%-3.05%, P = 0.001) in children with PM2.5 decreased level ≤25.56 μg / m3(50%), which was significant higher than its' counterparts 0.89% (95% CI = 0.37%-1.42%, P = 0.001).Our study found the etiological relationship between the declining PM2.5 concentration and the BP values and the incidence of prehypertension and hypertension in children and adolescents, suggesting continuous environmental protection measures in China have achieved remarkable health benefits.Copyright © 2023 by the Journal of Global Health.

More importantly, we combined three biological interpretability methods including DeepLIFT,in-silicotiling deletion, andin-silicomutagenesis to identify the potential core motifs of any given genomic region.For the results, DenseNet not only has achieved greater predictability than baseline methods such as LS-GKM and MEME for above 389 TFs from Arabidopsis, maize and rice, but also has greater performance on trans-species prediction of a total of 15 TFs from other six plant species. A motif analysis based on TF-MoDISco and global importance analysis (GIA) further provide the biological implication of the core motif identified by three interpretability methods. Finally, we developed a pipeline of TSPTFBS 2.0, which integrates 389 DenseNet-based models of TF binding and the above three interpretability methods.TSPTFBS 2.0 was implemented as a user-friendly web-server (http://www.hzau-hulab.com/TSPTFBS/), which can support important references for editing targets of any given plant promoters and it has great potentials to provide reliable editing target of genetic screen experiments in plants.Copyright © 2023 Cheng, Liu, Zhou, Deng, Ge and Hu."

Current models suggest that RUNX1 cooperates with other oncogenic factors (e.g., NOTCH1, TAL1) to drive the expression of proto-oncogenes in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) but the molecular mechanisms controlled by RUNX1 and its cooperation with other factors remain unclear. Integrative chromatin and transcriptional analysis following inhibition of RUNX1 and NOTCH1 revealed a surprisingly widespread role of RUNX1 in the establishment of global H3K27ac levels and that RUNX1 is required by NOTCH1 for cooperative transcription activation of key NOTCH1 target genes includingMYC, DTX1, HES4, IL7R,andNOTCH3. Super-enhancers were preferentially sensitive to RUNX1 knockdown and RUNX1-dependent super-enhancers were disrupted following the treatment of a pan-BET inhibitor, I-BET151.© 2023 The Authors."

To do this, we extracted cfDNA fragmentomic features from 191 whole-genome sequencing data and studied them in 396 low-pass 5hmC sequencing data, which included four common cancer types and control samples.In our analysis of 5hmC sequencing data from cancer samples, we observed aberrant ultra-long fragments (220-500 bp) that differed from normal samples in terms of both size and coverage profile. These fragments played a significant role in predicting cancer. Leveraging the ability to detect cfDNA hydroxymethylation and fragmentomic markers simultaneously in low-pass 5hmC sequencing data, we developed an integrated model that incorporated 63 features representing both fragmentomic features and hydroxymethylation signatures. This model achieved high sensitivity and specificity for pan-cancer detection (88.52% and 82.35%, respectively).We showed that fragmentomic information in 5hmC sequencing data is an ideal marker for cancer detection and that it shows high performance in low-pass sequencing data.Copyright © 2023.

Current medical care focuses on treating people after they become patients rather than preventing illness, leading to high costs in treating chronic and late-stage diseases. Additionally, a ""one-size-fits all"" approach to health care does not take into account individual differences in genetics, environment, or lifestyle factors, decreasing the number of people benefiting from interventions. Rapid advances in omics technologies and progress in computational capabilities have led to the development of multi-omics deep phenotyping, which profiles the interaction of multiple levels of biology over time and empowers precision health approaches. This review highlights current and emerging multi-omics modalities for precision health and discusses applications in the following areas: genetic variation, cardio-metabolic diseases, cancer, infectious diseases, organ transplantation, pregnancy, and longevity/aging. We will briefly discuss the potential of multi-omics approaches in disentangling host-microbe and host-environmental interactions. We will touch on emerging areas of electronic health record and clinical imaging integration with muti-omics for precision health. Finally, we will briefly discuss the challenges in the clinical implementation of multi-omics and its future prospects.Copyright © 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

Epigenetic drugs such as inhibitors of extra-terminal domain proteins (iBET) have shown beneficial effects in experimental kidney disease, mainly by inhibiting proliferative and inflammatory responses. The impact of iBET on mitochondrial damage was explored in in vitro studies in renal cells stimulated with TGF-β1 and in vivo in murine unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) model of progressive kidney damage. In vitro, JQ1 pretreatment prevented the TGF-β1-induced downregulation of components of the oxidative phosphorylation chain (OXPHOS), such as cytochrome C and CV-ATP5a in human proximal tubular cells. In addition, JQ1 also prevented the altered mitochondrial dynamics by avoiding the increase in the DRP-1 fission factor. In UUO model, renal gene expression levels of cytochrome C and CV-ATP5a as well as protein levels of cytochrome C were reduced These changes were prevented by JQ1 administration. In addition, JQ1 decreased protein levels of the DRP1 fission protein and increased the OPA-1 fusion protein, restoring mitochondrial dynamics. Mitochondria also participate in the maintenance of redox balance. JQ1 restored the gene expression of antioxidant proteins, such as Catalase and Heme oxygenase 1 in TGF-β1-stimulated human proximal tubular cells and in murine obstructed kidneys. Indeed, in tubular cells, JQ1 decreased ROS production induced by stimulation with TGF-β1, as evaluated by MitoSOXTM. iBETs, such as JQ1, improve mitochondrial dynamics, functionality, and oxidative stress in kidney disease."

However, animal model results may not be accurate due to the species' differences, and testing on humans is ethically impermissible. Here, we developed an in vitro human maternal-fetal multicellular model composed of a human hepatic compartment, a bilayer placental barrier, and a human fetal central nervous system compartment using neural stem cells (NSCs) to investigate the effect of AFB1on fetal-side NSCs. AFB1passed through the HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells to mimic the maternal metabolic effects. Importantly, even at the limited concentration (0.0641 ± 0.0046 μM) of AFB1,close to the national safety level standard of China (GB-2761-2011), the mixture of AFB1crossing the placental barrier induced NSC apoptosis. The level of reactive oxygen species in NSCs was significantly elevated and the cell membrane was damaged, causing the release of intracellular lactate dehydrogenase (p< 0.05). The comet experiment and γ-H2AX immunofluorescence assay showed that AFB1caused significant DNA damage to NSCs (p< 0.05). This study provided a new model for the toxicological evaluation of the effect of food mycotoxin exposure during pregnancy on fetal neurodevelopment."

The CRESPI cohort is an epidemiological study among workers (n~320) and children (n~540) attending daycares. The purpose is to examine the impact of daycare exposures to disinfectants and cleaning products (DCP) on the respiratory health of workers and children. A sample of 108 randomly selected daycares in the region of Paris has been visited to collect settled dust to analyze semi-volatile organic compounds and microbiota, as well as sample indoor air to analyze aldehydes and volatile organic compounds. Innovative tools (smartphone applications) are used to scan DCP barcodes in daycare and inform their use; a database then matches the barcodes with the products' compositions. At baseline, workers/parents completed a standardized questionnaire, collecting information on DCP used at home, respiratory health, and potential confounders. Follow-up regarding children's respiratory health (monthly report through a smartphone application and biannual questionnaires) is ongoing until the end of 2023. Associations between DCP exposures and the respiratory health of workers/children will be evaluated. By identifying specific environments or DCP substances associated with the adverse respiratory health of workers and children, this longitudinal study will contribute to the improvement of preventive measures."

The genetics of this process remained unclear until 1991 when Gregg Semenza while studying erythropoietin, came upon hypoxia-inducible factor 1, for which he obtained the Nobel Prize in 2019. The same year, Yingming Zhao found protein lactylation, a posttranslational modification that can alter the function of hypoxia-inducible factor 1, the master regulator of cellular senescence, a pathology implicated in both post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). The genetic correlation between PTSD and CVD has been demonstrated by many studies, of which the most recent one utilizes large-scale genetics to estimate the risk factors for these conditions. This study focuses on the role of hypertension and dysfunctional interleukin 7 in PTSD and CVD, the former caused by stress-induced sympathetic arousal and elevated angiotensin II, while the latter links stress to premature endothelial cell senescence and early vascular aging. This review summarizes the recent developments and highlights several novel PTSD and CVD pharmacological targets. They include lactylation of histone and non-histone proteins, along with the related biomolecular actors such as hypoxia-inducible factor 1α, erythropoietin, acid-sensing ion channels, basigin, and Interleukin 7, as well as strategies to delay premature cellular senescence by telomere lengthening and resetting the epigenetic clock."
"37233716","Molecular Mechanisms of Western Diet-Induced Obesity and Obesity-Related Carcinogenesis-A Narrative Review.","Metabolites","The present study aims to provide a narrative review of the molecular mechanisms of Western diet-induced obesity and obesity-related carcinogenesis. A literature search of the Cochrane Library, Embase and Pubmed databases, Google Scholar and the grey literature was conducted. Most of the molecular mechanisms that induce obesity are also involved in the twelve Hallmarks of Cancer, with the fundamental process being the consumption of a highly processed, energy-dense diet and the deposition of fat in white adipose tissue and the liver. The generation of crown-like structures, with macrophages surrounding senescent or necrotic adipocytes or hepatocytes, leads to a perpetual state of chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, hyperinsulinaemia, aromatase activity, activation of oncogenic pathways and loss of normal homeostasis. Metabolic reprogramming, epithelial mesenchymal transition, HIF-1α signalling, angiogenesis and loss of normal host immune-surveillance are particularly important. Obesity-associated carcinogenesis is closely related to metabolic syndrome, hypoxia, visceral adipose tissue dysfunction, oestrogen synthesis and detrimental cytokine, adipokine and exosomal miRNA release. This is particularly important in the pathogenesis of oestrogen-sensitive cancers, including breast, endometrial, ovarian and thyroid cancer, but also 'non-hormonal' obesity-associated cancers such as cardio-oesophageal, colorectal, renal, pancreatic, gallbladder and hepatocellular adenocarcinoma. Effective weight loss interventions may improve the future incidence of overall and obesity-associated cancer."
"37239938","NOD-like Receptors-Emerging Links to Obesity and Associated Morbidities.","Int J Mol Sci","Obesity and its associated metabolic morbidities have been and still are on the rise, posing a major challenge to health care systems worldwide. It has become evident over the last decades that a low-grade inflammatory response, primarily proceeding from the adipose tissue (AT), essentially contributes to adiposity-associated comorbidities, most prominently insulin resistance (IR), atherosclerosis and liver diseases. In mouse models, the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin (IL)-1β and the imprinting of immune cells to a pro-inflammatory phenotype in AT play an important role. However, the underlying genetic and molecular determinants are not yet understood in detail. Recent evidence demonstrates that nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor (NLR) family proteins, a group of cytosolic pattern recognition receptors (PRR), contribute to the development and control of obesity and obesity-associated inflammatory responses. In this article, we review the current state of research on the role of NLR proteins in obesity and discuss the possible mechanisms leading to and the outcomes of NLR activation in the obesity-associated morbidities IR, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), atherosclerosis and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and discuss emerging ideas about possibilities for NLR-based therapeutic interventions of metabolic diseases."
"37239934","Assessing the Differential Methylation Analysis Quality for Microarray and NGS Platforms.","Int J Mol Sci","Differential methylation (DM) is actively recruited in different types of fundamental and translational studies. Currently, microarray- and NGS-based approaches for methylation analysis are the most widely used with multiple statistical models designed to extract differential methylation signatures. The benchmarking of DM models is challenging due to the absence of gold standard data. In this study, we analyze an extensive number of publicly available NGS and microarray datasets with divergent and widely utilized statistical models and apply the recently suggested and validated rank-statistic-based approach Hobotnica to evaluate the quality of their results. Overall, microarray-based methods demonstrate more robust and convergent results, while NGS-based models are highly dissimilar. Tests on the simulated NGS data tend to overestimate the quality of the DM methods and therefore are recommended for use with caution. Evaluation of the top 10 DMC and top 100 DMC in addition to the not-subset signature also shows more stable results for microarray data. Summing up, given the observed heterogeneity in NGS methylation data, the evaluation of newly generated methylation signatures is a crucial step in DM analysis. The Hobotnica metric is coordinated with previously developed quality metrics and provides a robust, sensitive, and informative estimation of methods' performance and DM signatures' quality in the absence of gold standard data solving a long-existing problem in DM analysis."
"37239728","Support Provided by Caregivers for Community-Dwelling Obesity Individuals: Focus on Elderly and Hispanics.","Healthcare (Basel)","Obesity is a chronic disease marked by the buildup of extra adipose tissue and a higher chance of developing concomitant illnesses such as heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, and some malignancies. Over the past few decades, there has been a global increase in the prevalence of obesity, which now affects around one-third of the world's population. According to recent studies, a variety of factors, including genetics and biology as well as environmental, physiological, and psychosocial factors, may have a role in the development of obesity. The prevalence of obesity is often higher among Hispanic American groups than among White people in the U.S. Obesity is a widespread condition with a high risk of morbidity and death, and it is well-recognized that the prevalence of comorbidities rises with rising levels of obesity or body mass index. To combat the rising prevalence of obesity in the USA, especially among Hispanics, one of the fastest-growing racial/ethnic groups in the country, there is an urgent need for obesity therapies. The exact cause of this disparity is unclear, but some responsible factors are a lack of education, high unemployment rates, high levels of food insecurity, an unhealthy diet, inadequate access to physical activity resources, a lack of health insurance, and constricted access to culturally adequate healthcare. Additionally, managing obesity and giving needed/timely support to obese people is a difficult responsibility for medical professionals and their loved ones. The need for caregivers is increasing with the increased number of individuals with obesity, particularly Hispanics. Our article summarizes the status of obesity, focusing on Hispanic populations, and we also highlight specific factors that contribute to obesity, including genetics, epigenetics, biological, physiological, and psychosocial factors, medication and disease, environment, and socio-demographics.

EHMTs 1 and 2 (euchromatic histone lysine methyltransferases 1 and 2), also known as the G9a-like protein (GLP) and G9a, respectively, catalyze the mono- and di-methylation of histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9) and also methylate nonhistone substrates; in addition, they can act as transcriptional coactivators independent of their methyltransferase activity. These enzymes are known to contribute to adipocyte development and function, and in vivo data indicate a role for G9a and GLP in metabolic disease states; however, the mechanisms involved in the cell-autonomous functions of G9a and GLP in adipocytes are largely unknown. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) is a proinflammatory cytokine typically induced in adipose tissue in conditions of insulin resistance and Type 2 diabetes. Using an siRNA approach, we have determined that the loss of G9a and GLP enhances TNFα-induced lipolysis and inflammatory gene expression in adipocytes. Furthermore, we show that G9a and GLP are present in a protein complex with nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) in TNFα-treated adipocytes. These novel observations provide mechanistic insights into the association between adipocyte G9a and GLP expression and systemic metabolic health."

Notably, reverse phase protein array analysis (RPPA) demonstrated increased phosphorylated GAB1 (Y627), SRC (Y527), BCL2 (S70) and RAF (S338) protein expression in STS compared to LTS. Next, we identified 25 unique master regulators (MR) and 13 transcription factors (TFs) belonging to ontologies of integrin signalling and cell cycle to be upregulated in STS.Overall, comparison of STS and LTS GBM patients, identifies novel biomarkers and potential actionable therapeutic targets for the management of GBM.© 2023.

Here we utilized DepMap, a cancer gene dependency screen, to demonstrate that machine learning combined with network biology can produce robust algorithms that both predict what genes a cancer is dependent on and what network features coordinate such gene dependencies. Using network topology and biological annotations, we constructed four groups of novel engineered machine learning features that produced high accuracies when predicting binary gene dependencies. We found that in all examined cancer types, F1 scores were greater than 0.90, and model accuracy remained robust under multiple hyperparameter tests. We then deconstructed these models to identify tumor type-specific coordinators of gene dependency and identified that in certain cancers, such as thyroid and kidney, tumors' dependencies are highly predicted by gene connectivity. In contrast, other histologies relied on pathway-based features such as lung, where gene dependencies were highly predictive by associations with cell death pathway genes. In sum, we show that biologically informed network features can be a valuable and robust addition to predictive pharmacology models while simultaneously providing mechanistic insights."

However, their expression profiles and prognostic significance in adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remain unknown.The online databases, including HPA, CCLE, EMBL-EBI, GEPIA2, BloodSpot, GENT2, UCSCXenaShiny, GSCALite, cBioportal, and GenomicScape, utilized the data of TCGA and GEO to investigate gene expression, mutation, copy number variation (CNV), and prognostic significance of the TSC22D domain family in adult AML. Computational analysis of resistance (CARE) was used to explore the effect of TSC22D3 expression on drug response. Functional enrichment analysis of TSC22D3 was performed in the TRRUST Version 2 database. The STRING, Pathway Commons, and AnimalTFDB3.0 databases were used to investigate the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of TSC22D3. Harmonizome was used to predict target genes and kinases regulated by TSC22D3. The StarBase v2.0 and CancermiRNome databases were used to predict miRNAs regulated by TSC22D3. UCSCXenaShiny was used to investigate the correlation between TSC22D3 expression and immune infiltration.Compared with normal adult hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), the expression of TSC22D3 and TSC22D4 in adult AML tissues was markedly up-regulated, whereas TSC22D1 expression was markedly down-regulated. The expression of TSC22D1 and TSC22D3 was significantly increased in adult AML tissues compared to normal adult tissues. High TSC22D3 expression was significantly associated with poor overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) in adult AML patients. Univariate and multivariate Cox analysis showed that overexpression of TSC22D3 was independently associated with adverse OS of adult AML patients. High TSC22D3 expression had a adverse impact on OS and EFS of adult AML patients in the chemotherapy group. TSC22D3 expression correlated with drug resistance to BCL2 inhibitors. Functional enrichment analysis indicated that TSC22D3 might promote AML progression. MIR143-3p sponging TSC22D3 might have anti-leukemia effect in adult AML.A significant increase in TSC22D3 expression was observed in adult AML tissues compared to normal adult HSCs and tissues. The prognosis of adult AML patients with high TSC22D3 expression was unfavorable, which could severe as a new prognostic biomarker and potential target for adult AML.© 2023. The Author(s)."

For example, inhibiting metastasis activator BACH1 is proposed to decrease cancer metastases. Testing such assumptions requires approaches to measure disease phenotypes while precisely adjusting disease-promoting protein levels. Here we developed a two-step strategy to integrate protein-level tuning, noise-aware synthetic gene circuits into a well-defined human genomic safe harbor locus. Unexpectedly, engineered MDA-MB-231 metastatic human breast cancer cells become more, then less and then more invasive as we tune BACH1 levels up, irrespective of the native BACH1. BACH1 expression shifts in invading cells, and expression of BACH1's transcriptional targets confirm BACH1's nonmonotone phenotypic and regulatory effects. Thus, chemical inhibition of BACH1 could have unwanted effects on invasion. Additionally, BACH1's expression variability aids invasion at high BACH1 expression. Overall, precisely engineered, noise-aware protein-level control is necessary and important to unravel disease effects of genes to improve clinical drug efficacy.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37226094","Drug mechanism enrichment analysis improves prioritization of therapeutics for repurposing.","BMC Bioinformatics","There is a pressing need for improved methods to identify effective therapeutics for diseases. Many computational approaches have been developed to repurpose existing drugs to meet this need. However, these tools often output long lists of candidate drugs that are difficult to interpret, and individual drug candidates may suffer from unknown off-target effects. We reasoned that an approach which aggregates information from multiple drugs that share a common mechanism of action (MOA) would increase on-target signal compared to evaluating drugs on an individual basis. In this study, we present drug mechanism enrichment analysis (DMEA), an adaptation of gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), which groups drugs with shared MOAs to improve the prioritization of drug repurposing candidates.First, we tested DMEA on simulated data and showed that it can sensitively and robustly identify an enriched drug MOA. Next, we used DMEA on three types of rank-ordered drug lists: (1) perturbagen signatures based on gene expression data, (2) drug sensitivity scores based on high-throughput cancer cell line screening, and (3) molecular classification scores of intrinsic and acquired drug resistance. In each case, DMEA detected the expected MOA as well as other relevant MOAs. Furthermore, the rankings of MOAs generated by DMEA were better than the original single-drug rankings in all tested data sets. Finally, in a drug discovery experiment, we identified potential senescence-inducing and senolytic drug MOAs for primary human mammary epithelial cells and then experimentally validated the senolytic effects of EGFR inhibitors.DMEA is a versatile bioinformatic tool that can improve the prioritization of candidates for drug repurposing. By grouping drugs with a shared MOA, DMEA increases on-target signal and reduces off-target effects compared to analysis of individual drugs.

We describeIsoform peptides fromRNA splicing forImmunotherapy targetScreening (IRIS), a computational platform capable of discovering AS-derived tumor antigens (TAs) for T cell receptor (TCR) and chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapies. IRIS leverages large-scale tumor and normal transcriptome data and incorporates multiple screening approaches to discover AS-derived TAs with tumor-associated or tumor-specific expression. In a proof-of-concept analysis integrating transcriptomics and immunopeptidomics data, we showed that hundreds of IRIS-predicted TCR targets are presented by human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules. We applied IRIS to RNA-seq data of neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC). From 2,939 NEPC-associated AS events, IRIS predicted 1,651 epitopes from 808 events as potential TCR targets for two common HLA types (A*02:01 and A*03:01). A more stringent screening test prioritized 48 epitopes from 20 events with ""neoantigen-like"" NEPC-specific expression. Predicted epitopes are often encoded by microexons of ≤30 nucleotides. To validate the immunogenicity and T cell recognition of IRIS-predicted TCR epitopes, we performed in vitro T cell priming in combination with single-cell TCR sequencing. Seven TCRs transduced into human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) showed high activity against individual IRIS-predicted epitopes, providing strong evidence of isolated TCRs reactive to AS-derived peptides. One selected TCR showed efficient cytotoxicity against target cells expressing the target peptide. Our study illustrates the contribution of AS to the TA repertoire of cancer cells and demonstrates the utility of IRIS for discovering AS-derived TAs and expanding cancer immunotherapies."

Most of these studies have been significantly limited in scope by focusing predominantly on individual diseases or restricted to GWAS analysis. Using two large patient populations derived from Vanderbilt University and Marshfield Clinic biobanks linked to genomic and phenomic data from medical records, we investigated the inter-relationship between LTL, genomics, and human health. Our GWAS confirmed 11 genetic loci previously associated with LTL and two novel loci inSCNN1DandPITPNM1. PheWAS of LTL identified 67 distinct clinical phenotypes associated with both short and long LTL. We demonstrated that several diseases associated with LTL were related to one another but were largely independent from LTL genetics. Age of death was correlated with LTL independent of age. Those with very short LTL (<-1.5 standard deviation [SD]) died 10.4 years (p < 0.0001) younger than those with average LTL (±0.5 SD; mean age of death = 74.2 years). Likewise, those with very long LTL (>1.5 SD) died 1.9 years (p = 0.0175) younger than those with average LTL. This is consistent with the PheWAS results showing diseases associating with both short and long LTL. Finally, we estimated that the genome (12.8%) and age (8.5%) explain the largest proportion of LTL variance, whereas the phenome (1.5%) and sex (0.9%) explained a smaller fraction. In total, 23.7% of LTL variance was explained. These observations provide the rationale for expanded research to understand the multifaceted correlations between TL biology and human health over time, leading to effective LTL usage in medical applications.© 2023 The Authors."

We report 413,758 site-specific SVs affecting 13% (356 Mbp) of the mouse reference assembly, including 510 previously unannotated coding variants. We substantially improve theMus musculustransposable element (TE) callset, and we find that TEs comprise 39% of SVs and account for 75% of altered bases. We further utilize this callset to investigate how TE heterogeneity affects mouse embryonic stem cells and find multiple TE classes that influence chromatin accessibility. Our work provides a comprehensive analysis of SVs found in diverse mouse genomes and illustrates the role of TEs in epigenetic differences.© 2023 The Author(s)."

Some of these factors are required for L1 amplification, while others either suppress or enhance specific steps during L1 propagation. Previously, TRIM28 has been identified to suppress transposable elements, including L1 expression via its canonical role in chromatin remodeling. Here, we report that TRIM28 through its B box domain increases L1 retrotransposition and facilitates shorter cDNA and L1 insert generation in cultured cells. Consistent with the latter, we observe that tumor specific L1 inserts are shorter in endometrial, ovarian, and prostate tumors with higher TRIM28 mRNA expression than in those with lower TRIM28 expression. We determine that three amino acids in the B box domain that are involved in TRIM28 multimerization are critical for its effect on both L1 retrotransposition and cDNA synthesis. We provide evidence that B boxes from the other two members in the Class VI TRIM proteins, TRIM24 and TRIM33, also increase L1 retrotransposition. Our findings could lead to a better understanding of the host/L1 evolutionary arms race in the germline and their interplay during tumorigenesis.© The Author(s) 2023.

"37248389","SIMBA: single-cell embedding along with features.","Nat Methods","Most current single-cell analysis pipelines are limited to cell embeddings and rely heavily on clustering, while lacking the ability to explicitly model interactions between different feature types. Furthermore, these methods are tailored to specific tasks, as distinct single-cell problems are formulated differently. To address these shortcomings, here we present SIMBA, a graph embedding method that jointly embeds single cells and their defining features, such as genes, chromatin-accessible regions and DNA sequences, into a common latent space. By leveraging the co-embedding of cells and features, SIMBA allows for the study of cellular heterogeneity, clustering-free marker discovery, gene regulation inference, batch effect removal and omics data integration. We show that SIMBA provides a single framework that allows diverse single-cell problems to be formulated in a unified way and thus simplifies the development of new analyses and extension to new single-cell modalities. SIMBA is implemented as a comprehensive Python library ( https://simba-bio.readthedocs.io ).© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37244909","Inference of cell type-specific gene regulatory networks on cell lineages from single cell omic datasets.","Nat Commun","Cell type-specific gene expression patterns are outputs of transcriptional gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that connect transcription factors and signaling proteins to target genes. Single-cell technologies such as single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single cell Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (scATAC-seq), can examine cell-type specific gene regulation at unprecedented detail. However, current approaches to infer cell type-specific GRNs are limited in their ability to integrate scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq measurements and to model network dynamics on a cell lineage. To address this challenge, we have developed single-cell Multi-Task Network Inference (scMTNI), a multi-task learning framework to infer the GRN for each cell type on a lineage from scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data. Using simulated and real datasets, we show that scMTNI is a broadly applicable framework for linear and branching lineages that accurately infers GRN dynamics and identifies key regulators of fate transitions for diverse processes such as cellular reprogramming and differentiation.© 2023.

However, most reference datasets are constructed from single-cell RNA-sequencing data and cannot be used to annotate datasets that do not measure gene expression. Here we introduce 'bridge integration', a method to integrate single-cell datasets across modalities using a multiomic dataset as a molecular bridge. Each cell in the multiomic dataset constitutes an element in a 'dictionary', which is used to reconstruct unimodal datasets and transform them into a shared space. Our procedure accurately integrates transcriptomic data with independent single-cell measurements of chromatin accessibility, histone modifications, DNA methylation and protein levels. Moreover, we demonstrate how dictionary learning can be combined with sketching techniques to improve computational scalability and harmonize 8.6 million human immune cell profiles from sequencing and mass cytometry experiments. Our approach, implemented in version 5 of our Seurat toolkit ( http://www.satijalab.org/seurat ), broadens the utility of single-cell reference datasets and facilitates comparisons across diverse molecular modalities.© 2023.

"37205545","scDisInFact: disentangled learning for integration and prediction of multi-batch multi-condition single-cell RNA-sequencing data.","bioRxiv","Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) has been widely used for disease studies, where sample batches are collected from donors under different conditions including demographical groups, disease stages, and drug treatments. It is worth noting that the differences among sample batches in such a study are a mixture of technical confounders caused by batch effect and the biological variations caused by condition effect. However, current batch effect removal methods often eliminate both technical batch effects and meaningful condition effects, while perturbation prediction methods solely focus on condition effects, resulting in inaccurate gene expression predictions due to unaccounted batch effects. Here we introduce scDisInFact, a deep learning framework that models both batch effect and condition effect in scRNA-seq data. scDisInFact learns latent factors that disentangle condition effects from batch effects, enabling it to simultaneously perform three tasks: batch effect removal, condition-associated key gene detection, and perturbation prediction. We evaluated scDisInFact on both simulated and real datasets, and compared its performance to baseline methods for each task. Our results demonstrate that scDisInFact outperforms existing methods that focus on individual tasks, providing a more comprehensive and accurate approach for integrating and predicting multi-batch multi-condition single-cell RNA-sequencing data."
"37205427","CLCLSA: Cross-omics Linked embedding with Contrastive Learning and Self Attention for multi-omics integration with incomplete multi-omics data.","Res Sq","Integration of heterogeneous and high-dimensional multi-omics data is becoming increasingly important in understanding genetic data. Each omics technique only provides a limited view of the underlying biological process and integrating heterogeneous omics layers simultaneously would lead to a more comprehensive and detailed understanding of diseases and phenotypes. However, one obstacle faced when performing multi-omics data integration is the existence of unpaired multi-omics data due to instrument sensitivity and cost. Studies may fail if certain aspects of the subjects are missing or incomplete. In this paper, we propose a deep learning method for multi-omics integration with incomplete data by Cross-omics Linked unified embedding with Contrastive Learning and Self Attention (CLCLSA). Utilizing complete multi-omics data as supervision, the model employs cross-omics autoencoders to learn the feature representation across different types of biological data. The multi-omics contrastive learning, which is used to maximize the mutual information between different types of omics, is employed before latent feature concatenation. In addition, the feature-level self-attention and omics-level self-attention are employed to dynamically identify the most informative features for multi-omics data integration. Extensive experiments were conducted on four public multi-omics datasets. The experimental results indicated that the proposed CLCLSA outperformed the state-of-the-art approaches for multi-omics data classification using incomplete multiomics data."

We analyzed the semen parameters of 61 cycles in infertile couples undergoing IVF-ET and ICSI and determined DFI by sperm chromatin dispersion testing. Based on DFI, the patients were differentiated into a control group (DFI < 25%,n= 35) and a test group (DFI ≥ 25%,n= 26). Flow cytometry and immunofluorescence were used to investigate the extent of sperm reactive oxygen species (ROS) and apoptosis. We also investigated the effect of DFI on pregnancy outcomes of IVF-ET/ICSI. DFI was negatively related to sperm motility and positively correlated with ROS and apoptosis (P< 0.05). Abnormally elevated DFI reduced the rate of transplantable, high-quality embryos, implantation, clinical pregnancy, delivery, and live birth after IVF-ET, and increased the chance of early abortion per transfer cycle (P< 0.05). However, there was no significant correlation between DFI and fertilization rate, cleavage rate, transplantable rate, high-quality embryo rate, implantation rate, clinical pregnancy rate, early abortion rate, delivery rate and live birth rate when assisted by ICSI (P> 0.05). Sperm DNA integrity is crucial for fertilization and the development of healthy offspring. ROS may increase the level of DFI by inducing apoptosis in sperm.© 2023 the author(s), published by De Gruyter."

Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a class of closed-loop structures that can be stably expressedin vivo. In our experiments, rats exposed to PM2.5exhibited autism-like phenotypes, such as anxiety, and memory loss. To explore the etiology, we performed transcriptome sequencing and found significant differences in the expression of circRNA. A total of 7770 circRNAs were identified between the control and experimental groups, 18 of which were differentially expressed, we selected ten circRNAs and performed qRT-PCR and Sanger sequencing to validate them. By GO and KEGG enrichment analysis, we found differentially expressed circRNAs that were mainly enriched in processes related to placental development and reproduction. Finally, using bioinformatics, we predicted miRNAs and mRNAs that circ-Mbd5 and circ-Ash1l might regulate and constructed circRNA-miRNA-mRNA networks involving genes associated with ASD, suggesting that circRNAs might regulate the occurrence of ASD.Copyright © 2023 Xie, Li, Liang, Tian, Lin, Yan, Shi, Liu and Xi."

However, the expression profile, epigenetic modification, prognostic value, transcription regulation, and molecular mechanism of ZSCAN18 in breast cancer (BC) remain unknown.In the study, we present an integrated analysis of ZSCAN18 in BC based on public omics datasets with the use of multiple bioinformatics tools. Genes potentially regulated through restoration of ZSCAN18 expression in MDA-MB-231 cells were investigated to identify pathways associated with BC.We observed that ZSCAN18 was downregulated in BC and mRNA expression was significantly correlated with clinicopathological parameters. Low expression of ZSCAN18 was found in the HER2-positive and TNBC subtypes. High expression of ZSCAN18 was associated with good prognosis. As compared to normal tissues, the extent of ZSCAN18 DNA methylation was greater with fewer genetic alterations in BC tissues. ZSCAN18 was identified as a transcription factor that might be involved in intracellular molecular and metabolic processes. Low ZSCAN18 expression was associated with the cell cycle and glycolysis signaling pathway. Overexpression of ZSCAN18 inhibited mRNA expression of genes associated with the Wnt/β-catenin and glycolysis signaling pathways, including CTNNB1, BCL9, TSC1, and PFKP. ZSCAN18 expression was negatively correlated with infiltrating B cells and dendritic cells (DCs), as determined by the TIMER web server and reference to the TISIDB. ZSCAN18 DNA methylation was positively correlated with activated B cells, activated CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and activated DCs. Moreover, five ZSCAN18-related hub genes (KDM6B, KAT6A, KMT2D, KDM1A, and HSPBP1) were identified. ZSCAN18, ZNF396, and PGBD1 were identified as components of a physical complex.ZSCAN18 is a potential tumor suppressor in BC, as expression is modified by DNA methylation and associated with patient survival.

"37237005","Multimodal single cell analysis infers widespread enhancer co-activity in a lymphoblastoid cell line.","Commun Biol","Non-coding regulatory elements such as enhancers are key in controlling the cell-type specificity and spatio-temporal expression of genes. To drive stable and precise gene transcription robust to genetic variation and environmental stress, genes are often targeted by multiple enhancers with redundant action. However, it is unknown whether enhancers targeting the same gene display simultaneous activity or whether some enhancer combinations are more often co-active than others. Here, we take advantage of recent developments in single cell technology that permit assessing chromatin status (scATAC-seq) and gene expression (scRNA-seq) in the same single cells to correlate gene expression to the activity of multiple enhancers. Measuring activity patterns across 24,844 human lymphoblastoid single cells, we find that the majority of enhancers associated with the same gene display significant correlation in their chromatin profiles. For 6944 expressed genes associated with enhancers, we predict 89,885 significant enhancer-enhancer associations between nearby enhancers. We find that associated enhancers share similar transcription factor binding profiles and that gene essentiality is linked with higher enhancer co-activity. We provide a set of predicted enhancer-enhancer associations based on correlation derived from a single cell line, which can be further investigated for functional relevance.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Nucleosome structures are formed by the combination of histone octamers and genomic DNA. Through a systematic and precise process of folding and compression, these structures form a 30-nm chromatin fibre that is further organized within the nucleus in a hierarchical manner, known as the 3D genome. Understanding the intricacies of chromatin structure and the regulatory mode governing chromatin interactions is essential for unravelling the complexities of cellular architecture and function, particularly in relation to cell fate determination, regeneration, and the development of diseases. Here, we provide a general overview of the hierarchical structure of chromatin as well as of the evolution of chromatin conformation capture techniques.

Currently, overcoming the drug resistance in HCC is a critical challenge and ferroptosis has emerged as a promising therapeutic option for cancer. We aim to construct a new gene signature related to ferroptosis and drug resistance to predict the prognosis in HCC. The RNA-seq data of HCC patients was obtained from the Cancer Genome Atlas database. Using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator cox regression, Kaplan-Meier analysis, and differential analysis, we constructed a prognostic model consisting of six hub genes (TOP2A, BIRC5, VEGFA, HIF1A, FTH1, ACSL3) related to ferroptosis and drug resistance in HCC. Functional enrichment, pathway enrichment and GSEA analysis were performed to investigate the potential molecular mechanism, and construction of PPI, mRNA-miRNA, mRNA-RBP, mRNA-TF and mRNA-drugs interaction networks to predict its interaction with different molecules. Clinical prognostic characteristics were revealed by univariate, multivariate cox regression analysis and nomogram. We also analyzed the relationship between the signature, immune checkpoints, and drug sensitivity. The expression of the gene signature was detected in HCC cell lines and HPA database. Our prognostic model classified patients into high and low-risk groups based on the risk scores and found the expression level of the genes was higher in the high-risk group than the low-risk group, demonstrating that high expression of the hub genes was associated with poor prognosis in HCC. ROC analysis revealed its high diagnostic efficacy in both HCC and normal tissues. The proportional hazards model and calibration analysis confirmed that the model's prediction was most accurate for 1- and 3-years survival. QRT-PCR showed the high expression level of the gene signature in HCC. Our study built a novel gene signature with good potential to predict the prognosis of HCC, which may provide new therapeutic targets and molecular mechanism for HCC diagnosis and treatment.© 2023.

In this study, Plasminogen activator, urokinase receptor (PLAUR) was identified as an effective diagnostic marker for AS lesion progression by combining WGCNA and random forest algorithm. We validated the stability of the diagnostic value on multiple external datasets including humans and mice. We identified a significant correlation between PLAUR expression and lesion progression. We mined multiple single cell-RNA sequencing (sc-RNA seq) data to nominate macrophage as the key cell cluster for PLAUR mediated lesion progression. We combined cross-validation results from multiple databases to predict that HCG17-hsa-miR-424-5p-HIF1A, a competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network, may regulate hypoxia inducible factor 1 subunit alpha (HIF1A) expression. The DrugMatrix database was used to predict alprazolam, valsartan, biotin A, lignocaine, and curcumin as potential drugs to delay lesion progression by antagonizing PLAUR, and AutoDock was used to verify the binding ability of drugs and PLAUR. Overall, this study provides the first systematic identification of the diagnostic and therapeutic value of PLAUR in AS and offers multiple treatment options with potential applications.© 2023.

This study aimed to develop a novel risk classifier to predict the in-hospital death risk of nosocomial infections in this population.Retrospective clinical data were collected from a National Cancer Regional Center in Northwest China. The Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) algorithm was utilized to filter the optimal variables for model development and avoid model overfitting. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the independent predictors of the in-hospital death risk. A nomogram was then developed to predict the in-hospital death risk of each participant. The performance of the nomogram was evaluated using receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve, calibration curve, and decision curve analysis (DCA).A total of 569 elderly cancer patients were included in this study, and the estimated in-hospital mortality rate was 13.9%. The results of multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that ECOG-PS (odds ratio [OR]: 4.41, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.95-9.99), surgery type (OR: 0.18, 95%CI: 0.04-0.85), septic shock (OR: 5.92, 95%CI: 2.43-14.44), length of antibiotics treatment (OR: 0.21, 95%CI: 0.09-0.50), and prognostic nutritional index (PNI) (OR: 0.14, 95%CI: 0.06-0.33) were independent predictors of the in-hospital death risk of nosocomial infections in elderly cancer patients.

These ICD-related DEGs were closely associated with inflammation and immune activity. Afterward, CASP1, CD4, and EIF2AK3 among the 14 DEGs were selected as feature genes based on LASSO, Random Forest, and SVM-RFE algorithms, which had reliable diagnostic abilities. Moreover, functional enrichment analysis indicated that these feature genes may have a potential role in COVID-19 by being involved in the regulation of immune response and metabolism. Further CIBERSORT analysis demonstrated that the variations in the immune microenvironment of COVID-19 patients may be correlated with CASP1, CD4, and EIF2AK3.

"37240063","Evolution of Resistance to Irinotecan in Cancer Cells Involves Generation of Topoisomerase-Guided Mutations in Non-Coding Genome That Reduce the Chances of DNA Breaks.","Int J Mol Sci","Resistance to chemotherapy is a leading cause of treatment failure. Drug resistance mechanisms involve mutations in specific proteins or changes in their expression levels. It is commonly understood that resistance mutations happen randomly prior to treatment and are selected during the treatment. However, the selection of drug-resistant mutants in culture could be achieved by multiple drug exposures of cloned genetically identical cells and thus cannot result from the selection of pre-existent mutations. Accordingly, adaptation must involve the generation of mutations de novo upon drug treatment. Here we explored the origin of resistance mutations to a widely used Top1 inhibitor, irinotecan, which triggers DNA breaks, causing cytotoxicity. The resistance mechanism involved the gradual accumulation of recurrent mutations in non-coding regions of DNA at Top1-cleavage sites. Surprisingly, cancer cells had a higher number of such sites than the reference genome, which may define their increased sensitivity to irinotecan. Homologous recombination repairs of DNA double-strand breaks at these sites following initial drug exposures gradually reverted cleavage-sensitive ""cancer"" sequences back to cleavage-resistant ""normal"" sequences. These mutations reduced the generation of DNA breaks upon subsequent exposures, thus gradually increasing drug resistance. Together, large target sizes for mutations and their Top1-guided generation lead to their gradual and rapid accumulation, synergistically accelerating the development of resistance."

Accumulating evidences indicate that a significant fraction of genetic alterations, including structural variants (SVs), can cause human disease by altering the function of non-coding regulatory elements, such as enhancers. In the case of SVs, described pathomechanisms include changes in enhancer dosage and long-range enhancer-gene communication. However, there is still a clear gap between the need to predict and interpret the medical impact of non-coding variants, and the existence of tools to properly perform these tasks. To reduce this gap, we have developed POSTRE (Prediction Of STRuctural variant Effects), a computational tool to predict the pathogenicity of SVs implicated in a broad range of human congenital disorders. By considering disease-relevant cellular contexts, POSTRE identifies SVs with either coding or long-range pathological consequences with high specificity and sensitivity.

An asymptomatic mild to moderate iodine deficiency and/or isolated maternal hypothyroxinemia might affect the development of the embryonal/fetal brain. There is sufficient evidence underlining the importance of an adequate iodine supply for all women of childbearing age in order to prevent negative mental and social consequences for their children. An additional threat to the thyroid hormone system is the ubiquitous exposure to endocrine disrupters, which might exacerbate the effects of iodine deficiency in pregnant women on the neurocognitive development of their offspring. Ensuring adequate iodine intake is therefore essential not only for healthy fetal and neonatal development in general, but it might also extenuate the effects of endocrine disruptors. Individual iodine supplementation of women of childbearing age living in areas with mild to moderate iodine deficiency is mandatory as long as worldwide universal salt iodization does not guarantee an adequate iodine supply. There is an urgent need for detailed strategies to identify and reduce exposure to endocrine disrupters according to the ""precautional principle""."

Identifying targetable epigenetic mechanisms of self-renewal could therefore represent an important step toward developing effective treatments for this universally lethal cancer. Here we uncover an epigenetic axis of self-renewal mediated by the histone variant macroH2A2. With omics and functional assays deploying patient-derived in vitro and in vivo models, we show that macroH2A2 shapes chromatin accessibility at enhancer elements to antagonize transcriptional programs of self-renewal. macroH2A2 also sensitizes cells to small molecule-mediated cell death via activation of a viral mimicry response. Consistent with these results, our analyses of clinical cohorts indicate that high transcriptional levels of this histone variant are associated with better prognosis of high-grade glioma patients. Our results reveal a targetable epigenetic mechanism of self-renewal controlled by macroH2A2 and suggest additional treatment approaches for glioblastoma patients.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37240957","Epigenetic Signatures in Hypertension.","J Pers Med","Clear epigenetic signatures were found in hypertensive and pre-hypertensive patients using DNA methylation data and neural networks in a classification algorithm. It is shown how by selecting an appropriate subset of CpGs it is possible to achieve a mean accuracy classification of 86% for distinguishing control and hypertensive (and pre-hypertensive) patients using only 2239 CpGs. Furthermore, it is also possible to obtain a statistically comparable model achieving an 83% mean accuracy using only 22 CpGs. Both of these approaches represent a substantial improvement over using the entire amount of available CpGs, which resulted in the neural network not generating accurate classifications. An optimization approach is followed to select the CpGs to be used as the base for a model distinguishing between hypertensive and pre-hypertensive individuals. It is shown that it is possible to find methylation signatures using machine learning techniques, which can be applied to distinguish between control (healthy) individuals, pre-hypertensive individuals and hypertensive individuals, illustrating an associated epigenetic impact. Identifying epigenetic signatures might lead to more targeted treatments for patients in the future."
"37146365","Functional bioengineered tissue models of neurodegenerative diseases.","Biomaterials","Aging-associated neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases remain poorly understood and no disease-modifying treatments exist despite decades of investigation. Predominant in vitro (e.g., 2D cell culture, organoids) and in vivo (e.g., mouse) models of these diseases are insufficient mimics of human brain tissue structure and function and of human neurodegenerative pathobiology, and have thus contributed to this collective translational failure. This has been a longstanding challenge in the field, and new strategies are required to address both fundamental and translational needs. Bioengineered tissue culture models constitute a class of promising alternatives, as they can overcome the low cell density, poor nutrient exchange, and long term culturability limitations of existing in vitro models. Further, they can reconstruct the structural, mechanical, and biochemical cues of native brain tissue, providing a better mimic of human brain tissues for in vitro pathobiological investigation and drug development. We discuss bioengineering techniques for the generation of these neurodegenerative tissue models, including biomaterials-, organoid-, and microfluidics-based approaches, and design considerations for their construction. To aid the development of the next generation of functional neurodegenerative disease models, we discuss approaches to incorporate greater cellular diversity and simulate aging processes within bioengineered brain tissues.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

"37231234","Precision medicine and the problem of structural injustice.","Med Health Care Philos","Many countries currently invest in technologies and data infrastructures to foster precision medicine (PM), which is hoped to better tailor disease treatment and prevention to individual patients. But who can expect to benefit from PM? The answer depends not only on scientific developments but also on the willingness to address the problem of structural injustice. One important step is to confront the problem of underrepresentation of certain populations in PM cohorts via improved research inclusivity. Yet, we argue that the perspective needs to be broadened because the (in)equitable effects of PM are also strongly contingent on wider structural factors and prioritization of healthcare strategies and resources. When (and before) implementing PM, it is crucial to attend to how the organisation of healthcare systems influences who will benefit, as well as whether PM may present challenges for a solidaristic sharing of costs and risks. We discuss these issues through a comparative lens of healthcare models and PM-initiatives in the United States, Austria, and Denmark. The analysis draws attention to how PM hinges on-and simultaneously affects-access to healthcare services, public trust in data handling, and prioritization of healthcare resources. Finally, we provide suggestions for how to mitigate foreseeable negative effects.© 2023. The Author(s)."

To date, underlying molecular mechanisms of PSC remain unclear, and therapeutic options are limited.We performed cell-free messenger RNA (cf-mRNA) sequencing to characterize the circulating transcriptome of PSC and noninvasively investigate potentially bioactive signals that are associated with PSC. Serum cf-mRNA profiles were compared among 50 individuals with PSC, 20 healthy controls, and 235 individuals with NAFLD. Tissue and cell type-of-origin genes that are dysregulated in subjects with PSC were evaluated. Subsequently, diagnostic classifiers were developed using PSC dysregulated cf-mRNA genes.Differential expression analysis of the cf-mRNA transcriptomes of PSC and healthy controls resulted in identification of 1407 dysregulated genes. Furthermore, differentially expressed genes between PSC and healthy controls or NAFLD shared common genes known to be involved in liver pathophysiology. In particular, genes from liver- and specific cell type-origin, including hepatocyte, HSCs, and KCs, were highly abundant in cf-mRNA of subjects with PSC. Gene cluster analysis revealed that liver-specific genes dysregulated in PSC form a distinct cluster, which corresponded to a subset of the PSC subject population. Finally, we developed a cf-mRNA diagnostic classifier using liver-specific genes that discriminated PSC from healthy control subjects using gene transcripts of liver origin.Blood-based whole-transcriptome cf-mRNA profiling revealed high abundance of liver-specific genes in sera of subjects with PSC, which may be used to diagnose patients with PSC. We identified several unique cf-mRNA profiles of subjects with PSC. These findings may also have utility for noninvasive molecular stratification of subjects with PSC for pharmacotherapy safety and response studies.Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).

"37240090",NA,NA,"Changes in protein glycosylation are associated with most biological processes, and the importance of glycomic analysis in the research of disorders is constantly increasing, including in the neurodevelopmental field. We glycoprofiled sera in 10 children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and 10 matching healthy controls for 3 types of samples: whole serum, sera after depletion of abundant proteins (albumin and IgG), and isolated IgG. The analytical methods used were a lectin-based glycoprotein microarray enabling high-throughput glycan analysis and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) as a standard method for the identification of glycan structures. For microarray analysis, the samples printed on microarray slides were incubated with biotinylated lectins and detected using the fluorescent conjugate of streptavidin by a microarray scanner. In the ADHD patient samples, we found increased antennary fucosylation, decreased di-/triantennary N-glycans with bisecting N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), and decreased α2-3 sialylation. The results obtained by both independent methods were consistent. The study's sample size and design do not allow far-reaching conclusions to be drawn. In any case, there is a strong demand for a better and more comprehensive diagnosis of ADHD, and the obtained results emphasize that the presented approach brings new horizons to studying functional associations of glycan alterations in ADHD."
"37248507","Experimental hepatic encephalopathy causes early but sustained glial transcriptional changes.","J Neuroinflammation","Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a common complication of liver cirrhosis, associated with high morbidity and mortality, for which no brain-targeted therapies exist at present. The interplay between hyperammonemia and inflammation is thought to drive HE development. As such, astrocytes, the most important ammonia-metabolizing cells in the brain, and microglia, the main immunomodulatory cells in the brain, have been heavily implicated in HE development. As insight into cellular perturbations driving brain pathology remains largely elusive, we aimed to investigate cell-type specific transcriptomic changes in the HE brain. In the recently established mouse bile duct ligation (BDL) model of HE, we performed RNA-Seq of sorted astrocytes and microglia at 14 and 28 days after induction. This revealed a marked transcriptional response in both cell types which was most pronounced in microglia. In both cell types, pathways related to inflammation and hypoxia, mechanisms commonly implicated in HE, were enriched. Additionally, astrocytes exhibited increased corticoid receptor and oxidative stress signaling, whereas microglial transcriptome changes were linked to immune cell attraction. Accordingly, both monocytes and neutrophils accumulated in the BDL mouse brain. Time-dependent changes were limited in both cell types, suggesting early establishment of a pathological phenotype. While HE is often considered a unique form of encephalopathy, astrocytic and microglial transcriptomes showed significant overlap with previously established gene expression signatures in other neuroinflammatory diseases like septic encephalopathy and stroke, suggesting common pathophysiological mechanisms. Our dataset identifies key molecular mechanisms involved in preclinical HE and provides a valuable resource for development of novel glial-directed therapeutic strategies.© 2023. The Author(s)."

We quantified and compared anti-spike (S) antibodies using different commercial immunoassays. We tested serum samples from 70 SARS-CoV-2-naive health care workers 2 weeks after vaccination with a single dose of BNT162b2, 2 and 4 weeks, and 3 months after the second dose of BNT162b2. The following quantitative assays were used: Roche ElecsysAnti-SARS-CoV-2 S (Roche-S), Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG II Quant [Abbott-IgG(S)], and Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgM (Abbott-IgM). All samples tested positive for Roche-S and Abbott-IgG antibodies after the second dose, with 83.6% Abbott-IgM positive rate. Roche-S and Abbott-IgG(S) correlated significantly in all samples (r = 0.920, p < 0.0001), and the Roche-S and Abbott-IgG(S) assay showed a strong correlation with each other at each time point after vaccination. Roche-S and Abbott-IgG(S) antibody titers were correlated with age; their rate of decline was age-dependent in males but not in females. Abbott-IgG(S) antibody titers decreased from 2 weeks after the second dose. Roche-S antibody titers peaked 2 weeks after the second dose in 76.2% of the participants; the titers recovered 3 months post-vaccination after declining at week 4 in 40.7% of the participants. The concordance between Roche-S and Abbott-IgG(S) antibody titers over time was 47.5%. Most participants presented significantly high Roche-S and Abbott-IgG(S) antibody titers after immunization. Some measurements were inconsistent with titer changes between these assays, possibly because of differences in the immunoglobulin-specificity of the kits.© 2023 The Authors."

To better define the transcriptomic phenotypes and gene regulatory networks associated with AD, we enriched for microglia nuclei from 12 AD and 10 control human dorsolateral prefrontal cortices (7 males and 15 females, all aged >60 years) before single-nucleus RNA sequencing. Here we describe both established and previously unrecognized microglial molecular phenotypes, the inferred gene networks driving observed transcriptomic change, and apply trajectory analysis to reveal the putative relationships between microglial phenotypes. We identify microglial phenotypes more prevalent in AD cases compared with controls. Further, we describe the heterogeneity in microglia subclusters expressing homeostatic markers. Our study demonstrates that deep profiling of microglia in human AD brain can provide insight into microglial transcriptional changes associated with AD.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Meningeal immunity has emerged as a key factor in modulating proper brain function and social behavior, performing constant immune surveillance of the CNS, and participating in several neurological diseases. However, it remains to be determined how meningeal immunity contributes to CNS physiology and pathophysiology. With the advances in single-cell omics, new approaches, such as single-cell technologies, unveiled the details of cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying meningeal immunity in CNS homeostasis and dysfunction.

"37231260","Stabilized mosaic single-cell data integration using unshared features.","Nat Biotechnol","Currently available single-cell omics technologies capture many unique features with different biological information content. Data integration aims to place cells, captured with different technologies, onto a common embedding to facilitate downstream analytical tasks. Current horizontal data integration techniques use a set of common features, thereby ignoring non-overlapping features and losing information. Here we introduce StabMap, a mosaic data integration technique that stabilizes mapping of single-cell data by exploiting the non-overlapping features. StabMap first infers a mosaic data topology based on shared features, then projects all cells onto supervised or unsupervised reference coordinates by traversing shortest paths along the topology. We show that StabMap performs well in various simulation contexts, facilitates 'multi-hop' mosaic data integration where some datasets do not share any features and enables the use of spatial gene expression features for mapping dissociated single-cell data onto a spatial transcriptomic reference.© 2023.

This allows them to colonise the host environment upon infection and ensure life cycle progression. Yet, understanding of the mechanisms that regulate and drive the cell replication cycle of these forms is limited. Using single-cell transcriptomics on unsynchronised cell populations, we have obtained high resolution cell cycle regulated (CCR) transcriptomes of both procyclic and slender BSFTrypanosoma bruceiwithout prior cell sorting or synchronisation. Additionally, we describe an efficient freeze-thawing protocol that allows single-cell transcriptomic analysis of cryopreservedT. brucei. Computational reconstruction of the cell cycle using periodic pseudotime inference allowed the dynamic expression patterns of cycling genes to be profiled for both life cycle forms. Comparative analyses identify a core cycling transcriptome highly conserved between forms, as well as several genes where transcript levels dynamics are form specific. Comparing transcript expression patterns with protein abundance revealed that the majority of genes with periodic cycling transcript and protein levels exhibit a relative delay between peak transcript and protein expression. This work reveals novel detail of the CCR transcriptomes of both forms, which are available for further interrogation via an interactive webtool.© 2023, Briggs et al."
"37242612","Research Models to Study Ferroptosis's Impact in Neurodegenerative Diseases.","Pharmaceutics","Ferroptosis is a type of regulated cell death promoted by the appearance of oxidative perturbations in the intracellular microenvironment constitutively controlled by glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4). It is characterized by increased production of reactive oxygen species, intracellular iron accumulation, lipid peroxidation, inhibition of system Xc-, glutathione depletion, and decreased GPX4 activity. Several pieces of evidence support the involvement of ferroptosis in distinct neurodegenerative diseases. In vitro and in vivo models allow a reliable transition to clinical studies. Several in vitro models, including differentiated SH-SY5Y and PC12 cells, among others, have been used to investigate the pathophysiological mechanisms of distinct neurodegenerative diseases, including ferroptosis. In addition, they can be useful in the development of potential ferroptosis inhibitors that can be used as disease-modifying drugs for the treatment of such diseases. On the other hand, in vivo models based on the manipulation of rodents and invertebrate animals, such asDrosophila melanogaster,Caenorhabditis elegans, and zebrafish, have been increasingly used for research in neurodegeneration. This work provides an up-to-date review of the main in vitro and in vivo models that can be used to evaluate ferroptosis in the most prevalent neurodegenerative diseases, and to explore potential new drug targets and novel drug candidates for effective disease-modifying therapies."

Adifficult casewas defined as meeting one of the following criteria: an operative time ≥ 90 min, severe intraoperative bleeding, or conversion to laparoscopic resection. Five types of algorithms were employed in building models, including traditional logistic regression (LR) and automated machine learning (AutoML) analysis (gradient boost machine (GBM), deep neural net (DL), generalized linear model (GLM), and default random forest (DRF)). We assessed the performance of the models using the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC), the calibration curve, and the decision curve analysis (DCA) based on LR, as well as feature importance, SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) Plots and Local Interpretable Model Agnostic Explanation (LIME) based on AutoML.The GBM model outperformed other models with an AUC of 0.894 in the validation and 0.791 in the test cohorts. Furthermore, the GBM model achieved the highest accuracy among these AutoML models, with 0.935 and 0.911 in the validation and test cohorts, respectively. In addition, it was found that tumor size and endoscopists' experience were the most prominent features that significantly impacted the AutoML model's performance in predicting the difficulty for ER of gGISTs.The AutoML model based on the GBM algorithm can accurately predict the difficulty for ER of gGISTs before surgery.Copyright © 2023 Liu, Zhang, Shi, Li, Wang, Feng, Lu, Zong and Xu."

The 2015 American Thyroid Association (ATA) risk stratification system primary based on clinic-pathologic features is the most commonly used to describe the initial risk of persistent/recurrent disease. Besides, multiple prognostics models based on multigenes expression profiles have been developed to predict the recurrence risk of DTC patients. Recent evidences indicated that aberrant DNA methylation is involved in the initiation and progression of DTC and can be useful biomarkers for clinical diagnosis and prognosis prediction of DTC. Therefore, there is a need for integrating gene methylation feature to assess the recurrence risk of DTC. Gene methylation profile from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) was used to construct a recurrence risk model of DTC by successively performed univariate Cox regression, LASSO regression, and multivariate Cox regression. Two Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) methylation cohorts of DTC were utilized to validate the predictive value of the methylation profiles model as external cohort by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and survival analysis. Besides, CCK-8, colony-formation assay, transwell, and scratch-wound assay were used to investigate the biological significance of critical gene in the model. In our study, we constructed and validated a prognostic signature based on methylation profiles ofSPTA1, APCS,andDAB2and constructed a nomogram based on the methylation-related model, age, and AJCC_T stage that could provide evidence for the long-term treatment and management of DTC patients. Besides, in vitro experiments showed thatDAB2inhibited proliferation, colony-formation, and migration of BCPAP cells and the gene set enrichment analysis and immune infiltration analysis showed thatDAB2may promote antitumor immunity in DTC. In conclusion, promoter hypermethylation and loss expression ofDAB2in DTC may be a biomarker of unfavorable prognosis and poor response to immune therapy.Copyright © 2022 Gaoda Ju et al."

Therefore, we integrated single-cell RNA sequencing and bulk RNA sequencing data to select diagnosis and prognosis biomarkers for CRC.The CRC scRNA-seq dataset was used to describe the cellular landscape of normal intestinal mucosa, adenoma and CRC and to further select epithelium-specific clusters. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of epithelium-specific clusters were identified between intestinal lesion and normal mucosa in the scRNA-seq data throughout the adenoma-carcinoma sequence. Diagnostic biomarkers and prognostic biomarker (the risk score) for CRC were selected in the bulk RNA-seq dataset based on DEGs shared by the adenoma epithelium-specific cluster and the CRC epithelium-specific cluster (shared-DEGs).Among the 1063 shared-DEGs, we selected 38 gene expression biomarkers and 3 methylation biomarkers that had promising diagnostic power in plasma. Multivariate Cox regression identified  174 shared-DEGs as prognostic genes for CRC. We combined 1000 times LASSO-Cox regression and two-way stepwise regression to select 10 prognostic shared-DEGs to construct the risk score in the CRC meta-dataset. In the external validation dataset, the 1- and 5-year AUCs of the risk score were higher than those of stage, the pyroptosis-related genes (PRG) score and the cuproptosis-related genes (CRG) score.

"37214953","Leveraging genetic correlation structure to target discrete signaling mechanisms across metabolic tissues.","bioRxiv","Inter-organ communication is a vital process to maintain physiologic homeostasis, and its dysregulation contributes to many human diseases. Beginning with the discovery of insulin over a century ago, characterization of molecules responsible for signal between tissues has required careful and elegant experimentation where these observations have been integral to deciphering physiology and disease. Given that circulating bioactive factors are stable in serum, occur naturally, and are easily assayed from blood, they present obvious focal molecules for therapeutic intervention and biomarker development. For example, physiologic dissection of the actions of soluble proteins such as proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP1) have yielded among the most promising therapeutics to treat cardiovascular disease and obesity, respectively1-4. A major obstacle in the characterization of such soluble factors is that defining their tissues and pathways of action requires extensive experimental testing in cells and animal models. Recently, studies have shown that secreted proteins mediating inter-tissue signaling could be identified by ""brute-force"" surveys of all genes within RNA-sequencing measures across tissues within a population5-9. Expanding on this intuition, we reasoned that parallel strategies could be leveraged to understand how individual genes mediate signaling across metabolic tissues through correlative analysis of genetic variation. Thus, genetics could aid in understanding cross-organ signaling by adopting a genecentric approach. Here, we surveyed gene-gene genetic correlation structure for ∼6.1×10^12gene pairs across 18 metabolic tissues in 310 individuals where variation of genes such asFGF21, ADIPOQ, GCGandIL6showed enrichments which recapitulate experimental observations. Further, similar analyses were applied to explore both local signaling mechanisms (liverPCSK9) as well as genes encoding enzymes producing metabolites (adiposePNPLA2), where genetic correlation structure aligned with known roles for these critical metabolic pathways. Finally, we utilized this resource to suggest new functions for metabolic coordination between organs. For example, we prioritized key proteins for putative signaling between skeletal muscle and hippocampus, and further suggest colon as a central coordinator for systemic circadian clocks. We refer to this resource asGenetically-DerivedCorrelationsAcrossTissues (GD-CAT) where all tools and data are built into a web portal enabling users to perform these analyses without a single line of code ( gdcat.org ). This resource enables querying of any gene in any tissue to find genetic coregulation of genes, cell types, pathways and network architectures across metabolic organs."

However, several experimental and computational challenges remain in developing and implementing transcriptomics-based deconvolution approaches, especially those using a single cell/nuclei RNA-seq reference atlas, which are becoming rapidly available across many tissues. Notably, deconvolution algorithms are frequently developed using samples from tissues with similar cell sizes. However, brain tissue or immune cell populations have cell types with substantially different cell sizes, total mRNA expression, and transcriptional activity. When existing deconvolution approaches are applied to these tissues, these systematic differences in cell sizes and transcriptomic activity confound accurate cell proportion estimates and instead may quantify total mRNA content. Furthermore, there is a lack of standard reference atlases and computational approaches to facilitate integrative analyses, including not only bulk and single cell/nuclei RNA-seq data, but also new data modalities from spatial -omic or imaging approaches. New multi-assay datasets need to be collected with orthogonal data types generated from the same tissue block and the same individual, to serve as a ""gold standard"" for evaluating new and existing deconvolution methods.

Telomeres regulate the reproductive lifespan by mediating the synapsis and homologous recombination of chromosomes during gametogenesis. They are composed of thousands of hexanucleotide DNA repeats (TTAGGG) that are coupled to specialized shelterin complex proteins and non-coding RNAs. Telomerase activity in male germ cells ensures that the telomere length is maintained at maximum levels during spermatogenesis, despite telomere shortening due to DNA replication or other genotoxic factors such as environmental pollutants. An emerging body of evidence has associated an exposure to pollutants with male infertility. Although telomeric DNA may be one of the important targets of environmental pollutants, only a few authors have considered it as a conventional parameter for sperm function. The aim of this review is to provide comprehensive and up-to-date data on the research carried out so far on the structure/function of telomeres in spermatogenesis and the influence of environmental pollutants on their functionality.

Polysaccharides, one of the main effective components in edible and medicinal resources, are considered ideal regulators of various biological responses due to their high effectiveness and low toxicity, and they have a wide range of possible applications for the development of functional foods for the regulation of common, frequently occurring, chronic and severe diseases. Such applications include the development of polysaccharide products for the prevention and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases that are difficult to control by a single treatment, which is of great value to the aging population. Therefore, we evaluated the potential of polysaccharides to prevent neurodegeneration by their regulation of behavioral and major pathologies, including abnormal protein aggregation and neuronal damage caused by neuronal apoptosis, autophagy, oxidative damage, neuroinflammation, unbalanced neurotransmitters, and poor synaptic plasticity. This includes multi-target and multi-pathway regulation involving the mitochondrial pathway, MAPK pathway, NF-κB pathway, Nrf2 pathway, mTOR pathway, PI3K/AKT pathway, P53/P21 pathway, and BDNF/TrkB/CREB pathway. In this paper, research into edible and medicinal resource polysaccharides for neurodegenerative diseases was reviewed in order to provide a basis for the development and application of polysaccharide health products and promote the recognition of functional products of edible and medicinal resources."

A total number of 492 patients with T2DM with and without DN were categorized into case and control groups. The extracted DNA samples were genotyped using TaqMan allelic discrimination assay amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The haplotype analysis among the case and control groups was performed using an expectation-maximization algorithm by the maximum-likelihood method. The analysis of laboratory findings demonstrated significant differences in fasting blood sugar (FBS) and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) between the case and control groups (P < 0.05). The results showed that K121Q was significantly related to DN under a recessive model of inheritance (P = 0.006); however, rs1799774 and rs7754561 both were protective for DN under a dominant model of inheritance (P = 0.034 and P = 0.010, respectively) among four studied variants. Two haplotypes, including C-C-delT-G with a frequency < 0.02 and T-A-delT-G with a frequency < 0.01, were associated with the increased risk of DN (P < 0.05).

First, we delineated the cis-regulatory interactions and identified the regulatory networks and critical transcription factors involved in the epiblast (EPI), hypoblast, and trophectoderm/trophoblast (TE) lineage specification. Second, we observed that the chromatin opening of some genome regions preceded the gene expression during EPI and trophoblast specification. Third, we identified the opposing roles of FGF and BMP signaling in pluripotency regulation during EPI specification. Finally, we revealed the similarity between EPI and TE in gene expression profiles and demonstrated that PATZ1 and NR2F2 were involved in EPI and trophoblast specification during monkey post-implantation development.Our findings provide a useful resource and insights into dissecting the transcriptional regulatory machinery during primate post-implantation development.© The Author(s) 2023.

"37231414","Obesity and dyslipidemia are associated with partially reversible modifications to DNA hydroxymethylation of apoptosis- and senescence-related genes in swine adipose-derived mesenchymal stem/stromal cells.","Stem Cell Res Ther","Obesity dysregulates key biological processes underlying the functional homeostasis, fate decisions, and reparative potential of mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs). Mechanisms directing obesity-induced phenotypic alterations in MSCs remain unclear, but emerging drivers include dynamic modification of epigenetic marks, like 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). We hypothesized that obesity and cardiovascular risk factors induce functionally relevant, locus-specific changes in 5hmC of swine adipose-derived MSCs and evaluated their reversibility using an epigenetic modulator, vitamin-C.Female domestic pigs were fed a 16-week Lean or Obese diet (n = 6 each). MSCs were harvested from subcutaneous adipose tissue, and 5hmC profiles were examined through hydroxymethylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (hMeDIP-seq) followed by an integrative (hMeDIP and mRNA sequencing) gene set enrichment analysis. For clinical context, we compared 5hmC profiles of adipose tissue-derived human MSCs harvested from patients with obesity and healthy controls.hMeDIP-seq revealed 467 hyper- (fold change ≥ 1.4; p-value ≤ 0.05) and 591 hypo- (fold change ≤ 0.7; p-value ≤ 0.05) hydroxymethylated loci in swine Obese- versus Lean-MSCs. Integrative hMeDIP-seq/mRNA-seq analysis identified overlapping dysregulated gene sets and discrete differentially hydroxymethylated loci with functions related to apoptosis, cell proliferation, and senescence. These 5hmC changes were associated with increased senescence in cultured MSCs (p16/CDKN2A immunoreactivity, senescence-associated β-galactosidase [SA-β-Gal] staining), were partly reversed in swine Obese-MSCs treated with vitamin-C, and shared common pathways with 5hmC changes in human Obese-MSCs.Obesity and dyslipidemia are associated with dysregulated DNA hydroxymethylation of apoptosis- and senescence-related genes in swine and human MSCs, potentially affecting cell vitality and regenerative functions. Vitamin-C may mediate reprogramming of this altered epigenomic landscape, providing a potential strategy to improve the success of autologous MSC transplantation in obese patients.© 2023.

"37154345","Dam Assisted Fluorescent Tagging of Chromatin Accessibility (DAFCA) for Optical Genome Mapping in Nanochannel Arrays.","ACS Nano","Proteins and enzymes in the cell nucleus require physical access to their DNA target sites in order to perform genomic tasks such as gene activation and transcription. Hence, chromatin accessibility is a central regulator of gene expression, and its genomic profile holds essential information on the cell type and state. We utilized theE. coliDam methyltransferase in combination with a fluorescent cofactor analogue to generate fluorescent tags in accessible DNA regions within the cell nucleus. The accessible portions of the genome are then detected by single-molecule optical genome mapping in nanochannel arrays. This method allowed us to characterize long-range structural variations and their associated chromatin structure. We show the ability to create whole-genome, allele-specific chromatin accessibility maps composed of long DNA molecules extended in silicon nanochannels."
"37226244","Epigenetic regulation of human-specific gene expression in the prefrontal cortex.","BMC Biol","Changes in gene expression levels during brain development are thought to have played an important role in the evolution of human cognition. With the advent of high-throughput sequencing technologies, changes in brain developmental expression patterns, as well as human-specific brain gene expression, have been characterized. However, interpreting the origin of evolutionarily advanced cognition in human brains requires a deeper understanding of the regulation of gene expression, including the epigenomic context, along the primate genome. Here, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) to measure the genome-wide profiles of histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) and histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac), both of which are associated with transcriptional activation in the prefrontal cortex of humans, chimpanzees, and rhesus macaques.We found a discrete functional association, in whichH3K4me3HP gain was significantly associated with myelination assembly and signaling transmission, whileH3K4me3HP loss played a vital role in synaptic activity. Moreover,H3K27acHP gain was enriched in interneuron and oligodendrocyte markers, andH3K27acHP loss was enriched in CA1 pyramidal neuron markers. Using strand-specific RNA sequencing (ssRNA-seq), we first demonstrated that approximately 7 and 2% of human-specific expressed genes were epigenetically marked byH3K4me3HP andH3K27acHP, respectively, providing robust support for causal involvement of histones in gene expression. We also revealed the co-activation role of epigenetic modification and transcription factors in human-specific transcriptome evolution. Mechanistically, histone-modifying enzymes at least partially contribute to an epigenetic disturbance among primates, especially for the H3K27ac epigenomic marker. In line with this, peaks enriched in the macaque lineage were found to be driven by upregulated acetyl enzymes.Our results comprehensively elucidated a causal species-specific gene-histone-enzyme landscape in the prefrontal cortex and highlighted the regulatory interaction that drove transcriptional activation.© 2023.

"37238932","Complexity of Sex Differences and Their Impact on Alzheimer's Disease.","Biomedicines","Sex differences are present in brain morphology, sex hormones, aging processes and immune responses. These differences need to be considered for proper modelling of neurological diseases with clear sex differences. This is the case for Alzheimer's disease (AD), a fatal neurodegenerative disorder with two-thirds of cases diagnosed in women. It is becoming clear that there is a complex interplay between the immune system, sex hormones and AD. Microglia are major players in the neuroinflammatory process occurring in AD and have been shown to be directly affected by sex hormones. However, many unanswered questions remain as the importance of including both sexes in research studies has only recently started receiving attention. In this review, we provide a summary of sex differences and their implications in AD, with a focus on microglia action. Furthermore, we discuss current available study models, including emerging complex microfluidic and 3D cellular models and their usefulness for studying hormonal effects in this disease."

"37238930","Protective Effect and Mechanism of Xbp1s Regulating HBP/O-GlcNAcylation through GFAT1 on Brain Injury after SAH.","Biomedicines","(1) SAH induces cellular stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress, activating the unfolded protein response (UPR) in nerve cells. IRE1 (inositol-requiring enzyme 1) is a protein that plays a critical role in cellular stress response. Its final product, Xbp1s, is essential for adapting to changes in the external environment. This process helps maintain proper cellular function in response to various stressors. O-GlcNAcylation, a means of protein modification, has been found to be involved in SAH pathophysiology. SAH can increase the acute O-GlcNAcylation level of nerve cells, which enhances the stress capacity of nerve cells. The GFAT1 enzyme regulates the level of O-GlcNAc modification in cells, which could be a potential target for neuroprotection in SAH. Investigating the IRE1/XBP1s/GFAT1 axis could offer a promising avenue for future research. (2) Methods: SAH was induced using a suture to perforate an artery in mice. HT22 cells with Xbp1 loss- and gain-of-function in neurons were generated. Thiamet-G was used to increase O-GlcNAcylation; (3) Results: Severe neuroinflammation caused by subarachnoid hemorrhage leads to extensive endoplasmic reticulum stress of nerve cells. Xbp1s, the final product of unfolded proteins induced by endoplasmic reticulum stress, can induce the expression of the hexosamine pathway rate limiting enzyme GFAT1, increase the level of O-GlcNAc modification of cells, and have a protective effect on neural cells; (4) Conclusions: The correlation between Xbp1s displayed by immunohistochemistry and O-GlcNAc modification suggests that the IRE1/XBP1 branch of unfolded protein reaction plays a key role in subarachnoid hemorrhage. IRE1/XBP1 branch is a new idea to regulate protein glycosylation modification, and provides a promising strategy for clinical perioperative prevention and treatment of subarachnoid hemorrhage."
"37137305","Massively parallel base editing to map variant effects in human hematopoiesis.","Cell","Systematic evaluation of the impact of genetic variants is critical for the study and treatment of human physiology and disease. While specific mutations can be introduced by genome engineering, we still lack scalable approaches that are applicable to the important setting of primary cells, such as blood and immune cells. Here, we describe the development of massively parallel base-editing screens in human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Such approaches enable functional screens for variant effects across any hematopoietic differentiation state. Moreover, they allow for rich phenotyping through single-cell RNA sequencing readouts and separately for characterization of editing outcomes through pooled single-cell genotyping. We efficiently design improved leukemia immunotherapy approaches, comprehensively identify non-coding variants modulating fetal hemoglobin expression, define mechanisms regulating hematopoietic differentiation, and probe the pathogenicity of uncharacterized disease-associated variants. These strategies will advance effective and high-throughput variant-to-function mapping in human hematopoiesis to identify the causes of diverse diseases.Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).

"37214893","Defining a core configuration for human centromeres during mitosis.","bioRxiv","The biorientation of sister chromatids on the mitotic spindle, essential for accurate sister chromatid segregation, relies on critical centromere components including cohesin, the centromere-specific H3 variant CENP-A, and centromeric DNA. Centromeric DNA is highly variable between chromosomes yet must accomplish a similar function. Moreover, how the 50 nm cohesin ring, proposed to encircle sister chromatids, accommodates inter-sister centromeric distances of hundreds of nanometers on the metaphase spindle is a conundrum. Insight into the 3D organization of centromere components would help resolve how centromeres function on the mitotic spindle. We used ChIP-seq and super-resolution microscopy to examine the geometry of essential centromeric components on human chromosomes. ChIP-seq demonstrates that cohesin subunits are depleted in α-satellite arrays where CENP-A nucleosomes and kinetochores assemble. Cohesin is instead enriched at pericentromeric DNA. Structured illumination microscopy of sister centromeres is consistent, revealing a non-overlapping pattern of CENP-A and cohesin. We used single particle averaging of hundreds of mitotic sister chromatids to develop an average centromere model. CENP-A clusters on sister chromatids, connected by α-satellite, are separated by ∼562 nm with a perpendicular intervening ∼190 nM wide axis of cohesin. Two differently sized α-satellite arrays on chromosome 7 display similar inter-sister CENP-A cluster distance, demonstrating different sized arrays can achieve a common spacing. Our data suggest a working model for a common core configuration of essential centromeric components that includes CENP-A nucleosomes at the outer edge of extensible α-satellite DNA and pericentromeric cohesion. This configuration helps reconcile how centromeres function and serves as a foundation for future studies of additional components required for centromere function."
"37239999","Nuclear DJ-1 Regulates DNA Damage Repair via the Regulation of PARP1 Activity.","Int J Mol Sci","DNA damage and defective DNA repair are extensively linked to neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease (PD), but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we determined that the PD-associated protein DJ-1 plays an essential role in modulating DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair. Specifically, DJ-1 is a DNA damage response (DDR) protein that can be recruited to DNA damage sites, where it promotes DSB repair through both homologous recombination and nonhomologous end joining. Mechanistically, DJ-1 interacts directly with PARP1, a nuclear enzyme essential for genomic stability, and stimulates its enzymatic activity during DNA repair. Importantly, cells from PD patients with the DJ-1 mutation also have defective PARP1 activity and impaired repair of DSBs. In summary, our findings uncover a novel function of nuclear DJ-1 in DNA repair and genome stability maintenance, and suggest that defective DNA repair may contribute to the pathogenesis of PD linked to DJ-1 mutations."
"37231173","Non-canonical telomere protection role of FOXO3a of human skeletal muscle cells regulated by the TRF2-redox axis.","Commun Biol","Telomeric repeat binding factor 2 (TRF2) binds to telomeres and protects chromosome ends against the DNA damage response and senescence. Although the expression of TRF2 is downregulated upon cellular senescence and in various aging tissues, including skeletal muscle tissues, very little is known about the contribution of this decline to aging. We previously showed that TRF2 loss in myofibers does not trigger telomere deprotection but mitochondrial dysfunction leading to an increased level of reactive oxygen species. We show here that this oxidative stress triggers the binding of FOXO3a to telomeres where it protects against ATM activation, revealing a previously unrecognized telomere protective function of FOXO3a, to the best of our knowledge. We further showed in transformed fibroblasts and myotubes that the telomere properties of FOXO3a are dependent on the C-terminal segment of its CR2 domain (CR2C) but independent of its Forkhead DNA binding domain and of its CR3 transactivation domain. We propose that these non-canonical properties of FOXO3a at telomeres play a role downstream of the mitochondrial signaling induced by TRF2 downregulation to regulate skeletal muscle homeostasis and aging.© 2023.

"37222845","Yeast UPS1 deficiency leads to UVC radiation sensitivity and shortened lifespan.","Antonie Van Leeuwenhoek","UPS1/YLR193C of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae) encodes a mitochondrial intermembrane space protein. A previous study found that Ups1p is needed for normal mitochondrial morphology and that UPS1 deficiency disrupts the intramitochondrial transport of phosphatidic acid in yeast cells and leads to an altered unfolded protein response and mTORC1 signaling activation. In this paper, we first provide evidence showing that the UPS1 gene is involved in the UVC-induced DNA damage response and aging. We show that UPS1 deficiency leads to sensitivity to ultraviolet C (UVC) radiation and that this effect is accompanied by elevated DNA damage, increased intracellular ROS levels, abnormal mitochondrial respiratory function, an increased early apoptosis rate, and shortened replicative lifespan and chronological lifespan. Moreover, we show that overexpression of the DNA damage-induced checkpoint gene RAD9 effectively eliminates the senescence-related defects observed in the UPS1-deficient strain. Collectively, these results suggest a novel role for UPS1 in the UVC-induced DNA damage response and aging.© 2023.

"37205533","Structures of 9-1-1 DNA checkpoint clamp loading at gaps from start to finish and ramification to biology.","bioRxiv","Recent structural studies show the Rad24-RFC loads the 9-1-1 checkpoint clamp onto a recessed 5' end by binding the 5' DNA on Rad24 at an external surface site and threading the 3' ssDNA into the well-established internal chamber and into 9-1-1. We find here that Rad24-RFC loads 9-1-1 onto DNA gaps in preference to a recessed 5' DNA end, thus presumably leaving 9-1-1 on a 3' ss/ds DNA after Rad24-RFC ejects from the 5' gap end and may explain reports of 9-1-1 directly functioning in DNA repair with various TLS polymerases, in addition to signaling the ATR kinase. To gain a deeper understanding of 9-1-1 loading at gaps we report high-resolution structures of Rad24-RFC during loading of 9-1-1 onto 10-nt and 5-nt gapped DNAs. At a 10-nt gap we captured five Rad24-RFC-9-1-1 loading intermediates in which the 9-1-1 DNA entry gate varies from fully open to fully closed around DNA using ATPγS, supporting the emerging view that ATP hydrolysis is not needed for clamp opening/closing, but instead for dissociation of the loader from the clamp encircling DNA. The structure of Rad24-RFC-9-1-1 at a 5-nt gap shows a 180° axially rotated 3'-dsDNA which orients the template strand to bridge the 3'- and 5'- junctions with a minimum 5-nt ssDNA. The structures reveal a unique loop on Rad24 that limits the length of dsDNA in the inner chamber, and inability to melt DNA ends unlike RFC, thereby explaining Rad24-RFC's preference for a preexisting ssDNA gap and suggesting a direct role in gap repair in addition to its checkpoint role."
"37084987","Connecting the dots: Neuronal senescence, stress granules, and neurodegeneration.","Gene","Cellular senescence increases with aging. While senescence is associated with an exit of the cell cycle, there is ample evidence that post-mitotic cells including neurons can undergo senescence as the brain ages, and that senescence likely contributes significantly to the progression of neurodegenerative diseases (ND) such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). Stress granules (SGs) are stress-induced cytoplasmic biomolecular condensates of RNA and proteins, which have been linked to the development of AD and ALS. The SG seeding hypothesis of NDs proposes that chronic stress in aging neurons results in static SGs that progress into pathological aggregates Alterations in SG dynamics have also been linked to senescence, though studies that link SGs and senescence in the context of NDs and the aging brain have not yet been performed. In this Review, we summarize the literature on senescence, and explore the contribution of senescence to the aging brain. We describe senescence phenotypes in aging neurons and glia, and their links to neuroinflammation and the development of AD and ALS. We further examine the relationships of SGs to senescence and to ND. We propose a new hypothesis that neuronal senescence may contribute to the mechanism of SG seeding in ND by altering SG dynamics in aged cells, thereby providing additional aggregation opportunities within aged neurons.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

"37231196","Senescence-induced immune remodeling facilitates metastatic adrenal cancer in a sex-dimorphic manner.","Nat Aging","Aging markedly increases cancer risk, yet our mechanistic understanding of how aging influences cancer initiation is limited. Here we demonstrate that the loss of ZNRF3, an inhibitor of Wnt signaling that is frequently mutated in adrenocortical carcinoma, leads to the induction of cellular senescence that remodels the tissue microenvironment and ultimately permits metastatic adrenal cancer in old animals. The effects are sexually dimorphic, with males exhibiting earlier senescence activation and a greater innate immune response, driven in part by androgens, resulting in high myeloid cell accumulation and lower incidence of malignancy. Conversely, females present a dampened immune response and increased susceptibility to metastatic cancer. Senescence-recruited myeloid cells become depleted as tumors progress, which is recapitulated in patients in whom a low myeloid signature is associated with worse outcomes. Our study uncovers a role for myeloid cells in restraining adrenal cancer with substantial prognostic value and provides a model for interrogating pleiotropic effects of cellular senescence in cancer.© 2023.

The long-term use of VPA increases the risk of developing adverse drug reactions (ADRs), among which metabolic syndrome (MetS) plays a special role. MetS belongs to a cluster of metabolic conditions such as abdominal obesity, high blood pressure, high blood glucose, high serum triglycerides, and low serum high-density lipoprotein. Valproate-induced MetS (VPA-MetS) is a common ADR that needs an updated multidisciplinary approach to its prevention and diagnosis. In this review, we consider the results of studies of blood (serum and plasma) and the urinary biomarkers of VPA-MetS. These metabolic biomarkers may provide the key to the development of a new multidisciplinary personalized strategy for the prevention and diagnosis of VPA-MetS in patients with neurological diseases, psychiatric disorders, and addiction diseases."

These sequelae are highly heterogeneous in nature and adversely affect multiple biological systems, although breathlessness is a frequently cited symptom. Specific pulmonary sequelae, including pulmonary fibrosis and thromboembolic disease, need careful assessment and might require particular investigations and treatments. COVID-19 outcomes in people with pre-existing respiratory conditions vary according to the nature and severity of the respiratory disease and how well it is controlled. Extrapulmonary complications such as reduced exercise tolerance and frailty might contribute to breathlessness in post-COVID-19 condition. Non-pharmacological therapeutic options, including adapted pulmonary rehabilitation programmes and physiotherapy techniques for breathing management, might help to attenuate breathlessness in people with post-COVID-19 condition.

Patients with immunodeficiencies or autoimmunity where genetic analyses revealed heterozygousAIREmutations were included in the study and the dominant-negative effects of theAIREmutations were functionally assessedin vitro. We here report additional families with phenotypes ranging from immunodeficiency, enteropathy, and vitiligo to asymptomatic carrier status.

"37125945","Cystic Fibrosis-Related Diabetes Workshop: Research Priorities Spanning Disease Pathophysiology, Diagnosis, and Outcomes.","Diabetes","Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a recessive disorder arising from mutations in the gene encoding the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. CFTR is expressed in numerous tissues, with high expression in the airways, small and large intestine, pancreatic and hepatobiliary ducts, and male reproductive tract. CFTR loss in these tissues disrupts regulation of salt, bicarbonate, and water balance across their epithelia, resulting in a systemic disorder with progressive organ dysfunction and damage. Pancreatic exocrine damage ultimately manifests as pancreatic exocrine insufficiency that begins as early as infancy. Pancreatic remodeling accompanies this early damage, during which abnormal glucose tolerance can be observed in toddlers. With increasing age, however, insulin secretion defects progress such that CF-related diabetes (CFRD) occurs in 20% of teens and up to half of adults with CF. The relevance of CFRD is highlighted by its association with increased morbidity, mortality, and patient burden. While clinical research on CFRD has greatly assisted in the care of individuals with CFRD, key knowledge gaps on CFRD pathogenesis remain. Furthermore, the wide use of CFTR modulators to restore CFTR activity is changing the CFRD clinical landscape and the field's understanding of CFRD pathogenesis. For these reasons, the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases and the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation sponsored a CFRD Scientific Workshop, 23-25 June 2021, to define knowledge gaps and needed research areas.

This article focuses on the specific roles and clinical implications of pyroptosis-related genes (PRGs) in soft tissue sarcoma (STS). By analyzing differentially expressed PRGs in STS compared to normal tissue, our study evaluates the interactions, biological functions, and prognostic values of PRGs in STS. Through LASSO COX regression analysis, a five-gene survival related-risk score (PLCG1, PYCARD, CASP8, NOD1, and NOD2) was created, which examined both in TCGA cohort and training cohort (GSE21050, GSE30929, and GSE63157). Furthermore, we developed a nomogram incorporating clinic factors and the risk scores of the PRGs, which showed decent accuracy of prediction as evidenced by calibration curves. Additionally, our study analyzed the Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion Algorithm (TIDE) and IMvigor 210 cohorts to investigate the immunotherapy response, and found that immunotherapy was more beneficial for patients with minimal risk of PRGs than those exhibiting greater risk. Finally, GDSC and CAMP databases were used to screen for effective chemotherapy or targeted drugs that are sensitive to the high-risk populations, including doxorubicin, imatinib, and sorafenib. In conclusion, this study provides a comprehensive analysis of the PRG landscape in STS and constructs a novel risk model to predict prognosis and different therapeutic responses of STS patients, which is helpful for achieving precision medicine.Copyright © 2023 Liu, Li and Liang."

Recent evidence suggests that PTSD may be a risk factor for the development of subsequent neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's dementia and Parkinson's disease. Identification of biomarkers known to be associated with neurodegeneration in patients with PTSD would shed light on the pathophysiological mechanisms linking these disorders and would also help in the development of preventive strategies for neurodegenerative disorders in PTSD. With this background, the PubMed and Scopus databases were searched for studies designed to identify biomarkers that could be associated with an increased risk of neurodegenerative disorders in patients with PTSD. Out of a total of 342 citations retrieved, 29 studies were identified for inclusion in the review. The results of these studies suggest that biomarkers such as cerebral cortical thinning, disrupted white matter integrity, specific genetic polymorphisms, immune-inflammatory alterations, vitamin D deficiency, metabolic syndrome, and objectively documented parasomnias are significantly associated with PTSD and may predict an increased risk of subsequent neurodegenerative disorders. The biological mechanisms underlying these changes, and the interactions between them, are also explored. Though requiring replication, these findings highlight a number of biological pathways that plausibly link PTSD with neurodegenerative disorders and suggest potentially valuable avenues for prevention and early intervention."

The BEN domain of BANP has been shown to bind to a CGCG DNA sequence or an AAA-containing matrix attachment regions DNA sequence. Consistent with these in vivo observations, we identified an optimal DNA-binding sequence of AAATCTCG by protein binding microarray, which was also confirmed by our isothermal titration calorimetry and mutagenesis results. We then determined crystal structures of the BANP BEN domain in apo form and in complex with a CGCG-containing DNA, respectively, which revealed that the BANP BEN domain mainly used the electrostatic interactions to bind DNA with some base-specific interactions with the TC motifs. Our isothermal titration calorimetry results also showed that BANP bound to unmethylated and methylated DNAs with comparable binding affinities. Our complex structure of BANP-mCGCG revealed that the BANP BEN domain bound to the unmethylated and methylated DNAs in a similar mode and cytosine methylation did not get involved in binding, which is also consistent with our observations from the complex structures of the BEND6 BEN domain with the CGCG or CGmCG DNAs. Taken together, our results further elucidate the elements important for DNA recognition and transcriptional regulation by the BANP BEN domain-containing transcription factor.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

However, low positivity rate and sensitivity limits their clinical effectiveness. In this study, we explored the potential of C-reactive protein (CRP) and fibrinogen to improve the diagnostic efficiency of traditional biomarkers of CRC. The concentrations of CRP and fibrinogen in plasma were significantly higher in CRC patients compared with benign or healthy controls. The area under the ROC curves (AUCs) showed that the diagnostic efficacy of CRP and fibrinogen was 0.745 (95% CI: 0.712-0.779) and 0.699 (95% CI: 0.663-0.734), respectively. AUC increased to 0.750 (95% CI: 0.716-0.784) when CRP and fibrinogen were combined. It also further improved to 0.889 (95% CI: 0.866-0.913) when CRP and fibrinogen were integrated with CEA and CA72-4. Moreover, this combination increased the maximum area under AUC to 0.857 (95% CI: 0.830-0.883), which effective differentiated CRC from benign disease. Overall, this study found that CRP and fibrinogen were highly expressed in the plasma of CRC patients, suggesting their potential to improve the diagnostic efficiency of traditional biomarkers of CRC.© 2023 The Authors."
"37234978","Recent advances in understanding DNA methylation of prostate cancer.","Front Oncol","Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation, is widely studied in cancer. DNA methylation patterns have been shown to distinguish between benign and malignant tumors in various cancers, including prostate cancer. It may also contribute to oncogenesis, as it is frequently associated with downregulation of tumor suppressor genes. Aberrant patterns of DNA methylation, in particular the CpG island hypermethylator phenotype (CIMP), have shown associative evidence with distinct clinical features and outcomes, such as aggressive subtypes, higher Gleason score, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and overall tumor stage, overall worse prognosis, as well as reduced survival. In prostate cancer, hypermethylation of specific genes is significantly different between tumor and normal tissues. Methylation patterns could distinguish between aggressive subtypes of prostate cancer, including neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) and castration resistant prostate adenocarcinoma. Further, DNA methylation is detectable in cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and is reflective of clinical outcome, making it a potential biomarker for prostate cancer. This review summarizes recent advances in understanding DNA methylation alterations in cancers with the focus on prostate cancer. We discuss the advanced methodology used for evaluating DNA methylation changes and the molecular regulators behind these changes. We also explore the clinical potential of DNA methylation as prostate cancer biomarkers and its potential for developing targeted treatment of CIMP subtype of prostate cancer.Copyright © 2023 Shin, Hua and Li."

Even though somatic mutations have been linked to tumorigenesis and metastasis, it is less explored whether metastatic events can be identified through genomic mutational signatures, which are concise descriptions of the mutational processes. Here, we developed MetaWise, a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model, by applying mutational signatures as input features calculated from Whole-Exome Sequencing (WES) data of TCGA and other metastatic cohorts. This model can accurately classify metastatic tumors from primary tumors and outperform traditional machine learning (ML) models and a deep learning (DL) model, DiaDeL. Signatures of non-coding mutations also have a major impact on the model's performance. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Local Surrogate (LIME) analyses identify several mutational signatures which are directly correlated to metastatic spread in cancers, including APOBEC-mutagenesis, UV-induced signatures, and DNA damage response deficiency signatures.© 2023.

"37218279","Transcriptional condensates and phase separation: condensing information across scales and mechanisms.","Nucleus","Transcription is the fundamental process of gene expression, which in eukaryotes occurs within the complex physicochemical environment of the nucleus. Decades of research have provided extreme detail in the molecular and functional mechanisms of transcription, but the spatial and genomic organization of transcription remains mysterious. Recent discoveries show that transcriptional components can undergo phase separation and create distinct compartments inside the nucleus, providing new models through which to view the transcription process in eukaryotes. In this review, we focus on transcriptional condensates and their phase separation-like behaviors. We suggest differentiation between physical descriptions of phase separation and the complex and dynamic biomolecular assemblies required for productive gene expression, and we discuss how transcriptional condensates are central to organizing the three-dimensional genome across spatial and temporal scales. Finally, we map approaches for therapeutic manipulation of transcriptional condensates and ask what technical advances are needed to understand transcriptional condensates more completely."
"37224329","A2TEA: Identifying trait-specific evolutionary adaptations.","F1000Res","Background:Plants differ in their ability to cope with external stresses (e.g., drought tolerance). Genome duplications are an important mechanism to enable plant adaptation. This leads to characteristic footprints in the genome, such as protein family expansion. We explore genetic diversity and uncover evolutionary adaptation to stresses by exploiting genome comparisons between stress tolerant and sensitive species and RNA-Seq data sets from stress experiments. Expanded gene families that are stress-responsive based on differential expression analysis could hint at species or clade-specific adaptation, making these gene families exciting candidates for follow-up tolerance studies and crop improvement.Software:Integration of such cross-species omics data is a challenging task, requiring various steps of transformation and filtering. Ultimately, visualization is crucial for quality control and interpretation. To address this, we developed A2TEA: Automated Assessment of Trait-specific Evolutionary Adaptations, a Snakemake workflow for detecting adaptation footprints in silico. It functions as a one-stop processing pipeline, integrating protein family, phylogeny, expression, and protein function analyses. The pipeline is accompanied by an R Shiny web application that allows exploring, highlighting, and exporting the results interactively. This allows the user to formulate hypotheses regarding the genomic adaptations of one or a subset of the investigated species to a given stress.Conclusions: While our research focus is on crops, the pipeline is entirely independent of the underlying species and can be used with any set of species. We demonstrate pipeline efficiency on real-world datasets and discuss the implementation and limits of our analysis workflow as well as planned extensions to its current state.

"37242290","The Effects of Specific Gut Microbiota and Metabolites on IgA Nephropathy-Based on Mendelian Randomization and Clinical Validation.","Nutrients","Although recent research suggests that alterations in gut microbiota and metabolites play a critical role in the pathophysiology of immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN), the causal relationship between specific intestinal flora and metabolites and the risk of IgAN remains unclear.This study employed Mendelian randomization (MR) to investigate the causal association between gut microbiota and IgAN. To explore potential associations between gut microbiota and various outcomes, four MR methods were applied: inverse variance weighted (IVW), MR-Egger, weighted median, and weighted mode. If the results of the four methods are inconclusive, we prefer the IVW as the primary outcome. Additionally, MR-Egger, MR-PRESSO-Global, and Cochrane's Q tests were used to detect heterogeneity and pleiotropy. The stability of MR findings was assessed using the leave-one-out approach, and the strength of the causal relationship between exposure and outcome was tested using Bonferroni correction. Additional clinical samples were utilized to validate the results of Mendelian randomization, and the outcomes were visualized through an ROC curve, confusion matrix, and correlation analysis.This study examined a total of 15 metabolites and 211 microorganisms. Among them, eight bacteria and one metabolite were found to be associated with the risk of IgAN (p< 0.05). The Bonferroni-corrected test reveals that only Class. Actinobacteria (OR: 1.20, 95% CI: 1.07-1.36,p= 0.0029) have a significant causal relationship with IgAN. According to Cochrane's Q test, there is no substantial heterogeneity across different single-nucleotide polymorphisms (p> 0.05). Furthermore, MR-Egger and MR-PRESSO-Global tests (p> 0.05) showed no evidence of pleiotropy. No reverse causal association was found between the risk of IgAN and microbiota or metabolites (p> 0.05). Clinical specimens demonstrated the effectiveness and accuracy of Actinobacteria in distinguishing IgAN patients from those with other glomerular diseases (AUC = 0.9, 95% CI: 0.78-1.00). Additionally, our correlation analysis revealed a potential association between Actinobacteria abundance and increased albuminuria (r = 0.85) and poorer prognosis in IgAN patients (p= 0.01).Through MR analysis, we established a causal link between Actinobacteria and the incidence of IgAN. Moreover, clinical validation using fecal samples indicated that Actinobacteria might be associated with the onset and poorer prognosis of IgAN. This finding could provide valuable biomarkers for early, noninvasive detection of the disease and potential therapeutic targets in IgAN."

The aim of this study is to analyze the possible association betweenPPP3R1:rs3039851 polymorphism and left ventricular mass (LVM) in full-term healthy newborns.The study group consisted of 162 consecutive, full-term, healthy newborns. Two-dimensional M-mode echocardiography was used to assess LVM. ThePPP3R1:rs3039851 polymorphism was identified by PCR-RFLP in genomic DNA extracted from cord blood leukocytes.No significant differences were found between newborns homozygous for the reference allele (5I/5I, n = 135) and newborns carrying at least one 5D allele (n = 27) for LVM standardized for body mass, body length or body surface area (LVM/BM, LVM/BL or LVM/BSA, respectively). However, the frequency ofPPP3R1:rs3039851 genotypes with a 5D allele (5I/5D + 5D/5D) among newborns with the largest LVM/BM or LVM/BSA (upper tertile) was statistically significantly higher compared with the prevalence in individuals with the lowest values of both indices (lower tertile).Our results suggest that thePPP3R1:rs3039851 polymorphism may contribute to subtle variation in left ventricular mass at birth."
"37240283","Establishment of a Machine Learning Model for the Risk Assessment of Perineural Invasion in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma.","Int J Mol Sci","Perineural invasion is a prevalent pathological finding in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and a risk factor for unfavorable survival. An adequate diagnosis of perineural invasion by pathologic examination is limited due to the availability of tumor samples from surgical resection, which can arise in cases of definitive nonsurgical treatment. To address this medical need, we established a random forest prediction model for the risk assessment of perineural invasion, including occult perineural invasion, and characterized distinct cellular and molecular features based on our new and extended classification. RNA sequencing data of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma from The Cancer Genome Atlas were used as a training cohort to identify differentially expressed genes that are associated with perineural invasion. A random forest classification model was established based on these differentially expressed genes and was validated by inspection of H&E-stained whole image slides. Differences in epigenetic regulation and the mutational landscape were detected by an integrative analysis of multiomics data and single-cell RNA-sequencing data were analyzed. We identified a 44-gene expression signature related to perineural invasion and enriched for genes mainly expressed in cancer cells according to single-cell RNA-sequencing data. A machine learning model was trained based on the expression pattern of the 44-gene set with the unique feature to predict occult perineural invasion. This extended classification model enabled a more accurate analysis of alterations in the mutational landscape and epigenetic regulation by DNA methylation as well as quantitative and qualitative differences in the cellular composition in the tumor microenvironment between head and neck squamous cell carcinoma with or without perineural invasion. In conclusion, the newly established model could not only complement histopathologic examination as an additional diagnostic tool but also guide the identification of new drug targets for therapeutic intervention in future clinical trials with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients at a higher risk for treatment failure due to perineural invasion."
"37205493","Rare penetrant mutations confer severe risk of common diseases.","medRxiv","We examined 454,712 exomes for genes associated with a wide spectrum of complex traits and common diseases and observed that rare, penetrant mutations in genes implicated by genome-wide association studies confer ∼10-fold larger effects than common variants in the same genes. Consequently, an individual at the phenotypic extreme and at the greatest risk for severe, early-onset disease is better identified by a few rare penetrant variants than by the collective action of many common variants with weak effects. By combining rare variants across phenotype-associated genes into a unified genetic risk model, we demonstrate superior portability across diverse global populations compared to common variant polygenic risk scores, greatly improving the clinical utility of genetic-based risk prediction.Rare variant polygenic risk scores identify individuals with outlier phenotypes in common human diseases and complex traits."

We aimed to derive an improved polygenic score (PGS) for predicting children at risk of HM and to test if a PGS is predictive of MMD after accounting for SER.The PGS was derived from genome-wide association studies in participants of UK Biobank, CREAM Consortium, and Genetic Epidemiology Research on Adult Health and Aging. MMD severity was quantified by a deep learning algorithm. Prediction of HM was quantified as the area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC). Prediction of severe MMD was assessed by logistic regression.In independent samples of European, African, South Asian and East Asian ancestry, the PGS explained 19% (95% confidence interval 17-21%), 2% (1-3%), 8% (7-10%) and 6% (3-9%) of the variation in SER, respectively. The AUROC for HM in these samples was 0.78 (0.75-0.81), 0.58 (0.53-0.64), 0.71 (0.69-0.74) and 0.67 (0.62-0.72), respectively. The PGS was not associated with the risk of MMD after accounting for SER: OR = 1.07 (0.92-1.24).Performance of the PGS approached the level required for clinical utility in Europeans but not in other ancestries. A PGS for refractive error was not predictive of MMD risk once SER was accounted for.Supported by the Welsh Government and Fight for Sight (24WG201).Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).

"37225692","Circulating S100B levels at birth and risk of six major neuropsychiatric or neurological disorders: a two-sample Mendelian Randomization Study.","Transl Psychiatry","Circulating levels of the astrocytic marker S100B have been associated with risk of neuropsychiatric or neurological disorders. However, reported effects have been inconsistent, and no causal relations have yet been established. We applied two-sample Mendelian Randomization (MR) on the association statistics from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for circulating S100B levels measured 5-7 days after birth (the iPSYCH sample) and in an older adult sample (mean age, 72.5 years; the Lothian sample), upon those derived from major depression disorder (MDD), schizophrenia (SCZ), bipolar disorder (BIP), autism spectral disorder (ASD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Parkinson's disease (PD). We studied the causal relations in the two S100B datasets for risk of these six neuropsychiatric disorders. MR suggested increased S100B levels 5-7 days after birth to causally increase the risk of MDD (OR = 1.014; 95%CI = 1.007-1.022; FDR-corrected p = 6.43×10-4). In older adults, MR suggested increased S100B levels to have a causal relation to the risk of BIP (OR = 1.075; 95%CI = 1.026-1.127; FDR-corrected p = 1.35×10-2). No significant causal relations were found for the other five disorders. We did not observe any evidence for reverse causality of these neuropsychiatric or neurological disorders on altered S100B levels. Sensitivity analyses using more stringent SNP-selection criteria and three alternative MR models suggested the results are robust. Altogether, our findings imply a small cause-effect relation for the previously reported associations of S100B and mood disorders. Such findings may provide a novel avenue for the diagnosis and management of disorders.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37238457","Association between being Overweight in Young Childhood and during School Age and Puberty.","Children (Basel)","To examine whether body type at birth, body weight, and obesity in early childhood are associated with overweight/obesity during school age and puberty. Data from maternal and child health handbooks, baby health checkup information, and school physical examination information of participants at birth and three-generation cohort studies were linked. Association between body type and body weight at different time intervals (at birth and at 1.5, 3.5, 6, 11, and 14 years of age) were comprehensively analyzed using a multivariate regression model adjusted for gender, maternal age at childbirth, maternal parity, and maternal body mass index, and drinking and smoking statuses at pregnancy confirmation. Children who are overweight in young childhood had a greater risk of being overweight. Particularly, overweight at one year of age during checkup was associated with overweight at 3.5 years (adjusted odds ratio (aOR), 13.42; 95% confidence interval (CI), 4.46-45.42), 6 years (aOR, 6.94; 95% CI, 1.64-33.46), and 11 years (aOR, 5.22; 95% CI, 1.25-24.79) of age. Therefore, being overweight in young childhood could increase the risk of being overweight and obese during school age and puberty. Early intervention in young childhood may be warranted to prevent obesity during school age and puberty."

Most research within the developmental origins of the health and disease (DOHaD) field is focused on the role of macronutrients in the genome function and programming of the developing fetus. On the other hand, there is a paucity of knowledge about the role of micronutrients and, specifically, minerals in regulating the epigenome of livestock species, especially cattle. Therefore, this review will address the effects of the maternal dietary mineral supply on the fetal developmental programming from the embryonic to the postnatal phases in cattle. To this end, we will draw a parallel between findings from our cattle model research with data from model animals, cell lines, and other livestock species. The coordinated role and function of different mineral elements in feto-maternal genomic regulation underlies the establishment of pregnancy and organogenesis and, ultimately, affects the development and functioning of metabolically important tissues, such as the fetal liver, skeletal muscle, and, importantly, the placenta. Through this review, we will delineate the key regulatory pathways involved in fetal programming based on the dietary maternal mineral supply and its crosstalk with epigenomic regulation in cattle."

"37054563","Post-translational modifications of histone proteins by monoamine neurotransmitters.","Curr Opin Chem Biol","Protein monoaminylation is a biochemical process through which biogenic monoamines (e.g., serotonin, dopamine, histamine, etc.) are covalently bonded to certain protein substrates via Transglutaminase 2, an enzyme that catalyzes the transamidation of primary amines to the γ-carboxamides of glutamine residues. Since their initial discovery, these unusual post-translational modifications have been implicated in a wide variety of biological processes, ranging from protein coagulation to platelet activation and G-protein signaling. More recently, histone proteins - specifically histone H3 at glutamine 5 (H3Q5) - have been added to the growing list of monoaminyl substrates in vivo, with H3Q5 monoaminylation demonstrated to regulate permissive gene expression in cells. Such phenomena have further been shown to contribute critically to various aspects of (mal)adaptive neuronal plasticity and behavior. In this short review, we examine the evolution of our understanding of protein monoaminylation events, highlighting recent advances in the elucidation of their roles as important chromatin regulators.Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).

"37214901","Prenatal Lead Exposure is Negatively Associated with the Gut Microbiome in Childhood.","medRxiv","Metal exposures are associated with gut microbiome (GM) composition and function, and exposures early in development may be particularly important. Considering the role of the GM in association with many adverse health outcomes, understanding the relationship between prenatal metal exposures and the GM is critically important. However, there is sparse knowledge of the association between prenatal metal exposure and GM later in childhood.This analysis aims to identify associations between prenatal lead (Pb) exposure and GM composition and function in children 9-11 years old.Data come from the Programming Research in Obesity, Growth, Environment and Social Stressors (PROGRESS) cohort based in Mexico City, Mexico. Prenatal metal concentrations were measured in maternal whole blood drawn during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. Stool samples collected at 9-11 years old underwent metagenomic sequencing to assess the GM. This analysis uses multiple statistical modeling approaches, including linear regression, permutational analysis of variance, weighted quantile sum regression (WQS), and individual taxa regressions, to estimate the association between maternal blood Pb during pregnancy and multiple aspects of the child GM at 9-11 years old, adjusting for relevant confounders.Of the 123 child participants in this pilot data analysis, 74 were male and 49 were female. Mean prenatal maternal blood Pb was 33.6(SE=2.1) ug/L and 34.9(SE=2.1) ug/L at second and third trimesters, respectively. Analysis suggests a consistent negative relationship between prenatal maternal blood Pb and the GM at age 9-11, including measures of alpha and beta diversity, microbiome mixture analysis, and individual taxa. The WQS analysis showed a negative association between prenatal Pb exposure and the gut microbiome, for both second and third trimester exposures (2Tβ=-0.17,95%CI=[-0.46,0.11]; 3Tβ=-0.17,95%CI=[-0.44,0.10]). Ruminococcus gnavus, Bifidobacterium longum, Alistipes indistinctus, Bacteroides caccae, and Bifidobacterium bifidum all had weights above the importance threshold from 80% or more of the WQS repeated holdouts in association with both second and third trimester Pb exposure.Pilot data analysis suggests a negative association between prenatal Pb exposure and the gut microbiome later in childhood; however, additional investigation is needed."
"37235245","A Review on Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances in Pregnant Women: Maternal Exposure, Placental Transfer, and Relevant Model Simulation.","Toxics","Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are important and ubiquitous environmental contaminants worldwide. These novel contaminants can enter human bodies via various pathways, subsequently posing risks to the ecosystem and human health. The exposure of pregnant women to PFASs might pose risks to the health of mothers and the growth and development of fetuses. However, little information is available about the placental transfer of PFASs from mothers to fetuses and the related mechanisms through model simulation. In the present study, based upon a review of previously published literature, we initially summarized the exposure pathways of PFASs in pregnant women, factors affecting the efficiency of placental transfer, and mechanisms associated with placental transfer; outlined simulation analysis approaches using molecular docking and machine learning to reveal the mechanisms of placental transfer; and finally highlighted future research emphases that need to be focused on. Consequently, it was notable that the binding of PFASs to proteins during placental transfer could be simulated by molecular docking and that the placental transfer efficiency of PFASs could also be predicted by machine learning. Therefore, future research on the maternal-fetal transfer mechanisms of PFASs with the benefit of simulation analysis approaches is warranted to provide a scientific basis for the health effects of PFASs on newborns."

Epidemiological associations between PTB and maternal characteristics have been previously described. This work used multiomic profiling and multivariate modeling to investigate the biological signatures of these characteristics. Maternal covariates were collected during pregnancy from 13,841 pregnant women across five sites. Plasma samples from 231 participants were analyzed to generate proteomic, metabolomic, and lipidomic datasets. Machine learning models showed robust performance for the prediction of PTB (AUROC = 0.70), time-to-delivery (r= 0.65), maternal age (r= 0.59), gravidity (r= 0.56), and BMI (r= 0.81). Time-to-delivery biological correlates included fetal-associated proteins (e.g., ALPP, AFP, and PGF) and immune proteins (e.g., PD-L1, CCL28, and LIFR). Maternal age negatively correlated with collagen COL9A1, gravidity with endothelial NOS and inflammatory chemokine CXCL13, and BMI with leptin and structural protein FABP4. These results provide an integrated view of epidemiological factors associated with PTB and identify biological signatures of clinical covariates affecting this disease."

In 30-40% of the MPN subgroups essential thrombocythemia (ET) and myelofibrosis (MF), somatic mutations in the calreticulin gene (CALR) are drivers of the disease resulting in constitutive activation of the thrombopoietin receptor (MPL). In the current study, we describe a healthyCALRmutated individual during a 12 year follow-up from initial identification ofCALRclonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) to the diagnosis of pre-MF. The pre-diagnostic exponential development dynamics of the malignant clone demonstrated close correlation with the platelet counts, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte (NLR) ratio, and inversely correlated to hemoglobin and erythrocyte counts. Backward extrapolation of the growth rate indicated the potential for discovery of the malignant clone many years prior to presentation of overt disease, opening a window of opportunity for early treatment intervention. We did not find any additional mutations associated with MPNs and the current case report provides novel information regarding the development of a driver mutation and the association with blood cell counts prior to clinical manifestation of symptoms suggesting that pre-diagnostic dynamics may supplement future diagnostic criteria for early diagnosis and intervention in MPN patients.Copyright © 2023 Kjær, Skov, Larsen, Boklund, Andersen, Kefala, Knudsen, Schjellerup Eickhardt-Dalbøge, Stiehl, Gudmand-Høyer, Snyder, Holmström, Andersen, Ottesen, Ellervik and Hasselbalch."

This method not only generates an electric field but also utilizes the benefits of ultrasound such as non-invasive and mechanical effects. In this review, important elements in the system, piezoelectricity nanomaterial and ultrasound, are first analyzed. Then, we summarize recent studies categorized into five kinds, nervous system diseases treatment, musculoskeletal tissues treatment, cancer treatment, anti-bacteria therapy, and others, to prove two main mechanics under activated piezoelectricity: one is biological change on a cellular level, the other is a piezo-chemical reaction. However, there are still technical problems to be solved and regulation processes to be completed before widespread use. The core problems include how to accurately measure piezoelectricity properties, how to concisely control electricity release through complex energy transfer processes, and a deeper understanding of related bioeffects. If these problems are conquered in the future, piezoelectric nanomaterials activated by ultrasound will provide a new pathway and realize application in disease treatment."

"37240238","Liquid Biopsy in Lung Cancer: Biomarkers for the Management of Recurrence and Metastasis.","Int J Mol Sci","Liquid biopsies have emerged as a promising tool for the detection of metastases as well as local and regional recurrence in lung cancer. Liquid biopsy tests involve analyzing a patient's blood, urine, or other body fluids for the detection of biomarkers, including circulating tumor cells or tumor-derived DNA/RNA that have been shed into the bloodstream. Studies have shown that liquid biopsies can detect lung cancer metastases with high accuracy and sensitivity, even before they are visible on imaging scans. Such tests are valuable for early intervention and personalized treatment, aiming to improve patient outcomes. Liquid biopsies are also minimally invasive compared to traditional tissue biopsies, which require the removal of a sample of the tumor for further analysis. This makes liquid biopsies a more convenient and less risky option for patients, particularly those who are not good candidates for invasive procedures due to other medical conditions. While liquid biopsies for lung cancer metastases and relapse are still being developed and validated, they hold great promise for improving the detection and treatment of this deadly disease. Herein, we summarize available and novel approaches to liquid biopsy tests for lung cancer metastases and recurrence detection and describe their applications in clinical practice."

Here, we developed a general CRISPR-based platform to perform four functions and target multiple genome loci encoded in a single transcript. To establish multiple functions for multiple loci targets, we fused four RNA hairpins, MS2, PP7, com and boxB, to stem-loops of gRNA (guide RNA) scaffolds, separately. The RNA-hairpin-binding domains MCP, PCP, Com and λN22 were fused with different functional effectors. These paired combinations of cognate-RNA hairpins and RNA-binding proteins generated the simultaneous, independent regulation of multiple target genes. To ensure that all proteins and RNAs are expressed in one transcript, multiple gRNAs were constructed in a tandemly arrayed tRNA (transfer RNA)-gRNA architecture, and the triplex sequence was cloned between the protein-coding sequences and the tRNA-gRNA array. By leveraging this system, we illustrate the transcriptional activation, transcriptional repression, DNA methylation and DNA demethylation of endogenous targets using up to 16 individual CRISPR gRNAs delivered on a single transcript. This system provides a powerful platform to investigate synthetic biology questions and engineer complex-phenotype medical applications."

The specific molecular pathway(s) and biomarker(s) that distinguish AD from other neurodegenerative diseases and reflect the disease progression are still not well studied.Four frontal cortical datasets of AD were integrated to conduct differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and functional gene enrichment analyses. The transcriptional changes after the integrated frontal cortical datasets subtracting the cerebellar dataset of AD were further compared with frontal cortical datasets of frontotemporal dementia and Huntingdon's disease to identify AD-frontal-associated gene expression. Integrated bioinformatic analysis and machine-learning strategies were applied for screening and determining diagnostic biomarkers, which were further validated in another two frontal cortical datasets of AD by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves.Six hundred and twenty-six DEGs were identified as AD frontal associated, including 580 downregulated genes and 46 upregulated genes. The functional enrichment analysis revealed that immune response and oxidative stress were enriched in AD patients. Decorin (DCN) and regulator of G protein signaling 1 (RGS1) were screened as diagnostic biomarkers in distinguishing AD from frontotemporal dementia and Huntingdon's disease of AD. The diagnostic effects of DCN and RGS1 for AD were further validated in another two datasets of AD: the areas under the curve (AUCs) reached 0.8148 and 0.8262 in GSE33000, and 0.8595 and 0.8675 in GSE44770. There was a better value for AD diagnosis when combining performances of DCN and RGS1 with the AUCs of 0.863 and 0.869. Further, DCN mRNA level was correlated to CDR (Clinical Dementia Rating scale) score (r= 0.5066,p= 0.0058) and Braak staging (r= 0.3348,p= 0.0549).DCN and RGS1 associated with the immune response may be useful biomarkers for diagnosing AD and distinguishing the disease from frontotemporal dementia and Huntingdon's disease.

The large majority of existing studies has characterized differentiation at the level of individual molecular profiles, such as the transcriptome or the proteome. To obtain a more comprehensive view, we measured protein, mRNA and microRNA abundance during retinoic acid-driven differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells. We found that mRNA and protein abundance are typically only weakly correlated across time. To understand this finding, we developed a hierarchical dynamical model that allowed us to integrate all data sets. This model was able to explain mRNA-protein discordance for most genes and identified instances of potential microRNA-mediated regulation. Overexpression or depletion of microRNAs identified by the model, followed by RNA sequencing and protein quantification, were used to follow up on the predictions of the model. Overall, our study shows how multi-omics integration by a dynamical model could be used to nominate candidate regulators.Copyright: © 2023 van den Berg et al.

"37235322","False Positives in Brucellosis Serology: Wrong Bait and Wrong Pond?","Trop Med Infect Dis","This review summarizes the status of resolving the problem of false positive serologic results (FPSR) inBrucellaserology, compiles our knowledge on the molecular background of the problem, and highlights some prospects for its resolution. The molecular basis of the FPSRs is reviewed through analyzing the components of the cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria, especially the surface lipopolysaccharide (LPS) with details related to brucellae. After evaluating the efforts that have been made to solve target specificity problems of serologic tests, the following conclusions can be drawn: (i) resolving the FPSR problem requires a deeper understanding than we currently possess, both ofBrucellaimmunology and of the current serology tests; (ii) the practical solutions will be as expensive as the related research; and (iii) the root cause of FPSRs is the application of the same type of antigen (S-type LPS) in the currently approved tests. Thus, new approaches are necessary to resolve the problems stemming from FPSR. Such approaches suggested by this paper are: (i) the application of antigens from R-type bacteria; or (ii) the further development of specific brucellin-based skin tests; or (iii) the application of microbial cell-free DNA as analyte, whose approach is detailed in this paper."
"37245029","Epigenetics of cognition and behavior: insights from Mendelian disorders of epigenetic machinery.","J Neurodev Disord","Epigenetics, one mechanism by which gene expression can change without any changes to the DNA sequence, was described nearly a century ago. However, the importance of epigenetic processes to neurodevelopment and higher order neurological functions like cognition and behavior is only now being realized. A group of disorders known as the Mendelian disorders of the epigenetic machinery are caused by the altered function of epigenetic machinery proteins, which consequently affects downstream expression of many genes. These disorders almost universally have cognitive dysfunction and behavioral issues as core features. Here, we review what is known about the neurodevelopmental phenotypes of some key examples of these disorders divided into categories based on the underlying function of the affected protein. Understanding these Mendelian disorders of the epigenetic machinery can illuminate the role of epigenetic regulation in typical brain function and can lead to future therapies and better management for a host of neurodevelopmental and neuropsychological disorders.© 2023.

"37234776","Immunosuppressive cells in oncolytic virotherapy for glioma: challenges and solutions.","Front Cell Infect Microbiol","Glioblastoma is a highly aggressive form of brain cancer characterized by the abundance of myeloid lineage cells in the tumor microenvironment. Tumor-associated macrophages and microglia (TAM) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), play a pivotal role in promoting immune suppression and tumor progression. Oncolytic viruses (OVs) are self-amplifying cytotoxic agents that can stimulate local anti-tumor immune responses and have the potential to suppress immunosuppressive myeloid cells and recruit tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes (TILs) to the tumor site, leading to an adaptive immune response against tumors. However, the impact of OV therapy on the tumor-resident myeloid population and the subsequent immune responses are not yet fully understood. This review provides an overview of how TAM and MDSC respond to different types of OVs, and combination therapeutics that target the myeloid population to promote anti-tumor immune responses in the glioma microenvironment.Copyright © 2023 Liu, Piranlioglu, Ye, Shu, Lei and Nakashima."
"37214839","Parallels and contrasts between the cnidarian and bilaterian maternal-to-zygotic transition are revealed in Hydractinia embryos.","bioRxiv","Embryogenesis requires coordinated gene regulatory activities early on that establish the trajectory of subsequent development, during a period called the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT). The MZT comprises transcriptional activation of the embryonic genome and post-transcriptional regulation of egg-inherited maternal mRNA. Investigation into the MZT in animals has focused almost exclusively on bilaterians, which include all classical models such as flies, worms, sea urchin, and vertebrates, thus limiting our capacity to understand the gene regulatory paradigms uniting the MZT across all animals. Here, we elucidate the MZT of a non-bilaterian, the cnidarianHydractinia symbiolongicarpus. Using parallel poly(A)-selected and non poly(A)-dependent RNA-seq approaches, we find that the Hydractinia MZT is composed of regulatory activities analogous to many bilaterians, including cytoplasmic readenylation of maternally contributed mRNA, delayed genome activation, and separate phases of maternal mRNA deadenylation and degradation that likely depend on both maternally and zygotically encoded clearance factors, including microRNAs. But we also observe massive upregulation of histone genes and an expanded repertoire of predicted H4K20 methyltransferases, aspects thus far unique to the Hydractinia MZT and potentially underlying a novel mode of early embryonic chromatin regulation. Thus, similar regulatory strategies with taxon-specific elaboration underlie the MZT in both bilaterian and non-bilaterian embryos, providing insight into how an essential developmental transition may have arisen in ancestral animals."
"37216018","Integrative big transcriptomics data analysis implicates crucial role of MUC13 in pancreatic cancer.","Comput Struct Biotechnol J","Big data analysis holds a considerable influence on several aspects of biomedical health science. It permits healthcare providers to gain insights from large and complex datasets, leading to improvements in the understanding, diagnosis, medication, and restraint of pathological conditions including cancer. The incidences of pancreatic cancer (PanCa) are sharply rising, and it will become the second leading cause of cancer related deaths by 2030. Various traditional biomarkers are currently in use but are not optimal in sensitivity and specificity. Herein, we determine the role of a new transmembrane glycoprotein, MUC13, as a potential biomarker of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) by using integrative big data mining and transcriptomic approaches. This study is helpful to identify and appropriately segment the data related to MUC13, which are scattered in various data sets. The assembling of the meaningful data, representation strategy was used to investigate the MUC13 associated information for the better understanding regarding its structural, expression profiling, genomic variants, phosphorylation motifs, and functional enrichment pathways. For further in-depth investigation, we have adopted several popular transcriptomic methods like DEGseq2, coding and non-coding transcript, single cell seq analysis, and functional enrichment analysis. All these analyzes suggest the presence of three nonsense MUC13 genomic transcripts, two protein transcripts, short MUC13 (s-MUC13, non-tumorigenic or ntMUC13), and long MUC13 (L-MUC13, tumorigenic or tMUC13), several important phosphorylation sites in tMUC13. Altogether, this data confirms that importance of tMUC13 as a potential biomarker, therapeutic target of PanCa, and its significance in pancreatic pathobiology.© 2023 The Authors."

"37242136","Beyond BMI.","Nutrients","This review examined the origins of the concept of the BMI in the work of Quetelet in the 19th century and its subsequent adoption and use in tracking the course of the pandemic of obesity during the 20th century. In this respect, it has provided a valuable international epidemiological tool that should be retained. However, as noted in this review, the BMI is deficient in at least three ways. First, it does not measure body fat distribution, which is probably a more important guide to the risk of excess adiposity than the BMI itself. Second, it is not a very good measure of body fat, and thus its application to the diagnosis of obesity or excess adiposity in the individual patient is limited. Finally, the BMI does not provide any insights into the heterogeneity of obesity or its genetic, metabolic, physiological or psychological origins. Some of these mechanisms are traced in this review."
"37072495","Primary cilia as dynamic and diverse signalling hubs in development and disease.","Nat Rev Genet","Primary cilia, antenna-like sensory organelles protruding from the surface of most vertebrate cell types, are essential for regulating signalling pathways during development and adult homeostasis. Mutations in genes affecting cilia cause an overlapping spectrum of >30 human diseases and syndromes, the ciliopathies. Given the immense structural and functional diversity of the mammalian cilia repertoire, there is a growing disconnect between patient genotype and associated phenotypes, with variable severity and expressivity characteristic of the ciliopathies as a group. Recent technological developments are rapidly advancing our understanding of the complex mechanisms that control biogenesis and function of primary cilia across a range of cell types and are starting to tackle this diversity. Here, we examine the structural and functional diversity of primary cilia, their dynamic regulation in different cellular and developmental contexts and their disruption in disease.© 2023.
