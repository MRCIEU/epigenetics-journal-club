37239458,Novel Differentially Methylated Regions Identified by Genome-Wide DNA Methylation Analyses Contribute to Racial Disparities in Childhood Obesity.,Genes (Basel),"The magnitude of the childhood obesity epidemic and its effects on public health has accelerated the pursuit of practical preventative measures. Epigenetics is one subject that holds a lot of promise, despite being relatively new. The study of potentially heritable variations in gene expression that do not require modifications to the underlying DNA sequence is known as epigenetics. Here, we used Illumina MethylationEPIC BeadChip Array to identify differentially methylated regions in DNA isolated from saliva between normal weight (NW) and overweight/obese (OW/OB) children and between European American (EA) and African American (AA) children. A total of 3133 target IDs (associated with 2313 genes) were differentially methylated (p< 0.05) between NW and OW/OB children. In OW/OB children, 792 target IDs were hypermethylated and 2341 were hypomethylated compared to NW. Similarly, in the racial groups EA and AA, a total of 1239 target IDs corresponding to 739 genes were significantly differentially methylated in which 643 target IDs were hypermethylated and 596 were hypomethylated in the AA compared to EA participants. Along with this, the study identified novel genes that could contribute to the epigenetic regulation of childhood obesity."
37239390,Differential Methylation of Telomere-Related Genes Is Associated with Kidney Disease in Individuals with Type 1 Diabetes.,Genes (Basel),"Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) represents a major global health problem. Accelerated ageing is a key feature of DKD and, therefore, characteristics of accelerated ageing may provide useful biomarkers or therapeutic targets. Harnessing multi-omics, features affecting telomere biology and any associated methylome dysregulation in DKD were explored. Genotype data for nuclear genome polymorphisms in telomere-related genes were extracted from genome-wide case-control association data (n = 823 DKD/903 controls; n = 247 end-stage kidney disease (ESKD)/1479 controls). Telomere length was established using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Quantitative methylation values for 1091 CpG sites in telomere-related genes were extracted from epigenome-wide case-control association data (n = 150 DKD/100 controls). Telomere length was significantly shorter in older age groups (p= 7.6 × 10-6). Telomere length was also significantly reduced (p= 6.6 × 10-5) in DKD versus control individuals, with significance remaining after covariate adjustment (p= 0.028). DKD and ESKD were nominally associated with telomere-related genetic variation, with Mendelian randomisation highlighting no significant association between genetically predicted telomere length and kidney disease. A total of 496 CpG sites in 212 genes reached epigenome-wide significance (p≤ 10-8) for DKD association, and 412 CpG sites in 193 genes for ESKD. Functional prediction revealed differentially methylated genes were enriched for Wnt signalling involvement. Harnessing previously published RNA-sequencing datasets, potential targets where epigenetic dysregulation may result in altered gene expression were revealed, useful as potential diagnostic and therapeutic targets for intervention."
37233989,Dietary and supplemental intake of vitamins C and E is associated with altered DNA methylation in an epigenome-wide association study meta-analysis.,Epigenetics,"Dietary intake of antioxidants such as vitamins C and E protect against oxidative stress, and may also be associated with altered DNA methylation patterns.We meta-analysed epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) results from 11,866 participants across eight population-based cohorts to evaluate the association between self-reported dietary and supplemental intake of vitamins C and E with DNA methylation. EWAS were adjusted for age, sex, BMI, caloric intake, blood cell type proportion, smoking status, alcohol consumption, and technical covariates. Significant results of the meta-analysis were subsequently evaluated in gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and expression quantitative trait methylation (eQTM) analysis.In meta-analysis, methylation at 4,656 CpG sites was significantly associated with vitamin C intake at FDR ≤ 0.05. The most significant CpG sites associated with vitamin C (at FDR ≤ 0.01) were enriched for pathways associated with systems development and cell signalling in GSEA, and were associated with downstream expression of genes enriched in the immune response in eQTM analysis. Furthermore, methylation at 160 CpG sites was significantly associated with vitamin E intake at FDR ≤ 0.05, but GSEA and eQTM analysis of the top most significant CpG sites associated with vitamin E did not identify significant enrichment of any biological pathways investigated.We identified significant associations of many CpG sites with vitamin C and E intake, and our results suggest that vitamin C intake may be associated with systems development and the immune response."
37231515,Epigenomic profiling of isolated blood cell types reveals highly specific B cell smoking signatures and links to disease risk.,Clin Epigenetics,"Tobacco smoking alters the DNA methylation profiles of immune cells which may underpin some of the pathogenesis of smoking-associated diseases. To link smoking-driven epigenetic effects in specific immune cell types with disease risk, we isolated six leukocyte subtypes, CD14+ monocytes, CD15+ granulocytes, CD19+ B cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and CD56+ natural killer cells, from whole blood of 67 healthy adult smokers and 74 nonsmokers for epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) using Illumina 450k and EPIC methylation arrays.Numbers of smoking-associated differentially methylated sites (smCpGs) at genome-wide significance (p < 1.2 × 10-7) varied widely across cell types, from 5 smCpGs in CD8+ T cells to 111 smCpGs in CD19+ B cells. We found unique smoking effects in each cell type, some of which were not apparent in whole blood. Methylation-based deconvolution to estimate B cell subtypes revealed that smokers had 7.2% (p = 0.033) less naïve B cells. Adjusting for naïve and memory B cell proportions in EWAS and RNA-seq allowed the identification of genes enriched for B cell activation-related cytokine signaling pathways, Th1/Th2 responses, and hematopoietic cancers. Integrating with large-scale public datasets, 62 smCpGs were among CpGs associated with health-relevant EWASs. Furthermore, 74 smCpGs had reproducible methylation quantitative trait loci single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were in complete linkage disequilibrium with genome-wide association study SNPs, associating with lung function, disease risks, and other traits.We observed blood cell-type-specific smCpGs, a naïve-to-memory shift among B cells, and by integrating genome-wide datasets, we identified their potential links to disease risks and health traits.© 2023.

37230663,Maternal Periconceptional Folic Acid Supplementation and DNA Methylation Patterns in Adolescent Offspring.,J Nutr,"Folate, including the folic acid form, is a key component of the one-carbon metabolic pathway used for DNA methylation. Changes in DNA methylation patterns during critical development periods are associated with disease outcomes and are associated with changes in nutritional status in pregnancy. The long-term impact of periconceptional folic acid supplementation on DNA methylation patterns is unknown.To determine the long-term impact of periconceptional folic acid supplementation on DNA methylation patterns, we examined the association of the recommended dosage (400 μg/d) and time period (periconceptional before pregnancy through first trimester) of folic acid supplementation with the DNA methylation patterns in the offspring at age 14-17 y compared with offspring with no supplementation.Two geographic sites in China from the 1993-1995 Community Intervention Program of folic acid supplementation were selected for the follow-up study. DNA methylation at 402,730 CpG sites was assessed using saliva samples from 89 mothers and 179 adolescents (89 male). The mean age at saliva collection was 40 y among mothers (range: 35-54 y) and 15 y among adolescents (range: 14-17 y). Epigenome-wide analyses were conducted to assess the interactions of periconceptional folic acid exposure, the 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR)-C677T genotype, and epigenome-wide DNA methylation controlling for offspring sex, geographic region, and background cell composition in the saliva.In the primary outcome, no significant differences were observed in epigenome-wide methylation patterns between adolescents exposed and those non-exposed to maternal periconceptional folic acid supplementation after adjustment for potential confounders [false discovery rate (FDR) P values < 0.05]. The MTHFR-C677T genotype did not modify this lack of association (FDR P values < 0.05).Overall, there were no differences in DNA methylation between adolescents who were exposed during the critical developmental window and those not exposed to the recommended periconceptional/first-trimester dosage of folic acid.Copyright © 2022 American Society for Nutrition."
37218167,Detecting aberrant DNA methylation in Illumina DNA methylation arrays: a toolbox and recommendations for its use.,Epigenetics,"In this study, our goal was to determine probe-specific thresholds for identifying aberrant, or outlying, DNA methylation and to provide guidance on the relative merits of using continuous or outlier methylation data. To construct a reference database, we downloaded Illumina Human 450K array data for more than 2,000 normal samples, characterized the distribution of DNA methylation and derived probe-specific thresholds for identifying aberrations. We made the decision to restrict our reference database to solid normal tissue and morphologically normal tissue found adjacent to solid tumours, excluding blood which has very distinctive patterns of DNA methylation. Next, we explored the utility of our outlier thresholds in several analyses that are commonly performed on DNA methylation data. Outliers are as effective as the full continuous dataset for simple tasks, like distinguishing tumour tissue from normal, but becomes less useful as the complexity of the problem increases. We developed an R package called OutlierMeth containing our thresholds, as well as functions for applying them to data."
37231098,"Gene expression in African Americans, Puerto Ricans and Mexican Americans reveals ancestry-specific patterns of genetic architecture.",Nat Genet,"We explored ancestry-related differences in the genetic architecture of whole-blood gene expression using whole-genome and RNA sequencing data from 2,733 African Americans, Puerto Ricans and Mexican Americans. We found that heritability of gene expression significantly increased with greater proportions of African genetic ancestry and decreased with higher proportions of Indigenous American ancestry, reflecting the relationship between heterozygosity and genetic variance. Among heritable protein-coding genes, the prevalence of ancestry-specific expression quantitative trait loci (anc-eQTLs) was 30% in African ancestry and 8% for Indigenous American ancestry segments. Most anc-eQTLs (89%) were driven by population differences in allele frequency. Transcriptome-wide association analyses of multi-ancestry summary statistics for 28 traits identified 79% more gene-trait associations using transcriptome prediction models trained in our admixed population than models trained using data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression project. Our study highlights the importance of measuring gene expression across large and ancestrally diverse populations for enabling new discoveries and reducing disparities.© 2023. The Author(s)."
37225790,A longitudinal study of the association between attending cultural events and coronary heart disease.,Commun Med (Lond),"The experiences of art and music are an essential part of human life and this study aimed to examine the longitudinal association between cultural participation and coronary heart disease.This was a longitudinal study on a randomly selected representative adult cohort (n = 3296) of the Swedish population. The study period was over 36 years (1982-2017) with three separate eight-year interval measurements of cultural exposure (for example, visiting theatres and museums) starting in 1982/83. The outcome was coronary heart disease during the study period. Marginal structural Cox models with inverse probability weighting were used to account for time-varying weights of the exposure and potential confounders during the follow-up. The associations were also examined through a time-varying Cox proportional hazard regression model.Cultural participation shows a graded association, the higher the exposure the lower the risk of coronary heart disease; the hazard ratio was 0.66 (95% confidence interval, 0.50 to 0.86) for coronary heart disease in participants with the highest level of cultural exposure compared with the lowest level.Although causality cannot be determined due to the remaining risk of residual confounding and bias, the use of marginal structural Cox models with inverse probability weighting strengthens the evidence for a potentially causal association with cardiovascular health, which warrants further studies.© 2023.

37209526,Integrated fragmentomic profile and 5-Hydroxymethylcytosine of capture-based low-pass sequencing data enables pan-cancer detection via cfDNA.,Transl Oncol,"Using epigenetic markers and fragmentomics of cell-free DNA for cancer detection has been proven applicable.We further investigated the diagnostic potential of combining two features (epigenetic markers and fragmentomic information) of cell-free DNA for detecting various types of cancers. To do this, we extracted cfDNA fragmentomic features from 191 whole-genome sequencing data and studied them in 396 low-pass 5hmC sequencing data, which included four common cancer types and control samples.In our analysis of 5hmC sequencing data from cancer samples, we observed aberrant ultra-long fragments (220-500 bp) that differed from normal samples in terms of both size and coverage profile. These fragments played a significant role in predicting cancer. Leveraging the ability to detect cfDNA hydroxymethylation and fragmentomic markers simultaneously in low-pass 5hmC sequencing data, we developed an integrated model that incorporated 63 features representing both fragmentomic features and hydroxymethylation signatures. This model achieved high sensitivity and specificity for pan-cancer detection (88.52% and 82.35%, respectively).We showed that fragmentomic information in 5hmC sequencing data is an ideal marker for cancer detection and that it shows high performance in low-pass sequencing data.Copyright © 2023.

37239934,Assessing the Differential Methylation Analysis Quality for Microarray and NGS Platforms.,Int J Mol Sci,"Differential methylation (DM) is actively recruited in different types of fundamental and translational studies. Currently, microarray- and NGS-based approaches for methylation analysis are the most widely used with multiple statistical models designed to extract differential methylation signatures. The benchmarking of DM models is challenging due to the absence of gold standard data. In this study, we analyze an extensive number of publicly available NGS and microarray datasets with divergent and widely utilized statistical models and apply the recently suggested and validated rank-statistic-based approach Hobotnica to evaluate the quality of their results. Overall, microarray-based methods demonstrate more robust and convergent results, while NGS-based models are highly dissimilar. Tests on the simulated NGS data tend to overestimate the quality of the DM methods and therefore are recommended for use with caution. Evaluation of the top 10 DMC and top 100 DMC in addition to the not-subset signature also shows more stable results for microarray data. Summing up, given the observed heterogeneity in NGS methylation data, the evaluation of newly generated methylation signatures is a crucial step in DM analysis. The Hobotnica metric is coordinated with previously developed quality metrics and provides a robust, sensitive, and informative estimation of methods' performance and DM signatures' quality in the absence of gold standard data solving a long-existing problem in DM analysis."
37196634,Molecular signatures of post-traumatic stress disorder in war-zone-exposed veteran and active-duty soldiers.,Cell Rep Med,"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a multisystem syndrome. Integration of systems-level multi-modal datasets can provide a molecular understanding of PTSD. Proteomic, metabolomic, and epigenomic assays are conducted on blood samples of two cohorts of well-characterized PTSD cases and controls: 340 veterans and 180 active-duty soldiers. All participants had been deployed to Iraq and/or Afghanistan and exposed to military-service-related criterion A trauma. Molecular signatures are identified from a discovery cohort of 218 veterans (109/109 PTSD+/-). Identified molecular signatures are tested in 122 separate veterans (62/60 PTSD+/-) and in 180 active-duty soldiers (PTSD+/-). Molecular profiles are computationally integrated with upstream regulators (genetic/methylation/microRNAs) and functional units (mRNAs/proteins/metabolites). Reproducible molecular features of PTSD are identified, including activated inflammation, oxidative stress, metabolic dysregulation, and impaired angiogenesis. These processes may play a role in psychiatric and physical comorbidities, including impaired repair/wound healing mechanisms and cardiovascular, metabolic, and psychiatric diseases.Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).

37137305,Massively parallel base editing to map variant effects in human hematopoiesis.,Cell,"Systematic evaluation of the impact of genetic variants is critical for the study and treatment of human physiology and disease. While specific mutations can be introduced by genome engineering, we still lack scalable approaches that are applicable to the important setting of primary cells, such as blood and immune cells. Here, we describe the development of massively parallel base-editing screens in human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Such approaches enable functional screens for variant effects across any hematopoietic differentiation state. Moreover, they allow for rich phenotyping through single-cell RNA sequencing readouts and separately for characterization of editing outcomes through pooled single-cell genotyping. We efficiently design improved leukemia immunotherapy approaches, comprehensively identify non-coding variants modulating fetal hemoglobin expression, define mechanisms regulating hematopoietic differentiation, and probe the pathogenicity of uncharacterized disease-associated variants. These strategies will advance effective and high-throughput variant-to-function mapping in human hematopoiesis to identify the causes of diverse diseases.Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).

37253775,Deep learning model accurately classifies metastatic tumors from primary tumors based on mutational signatures.,Sci Rep,"Metastatic propagation is the leading cause of death for most cancers. Prediction and elucidation of metastatic process is crucial for the treatment of cancer. Even though somatic mutations have been linked to tumorigenesis and metastasis, it is less explored whether metastatic events can be identified through genomic mutational signatures, which are concise descriptions of the mutational processes. Here, we developed MetaWise, a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model, by applying mutational signatures as input features calculated from Whole-Exome Sequencing (WES) data of TCGA and other metastatic cohorts. This model can accurately classify metastatic tumors from primary tumors and outperform traditional machine learning (ML) models and a deep learning (DL) model, DiaDeL. Signatures of non-coding mutations also have a major impact on the model's performance. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Local Surrogate (LIME) analyses identify several mutational signatures which are directly correlated to metastatic spread in cancers, including APOBEC-mutagenesis, UV-induced signatures, and DNA damage response deficiency signatures.© 2023.

36400018,Evaluation of cell-free DNA approaches for multi-cancer early detection,Cancer Cell,"In the Circulating Cell-free Genome Atlas (NCT02889978) substudy 1, we evaluate several approaches for a circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA)-based multi-cancer early detection (MCED) test by defining clinical limit of detection (LOD) based on circulating tumor allele fraction (cTAF), enabling performance comparisons. Among 10 machine-learning classifiers trained on the same samples and independently validated, when evaluated at 98% specificity, those using whole-genome (WG) methylation, single nucleotide variants with paired white blood cell background removal, and combined scores from classifiers evaluated in this study show the highest cancer signal detection sensitivities. Compared with clinical stage and tumor type, cTAF is a more significant predictor of classifier performance and may more closely reflect tumor biology. Clinical LODs mirror relative sensitivities for all approaches. The WG methylation feature best predicts cancer signal origin. WG methylation is the most promising technology for MCED and informs development of a targeted methylation MCED test."
37190212,Sequence-Based Platforms for Discovering Biomarkers in Liquid Biopsy of Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer,Cancers (Basel),"Lung cancer detection and monitoring are hampered by a lack of sensitive biomarkers, which results in diagnosis at late stages and difficulty in tracking response to treatment. Recent developments have established liquid biopsies as promising non-invasive methods for detecting biomarkers in lung cancer patients. With concurrent advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies and bioinformatics tools, new approaches for biomarker discovery have emerged. In this article, we survey established and emerging biomarker discovery methods using nucleic acid materials derived from bodily fluids in the context of lung cancer. We introduce nucleic acid biomarkers extracted from liquid biopsies and outline biological sources and methods of isolation. We discuss next-generation sequencing (NGS) platforms commonly used to identify novel biomarkers and describe how these have been applied to liquid biopsy. We highlight emerging biomarker discovery methods, including applications of long-read sequencing, fragmentomics, whole-genome amplification methods for single-cell analysis, and whole-genome methylation assays. Finally, we discuss advanced bioinformatics tools, describing methods for processing NGS data, as well as recently developed software tailored for liquid biopsy biomarker detection, which holds promise for early diagnosis of lung cancer."
36945560,Potentially causal associations between placental DNA methylation and schizophrenia and other neuropsychiatric disorders,medRxiv,"Increasing evidence supports the role of placenta in neurodevelopment and potentially, in the later onset of neuropsychiatric disorders. Recently, methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTL) and interaction QTL (iQTL) maps have proven useful to understand SNP-genome wide association study (GWAS) relationships, otherwise missed by conventional expression QTLs. In this context, we propose that part of the genetic predisposition to complex neuropsychiatric disorders acts through placental DNA methylation (DNAm). We constructed the first public placental cis -mQTL database including nearly eight million mQTLs calculated in 368 fetal placenta DNA samples from the INMA project, ran cell type- and gestational age-imQTL models and combined those data with the summary statistics of the largest GWAS on 10 neuropsychiatric disorders using Summary-based Mendelian Randomization (SMR) and colocalization. Finally, we evaluated the influence of the DNAm sites identified on placental gene expression in the RICHS cohort. We found that placental cis -mQTLs are highly enriched in placenta-specific active chromatin regions, and useful to map the etiology of neuropsychiatric disorders at prenatal stages. Specifically, part of the genetic burden for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder confers risk through placental DNAm. The potential causality of several of the observed associations is reinforced by secondary association signals identified in conditional analyses, regional pleiotropic methylation signals associated to the same disorder, and cell type- imQTLs, additionally associated to the expression levels of relevant immune genes in placenta. In conclusion, the genetic risk of several neuropsychiatric disorders could operate, at least in part, through DNAm and associated gene expression in placenta."
37262156,The landscape of tolerated genetic variation in humans and primates,Science,"Personalized genome sequencing has revealed millions of genetic differences between individuals, but our understanding of their clinical relevance remains largely incomplete. To systematically decipher the effects of human genetic variants, we obtained whole-genome sequencing data for 809 individuals from 233 primate species and identified 4.3 million common protein-altering variants with orthologs in humans. We show that these variants can be inferred to have nondeleterious effects in humans based on their presence at high allele frequencies in other primate populations. We use this resource to classify 6% of all possible human protein-altering variants as likely benign and impute the pathogenicity of the remaining 94% of variants with deep learning, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy for diagnosing pathogenic variants in patients with genetic diseases."
