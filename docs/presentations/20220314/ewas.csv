35236238,Epigenetics,Meditarranean diet during pregnancy,cord blood,2802 pregnancies (PACE consortium),1,Maternal Mediterranean diet in pregnancy and newborn DNA methylation: a meta-analysis in the PACE Consortium.,"Higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet during pregnancy is related to a lower risk of preterm birth and to better offspring cardiometabolic health. DNA methylation may be an underlying biological mechanism. We evaluated whether maternal adherence to the Mediterranean diet was associated with offspring cord blood DNA methylation.We meta-analysed epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) of maternal adherence to the Mediterranean diet during pregnancy and offspring cord blood DNA methylation in 2802 mother-child pairs from five cohorts. We calculated the relative Mediterranean diet (rMED) score with range 0-18 and an adjusted rMED excluding alcohol (rMEDp, range 0-16). DNA methylation was measured using Illumina 450K arrays. We used robust linear regression modelling adjusted for child sex, maternal education, age, smoking, body mass index, energy intake, batch, and cell types. We performed several functional analyses and examined the persistence of differential DNA methylation into childhood (4.5-7.8 y).rMEDp was associated with cord blood DNA methylation at cg23757341 (0.064% increase in DNA methylation per 1-point increase in the rMEDp score, SE = 0.011,P= 2.41 × 10-8). This cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) site maps toWNT5B, associated with adipogenesis and glycaemic phenotypes. We did not identify associations with childhood gene expression, nor did we find enriched biological pathways. The association did not persist into childhood.In this meta-analysis, maternal adherence to the Mediterranean diet (excluding alcohol) during pregnancy was associated with cord blood DNA methylation level at cg23757341. Potential mediation of DNA methylation in associations with offspring health requires further study."
35237744,Epigenet Insights,prenatal stress,cord blood,358,null,Periconception and Prenatal Exposure to Maternal Perceived Stress and Cord Blood DNA Methylation.,"Maternal prenatal stress is associated with physiologic and adverse mental health outcomes in the offspring, but the underlying biologic mechanisms are unknown. We examined the associations of maternal perceived stress, including preconception exposure, with DNA methylation (DNAm) alterations in the cord blood buffy coats of 358 singleton infants.Maternal perceived stress was measured prior to and throughout pregnancy in a cohort of women enrolled in Effects of Aspirin in Gestation and Reproduction Trial (EAGeR) trial. Perceived stress assessments based on a standardized Likert-scale were obtained in periconception (~2 months preconception and 2-8 weeks of gestation) and pregnancy (8-36 weeks of gestation). Cumulative perceived stress was estimated by calculating the predicted area under the curve of stress reported prior to and during pregnancy. DNAm was measured by the Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip. Multivariable robust linear regression was used to assess associations of perceived stress with individual CpG probes.Based on a 0 to 3 scale, average reported preconception and early pregnancy stress were 0.76 (0.60) and 0.67 (0.50), respectively. Average mid- to late-pregnancy stress, based on a 0 to 10 scale, was 4.9 (1.6). Neither periconception nor pregnancy perceived stress were associated with individual CpG sites in neonatal cord blood (all false discovery rate [FDR] >5%).No effects of maternal perceived stress exposure on array-wide cord blood neonatal methylation differences were found.© The Author(s) 2022."
35266797,Environ Health Perspect,pregnancy perfluoroalkyl exposure,cord blood; peripheral blood,266; 160,435 (6 replicated),Gestational Perfluoroalkyl Substance Exposure and DNA Methylation at Birth and 12 Years of Age: A Longitudinal Epigenome-Wide Association Study.,"DNA methylation alterations may underlie associations between gestational perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) exposure and later-life health outcomes. To the best of our knowledge, no longitudinal studies have examined the associations between gestational PFAS and DNA methylation.We examined associations of gestational PFAS exposure with longitudinal DNA methylation measures at birth and in adolescence using the Health Outcomes and Measures of the Environment (HOME) Study (2003-2006; Cincinnati, Ohio).We quantified serum concentrations of perfluorooctanoate (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorononanoate (PFNA), and perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) in mothers during pregnancy. We measured DNA methylation in cord blood (n=266) and peripheral leukocytes at 12 years of age (n=160) using the Illumina HumanMethylation EPIC BeadChip. We analyzed associations betweenlog2-transformedPFAS concentrations and repeated DNA methylation measures using linear regression with generalized estimating equations. We included interaction terms between children's age and gestational PFAS. We performed Gene Ontology enrichment analysis to identify molecular pathways. We used Project Viva (1999-2002; Boston, Massachusetts) to replicate significant associations.After adjusting for covariates, 435 cytosine-guanine dinucleotide (CpG) sites were associated with PFAS (false discovery rate,q<0.05). Specifically, we identified 2 CpGs for PFOS, 12 for PFOA, 8 for PFHxS, and 413 for PFNA; none overlapped. Among these, 2 CpGs for PFOA and 4 for PFNA were replicated in Project Viva. Some of the PFAS-associated CpG sites annotated to gene regions related to cancers, cognitive health, cardiovascular disease, and kidney function. We found little evidence that the associations between PFAS and DNA methylation differed by children's age.In these longitudinal data, PFAS biomarkers were associated with differences in several CpGs at birth and at 12 years of age in or near genes linked to some PFAS-associated health outcomes. Future studies should examine whether DNA methylation mediates associations between gestational PFAS exposure and health. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP10118."
35236959,Mol Psychiatry,antipsychotic drugs,caudate nucleus,296,"null (by wgbs, many gene expression differences by rna-seq)",Molecular phenotypes associated with antipsychotic drugs in the human caudate nucleus.,"Antipsychotic drugs are the current first-line of treatment for schizophrenia and other psychotic conditions. However, their molecular effects on the human brain are poorly studied, due to difficulty of tissue access and confounders associated with disease status. Here we examine differences in gene expression and DNA methylation associated with positive antipsychotic drug toxicology status in the human caudate nucleus. We find no genome-wide significant differences in DNA methylation, but abundant differences in gene expression. These gene expression differences are overall quite similar to gene expression differences between schizophrenia cases and controls. Interestingly, gene expression differences based on antipsychotic toxicology are different between brain regions, potentially due to affected cell type differences. We finally assess similarities with effects in a mouse model, which finds some overlapping effects but many differences as well. As a first look at the molecular effects of antipsychotics in the human brain, the lack of epigenetic effects is unexpected, possibly because long term treatment effects may be relatively stable for extended periods.© 2022.
