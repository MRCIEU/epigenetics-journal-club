no,DNAm age,35255955,Deconvolution of the epigenetic age discloses distinct inter-personal variability in epigenetic aging patterns.,Epigenetics Chromatin,"The epigenetic age can now be extrapolated from one of several epigenetic clocks, which are based on age-related changes in DNA methylation levels at specific multiple CpG sites. Accelerated aging, calculated from the discrepancy between the chronological age and the epigenetic age, has shown to predict morbidity and mortality rate. We assumed that deconvolution of epigenetic age to its components could shed light on the diversity of epigenetic, and by inference, on inter-individual variability in the causes of biological aging.Using the Horvath original epigenetic clock, we identified several CpG sites linked to distinct genes that quantitatively explain much of the inter-personal variability in epigenetic aging, with CpG sites related to secretagogin and malin being the most variable. We show that equal epigenetic age in different subjects can result from variable contribution size of the same CpG sites to the total epigenetic age. In a healthy cohort, the most variable CpG sites are responsible for accelerated and decelerated epigenetic aging, relative to chronological age.Of the 353 CpG sites that form the basis for the Horvath epigenetic age, we have found the CpG sites that are responsible for accelerated and decelerated epigenetic aging in healthy subjects. However, the relative contribution of each site to aging varies between individuals, leading to variable personal aging patterns. Our findings pave the way to form personalized aging cards allowing the identification of specific genes related to CpG sites, as aging markers, and perhaps treatment of these targets in order to hinder undesirable age drifting.© 2022.

Bisulfite pyrosequencing (BPS) was used to determine the methylation levels of the rDNA core promoter and the rDNA upstream control element (UCE) along with two oppositely genomically imprinted control genes (PEG3andGTL2) in individual human germinal vesicle (GV) oocytes from 90 consenting women undergoing fertility treatment because of male infertility. Apart from a few (4%) oocytes with single imprinting defects (in eitherPEG3orGTL2), the analyzed GV oocytes displayed correct imprinting patterns. In 95 GV oocytes from 42 younger women (26-32 years), the mean methylation levels of the rDNA core promoter and UCE were 7.4±4.0% and 9.3±6.1%, respectively. In 79 GV oocytes from 48 older women (33-39 years), methylation levels increased to 9.3±5.3% (P= 0.014) and 11.6±7.4% (P= 0.039), respectively. An age-related increase in oocyte rDNA methylation was also observed in 123 mouse GV oocytes from 29 4-16-months-old animals. Similar to the continuously mitotically dividing male germline, ovarian aging is associated with a gain of rDNA methylation in meiotically arrested oocytes. Oocytes from the same woman can exhibit varying rDNA methylation levels and, by extrapolation, different epigenetic ages."
no,epigenetics,35166834,"DNA methylation cues in nucleosome geometry, stability and unwrapping.",Nucleic Acids Res,"Cytosine methylation at the 5-carbon position is an essential DNA epigenetic mark in many eukaryotic organisms. Although countless structural and functional studies of cytosine methylation have been reported, our understanding of how it influences the nucleosome assembly, structure, and dynamics remains obscure. Here, we investigate the effects of cytosine methylation at CpG sites on nucleosome dynamics and stability. By applying long molecular dynamics simulations on several microsecond time scale, we generate extensive atomistic conformational ensembles of full nucleosomes. Our results reveal that methylation induces pronounced changes in geometry for both linker and nucleosomal DNA, leading to a more curved, under-twisted DNA, narrowing the adjacent minor grooves, and shifting the population equilibrium of sugar-phosphate backbone geometry. These DNA conformational changes are associated with a considerable enhancement of interactions between methylated DNA and the histone octamer, doubling the number of contacts at some key arginines. H2A and H3 tails play important roles in these interactions, especially for DNA methylated nucleosomes. This, in turn, prevents a spontaneous DNA unwrapping of 3-4 helical turns for the methylated nucleosome with truncated histone tails, otherwise observed in the unmethylated system on several microseconds time scale.Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research 2022."

It has been proposed to modulate DNA structure and transcription, transmit information across generations and have a role in disease, among other functions. However, its existence in more recently evolved eukaryotes remains a topic of debate. Recent technological advancements have facilitated the identification and quantification of 6mA even when the modification is exceptionally rare, but each approach has limitations.

The current study was designed to develop an epigenetic biomarker for susceptibility of preterm birth using buccal cells from the mother, father, and child (triads). An epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) was used to identify differential DNA methylation regions (DMRs) using a comparison of control term birth versus preterm birth triads. Epigenetic DMR associations with preterm birth were identified for both the mother and father that were distinct and suggest potential epigenetic contributions from both parents. The mother (165 DMRs) and female child (136 DMRs) at p < 1e-04 had the highest number of DMRs and were highly similar suggesting potential epigenetic inheritance of the epimutations. The male child had negligible DMR associations. The DMR associated genes for each group involve previously identified preterm birth associated genes. Observations identify a potential paternal germline contribution for preterm birth and identify the potential epigenetic inheritance of preterm birth susceptibility for the female child later in life. Although expanded clinical trials and preconception trials are required to optimize the potential epigenetic biomarkers, such epigenetic biomarkers may allow preventative medicine strategies to reduce the incidence of preterm birth.© 2022.

DNA methylation may be an underlying biological mechanism. We evaluated whether maternal adherence to the Mediterranean diet was associated with offspring cord blood DNA methylation.We meta-analysed epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) of maternal adherence to the Mediterranean diet during pregnancy and offspring cord blood DNA methylation in 2802 mother-child pairs from five cohorts. We calculated the relative Mediterranean diet (rMED) score with range 0-18 and an adjusted rMED excluding alcohol (rMEDp, range 0-16). DNA methylation was measured using Illumina 450K arrays. We used robust linear regression modelling adjusted for child sex, maternal education, age, smoking, body mass index, energy intake, batch, and cell types. We performed several functional analyses and examined the persistence of differential DNA methylation into childhood (4.5-7.8 y).rMEDp was associated with cord blood DNA methylation at cg23757341 (0.064% increase in DNA methylation per 1-point increase in the rMEDp score, SE = 0.011,P= 2.41 × 10-8). This cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) site maps toWNT5B, associated with adipogenesis and glycaemic phenotypes. We did not identify associations with childhood gene expression, nor did we find enriched biological pathways. The association did not persist into childhood.In this meta-analysis, maternal adherence to the Mediterranean diet (excluding alcohol) during pregnancy was associated with cord blood DNA methylation level at cg23757341. Potential mediation of DNA methylation in associations with offspring health requires further study."

However, their molecular effects on the human brain are poorly studied, due to difficulty of tissue access and confounders associated with disease status. Here we examine differences in gene expression and DNA methylation associated with positive antipsychotic drug toxicology status in the human caudate nucleus. We find no genome-wide significant differences in DNA methylation, but abundant differences in gene expression. These gene expression differences are overall quite similar to gene expression differences between schizophrenia cases and controls. Interestingly, gene expression differences based on antipsychotic toxicology are different between brain regions, potentially due to affected cell type differences. We finally assess similarities with effects in a mouse model, which finds some overlapping effects but many differences as well. As a first look at the molecular effects of antipsychotics in the human brain, the lack of epigenetic effects is unexpected, possibly because long term treatment effects may be relatively stable for extended periods.© 2022.

However, the underlying role of epigenetics as a mediator of this association remains unknown.DNA methylation (DNAm) in peripheral blood was measured at age 18 years in the Isle of Wight birth cohort (IOWBC) along with data on age of pubertal events, forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) at 26 years. Structural equation models were applied to examine mediation effects of DNAm on the association of age at pubertal events with FVC and FEV1. Findings were further tested in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) cohort.In the IOWBC, for females, 21 cytosine-phosphate-guanine sites (CpGs) were shown to mediate the association of age at puberty with FVC or FEV1at 26 years (p<0.05). In males, DNAm at 20 CpGs was found to mediate the association of age at puberty with FVC (p<0.05). At almost all these CpGs, indirect effects (effects of age at pubertal events on FVC or FEV1viaDNAm) contributed a smaller portion to the total effects compared to direct effects (e.g.at cg08680129, ∼22% of the estimated total effect of age at menarche on FVC at age 26 was contributed by an indirect effect). Among the IOWBC-discovered CpGs available in ALSPAC, none of them was replicated in ALSPAC (p>0.05).Our findings suggest that post-adolescence DNAm in peripheral blood is likely not to mediate the association of age at pubertal onset with young adulthood FVC or FEV1.Copyright ©The authors 2022."

We examined the associations of maternal perceived stress, including preconception exposure, with DNA methylation (DNAm) alterations in the cord blood buffy coats of 358 singleton infants.Maternal perceived stress was measured prior to and throughout pregnancy in a cohort of women enrolled in Effects of Aspirin in Gestation and Reproduction Trial (EAGeR) trial. Perceived stress assessments based on a standardized Likert-scale were obtained in periconception (~2 months preconception and 2-8 weeks of gestation) and pregnancy (8-36 weeks of gestation). Cumulative perceived stress was estimated by calculating the predicted area under the curve of stress reported prior to and during pregnancy. DNAm was measured by the Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip. Multivariable robust linear regression was used to assess associations of perceived stress with individual CpG probes.Based on a 0 to 3 scale, average reported preconception and early pregnancy stress were 0.76 (0.60) and 0.67 (0.50), respectively. Average mid- to late-pregnancy stress, based on a 0 to 10 scale, was 4.9 (1.6). Neither periconception nor pregnancy perceived stress were associated with individual CpG sites in neonatal cord blood (all false discovery rate [FDR] >5%).No effects of maternal perceived stress exposure on array-wide cord blood neonatal methylation differences were found.© The Author(s) 2022."

However, the mechanisms underlying the disproportionate susceptibility to sepsis and worse outcomes in the elderly are not well understood. Recently, changes in DNA methylation have been shown to be linked to aging processes and age-related diseases. Thus, we postulated that age-related changes in DNA methylation may play a role in the onset and prognosis of sepsis in elderly patients. Here, we performed genome-wide methylation profiling of peripheral blood from patients with sepsis and controls. Among the CpG sites whose methylation changes may contribute to an increase in sepsis susceptibility or mortality, 241 sites that possessed age-related changes in DNA methylation in controls may partly explain the increased risk of sepsis in older adults, and 161 sites whose methylation significantly correlated with age in sepsis group may be the potential mechanisms underlying the worse outcomes of elderly septic patients. Finally, an independent cohort was used to validate our findings. Together, our study demonstrates that age-related changes in DNA methylation may explain in part the disproportionate susceptibility and worse outcomes of sepsis in older adults.Copyright © 2022 Lang, Shen, Zhu, Zhao, Chen, Zhu, Su, Wang, Wang, Neri, Jiang and Chen."

We hypothesized that differences in DNA methylation (DNAm) play a role in racial disparities in cLBP.To determine the relationship between DNAm levels and racial group differences in adults with cLBP. Our study's secondary purpose was to perform a race-stratified comparison of adults with cLBP and pain-free controls and identify functional genomic pathways enriched by annotated differentially methylated genes.We recruited 49 NHBs and 49 NHWs (49 cLBP and 49 pain-free controls, PFCs), analyzed DNAm from whole blood using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing, and identified enriched genomic pathways.Among participants with cLBP, we identified 2873 differentially methylated loci (DML; methylation differences of at least 10% and p < 0.0001), many of which were annotated to genes of importance to pain pathology. These DMLs significantly enriched pathways to involved in nociception/pain processing (Dopamine-DARPP32 Feedback in cAMP signaling,GABA Receptor Signaling,Opioid Signaling) and neuronal differentiation (e.g.,Calcium Signaling, Axon Guidance Signaling, andEndocannabinoid Neuronal Synapse). Our race stratified analyses of individuals with cLBP versus PFCs revealed 2356 DMLs in NHBs and 772 DMLs in NHWs with p < 0.0001 and > 10% methylation difference. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis revealed that many pathways of significance to pain such asCorticotropin Releasing Hormone Signaling, White Adipose Tissue Browning,andGABA Receptor Signaling pathways, were more significant in NHBs than NHWs.Even though an individual's self-identified race is a social construct, not a biological variable, racism associated with that classification affects virtually every aspect of life, including disease risk. DNAm induced alterations in stress signaling pathways may explain worse pain outcomes in NHBs.© 2022 The Author(s)."

Environmental triggers of MS, such as viral infections or smoking, were demonstrated to affect DNA methylation, and thus to involve this important epigenetic mechanism in the development of pathological process. To identify MS-associated DNA methylation hallmarks, we performed genome-wide DNA methylation profiling of two cell populations (CD4+ T-lymphocytes and CD14+ monocytes), collected from the same treatment-naive relapsing-remitting MS patients and healthy subjects, using Illumina 450 K methylation arrays. We revealed significant changes in DNA methylation for both cell populations in MS. In CD4+ cells of MS patients the majority of differentially methylated positions (DMPs) were shown to be hypomethylated, while in CD14+ cells - hypermethylated. Differential methylation of HLA-DRB1 gene in CD4+ and CD14+ cells was associated with carriage of DRB1*15 allele independently from the disease status. Besides, about 20% of identified DMPs were shared between two cell populations and had the same direction of methylation changes; they may be involved in basic epigenetic processes occuring in MS. These findings suggest that the epigenetic mechanism of DNA methylation in immune cells contributes to MS; further studies are now required to validate these results and understand their functional significance.Copyright © 2022.

To the best of our knowledge, no longitudinal studies have examined the associations between gestational PFAS and DNA methylation.We examined associations of gestational PFAS exposure with longitudinal DNA methylation measures at birth and in adolescence using the Health Outcomes and Measures of the Environment (HOME) Study (2003-2006; Cincinnati, Ohio).We quantified serum concentrations of perfluorooctanoate (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorononanoate (PFNA), and perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) in mothers during pregnancy. We measured DNA methylation in cord blood (n=266) and peripheral leukocytes at 12 years of age (n=160) using the Illumina HumanMethylation EPIC BeadChip. We analyzed associations betweenlog2-transformedPFAS concentrations and repeated DNA methylation measures using linear regression with generalized estimating equations. We included interaction terms between children's age and gestational PFAS. We performed Gene Ontology enrichment analysis to identify molecular pathways. We used Project Viva (1999-2002; Boston, Massachusetts) to replicate significant associations.After adjusting for covariates, 435 cytosine-guanine dinucleotide (CpG) sites were associated with PFAS (false discovery rate,q<0.05). Specifically, we identified 2 CpGs for PFOS, 12 for PFOA, 8 for PFHxS, and 413 for PFNA; none overlapped. Among these, 2 CpGs for PFOA and 4 for PFNA were replicated in Project Viva. Some of the PFAS-associated CpG sites annotated to gene regions related to cancers, cognitive health, cardiovascular disease, and kidney function. We found little evidence that the associations between PFAS and DNA methylation differed by children's age.In these longitudinal data, PFAS biomarkers were associated with differences in several CpGs at birth and at 12 years of age in or near genes linked to some PFAS-associated health outcomes. Future studies should examine whether DNA methylation mediates associations between gestational PFAS exposure and health. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP10118."

It is of interest to understand the interrelationship of germline genetics, DNAm, and CRC risk.We performed a genome-wide methylation quantitative trait locus (meQTL) analysis in 1355 people, assessing the pairwise associations between genetic variants and lymphocytes methylation data. In addition, we used penalized regression with cis-genetic variants +/- 1Mb of methylation to identify genome-wide heritable DNAm. We evaluated the association of genetically predicted methylation with CRC risk based on GWAS of over 125,000 cases and controls using the multivariate sMiST as well as univariately via examination of marginal association with CRC risk.Of the 142 known CRC genome-wide association studies (GWAS) loci, 47 were identified as meQTLs. We identified 4 novel CRC associated loci (NID2, ATXN10, KLHDC10 and CEP41) that reside over 1Mb outside of known CRC loci and 10 secondary signals within 1Mb of known loci.Leveraging information of DNAm regulation into genetic association of CRC risk reveals novel pathways in CRC tumorigenesis. Our summary statistics-based framework sMiST provides a powerful approach by combining information from the effect through methylation and residual direct effects of the meQTLs on disease risk. Further validation and functional follow-up of these novel pathways are needed.Using genotype, DNA methylation, GWAS, we identified four new CRC risk loci. We studied the landscape of genetic regulation of DNA methylation via single-SNP and multi-SNP meQTL analyses."

One of these challenges is to account for variation due to unobserved confounding factors, such as individual ancestry or cell-type composition in tissues. This issue can be addressed with penalized latent factor regression models, where penalties are introduced to cope with high dimension in the data. If a relatively small proportion of genomic or epigenomic markers correlate with the variable of interest, sparsity penalties may help to capture the relevant associations, but the improvement over non-sparse approaches has not been fully evaluated yet. Here, we present least-squares algorithms that jointly estimate effect sizes and confounding factors in sparse latent factor regression models. In simulated data, sparse latent factor regression models generally achieved higher statistical performance than other sparse methods, including the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator and a Bayesian sparse linear mixed model. In generative model simulations, statistical performance was slightly lower (while being comparable) to non-sparse methods, but in simulations based on empirical data, sparse latent factor regression models were more robust to departure from the model than the non-sparse approaches. We applied sparse latent factor regression models to a genome-wide association study of a flowering trait for the plantArabidopsis thalianaand to an epigenome-wide association study of smoking status in pregnant women. For both applications, sparse latent factor regression models facilitated the estimation of non-null effect sizes while overcoming multiple testing issues. The results were not only consistent with previous discoveries, but they also pinpointed new genes with functional annotations relevant to each application.© 2022 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston."

Traditional diagnostic techniques rely heavily on heuristic approaches, coupling clinical experience from prior rare disease presentations with the medical literature. A large number of rare disease patients remain undiagnosed for years and many even die without an accurate diagnosis. In recent years, gene panels, microarrays, and exome sequencing have helped to identify the molecular cause of such rare and undiagnosed diseases. These technologies have allowed diagnoses for a sizable proportion (25-35%) of undiagnosed patients, often with actionable findings. However, a large proportion of these patients remain undiagnosed. In this review, we focus on technologies that can be adopted if exome sequencing is unrevealing. We discuss the benefits of sequencing the whole genome and the additional benefit that may be offered by long-read technology, pan-genome reference, transcriptomics, metabolomics, proteomics, and methyl profiling. We highlight computational methods to help identify regionally distant patients with similar phenotypes or similar genetic mutations. Finally, we describe approaches to automate and accelerate genomic analysis. The strategies discussed here are intended to serve as a guide for clinicians and researchers in the next steps when encountering patients with non-diagnostic exomes.© 2022. The Author(s)."

In this study, we characterized the biological heterogeneity of PTSD symptom clusters by performing a multi-omics investigation integrating genetically regulated gene, splicing, and protein expression in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex tissue within a sample of US veterans enrolled in the Million Veteran Program (Ntotal = 186,689). We identified 30 genes in 19 regions across the three PTSD symptom clusters. We found nine genes to have cell-type specific expression, and over-representation of miRNA-families - miR-148, 30, and 8. Gene-drug target prioritization approach highlighted cyclooxygenase and acetylcholine compounds. Next, we tested molecular-profile based phenome-wide impact of identified genes with respect to 1678 phenotypes derived from the Electronic Health Records of the Vanderbilt University biorepository (N = 70,439). Lastly, we tested for local genetic correlation across PTSD symptom clusters which highlighted metabolic (e.g., obesity, diabetes, vascular health) and laboratory traits (e.g., neutrophil, eosinophil, tau protein, creatinine kinase). Overall, this study finds comprehensive genomic evidence including clinical and regulatory profiles between PTSD, hematologic and cardiometabolic traits, that support comorbidities observed in epidemiologic studies of PTSD.© 2022.

Recent large-scale studies have reported genetic (i.e., protein quantitative trait loci, pQTLs) and non-genetic factors, such as age and sex, as major determinants to inter-individual variability in immune response variation. However, the contribution of blood-cell composition to plasma protein heterogeneity has not been fully characterized and may act as a mediating factor in association studies.Here, we evaluated plasma protein levels from 400 unrelated healthy individuals of western European ancestry, who were stratified by sex and two decades of life (20-29 and 60-69 years), from the Milieu Intérieur cohort. We quantified 229 proteins by Luminex in a clinically certified laboratory and their levels of variation were analyzed together with 5.2 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms. With respect to non-genetic variables, we included 254 lifestyle and biochemical factors, as well as counts of seven circulating immune cell populations measured by hemogram and standardized flow cytometry.Collectively, we found 152 significant associations involving 49 proteins and 20 non-genetic variables. Consistent with previous studies, age and sex showed a global, pervasive impact on plasma protein heterogeneity, while body mass index and other health status variables were among the non-genetic factors with the highest number of associations. After controlling for these covariates, we identified 100 and 12 pQTLs acting in cis and trans, respectively, collectively associated with 87 plasma proteins and including 19 novel genetic associations. Genetic factors explained the largest fraction of the variability of plasma protein levels, as compared to non-genetic factors. In addition, blood-cell fractions, including leukocytes, lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, and platelets, had a larger contribution to inter-individual variability than age and sex and appeared as confounders of specific genetic associations. Finally, we identified new genetic associations with plasma protein levels of five monogenic Mendelian disease genes including two primary immunodeficiency genes (Ficolin-3 and FAS).Our study identified novel genetic and non-genetic factors associated to plasma protein levels which may inform health status and disease management.© 2022.

We have previously observed links between epigenetic aging signatures in breast/tumor tissue and breast cancer risk/prevalence. However, these DNA methylation-based aging biomarkers capture diverse epigenetic phenomena and it is not known to what degree they relate to breast cancer risk, and/or progression.Using six epigenetic clocks, we analyzed whether they distinguish normal breast tissue adjacent to tumor (cases) vs normal breast tissue from healthy controls (controls).The Levine (p = 0.0037) and Yang clocks (p = 0.023) showed significant epigenetic age acceleration in cases vs controls in breast tissue. We observed that much of the difference between cases and controls is driven by CpGs associated with polycomb-related genes. Thus, we developed a new score utilizing only CpGs associated with polycomb-related genes and demonstrated that it robustly captured epigenetic age acceleration in cases vs controls (p = 0.00012). Finally, we tested whether this same signal could be seen in peripheral blood. We observed no difference in cases vs. controls and no correlation between matched tissue/blood samples, suggesting that peripheral blood is not a good surrogate marker for epigenetic age acceleration.Moving forward, it will be critical for studies to elucidate whether epigenetic age acceleration in breast tissue precedes breast cancer diagnosis and whether methylation changes at CpGs associated with polycomb-related genes can be used to assess the risk of developing breast cancer among unaffected individuals.© 2022.

The opportunity to use minimally invasive liquid biopsy testing to screen asymptomatic individuals at-risk for multiple cancers simultaneously could benefit from the aggregated diseases prevalence and a fixed specificity. Increasing both latter parameters is paramount to mediate high positive predictive value-a useful metric to evaluate a screening test accuracy and its potential harm-benefit. Thus, the use of a single test for multi-cancer early detection (stMCED) has emerged as an appealing strategy for increasing early cancer detection rate efficiency and benefit population health. A recent flurry of these stMCED technologies have been reported for clinical potential; however, their development is facing unique challenges to effectively improve clinical cost-benefit. One promising avenue is the analysis of circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) for detecting DNA methylation biomarker fingerprints of malignancies-a hallmark of disease aetiology and progression holding the potential to be tissue- and cancer-type specific. Utilizing panels of epigenetic biomarkers could potentially help to detect earlier stages of malignancies as well as identify a tumour of origin from blood testing, useful information for follow-up clinical decision making and subsequent patient care improvement. Overall, this review collates the latest and most promising stMCED methodologies, summarizes their clinical performances, and discusses the specific requirements multi-cancer tests should meet to be successfully implemented into screening guidelines."
