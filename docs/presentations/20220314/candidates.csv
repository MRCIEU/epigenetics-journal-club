"35268351","Epigenetic Alterations in Inborn Errors of Immunity.","J Clin Med","The epigenome bridges environmental factors and the genome, fine-tuning the process of gene transcription. Physiological programs, including the development, maturation and maintenance of cellular identity and function, are modulated by intricate epigenetic changes that encompass DNA methylation, chromatin remodeling, histone modifications and RNA processing. The collection of genome-wide DNA methylation data has recently shed new light into the potential contribution of epigenetics in pathophysiology, particularly in the field of immune system and host defense. The study of patients carrying mutations in genes encoding for molecules involved in the epigenetic machinery has allowed the identification and better characterization of environment-genome interactions via epigenetics as well as paving the way for the development of new potential therapeutic options. In this review, we summarize current knowledge of the role of epigenetic modifications in the immune system and outline their potential involvement in the pathogenesis of inborn errors of immunity."
"35267594","Epigenetic Alteration of the Cancer-Related Gene TGFBI in B Cells Infected with Epstein-Barr Virus and Exposed to Aflatoxin B1: Potential Role in Burkitt Lymphoma Development.","Cancers (Basel)","Burkitt lymphoma (BL) is a malignant B cell neoplasm that accounts for almost half of pediatric cancers in sub-Saharan African countries. Although the BL endemic prevalence is attributable to the combination of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection with malaria and environmental carcinogens exposure, such as the food contaminant aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), the molecular determinants underlying the pathogenesis are not fully understood. Consistent with the role of epigenetic mechanisms at the interface between the genome and environment, AFB1 and EBV impact the methylome of respectively leukocytes and B cells specifically. Here, we conducted a thorough investigation of common epigenomic changes following EBV or AFB1 exposure in B cells. Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling identified an EBV-AFB1 common signature within the TGFBI locus, which encodes for a putative tumor suppressor often altered in cancer. Subsequent mechanistic analyses confirmed a DNA-methylation-dependent transcriptional silencing of TGFBI involving the recruitment of DNMT1 methyltransferase that is associated with an activation of the NF-κB pathway. Our results reveal a potential common mechanism of B cell transformation shared by the main risk factors of endemic BL (EBV and AFB1), suggesting a key determinant of disease that could allow the development of more efficient targeted therapeutic strategies."
"35266797","Gestational Perfluoroalkyl Substance Exposure and DNA Methylation at Birth and 12 Years of Age: A Longitudinal Epigenome-Wide Association Study.","Environ Health Perspect","DNA methylation alterations may underlie associations between gestational perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) exposure and later-life health outcomes. To the best of our knowledge, no longitudinal studies have examined the associations between gestational PFAS and DNA methylation.We examined associations of gestational PFAS exposure with longitudinal DNA methylation measures at birth and in adolescence using the Health Outcomes and Measures of the Environment (HOME) Study (2003-2006; Cincinnati, Ohio).We quantified serum concentrations of perfluorooctanoate (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorononanoate (PFNA), and perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) in mothers during pregnancy. We measured DNA methylation in cord blood (n=266) and peripheral leukocytes at 12 years of age (n=160) using the Illumina HumanMethylation EPIC BeadChip. We analyzed associations betweenlog2-transformedPFAS concentrations and repeated DNA methylation measures using linear regression with generalized estimating equations. We included interaction terms between children's age and gestational PFAS. We performed Gene Ontology enrichment analysis to identify molecular pathways. We used Project Viva (1999-2002; Boston, Massachusetts) to replicate significant associations.After adjusting for covariates, 435 cytosine-guanine dinucleotide (CpG) sites were associated with PFAS (false discovery rate,q<0.05). Specifically, we identified 2 CpGs for PFOS, 12 for PFOA, 8 for PFHxS, and 413 for PFNA; none overlapped. Among these, 2 CpGs for PFOA and 4 for PFNA were replicated in Project Viva. Some of the PFAS-associated CpG sites annotated to gene regions related to cancers, cognitive health, cardiovascular disease, and kidney function. We found little evidence that the associations between PFAS and DNA methylation differed by children's age.In these longitudinal data, PFAS biomarkers were associated with differences in several CpGs at birth and at 12 years of age in or near genes linked to some PFAS-associated health outcomes. Future studies should examine whether DNA methylation mediates associations between gestational PFAS exposure and health. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP10118."
"35263365","An integrated analysis of the effects of maternal broccoli sprouts exposure on transcriptome and methylome in prevention of offspring mammary cancer.","PLoS One","Broccoli sprouts (BSp), a cruciferous vegetable, has shown promising effects on prevention of many types of cancer including breast cancer (BC). BC has a developmental foundation, and maternal nutrition status may influence an offspring's risk to BC later in life. What is less understood, however, is the influence of maternal nutrition intervention on reversing epigenomic abnormalities that are essential in BC programming during early development. Our research focused on how maternal exposure to BSp diet prevents offspring BC and investigation of possible epigenetic mechanisms during these processes. Our results showed that maternal feeding of BSp can prevent mammary tumor development in the offspring of a transgenic mouse model. Through comprehensive integrated multi-omics studies on transcriptomic and methylomic analysis, we identified numerous target genes exhibiting significantly differential gene expression and DNA methylation patterns in the offspring mammary tumor. We discovered that maternal exposure to BSp diet can induce both gene and methylation changes in several key genes such as Avpr2, Cyp4a12b, Dpp6, Gria2, Pcdh9 and Tspan11 that are correlated with pivotal biological functions during carcinogenesis. In addition, we found an impact of maternal BSp treatment on DNA methyltransferase and histone deacetylases activity. Our study provides knowledgeable information regarding how maternal BSp diet influences key tumor-related gene expression and the epigenetic changes using a genome-wide perspective. Additionally, these findings provide mechanistic insights into the effectiveness of maternal BSp administration on the prevention of BC in the offspring later in life, which may lead to an early-life BC chemopreventive strategy that benefits the progenies' long-term health."
"35260776","Genome-wide DNA methylation patterns reveal clinically relevant predictive and prognostic subtypes in human osteosarcoma.","Commun Biol","Aberrant methylation of genomic DNA has been reported in many cancers. Specific DNA methylation patterns have been shown to provide clinically useful prognostic information and define molecular disease subtypes with different response to therapy and long-term outcome. Osteosarcoma is an aggressive malignancy for which approximately half of tumors recur following standard combined surgical resection and chemotherapy. No accepted prognostic factor save tumor necrosis in response to adjuvant therapy currently exists, and traditional genomic studies have thus far failed to identify meaningful clinical associations. We studied the genome-wide methylation state of primary tumors and tested how they predict patient outcomes. We discovered relative genomic hypomethylation to be strongly predictive of response to standard chemotherapy. Recurrence and survival were also associated with genomic methylation, but through more site-specific patterns. Furthermore, the methylation patterns were reproducible in three small independent clinical datasets. Downstream transcriptional, in vitro, and pharmacogenomic analysis provides insight into the clinical translation of the methylation patterns. Our findings suggest the assessment of genomic methylation may represent a strategy for stratifying patients for the application of alternative therapies.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35259267","DNA methylation profiles after ART during human lifespan: a systematic review and meta-analysis.","Hum Reprod Update","The many manipulations and processes used in ART coincide with the timing of epigenetic reprogramming and imprinting during female gametogenesis and pre-implantation embryo development, leading to concerns that the actual ART could negatively affect epigenetic reprogramming and imprinting in gametes and early embryos. A growing body of literature suggests that ART may affect epigenetic marks, such as DNA methylation, in the fetus and placenta. Potentially, this may be responsible later in life for the increased risk of adverse outcomes associated with ART. Unfortunately, the conclusions are inconsistent and, despite the increasing usage of ART, its safety at the epigenetic level is still not established.To examine whether ART is associated with DNA methylation modifications and if these modifications persist throughout life, we provide an update on the current understanding of epigenetic reprogramming in human gametes and embryos, and then focus on the assessment of fetal and postnatal DNA methylation modifications that may remain until adulthood following the use of ART in humans.We reviewed studies using targeted or epigenome-wide techniques to assess the DNA methylation patterns of the conceptus after ART compared with natural conceptions. A search for relevant studies was performed in the PubMed and EMBASE databases on 15 July 2021 with an extensive search equation. Studies on animals, gametes and embryos were subsequently excluded. After an in-depth review of full-text articles, studies on specific populations with imprinting disorders were removed and not further discussed. Before comprehensive analysis, the risk of bias of each included study was assessed with the Newcastle-Ottawa scale and quality of evidence was graded using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations criteria.In total, 928 records were initially identified, and 51 were finally included in the systematic review. Given the variability in the genomic scale at which DNA methylation was measured in the different studies, they were separated into two categories: targeted DNA methylation or genome-wide DNA methylation study. The present systematic review has made it possible to assess a substantial number of children since more than 4000 DNA methylation profiles of ART concepti were compared to more than 7000 controls. There is evidence that ART conception is associated with aberrant DNA methylation in imprinted loci and other genes in various tissues. One isolated modification notably occur in the paternally expressed gene 1/mesoderm-specific transcript homologue (PEG1/MEST) region, and we cannot rule out other studied sequences owing to the heterogeneity of the evidence base.Differences in DNA methylation after ART conceptions are modest, and the functional relevance in adult tissues is unknown. Functional effects in terms of gene expression as well as the roles of other epigenetic marks need to be further explored. Moreover, there is little overlap of findings obtained in targeted and genome-scale analyses owing to the lack of comparability of CpGs analyzed between both techniques. This issue also stems from small sample sizes and marked differences in methodology and cohort characteristics. Standardization of methodologies and large collaborative efforts are required to reduce the inconsistency of results and increase the robustness of findings. Finally, further studies are required to determine the contribution of parental infertility per se from the ART treatment.© The Author(s) 2022.

Human spermatozoa were used for targeted bisulfite amplicon sequencing (267 men) or droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (45 men). The potential role of Brca1 in DNA damage was explored in mouse GC2 spermatocyte cells. Oxidative damage to spermatocytes was modeled by incubating GC2 cells with H2O2(25 mM) for 90 minutes.BRCA1 was identified as a hub gene in SDF. Promoter hypermethylation of BRCA1 was observed in those samples with a high DNA fragmentation index (DFI) compared to those with a low DFI. Concomitantly, BRCA1 mRNA expression was lower in samples with a high DFI than with a low DFI. In the GC2 cell model, Brca1 knockdown reduced cell proliferation and increased sensitivity to oxidative stress. Moreover, it increased double-strand breaks and decreased the protein levels of the DNA repair genes MRE11 and RAD51.A prominent cluster of comethylated patterns associated with SDF was identified. BRCA1 may be the hub gene involved in sperm DNA damage.Copyright © 2022 American Society for Reproductive Medicine. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
"35255735","Risks and rewards of big-data in epigenomics research: an interview with Melanie Ehrlich.","Epigenomics","Melanie Ehrlich, PhD, is a professor in the Tulane Cancer Center, the Tulane Center for Medical Bioinformatics and Genomics and the Hayward Human Genetics Program at Tulane Medical School, New Orleans, LA. She obtained her PhD in molecular biology in 1971 from the State University of New York at Stony Brook and completed postdoctoral research at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in 1972. She has been working on various aspects of epigenetics, starting with DNA methylation, since 1973. Her group made many first findings about DNA methylation (see below). For example, in 1982 and 1983, in collaboration with Charles Gehrke at the University of Missouri, she was the first to report tissue-specific and cancer-specific differences in overall DNA methylation in humans. In 1985, Xian-Yang Zhang and Richard Wang in her lab discovered a class of human DNA sequences specifically hypomethylated in sperm. In 1998, her group was the first to describe extensive losses of DNA methylation in pericentromeric and centromeric DNA repeats in human cancer. Her lab's many publications on the prevalence of both DNA hypermethylation and hypomethylation in the same cancers brought needed balance to our understanding of the epigenetics of cancer and to its clinical implications [1]. Besides working on cancer epigenetics, her research group has helped elucidate cytogenetic and gene expression abnormalities in the immunodeficiency, centromeric and facial anomalies (ICF) syndrome, a rare recessive disease often caused by mutations inDNMT3B. Her group also studied the epigenetics and transcriptomics of facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), whose disease locus is a tandem 3.3-kb repeat at subtelomeric 4q (that happens to be hypomethylated in ICF DNA [2]). Her study of FSHD has taken her in the direction of muscle (skeletal muscle, heart and aorta) epigenetics [3-6]. Recently, she has led research that applies epigenetics much more rigorously than usual to the evaluation of genetic variants from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of osteoporosis and obesity. In continued collaboration with Sriharsa Pradhan at New England Biolabs and Michelle Lacey at Tulane University, she has compared 5-hydroxymethylcytosine and 5-methylcytosine clustering in various human tissues [7] and is studying myoblast methylomes that they generated by a new high-resolution enzymatic technique (enzymatic methyl-seq)."

However, its function in CD4+T cells under allergic inflammation is unclear. We aimed to investigate the epigenomic distribution of DNA 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) and the role of TET2 in CD4+T cells of allergic rhinitis (AR).The hMeDIP-seq was performed to identify sequences with 5hmC deposition in CD4+T cells of AR patients.Tet2-deficient or wild type mice were stimulated with ovalbumin (OVA) to develop an AR mouse model. The histopathology in nasal mucosae, Th1/Th2/Treg/Th17 cell percentage, concentrations of Th-related cytokines, expression of Tet and differential hydroxymethylated genes (DhMG), and the global deposition of 5hmC in sorted CD4+T cells were detected.Epigenome-wide 5hmC landscape andDhMGin the CD4+T cells of AR patients were identified.Tet2depletion did not led to spontaneous inflammation. However, under the stimulation of allergen, OVA, loss ofTet2resulted in the exacerbation of allergic inflammation, which was characterized by severer allergic symptoms, more inflammatory cells infiltrating the nasal lamina propria, sharper imbalances between Th1/Th2 and Treg/Th17 cells, and excessive secretion of OVA-specific IgE and Th2-related cytokines. Moreover, altered mRNA production of several DhMG and sharp decrease in 5hmC deposition were also observed inTet2-deficient OVA-exposed mice.TET2 may regulate DNA 5hmC, DhMG expressions, and CD4+T cell balance in AR.Copyright © 2022 The Korean Academy of Asthma, Allergy and Clinical Immunology • The Korean Academy of Pediatric Allergy and Respiratory Disease."
"35255108","Lysine-Specific Demethylase 1 (LSD1) epigenetically controls osteoblast differentiation.","PLoS One","Epigenetic mechanisms regulate osteogenic lineage differentiation of mesenchymal stromal cells. Histone methylation is controlled by multiple lysine demethylases and is an important step in controlling local chromatin structure and gene expression. Here, we show that the lysine-specific histone demethylase Kdm1A/Lsd1 is abundantly expressed in osteoblasts and that its suppression impairs osteoblast differentiation and bone nodule formation in vitro. Although Lsd1 knockdown did not affect global H3K4 methylation levels, genome-wide ChIP-Seq analysis revealed high levels of Lsd1 at gene promoters and its binding was associated with di- and tri-methylation of histone 3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me2 and H3K4me3). Lsd1 binding sites in osteoblastic cells were enriched for the Runx2 consensus motif suggesting a functional link between the two proteins. Importantly, inhibition of Lsd1 activity decreased osteoblast activity in vivo. In support, mesenchymal-targeted knockdown of Lsd1 led to decreased osteoblast activity and disrupted primary spongiosa ossification and reorganization in vivo. Together, our studies demonstrate that Lsd1 occupies Runx2-binding cites at H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 and its activity is required for proper bone formation."
"35252421","Genome-Wide Methylation Profiling in the Thalamus of Scrapie Sheep.","Front Vet Sci","Scrapie is a neurodegenerative disorder belonging to the group of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE). Scrapie occurs in sheep and goats, which are considered good natural animal models of these TSE. Changes in DNA methylation occur in the central nervous system (CNS) of patients suffering from prion-like neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease. Nevertheless, potential DNA methylation alterations have not yet been investigated in the CNS of any prion disease model or naturally infected cases, neither in humans nor in animals. Genome-wide DNA methylation patterns were studied in the thalamus obtained from sheep naturally infected with scrapie at a clinical stage (n= 4) and from controls (n= 4) by performing a whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) analysis. Ewes carried the scrapie-susceptible ARQ/ARQPRNPgenotype and were sacrificed at a similar age (4-6 years). Although the average genomic methylation levels were similar between the control and the scrapie animals, we identified 8,907 significant differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and 39 promoters (DMPs). Gene Ontology analysis revealed that hypomethylated DMRs were enriched in genes involved in transmembrane transport and cell adhesion, whereas hypermethylated DMRs were related to intracellular signal transduction genes. Moreover, genes highly expressed in specific types of CNS cells and those previously described to be differentially expressed in scrapie brains contained DMRs. Finally, a quantitative PCR (qPCR) validation indicated differences in the expression of five genes (PCDH19, SNCG, WDR45B, PEX1, andCABIN1) that matched the methylation changes observed in the genomic study. Altogether, these results suggest a potential regulatory role of DNA methylation in prion neuropathology.Copyright © 2022 Hernaiz, Sanz, Sentre, Ranera, Lopez-Pérez, Zaragoza, Badiola, Filali, Bolea, Toivonen and Martín-Burriel."

The top 10 SNPs selected from each chromosomal region by odds ratio were evaluated for progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) hazard ratios in the first cohort, resulting in four candidates (p < 0.0025). The four selected candidates were re-evaluated in another cohort of 24 EC patients, which included patients prospectively enrolled in this study to fulfill the sample size statistically suggested by the results of the first cohort, and of the four, only rs3815544 was replicated (p < 0.0125). Furthermore, this candidate genotype of rs3815544 proceeded to the re-evaluation study in an external cohort consisting of EC patients treated with platinum derivatives and/or by radiation therapy as the first-line treatment in BBJ, which confirmed that the alternative allele (G) of rs3815544 was statistically associated with non-response (SD or PD) to platinum-based therapy in EC patients (odds ratio = 1.801,p = 0.048). The methylation QTL database as well as online clinicogenomic databases suggested that the region including rs3815544 may regulateMSX1expression through CpG methylation, and this down-regulation was statistically associated with poor prognosis after platinum-based therapies for EC.rs3815544 is a novel candidate predictive marker for platinum-based EC therapy.© The Author(s), 2022."
"35249126","An improved Raphanus sativus cv. WK10039 genome localizes centromeres, uncovers variation of DNA methylation and resolves arrangement of the ancestral Brassica genome blocks in radish chromosomes.","Theor Appl Genet","This study presents an improved genome of Raphanus sativus cv. WK10039 uncovering centromeres and differentially methylated regions of radish chromosomes. Comprehensive genome comparison of radish and diploid Brassica species of U's triangle reveals that R. sativus arose from the Brassica B genome lineage and is a sibling species of B. nigra. Radish (Raphanus sativus L.) is a key root vegetable crop closely related to the Brassica crop species of the family Brassicaceae. We reported a draft genome of R. sativus cv. WK10039 (Rs1.0), which had 54.6 Mb gaps. To study the radish genome and explore previously unknown regions, we generated an improved genome assembly (Rs2.0) by long-read sequencing and high-resolution genome-wide mapping of chromatin interactions. Rs2.0 was 434.9 Mb in size with 0.27 Mb gaps, and the N50 scaffold length was 37.3 Mb (40-fold larger assembly compared to Rs1.0). Approximately 38% of Rs2.0 was comprised of repetitive sequences, and 52,768 protein-coding genes and 4845 non-protein-coding genes were predicted and annotated. The improved contiguity and coverage of Rs2.0, along with the detection of highly methylated regions, enabled localization of centromeres where R. sativus-specific centromere-associated repeats, full-length OTA and CRM LTR-Gypsy retrotransposons, hAT-Ac, CMC-EnSpm and Helitron DNA transposons, and sequences highly homologous to B. nigra centromere-specific CENH3-associated CL sequences were enriched. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing combined with mRNA sequencing identified differential epigenetic marks in the radish genome related to tissue development. Synteny comparison and genomic distance analysis of radish and three diploid Brassica species of U's triangle suggested that the radish genome arose from the Brassica B genome lineage through unique rearrangement of the triplicated ancestral Brassica genome after splitting of the Brassica A/C and B genomes.© 2022.

It is of interest to understand the interrelationship of germline genetics, DNAm, and CRC risk.We performed a genome-wide methylation quantitative trait locus (meQTL) analysis in 1355 people, assessing the pairwise associations between genetic variants and lymphocytes methylation data. In addition, we used penalized regression with cis-genetic variants +/- 1Mb of methylation to identify genome-wide heritable DNAm. We evaluated the association of genetically predicted methylation with CRC risk based on GWAS of over 125,000 cases and controls using the multivariate sMiST as well as univariately via examination of marginal association with CRC risk.Of the 142 known CRC genome-wide association studies (GWAS) loci, 47 were identified as meQTLs. We identified 4 novel CRC associated loci (NID2, ATXN10, KLHDC10 and CEP41) that reside over 1Mb outside of known CRC loci and 10 secondary signals within 1Mb of known loci.Leveraging information of DNAm regulation into genetic association of CRC risk reveals novel pathways in CRC tumorigenesis. Our summary statistics-based framework sMiST provides a powerful approach by combining information from the effect through methylation and residual direct effects of the meQTLs on disease risk. Further validation and functional follow-up of these novel pathways are needed.Using genotype, DNA methylation, GWAS, we identified four new CRC risk loci. We studied the landscape of genetic regulation of DNA methylation via single-SNP and multi-SNP meQTL analyses."

Here we used phenotypic and molecular profiling, including epigenetic analyses, to investigate how ENKTL ontogeny relates to normal NK-cell development. We demonstrate that neoplastic NK cells are stably, but reversibly, arrested at earlier stages of NK-cell maturation. Genes downregulated in the most epigenetic immature tumors were associated with polycomb silencing along with genomic gain and overexpression of EZH2. ENKTL cells exhibited genome-wide DNA hypermethylation. Tumor-specific DNA methylation gains were associated with polycomb-marked regions, involving extensive gene silencing and loss of transcription factor binding. To investigate therapeutic targeting, we treated novel patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of ENKTL with the DNA hypomethylating agent, 5-azacytidine. Treatment led to reexpression of NK-cell developmental genes, phenotypic NK-cell differentiation, and prolongation of survival. These studies lay the foundation for epigenetic-directed therapy in ENKTL.Through epigenetic and transcriptomic analyses of ENKTL, a rare, aggressive malignancy, along with normal NK-cell developmental intermediates, we identified that extreme DNA hypermethylation targets genes required for NK-cell development. Disrupting this epigenetic blockade in novel PDX models led to ENKTL differentiation and improved survival.

"35247757","DNA methylation age acceleration is associated with age of onset in Chinese spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 patients.","Neurobiol Aging","Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3), also known as Machado Joseph disease (MJD), is a common dominantly inherited ataxia, and has heterogeneous clinical features and variable age of onset, ranging from 10 to 78 years. Repeats variability of ATXN3, HTT, ATN1 and ATXN2 can explain partially but not fully SCA3 age of onset heterogeneity. Aging is a reported modifier of SCA3 severity and closely linked to DNA methylation (DNAm). DNAm age acceleration was associated with disease risk and/or variable disease phenotypes in several repeat associated neurodegenerative diseases (such as Huntington's disease and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). To understand if DNAm age acceleration is associated with SCA3 age of onset, we performed a genome-wide DNAm study of a Chinese SCA3 family with variable age of onset and clinical presentations. All patients showed unsteady gait, deterioration of extremities coordination, speech (dysarthria) and swallowing problems (dysphagia, choking on eating and/or drinking) and oculomotor abnormalities, with variable age of onset ranging from 27 to 52 years. We found that DNAm age acceleration is associated with age of onset (p-value = 0.0023, B = -1.26), suggesting that every 5 year increase in DNAm-age acceleration is corresponding to a 6.3 year earlier disease onset. This association remains significant after the adjustment to ATXN3 CAG repeats (adjusted p-value = 0.037, adjusted B = -1.0). In an independent SCA3 cohort (n = 40), we also observed the association between DNAm age acceleration and age of onset (adjusted p-value = 0.007, adjusted B = -0.69). Of note, we found no significant association between DNAm of single-CpG locus and/or CpG-SNPs and SCA3 age of onset in the current family or the SCA3 cohort. Our findings suggested that DNAm age acceleration might be a SCA3 age of onset modifier, and encourage further investigations in extended SCA3 cohorts to clarify the role of epigenetic aging in modifying disease onset.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

"35246225","Changes in DNA methylation hallmark alterations in chromatin accessibility and gene expression for eye lens differentiation.","Epigenetics Chromatin","Methylation at cytosines (mCG) is a well-known regulator of gene expression, but its requirements for cellular differentiation have yet to be fully elucidated. A well-studied cellular differentiation model system is the eye lens, consisting of a single anterior layer of epithelial cells that migrate laterally and differentiate into a core of fiber cells. Here, we explore the genome-wide relationships between mCG methylation, chromatin accessibility and gene expression during differentiation of eye lens epithelial cells into fiber cells.Whole genome bisulfite sequencing identified 7621 genomic loci exhibiting significant differences in mCG levels between lens epithelial and fiber cells. Changes in mCG levels were inversely correlated with the differentiation state-specific expression of 1285 genes preferentially expressed in either lens fiber or lens epithelial cells (Pearson correlation r = - 0.37, p < 1 × 10-42). mCG levels were inversely correlated with chromatin accessibility determined by assay for transposase-accessible sequencing (ATAC-seq) (Pearson correlation r = - 0.86, p < 1 × 10-300). Many of the genes exhibiting altered regions of DNA methylation, chromatin accessibility and gene expression levels in fiber cells relative to epithelial cells are associated with lens fiber cell structure, homeostasis and transparency. These include lens crystallins (CRYBA4, CRYBB1, CRYGN, CRYBB2), lens beaded filament proteins (BFSP1, BFSP2), transcription factors (HSF4, SOX2, HIF1A), and Notch signaling pathway members (NOTCH1, NOTCH2, HEY1, HES5). Analysis of regions exhibiting cell-type specific alterations in DNA methylation revealed an overrepresentation of consensus sequences of multiple transcription factors known to play key roles in lens cell differentiation including HIF1A, SOX2, and the MAF family of transcription factors.Collectively, these results link DNA methylation with control of chromatin accessibility and gene expression changes required for eye lens differentiation. The results also point to a role for DNA methylation in the regulation of transcription factors previously identified to be important for lens cell differentiation.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35246124","Acceleration of the DNA methylation clock among lynch syndrome-associated mutation carriers.","BMC Med Genomics","DNA methylation (DNAm) age metrics have been widely accepted as an epigenetic biomarker for biological aging and disease. The purpose of this study is to assess whether or not individuals carrying Lynch Syndrome-associated mutations are affected in their rate of biological aging, as measured by the epigenetic clock.Genome-wide bisulfite DNA sequencing data were generated using DNA from CD4 + T-cells obtained from peripheral blood using 27 patient samples from Lynch syndrome families. Horvath's DNAm age model based on penalized linear regression was applied to estimate DNAm age from patient samples with distinct clinical and genetic characteristics to investigate cancer mutation-related aging effects.Both Lynch mutation carriers and controls exhibited high variability in their estimated DNAm age, but regression analysis showed steeper slope for the Lynch mutation carriers. Remarkably, six Lynch Syndrome-associated mutation carriers showed a strong correlation to the control group, and two sisters carrying Lynch Syndrome-associated mutations, with no significant difference in lifestyle and similar chronological age, were assigned very different DNAm age.Future studies will be required to explore, in larger patient populations, whether specific epigenetic age acceleration is predictive of time-to-cancer development, treatment response, and survival. Epigenetic clock DNAm metrics may be affected by the presence of cancer mutations in the germline, and thus show promise of potential clinical utility for stratified surveillance strategies based on the relative risk for imminent emergence of tumor lesions in otherwise healthy Lynch Syndrome-associated mutation carriers.© 2022.

Environmental triggers of MS, such as viral infections or smoking, were demonstrated to affect DNA methylation, and thus to involve this important epigenetic mechanism in the development of pathological process. To identify MS-associated DNA methylation hallmarks, we performed genome-wide DNA methylation profiling of two cell populations (CD4+ T-lymphocytes and CD14+ monocytes), collected from the same treatment-naive relapsing-remitting MS patients and healthy subjects, using Illumina 450 K methylation arrays. We revealed significant changes in DNA methylation for both cell populations in MS. In CD4+ cells of MS patients the majority of differentially methylated positions (DMPs) were shown to be hypomethylated, while in CD14+ cells - hypermethylated. Differential methylation of HLA-DRB1 gene in CD4+ and CD14+ cells was associated with carriage of DRB1*15 allele independently from the disease status. Besides, about 20% of identified DMPs were shared between two cell populations and had the same direction of methylation changes; they may be involved in basic epigenetic processes occuring in MS. These findings suggest that the epigenetic mechanism of DNA methylation in immune cells contributes to MS; further studies are now required to validate these results and understand their functional significance.Copyright © 2022.

"35245419","Sparse latent factor regression models for genome-wide and epigenome-wide association studies.","Stat Appl Genet Mol Biol","Association of phenotypes or exposures with genomic and epigenomic data faces important statistical challenges. One of these challenges is to account for variation due to unobserved confounding factors, such as individual ancestry or cell-type composition in tissues. This issue can be addressed with penalized latent factor regression models, where penalties are introduced to cope with high dimension in the data. If a relatively small proportion of genomic or epigenomic markers correlate with the variable of interest, sparsity penalties may help to capture the relevant associations, but the improvement over non-sparse approaches has not been fully evaluated yet. Here, we present least-squares algorithms that jointly estimate effect sizes and confounding factors in sparse latent factor regression models. In simulated data, sparse latent factor regression models generally achieved higher statistical performance than other sparse methods, including the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator and a Bayesian sparse linear mixed model. In generative model simulations, statistical performance was slightly lower (while being comparable) to non-sparse methods, but in simulations based on empirical data, sparse latent factor regression models were more robust to departure from the model than the non-sparse approaches. We applied sparse latent factor regression models to a genome-wide association study of a flowering trait for the plantArabidopsis thalianaand to an epigenome-wide association study of smoking status in pregnant women. For both applications, sparse latent factor regression models facilitated the estimation of non-null effect sizes while overcoming multiple testing issues. The results were not only consistent with previous discoveries, but they also pinpointed new genes with functional annotations relevant to each application.© 2022 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston."

However, the mechanisms underlying the disproportionate susceptibility to sepsis and worse outcomes in the elderly are not well understood. Recently, changes in DNA methylation have been shown to be linked to aging processes and age-related diseases. Thus, we postulated that age-related changes in DNA methylation may play a role in the onset and prognosis of sepsis in elderly patients. Here, we performed genome-wide methylation profiling of peripheral blood from patients with sepsis and controls. Among the CpG sites whose methylation changes may contribute to an increase in sepsis susceptibility or mortality, 241 sites that possessed age-related changes in DNA methylation in controls may partly explain the increased risk of sepsis in older adults, and 161 sites whose methylation significantly correlated with age in sepsis group may be the potential mechanisms underlying the worse outcomes of elderly septic patients. Finally, an independent cohort was used to validate our findings. Together, our study demonstrates that age-related changes in DNA methylation may explain in part the disproportionate susceptibility and worse outcomes of sepsis in older adults.Copyright © 2022 Lang, Shen, Zhu, Zhao, Chen, Zhu, Su, Wang, Wang, Neri, Jiang and Chen."
"35237284","Identification of Putative Markers of Non-infectious Bud Failure in Almond [<i>Prunus dulcis</i> (Mill.) D.A. Webb] Through Genome Wide DNA Methylation Profiling and Gene Expression Analysis in an Almond × Peach Hybrid Population.","Front Plant Sci","Almond [Prunus dulcis(Mill.) D.A. Webb] is an economically important nut crop susceptible to the genetic disorder, Non-infectious Bud Failure (NBF). Despite the severity of exhibition in several prominent almond cultivars, no causal mechanism has been identified underlying NBF development. The disorder is hypothesized to be associated with differential DNA methylation patterns based on patterns of inheritance (i.e., via sexual reproduction and clonal propagation) and previous work profiling methylation in affected trees. Peach (Prunus persicaL. Batsch) is a closely related species that readily hybridizes with almond; however, peach is not known to exhibit NBF. A cross between an NBF-exhibiting 'Carmel' cultivar and early flowering peach ('40A17') produced an F1where ∼50% of progeny showed signs of NBF, including canopy die-back, erratic branching patterns (known as ""crazy-top""), and rough bark. In this study, whole-genome DNA methylation profiles were generated for three F1progenies exhibiting NBF and three progenies considered NBF-free. Subsequent alignment to both the almond and peach reference genomes showed an increase in genome-wide methylation levels in NBF hybrids in CG and CHG contexts compared to no-NBF hybrids when aligned to the almond genome but no difference in methylation levels when aligned to the peach genome. Significantly differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identified by comparing methylation levels across the genome between NBF- and no-NBF hybrids in each methylation context. In total, 115,635 DMRs were identified based on alignment to the almond reference genome, and 126,800 DMRs were identified based on alignment to the peach reference genome. Nearby genes were identified as associated with the 39 most significant DMRs occurring either in the almond or peach alignments alone or occurring in both the almond and peach alignments. These DMR-associated genes include several uncharacterized proteins and transposable elements. Quantitative PCR was also performed to analyze the gene expression patterns of these identified gene targets to determine patterns of differential expression associated with differential DNA methylation. These DMR-associated genes, particularly those showing corresponding patterns of differential gene expression, represent key targets for almond breeding for future cultivars and mitigating the effects of NBF-exhibition in currently affected cultivars.Copyright © 2022 D’Amico-Willman, Sideli, Allen, Anderson, Gradziel and Fresnedo-Ramírez."

However, their molecular effects on the human brain are poorly studied, due to difficulty of tissue access and confounders associated with disease status. Here we examine differences in gene expression and DNA methylation associated with positive antipsychotic drug toxicology status in the human caudate nucleus. We find no genome-wide significant differences in DNA methylation, but abundant differences in gene expression. These gene expression differences are overall quite similar to gene expression differences between schizophrenia cases and controls. Interestingly, gene expression differences based on antipsychotic toxicology are different between brain regions, potentially due to affected cell type differences. We finally assess similarities with effects in a mouse model, which finds some overlapping effects but many differences as well. As a first look at the molecular effects of antipsychotics in the human brain, the lack of epigenetic effects is unexpected, possibly because long term treatment effects may be relatively stable for extended periods.© 2022.

We evaluated whether maternal adherence to the Mediterranean diet was associated with offspring cord blood DNA methylation.We meta-analysed epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) of maternal adherence to the Mediterranean diet during pregnancy and offspring cord blood DNA methylation in 2802 mother-child pairs from five cohorts. We calculated the relative Mediterranean diet (rMED) score with range 0-18 and an adjusted rMED excluding alcohol (rMEDp, range 0-16). DNA methylation was measured using Illumina 450K arrays. We used robust linear regression modelling adjusted for child sex, maternal education, age, smoking, body mass index, energy intake, batch, and cell types. We performed several functional analyses and examined the persistence of differential DNA methylation into childhood (4.5-7.8 y).rMEDp was associated with cord blood DNA methylation at cg23757341 (0.064% increase in DNA methylation per 1-point increase in the rMEDp score, SE = 0.011,P= 2.41 × 10-8). This cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) site maps toWNT5B, associated with adipogenesis and glycaemic phenotypes. We did not identify associations with childhood gene expression, nor did we find enriched biological pathways. The association did not persist into childhood.In this meta-analysis, maternal adherence to the Mediterranean diet (excluding alcohol) during pregnancy was associated with cord blood DNA methylation level at cg23757341.

Translational accuracy has been suggested on a purely correlative basis to positively coincide with maximum possible life span among different rodent species, but causal evidence that translation errors accelerate aging in vivo and limit life span is lacking. We have now addressed this question experimentally by creating heterozygous knock-in mice that express the ribosomal ambiguity mutation RPS9 D95N, resulting in genome-wide error-prone translation. Here, we show thatRps9D95N knock-in mice exhibit reduced life span and a premature onset of numerous aging-related phenotypes, such as reduced weight, chest deformation, hunchback posture, poor fur condition, and urinary syndrome, together with lymphopenia, increased levels of reactive oxygen species-inflicted damage, accelerated age-related changes in DNA methylation, and telomere attrition. Our results provide an experimental link between translational accuracy, life span, and aging-related phenotypes in mammals."
"35232984","Preterm birth buccal cell epigenetic biomarkers to facilitate preventative medicine.","Sci Rep","Preterm birth is the major cause of newborn and infant mortality affecting nearly one in every ten live births. The current study was designed to develop an epigenetic biomarker for susceptibility of preterm birth using buccal cells from the mother, father, and child (triads). An epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) was used to identify differential DNA methylation regions (DMRs) using a comparison of control term birth versus preterm birth triads. Epigenetic DMR associations with preterm birth were identified for both the mother and father that were distinct and suggest potential epigenetic contributions from both parents. The mother (165 DMRs) and female child (136 DMRs) at p < 1e-04 had the highest number of DMRs and were highly similar suggesting potential epigenetic inheritance of the epimutations. The male child had negligible DMR associations. The DMR associated genes for each group involve previously identified preterm birth associated genes. Observations identify a potential paternal germline contribution for preterm birth and identify the potential epigenetic inheritance of preterm birth susceptibility for the female child later in life. Although expanded clinical trials and preconception trials are required to optimize the potential epigenetic biomarkers, such epigenetic biomarkers may allow preventative medicine strategies to reduce the incidence of preterm birth.© 2022.

However, the functional interplay of these less abundant modified nucleotides in other eukaryotic lineages remains poorly understood. We carried out a systematic study of the content and distribution of oxi-mCs in the DNA and RNA of the basidiomycetesLaccaria bicolorandCoprinopsis cinerea,which are established models to study DNA methylation and developmental and symbiotic processes. Quantitative liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry revealed persistent but uneven occurrences of 5hmC, 5fC and 5caC in the DNA and RNA of the two organisms, which could be upregulated by vitamin C. 5caC in RNA (5carC) was predominantly found in non-ribosomal RNA, which potentially includes non-coding, messenger and small RNA species. Genome-wide mapping of 5hmC and 5fC using the single CG analysis techniques hmTOP-seq and foTOP-seq pointed at involvement of oxi-mCs in the regulation of gene expression and silencing of transposable elements. The implicated diverse roles of 5mC and oxi-mCs in the two fungi highlight the epigenetic importance of the latter modifications, which are often neglected in standard whole-genome bisulfite analyses."

Prior work has characterized and prioritized active enhancers located in LOAD-genome-wide association study (GWAS) regions and their potential interactions with candidate genes. The current study extends this work by focusing on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within these LOAD enhancers and their impact on altering transcription factor (TF) binding. The proposed bioinformatics pipeline progresses from SNPs located in LOAD-GWAS regions to a filtered set of candidate regulatory SNPs that have a predicted strong effect on TF binding.Active enhancers within LOAD-associated regions were identified and SNPs located in the enhancers were catalogued. SNPs that disrupt TF binding sites were prioritized and the respective TFs were filtered to include only those that were expressed in brain tissues relevant to LOAD. The TFs binding to the corresponding sequence was further confirmed by ChIP-seq signals. Finally, the high-priority candidate SNPs were evaluated as expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) in disease-relevant tissues.We catalogued 61 strong enhancers in LOAD-GWAS regions encompassing 326 SNPs and 104 TF binding sites. Seventy-seven and 78 of the TFs were expressed in brain and monocytes, respectively, out of which 19 TF-binding sites showed ChIP-seq signals. Eleven SNPs were found to interrupt with TF binding out of which three SNPs were also significant eQTL.This study provides a framework to catalogue noncoding variations in enhancers located in LOAD-GWAS loci and characterize their likelihood to perturb TF binding. The approach integrates multiple data types to characterize and prioritize SNPs for putative regulatory function using single-cell multi-omics assays and gene editing.© 2022 The Authors.

Environmental mixtures of EDCs might have adverse effects on human health, even though their individual concentrations are below regulatory levels of concerns. However, studies identifying and experimentally testing adverse effects of real-life mixtures are scarce. In this study, we aimed at evaluating an epidemiologically identified EDC mixture in an experimental setting to delineate its cellular and epigenetic effects. The mixture was established using data from the Swedish Environmental Longitudinal Mother and child Asthma and allergy (SELMA) study where it was associated with lower birth weight, an early marker for prenatal metabolic programming. This mixture was then tested for its ability to change metabolic programming of human mesenchymal stem cells. In these cells, we assessed if the mixture induced adipogenesis and genome-wide DNA methylation changes. The mixture increased lipid droplet accumulation already at concentrations corresponding to levels measured in the pregnant women of the SELMA study. Furthermore, we identified differentially methylated regions in genes important for adipogenesis and thermogenesis. This study shows that a mixture reflecting human real-life exposure can induce molecular and cellular changes during development that could underlie adverse outcomes."

The highly devastating potential of this phytopathogen results from the efficient production of plant cell wall-degrading enzymes, i.e., pectinases, cellulases and proteases, in addition to the impact of accessory virulence factors such as motility, siderophores, biofilm and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). LPS belongs to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and plays an important role in plant colonization and interaction with the defense systems of the host. Therefore, we decided to investigate the heterogeneity of O-polysaccharides (OPS) of LPS of different strains ofP. parmentieri, in search of an association between the selected genomic and phenotypic features of the strains that share an identical structure of the OPS molecule. In the current study, OPS were isolated from the LPS of twoP. parmentieristrains obtained either in Finland in the 1980s (SCC3193) or in Poland in 2013 (IFB5432). The purified polysaccharides were analyzed by utilizing 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy (1H, DQF-COSY, TOCSY, ROESY, HSQC, HSQC-TOCSY and HMBC) in addition to chemical methods. Sugar and methylation analyses of native polysaccharides, absolute configuration assignment of constituent monosaccharides and NMR spectroscopy data revealed that these twoP. parmentieristrains isolated in different countries possess the same structure of OPS with a very rare residue of 5,7-diamino-3,5,7,9-tetradeoxy-l-glycero-l-manno-non-2-ulosonic acid (pseudaminic acid) substituted in the position C-8: →3)-β-d-Galf-(1→3)-α-d-Galp-(1→8)-β-Pse4Ac5Ac7Ac-(2→6)-α-d-Glcp-(1→6)-β-d-Glcp-(1→.

Although nephroureterectomy is the standard treatment for UTUC, the recurrence rate is approximately half and the tumor is associated with poor prognoses. Metastases are the most devastating and lethal clinical situation in urothelial carcinoma. Despite its clinical importance, few potential diagnostic biomarkers are suitable for early UC detection. We compared high-stage/high-grade urothelial carcinoma tissues to adjacent normal urothelial tissues using methyl-CpG binding domain protein capture for genome-wide DNA methylation analysis. Based on our findings, inhibin βA (INHBA) might be associated with carcinogenesis and metastasis. Further, clinical UC specimens had significant INHBA hypomethylation based on pyrosequencing. INHBA was detected by real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry staining, and was found to be highly expressed in clinical tissues and cell lines of urothelial carcinoma. Further, INHBA depletion was found to significantly reduce BFTC-909 cell growth and migration by INHBA-specific small interfering RNA. Interestingly, a positive correlation was found between SMAD binding and extracellular structure organization with INHBA using gene set enrichment analysis and gene ontology analysis. Together, these results are the first evidence of INHBA promoter hypomethylation and INHBA overexpression in UTUC. INHBA may affect urothelial carcinoma migration by reorganizing the extracellular matrix through the SMAD pathway."

In the current study, through genome-wide analysis, a total of 122SDGswere identified in theB. napusgenome. TheseBnSDGswere subdivided into seven (I-VII) classes based on phylogeny analysis, domain configurations, and motif distribution. Segmental duplication was involved in the evolution of this family, and the duplicated genes were under strong purifying selection. The promoter sequence ofBnSDGsconsisted of various growth, hormones, and stress-related cis-acting elements along with transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) for 20 TF families in 59 of the 122BnSDGs. The gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed that BnSDGs were closely associated with histone and non-histone methylation and metal binding capacity localized mostly in the nucleus. The in silico expression analysis at four developmental stages in leaf, stem root, floral organ, silique, and seed tissues showed a broad range of tissue and stage-specific expression pattern. The expression analysis under four abiotic stresses (dehydration, cold, ABA, and salinity) also provided evidence for the importance ofBnSDGsin stress environments. Based on expression analysis, we performed reverse transcription-quantitative PCR for 15 targetBnSDGsin eight tissues (young leaf, mature leaf, root, stem, carpel, stamen, sepal, and petals).

This study is a proof of transferability from bench to bedside of this epigenetic signature. For this purpose, we used Methylation Specific High-Resolution Melting (MS-HRM), a PCR based method that can be implemented in any medical laboratory at low cost and with minimal equipment. In 23 individuals with BD, MS-HRM measures of three out of seven DMRs were technically feasible and consistencies between SeqCapEpi and MS-HRM-measures were moderate to high. In an extended sample of individuals with BD (n= 70), the three MS-HRM-measured DMRs mainly predicted nonresponse, with AUC between 0.70-0.80 according to different definitions of the phenotype (Alda- or machine-learning-based definitions). Classification tree analyses further suggested that the MS-HRM-measured DMRs correctly classified up to 84% of individuals as good or non-responders. This study suggested that epigenetic biomarkers, identified in a retrospective sample, accurately discriminate non-responders from responders to Li and may be transferrable to routine practice."

In addition, 324 genes with low methylation and high expression and 204 genes with high methylation and low expression were respectively related to the degeneration of the nervous system and the function of the cardiovascular system. Interestingly, 43 genes were up-regulated under the dual regulation of reduced miRNA and hypomethylation, while 14 genes were down-regulated under the dual regulation of increased miRNA and hypermethylation. Ten chemicals have been identified as putative therapeutic agents for pathological conditions caused by smoking.

Traditional diagnostic techniques rely heavily on heuristic approaches, coupling clinical experience from prior rare disease presentations with the medical literature. A large number of rare disease patients remain undiagnosed for years and many even die without an accurate diagnosis. In recent years, gene panels, microarrays, and exome sequencing have helped to identify the molecular cause of such rare and undiagnosed diseases. These technologies have allowed diagnoses for a sizable proportion (25-35%) of undiagnosed patients, often with actionable findings. However, a large proportion of these patients remain undiagnosed. In this review, we focus on technologies that can be adopted if exome sequencing is unrevealing. We discuss the benefits of sequencing the whole genome and the additional benefit that may be offered by long-read technology, pan-genome reference, transcriptomics, metabolomics, proteomics, and methyl profiling. We highlight computational methods to help identify regionally distant patients with similar phenotypes or similar genetic mutations. Finally, we describe approaches to automate and accelerate genomic analysis.

Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) populations experience more negative outcomes across the cancer continuum. Social conditions are instrumental in better understanding the contemporary and historical constructs that create these patterns of disparities. There is an equally important body of evidence that points to the ways that social conditions shape biological pathways. To date, these areas of research are, for the most part, separate. This paper calls for a bridging of these two areas of research to create new directions for the field of cancer disparities. We discuss inflammation, epigenetic changes, co-morbidities, and early onset as examples of the biological consequences of social conditions that BIPOC populations experience throughout their lifespan that may contribute to disproportionate tumorigenesis and tumor progression."

Thus, why searching for biological markers, when some clinical and socio-economic indicators do already provide sufficiently accurate predictions? Indeed, the search of frailty biomarkers and of their biological clocks helps to build up a mechanistic frame that may orientate the design of interventions and the time window of their efficacy.

"35228014","Ageing with HIV: Challenges and biomarkers.","EBioMedicine","The antiretroviral treatment (ART) developed to control HIV infection led to a revolution in the prognosis of people living with HIV (PLWH). PLWH underwent from suffering severe disease and often fatal complications at young ages to having a chronic condition and a life expectancy close to the general population. Nevertheless, chronic age-related diseases increase as PLWH age. The harmful effect of HIV infection on the individual's immune system adds to its deterioration during ageing, exacerbating comorbidities. In addition, PLWH are more exposed to risk factors affecting ageing, such as coinfections or harmful lifestyles. The ART initiation reverses the biological ageing process but only partially, and additionally can have some toxicities that influence ageing. Observational studies suggest premature ageing in PLWH. Therefore, there is considerable interest in the early prediction of unhealthy ageing through validated biomarkers, easy to implement in HIV-clinical settings. The most promising biomarkers are second-generation epigenetic clocks and integrative algorithms.Copyright © 2022 Fundación Investigación Biomédica del Hospital La Paz. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Maternal and paternal background, birth condition, and growth and development indicators were analyzed.The ART and NC groups exhibited differences in maternal and paternal childbearing age; maternal weight; maternal body mass index (BMI); maternal alcohol consumption; paternal smoking; delivery method; and serum zinc, iron, and lead levels. Multifactor analysis adjusted for relevant factors showed that paternal childbearing age and group significantly affected the BMD Z score. In the subgroup analysis,in vitrofertilization (IVF) (p=0.026) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) (p=0.008) had a positive impact on the BMD Z score. Male infertility only (p=0.010) or male infertility combined with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) (p=0.026) may affect the BMD Z score. In the embryo transfer cycle subgroup analysis, compared with natural conception, both stimulation cycle fresh embryo transfer (p=0.019) and natural cycle frozen embryo transfer (p=0.006) had a positive effect on the BMD Z score.The BMD levels of the ART and control groups were generally in the normal range.

"35223855","Intragenic CpG Islands and Their Impact on Gene Regulation.","Front Cell Dev Biol","The mammalian genome is depleted in CG dinucleotides, except at protected regions where they cluster as CpG islands (CGIs). CGIs are gene regulatory hubs and serve as transcription initiation sites and are as expected, associated with gene promoters. Advances in genomic annotations demonstrate that a quarter of CGIs are found within genes. Such intragenic regions are repressive environments, so it is surprising that CGIs reside here and even more surprising that some resist repression and are transcriptionally active within a gene. Hence, intragenic CGI positioning within genes is not arbitrary and is instead, selected for. As a wealth of recent studies demonstrate, intragenic CGIs are embedded within genes and consequently, influence 'host' gene mRNA isoform length and expand transcriptome diversity.Copyright © 2022 Cain, Montibus and Oakey."
"35209953","Evidence of accelerated epigenetic aging of breast tissues in patients with breast cancer is driven by CpGs associated with polycomb-related genes.","Clin Epigenetics","Age is one of the strongest risk factors for the development of breast cancer, however, the underlying etiology linking age and breast cancer remains unclear. We have previously observed links between epigenetic aging signatures in breast/tumor tissue and breast cancer risk/prevalence. However, these DNA methylation-based aging biomarkers capture diverse epigenetic phenomena and it is not known to what degree they relate to breast cancer risk, and/or progression.Using six epigenetic clocks, we analyzed whether they distinguish normal breast tissue adjacent to tumor (cases) vs normal breast tissue from healthy controls (controls).The Levine (p = 0.0037) and Yang clocks (p = 0.023) showed significant epigenetic age acceleration in cases vs controls in breast tissue. We observed that much of the difference between cases and controls is driven by CpGs associated with polycomb-related genes. Thus, we developed a new score utilizing only CpGs associated with polycomb-related genes and demonstrated that it robustly captured epigenetic age acceleration in cases vs controls (p = 0.00012). Finally, we tested whether this same signal could be seen in peripheral blood. We observed no difference in cases vs. controls and no correlation between matched tissue/blood samples, suggesting that peripheral blood is not a good surrogate marker for epigenetic age acceleration.Moving forward, it will be critical for studies to elucidate whether epigenetic age acceleration in breast tissue precedes breast cancer diagnosis and whether methylation changes at CpGs associated with polycomb-related genes can be used to assess the risk of developing breast cancer among unaffected individuals.© 2022.

Next-generation sequencing has enabled us to study the functional implication of DNA methylation across the whole genome. However, this approach usually requires a substantial amount of genomic DNA, which limits its application to defined cell types within a discrete brain region. Here, we applied two separate protocols, Accel-NGS Methyl-Seq (AM-seq) and Enzymatic Methyl-seq (EM-seq), to profile the methylome of D2 dopamine receptor-expressing medium spiny neurons (D2-MSNs) in mouse nucleus accumbens (NAc). Using 40 ng DNA extracted from FACS-isolated D2-MSNs, we found that both methods yielded comparably high-quality methylome data. Additionally, we identified numerous unmethylated regions (UMRs) as cell type-specific regulatory regions. By comparing the NAc D2-MSN methylome with the published methylomes of mouse prefrontal cortex excitatory neurons and neural progenitor cells (NPCs), we identified numerous differentially methylated CpG and non-CpG regions. Our study not only presents a comparison of these two low-input DNA whole genome methylation profiling protocols, but also provides a resource of DNA methylome of mouse accumbal D2-MSNs, a neuron type that has critical roles in addiction and other neuropsychiatric disorders."

In addition, we summarize the available multimodal single-cell omics methods that allow studying the TME from different angles, as well as their advantages and limitations. We discuss computational analysis tools, data integration, and methods to specifically study crosstalk between TME components.

Recent large-scale studies have reported genetic (i.e., protein quantitative trait loci, pQTLs) and non-genetic factors, such as age and sex, as major determinants to inter-individual variability in immune response variation. However, the contribution of blood-cell composition to plasma protein heterogeneity has not been fully characterized and may act as a mediating factor in association studies.Here, we evaluated plasma protein levels from 400 unrelated healthy individuals of western European ancestry, who were stratified by sex and two decades of life (20-29 and 60-69 years), from the Milieu Intérieur cohort. We quantified 229 proteins by Luminex in a clinically certified laboratory and their levels of variation were analyzed together with 5.2 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms. With respect to non-genetic variables, we included 254 lifestyle and biochemical factors, as well as counts of seven circulating immune cell populations measured by hemogram and standardized flow cytometry.Collectively, we found 152 significant associations involving 49 proteins and 20 non-genetic variables. Consistent with previous studies, age and sex showed a global, pervasive impact on plasma protein heterogeneity, while body mass index and other health status variables were among the non-genetic factors with the highest number of associations. After controlling for these covariates, we identified 100 and 12 pQTLs acting in cis and trans, respectively, collectively associated with 87 plasma proteins and including 19 novel genetic associations. Genetic factors explained the largest fraction of the variability of plasma protein levels, as compared to non-genetic factors. In addition, blood-cell fractions, including leukocytes, lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, and platelets, had a larger contribution to inter-individual variability than age and sex and appeared as confounders of specific genetic associations. Finally, we identified new genetic associations with plasma protein levels of five monogenic Mendelian disease genes including two primary immunodeficiency genes (Ficolin-3 and FAS).Our study identified novel genetic and non-genetic factors associated to plasma protein levels which may inform health status and disease management.© 2022.

"35241742","Gene-based association tests using GWAS summary statistics and incorporating eQTL.","Sci Rep","Although genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been successfully applied to a variety of complex diseases and identified many genetic variants underlying complex diseases via single marker tests, there is still a considerable heritability of complex diseases that could not be explained by GWAS. One alternative approach to overcome the missing heritability caused by genetic heterogeneity is gene-based analysis, which considers the aggregate effects of multiple genetic variants in a single test. Another alternative approach is transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS). TWAS aggregates genomic information into functionally relevant units that map to genes and their expression. TWAS is not only powerful, but can also increase the interpretability in biological mechanisms of identified trait associated genes. In this study, we propose a powerful and computationally efficient gene-based association test, called Overall. Using extended Simes procedure, Overall aggregates information from three types of traditional gene-based association tests and also incorporates expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) information into a gene-based association test using GWAS summary statistics. We show that after a small number of replications to estimate the correlation among the integrated gene-based tests, the p values of Overall can be calculated analytically. Simulation studies show that Overall can control type I error rates very well and has higher power than the tests that we compared with. We also apply Overall to two schizophrenia GWAS summary datasets and two lipids GWAS summary datasets. The results show that this newly developed method can identify more significant genes than other methods we compared with.© 2022. The Author(s)."

Here, we isolated isogenic human embryonic stem cell (hESC) subclones-one with a full FX mutation and one that is free of the mutation (control) but shares the same genetic background-differentiated them into induced neurons (iNs) by forced expression ofNEUROG-1, and compared the functional properties of the derived neuronal networks. High-throughput image analysis demonstrates that FX-iNs have significantly smaller cell bodies and reduced arborizations than the control. Both FX- and control-neurons can discharge repetitive action potentials, and FX neuronal networks are also able to generate spontaneous excitatory synaptic currents with slight differences from the control, demonstrating that iNs generate more mature neuronal networks than the previously used protocols. MEA analysis demonstrated that FX networks are hyperexcitable with significantly higher spontaneous burst-firing activity compared to the control. Most importantly, cross-correlation analysis enabled quantification of network connectivity to demonstrate that the FX neuronal networks are significantly less synchronous than the control, which can explain the origin of the development of intellectual dysfunction associated with FXS."

In this review, we examine how MEA technology is currently deployed in iPSC modeling studies of neurodevelopmental disorders. We first highlight the strengths of in vitro MEA technology by reviewing the history of its development and the original scientific questions MEAs were intended to answer. Methods of generating patient iPSC-derived neurons and astrocytes for MEA co-cultures are summarized. We then discuss challenges associated with MEA data analysis in a disease modeling context, and present novel computational methods used to better interpret network phenotyping data. We end by suggesting best practices for presenting MEA data in research publications, and propose that the creation of a public MEA data repository to enable collaborative data sharing would be of great benefit to the iPSC disease modeling community."

The aim of the present study was to identify gene network patterns and associated cellular immune responses in children with or without nut allergy.Transcriptome profiling of whole blood cells was compared between children with and without nut allergy. Three genes were selected to be validated on a larger cohort of samples (n = 86) by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactions (RT-qPCR). The composition of immune cells was inferred from the transcriptomic data using the CIBERSORTx algorithm. A co-expression network was constructed employing weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) on the top 5000 most variable transcripts. The modules were interrogated with pathway analysis tools (InnateDB) and correlated with clinical phenotypes and cellular immune responses.Proportions of neutrophils were positively correlated and CD4+T-cells and regulatory T-cells (Tregs) were negatively correlated with modules of nut allergy. We also identified 2 upregulated genes, namelyInterferon Induced With Helicase C Domain 1 (IFIH1),DNA damage-regulated autophagy modulator 1 (DRAM1)and a downregulated geneZinc Finger Protein 512B (ZNF512B)as hub genes for nut allergy. Further pathway analysis showed enrichment of type 1 interferon signalling in nut allergy.Our findings suggest that upregulation of type 1 interferon signalling and neutrophil responses and downregulation of CD4+T-cells and Tregs are features of the pathogenesis of nut allergy.© 2022 The Authors."
"35227298","Cell-type heterogeneity: Why we should adjust for it in epigenome and biomarker studies.","Clin Epigenetics","Most studies aiming to identify epigenetic biomarkers do so from complex tissues that are composed of many different cell-types. By definition, these cell-types vary substantially in terms of their epigenetic profiles. This cell-type specific variation among healthy cells is completely independent of the variation associated with disease, yet it dominates the epigenetic variability landscape. While cell-type composition of tissues can change in disease and this may provide accurate and reproducible biomarkers, not adjusting for the underlying cell-type heterogeneity may seriously limit the sensitivity and precision to detect disease-relevant biomarkers or hamper our understanding of such biomarkers. Given that computational and experimental tools for tackling cell-type heterogeneity are available, we here stress that future epigenetic biomarker studies should aim to provide estimates of underlying cell-type fractions for all samples in the study, and to identify biomarkers before and after adjustment for cell-type heterogeneity, in order to obtain a more complete and unbiased picture of the biomarker-landscape. This is critical, not only to improve reproducibility and for the eventual clinical application of such biomarkers, but importantly, to also improve our molecular understanding of disease itself.© 2022.

Immune mediated disorders are complex diseases for which hundreds of risk alleles have been identified by GWAS. However, the intergenic location of most of the signals has make it difficult to decipher their implication in disease pathogenesis. A significant number of immune disease-associated SNPs are located within long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). LncRNAs have gained importance due to their involvement in the regulation of a wide range of biological processes, including immune responses.

However, the underlying role of epigenetics as a mediator of this association remains unknown.DNA methylation (DNAm) in peripheral blood was measured at age 18 years in the Isle of Wight birth cohort (IOWBC) along with data on age of pubertal events, forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) at 26 years. Structural equation models were applied to examine mediation effects of DNAm on the association of age at pubertal events with FVC and FEV1. Findings were further tested in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) cohort.In the IOWBC, for females, 21 cytosine-phosphate-guanine sites (CpGs) were shown to mediate the association of age at puberty with FVC or FEV1at 26 years (p<0.05). In males, DNAm at 20 CpGs was found to mediate the association of age at puberty with FVC (p<0.05). At almost all these CpGs, indirect effects (effects of age at pubertal events on FVC or FEV1viaDNAm) contributed a smaller portion to the total effects compared to direct effects (e.g.at cg08680129, ∼22% of the estimated total effect of age at menarche on FVC at age 26 was contributed by an indirect effect). Among the IOWBC-discovered CpGs available in ALSPAC, none of them was replicated in ALSPAC (p>0.05).Our findings suggest that post-adolescence DNAm in peripheral blood is likely not to mediate the association of age at pubertal onset with young adulthood FVC or FEV1.Copyright ©The authors 2022."

Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted at three main primary health care centers at National Guard Health Affairs, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Participating parents were asked if they think their children have language delay and if they were able to detect it early. Then, validated age-appropriate screening tools were administered to assess the child's language development. The parents' answers regarding their child's language development were then compared to the screening tool assessment results. Participants A total of 250 parents attending a well-baby clinic for their children's routine vaccinations participated in the study after informed consent was obtained. Results Language delay was more prominent in the one-year-old age group (26.7%). In addition, children who were not breastfed were significantly more likely to have language delays (P-value 0.014). The parents' ability to detect language delay varied among the different age groups. Fifty-seven point one percent (57.1%) of children aged two years old and 61.5% of children aged five years old who were found to have language delay were not noticed by their parents (P-value 0.03, 0.02). Conclusion Parents showed a lack of ability to detect language delay early. Increasing their awareness of the typical language development milestones and the importance of early intervention is very important to minimize the consequences of late intervention.Copyright © 2022, Alakeely et al."
"35252485","Chronic restraint stress produces sex-specific behavioral and molecular outcomes in the dorsal and ventral rat hippocampus.","Neurobiol Stress","Stress-related disorders display differences at multiple levels according to sex. While most studies have been conducted in male rodents, less is known about comparable outcomes in females. In this study, we found that the chronic restraint stress model (2.5 h/day for 14 days) triggers different somatic responses in male and female adult rats. Chronic restraint produced a loss in sucrose preference and novel location preference in male rats. However, chronic restraint failed to produce loss of sucrose preference in females, while it improved spatial performance. We then characterized the molecular responses associated with these behaviors in the hippocampus, comparing the dorsal and ventral poles. Notably, sex- and hippocampal pole-specific transcriptional signatures were observed, along with a significant concordance between the female ventral and male dorsal profiles. Functional enrichment analysis revealed both shared and specific terms associated with each pole and sex. By looking into signaling pathways that were associated with these terms, we found an ample array of sex differences in the dorsal and, to a lesser extent, in the ventral hippocampus. These differences were mainly present in synaptic TrkB signaling, Akt pathway, and glutamatergic receptors. Unexpectedly, the effects of stress on these pathways were rather minimal and mostly dissociated from the sex-specific behavioral outcomes. Our study suggests that female rats are resilient and males susceptible to the restraint stress exposure in the sucrose preference and object location tests, while the activity of canonical signaling pathways is primarily determined by sex rather than stress in the dorsal and ventral hippocampus.© 2022 The Authors.

Studies on the underlying mechanisms and biological markers of sex differences in PSD are of great significance, but there are still few such studies. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to investigate the association of biomarkers with PSD at 3 months after minor stroke in men and women.This was a prospective multicenter cohort study that enrolled 530 patients with minor stroke (males, 415; females, 115). Demographic information and blood samples of patients were collected within 24 h of admission, and followed up at 3 months after stroke onset. PSD was defined as a depressive disorder due to another medical condition with depressive features, major depressive-like episode, or mixed-mood features according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-V). Univariate analysis was performed using the chi-square test, Mann-Whitney U test, or t-test. Partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) was used to distinguish between patients with and without PSD. Factors with variable importance for projection (VIP) > 1.0 were classified as the most important factors in the model segregation.The PLS-DA model mainly included component 1 and component 2 for males and females. For males, the model could explain 13% and 16.9% of the variables, respectively, and 29.9% of the variables in total; the most meaningful predictors were exercise habit and fibrinogen level. For females, the model could explain 15.7% and 10.5% of the variables, respectively, and 26.2% of the variables in total; the most meaningful predictors in the model were brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), magnesium and free T3. Fibrinogen was positively correlated with the Hamilton Depression Scale-17 items (HAMD-17) score. BDNF, magnesium, and free T3 levels were negatively correlated with the HAMD-17 score.This was a prospective cohort study. The most important markers found to be affecting PSD at 3 months were fibrinogen in males, and free T3, magnesium, and BDNF in females.ChiCTR-ROC-17013993 .© 2022. The Author(s)."

We also address challenges in using human postmortem and mouse tissues and outline future developments in single cell sequencing data analysis. Importantly, we have implemented our recommended workflow for each major analytic direction and applied them to a large single nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) dataset in AD. Key analytic results are reported while the scripts and the data are shared with the research community through  GitHub. In summary, this comprehensive review provides insights into various approaches to analyze single cell sequencing data and offers specific guidelines for study design and a variety of analytic directions.

"35256811","Hibernation slows epigenetic ageing in yellow-bellied marmots.","Nat Ecol Evol","Species that hibernate generally live longer than would be expected based solely on their body size. Hibernation is characterized by long periods of metabolic suppression (torpor) interspersed by short periods of increased metabolism (arousal). The torpor-arousal cycles occur multiple times during hibernation, and it has been suggested that processes controlling the transition between torpor and arousal states cause ageing suppression. Metabolic rate is also a known correlate of longevity; we thus proposed the 'hibernation-ageing hypothesis' whereby ageing is suspended during hibernation. We tested this hypothesis in a well-studied population of yellow-bellied marmots (Marmota flaviventer), which spend 7-8 months per year hibernating. We used two approaches to estimate epigenetic age: the epigenetic clock and the epigenetic pacemaker. Variation in epigenetic age of 149 samples collected throughout the life of 73 females was modelled using generalized additive mixed models (GAMM), where season (cyclic cubic spline) and chronological age (cubic spline) were fixed effects. As expected, the GAMM using epigenetic ages calculated from the epigenetic pacemaker was better able to detect nonlinear patterns in epigenetic ageing over time. We observed a logarithmic curve of epigenetic age with time, where the epigenetic age increased at a higher rate until females reached sexual maturity (two years old). With respect to circannual patterns, the epigenetic age increased during the active season and essentially stalled during the hibernation period. Taken together, our results are consistent with the hibernation-ageing hypothesis and may explain the enhanced longevity in hibernators.© 2022. The Author(s)."

However, previous studies have only identified common single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) within theTHADAgene, neglecting the rare variants and other genes in 2p21; thus, this study was designed to investigate additional variants and novel susceptibility genes in 2p21. A total of 159 NSCL/P patients and 542 controls were recruited in the discovery phase, whereas 1830 NSCL/P patients and 2,436 controls were recruited in the replication phase. After targeted region sequencing, we performed association and burden analyses for the common and rare variants, respectively. Furthermore, RNA-seq, proliferation assay and cell cycle analysis were performed to clarify the possible function of the candidate geneZFP36L2. Association analysis showed that four SNPs were specifically associated with non-syndromic cleft lip only (NSCLO) and two SNPs were associated with both NSCLO and NSCL/P. Burden analysis indicated thatZFP36L2was associated with NSCLO (p= .0489, OR = 2.41, 95% CI: 0.98-5.90).

However, the genetic architecture of CC, AC, and WC is still elusive. Here, we performed single-trait and multi-trait genome-wide association studies (GWASs) for CC, AC, and WC in 2,206 American origin Duroc (AOD) and 2,082 Canadian origin Duroc (COD) pigs. As a result, one novel quantitative trait locus (QTL) onSus scrofachromosome (SSC) one was associated with CC and AC in COD pigs, which spans 6.92 Mb (from 170.06 to 176.98 Mb). Moreover, multi-trait GWAS identified 21 significant SNPs associated with the three conformation traits, indicating the multi-trait GWAS is a powerful statistical approach that uncovers pleiotropic locus. Finally, the three candidate genes (ITGA11, TLE3, andGALC) were selected that may play a role in the conformation traits. Further bioinformatics analysis indicated that the candidate genes for the three conformation traits mainly participated in sphingolipid metabolism and lysosome pathways. For all we know, this study was the first GWAS for WC in pigs. In general, our findings further reveal the genetic architecture of CC, AC, and WC, which may offer a useful reference for improving the conformation traits in pigs.Copyright © 2022 Zhou, Ding, Zhuang, Zeng, Wen, Ruan, Wu, Qiu, Zheng, Cai, Yang, Wu and Yang."
"35223214","Functional network motifs defined through integration of protein-protein and genetic interactions.","PeerJ","Cells are enticingly complex systems. The identification of feedback regulation is critically important for understanding this complexity. Network motifs defined as small graphlets that occur more frequently than expected by chance have revolutionized our understanding of feedback circuits in cellular networks. However, with their definition solely based on statistical over-representation, network motifs often lack biological context, which limits their usefulness. Here, we define functional network motifs (FNMs) through the systematic integration of genetic interaction data that directly inform on functional relationships between genes and encoded proteins. Occurring two orders of magnitude less frequently than conventional network motifs, we found FNMs significantly enriched in genes known to be functionally related. Moreover, our comprehensive analyses of FNMs in yeast showed that they are powerful at capturing both known and putative novel regulatory interactions, thus suggesting a promising strategy towards the systematic identification of feedback regulation in biological networks. Many FNMs appeared as excellent candidates for the prioritization of follow-up biochemical characterization, which is a recurring bottleneck in the targeting of complex diseases. More generally, our work highlights a fruitful avenue for integrating and harnessing genomic network data.©2022 Sahoo and Pechmann."

"35194621","The public health impact of poor sleep on severe COVID-19, influenza and upper respiratory infections.","medRxiv","Poor sleep is associated with an increased risk of infections and all-cause mortality, and acute sleep loss and disruption have been linked with inflammation and poorer immune control. Previous studies, however, have been unable to evidence causality between the chronic effects of poor sleep and respiratory infection risk. In light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and potential future disease outbreaks, understanding the risk factors for these infections is of great importance.Our goal was to understand if chronic poor sleep could be identified as a causal risk factor for respiratory infections including influenza, upper respiratory infections and COVID-19.We used population cohorts from the UK Biobank (N ≈ 231,000) and FinnGen (N ≈ 327,000) with ICD-10 based electronic health records and obtained diagnoses of insomnia, influenza and upper respiratory infections (URIs) from primary care and hospital settings. We computed logistic regression to assess association between poor sleep and infections, disease free survival hazard ratios, and used summary statistics from genome-wide association studies of insomnia, influenza, URI and COVID-19 to perform Mendelian randomization analyses and assess causality.Utilizing 23 years of registry data and follow-up, we saw that insomnia diagnosis associated with increased risk for infections in FinnGen and in UK Biobank (FinnGen influenza HR = 5.32 [4.09, 6.92], P = 1.02×10-35, UK Biobank influenza HR = 1.54 [1.37, 1.73], P = 2.49×10-13). Mendelian randomization indicated that insomnia causally predisposed to influenza (OR = 1.59, P = 6.23×10-4), upper respiratory infections (OR = 1.71, P = 7.60×10-13), COVID-19 infection (OR = 1.08, P = 0.037) and risk of hospitalization from COVID-19 (OR = 1.47, P = 4.96×10-5).Our findings indicate that chronic poor sleep is a causal risk factor for contracting respiratory infections, and in addition contributes to the severity of respiratory infections. These findings highlight the role of sleep in maintaining sufficient immune response against pathogens as suggested by earlier work. As the current COVID-19 pandemic has increased the number of people suffering from poor sleep, safe interventions such as sleep management and treating individuals with insomnia could be promoted to reduce infections and save lives."
"35216315","The Mitochondrial Epigenome: An Unexplored Avenue to Explain Unexplained Myopathies?","Int J Mol Sci","Mutations in either mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) or nuclear genes that encode mitochondrial proteins may lead to dysfunctional mitochondria, giving rise to mitochondrial diseases. Some mitochondrial myopathies, however, present without a known underlying cause. Interestingly, methylation of mtDNA has been associated with various clinical pathologies. The present study set out to assess whether mtDNA methylation could explain impaired mitochondrial function in patients diagnosed with myopathy without known underlying genetic mutations. Enhanced mtDNA methylation was indicated by pyrosequencing for muscle biopsies of 14 myopathy patients compared to four healthy controls, at selected cytosines in the Cytochrome B (CYTB) gene, but not within the displacement loop (D-loop) region. The mtDNA methylation patterns of the four healthy muscle biopsies were highly consistent and showed intriguing tissue-specific differences at particular cytosines with control skin fibroblasts cultured in vitro. Within individual myopathy patients, the overall mtDNA methylation pattern correlated well between muscle and skin fibroblasts. Despite this correlation, a pilot analysis of four myopathy and five healthy fibroblast samples did not reveal a disease-associated difference in mtDNA methylation. We did, however, detect increased expression of solute carrier family 25A26 (SLC25A26), encoding the importer of S-adenosylmethionine, together with enhanced mtDNA copy numbers in myopathy fibroblasts compared to healthy controls. To confirm that pyrosequencing indeed reflected DNA methylation and not bisulfite accessibility, mass spectrometry was employed. Although no myopathy-related differences in total amount of methylated cytosines were detected at this stage, a significant contribution of contaminating nuclear DNA (nDNA) was revealed, and steps to improve enrichment for mtDNA are reported. In conclusion, in this explorative study we show that analyzing the mitochondrial genome beyond its sequence opens novel avenues to identify potential molecular biomarkers assisting in the diagnosis of unexplained myopathies."
"35261972","A deterministic code for transcription factor-DNA recognition through computation of binding interfaces.","NAR Genom Bioinform","The recognition code between transcription factor (TF) amino acids and DNA bases remains poorly understood. Here, the determinants of TF amino acid-DNA base binding selectivity were identified through the analysis of crystals of TF-DNA complexes. Selective, high-frequency interactions were identified for the vast majority of amino acid side chains ('structural code'). DNA binding specificities were then independently assessed by meta-analysis of random-mutagenesis studies of Zn finger-target DNA sequences. Selective, high-frequency interactions were identified for the majority of mutagenized residues ('mutagenesis code'). The structural code and the mutagenesis code were shown to match to a striking level of accuracy (P = 3.1 × 10-33), suggesting the identification of fundamental rules of TF binding to DNA bases. Additional insight was gained by showing a geometry-dictated choice among DNA-binding TF residues with overlapping specificity. These findings indicate the existence of a DNA recognition mode whereby the physical-chemical characteristics of the interacting residues play a deterministic role. The discovery of this DNA recognition code advances our knowledge on fundamental features of regulation of gene expression and is expected to pave the way for integration with higher-order complexity approaches.© The Author(s) 2022.

Aberrant DNAm has an implication in different human diseases such as cancer, schizophrenia, and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). ASD is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects behavior, learning, and communication skills. Acyl-CoA synthetase family member 3 (ACSF3) encodes malonyl-CoA synthetase that is involved in the synthesis and oxidation of fatty acids. The dysregulation in such gene has been reported in combined malonic and methylmalonic aciduria associated with neurological symptoms such as memory problems, psychiatric diseases, and/or cognitive decline. This research aims to study DNAm in the transcription factor (TF) binding site ofACSF3in Saudi autistic children. To determine whether the DNAm of the TF-binding site is a cause or a consequence of transcription regulation ofACSF3.RT-qPCR and DNA methylight qPCR were used to determine the expression and DNAm level in the promoter region ofACSF3, respectively. DNA and RNA were extracted from 19 cases of ASD children and 18 control samples from their healthy siblings.The results showed a significant correlation between the gene expression ofACSF3and specificity protein 1 (SP1) in 17 samples of ASD patients, where both genes were upregulated in 9 samples and downregulated in 8 samples.Although this study found no DNAm in the binding site ofSP1within theACSF3promoter, the indicated correlation highlights a possible role ofACSF3andSP1in ASD patients.© 2022 Algothmi et al."
"35192609","Lrh1 can help reprogram sexual cell fate and is required for Sertoli cell development and spermatogenesis in the mouse testis.","PLoS Genet","The mammalian nuclear hormone receptors LRH1 (NR5A2) and SF1 (NR5A1) are close paralogs that can bind the same DNA motif and play crucial roles in gonadal development and function. Lrh1 is essential for follicle development in the ovary and has been proposed to regulate steroidogenesis in the testis. Lrh1 expression in the testis is highly elevated by loss of the sex regulator Dmrt1, which triggers male-to-female transdifferentiation of Sertoli cells. While Sf1 has a well-defined and crucial role in testis development, no function for Lrh1 in the male gonad has been reported. Here we use conditional genetics to examine Lrh1 requirements both in gonadal cell fate reprogramming and in normal development of the three major cell lineages of the mouse testis. We find that loss of Lrh1 suppresses sexual transdifferentiation, confirming that Lrh1 can act as a key driver in reprogramming sexual cell fate. In otherwise wild-type testes, we find that Lrh1 is dispensable in Leydig cells but is required in Sertoli cells for their proliferation, for seminiferous tubule morphogenesis, for maintenance of the blood-testis barrier, for feedback regulation of androgen production, and for support of spermatogenesis. Expression profiling identified misexpressed genes likely underlying most aspects of the Sertoli cell phenotype. In the germ line we found that Lrh1 is required for maintenance of functional spermatogonia, and hence mutants progressively lose spermatogenesis. Reduced expression of the RNA binding factor Nxf2 likely contributes to the SSC defect. Unexpectedly, however, over time the Lrh1 mutant germ line recovered abundant spermatogenesis and fertility. This finding indicates that severe germ line depletion triggers a response allowing mutant spermatogonia to recover the ability to undergo complete spermatogenesis. Our results demonstrate that Lrh1, like Sf1, is an essential regulator of testis development and function but has a very distinct repertoire of functions."

Furthermore, the prognostic value of NLR was evaluated by Multivariable Cox Regression analysis.There were 96 patients with GCT. It was found that only NLR values had prognostic significance for predicting recurrence (AUC:0.647; 95% CI:0.533-0.762; P=0.021). The statistically significant cut-off value of NLR for predicting recurrence was ≥2.25. NLR was ≥2.25 in 51% (n = 49) of patients. Multivariable analysis showed that NLR ≥2.25 (HR=2.9, 95% CI:1.3-6.6; p=0.009) and lung metastasis (HR=7.9, 95% CI:2.2-28.2; p=0.001) were independent factors of recurrence. In patients with lung metastasis and patients with NLR ≥2.25, recurrence was observed in a sooner period (Log rank test; p=0.001; p=0.009, respectively).Our findings showed that NLR is a new and promising inflammation-based prognostic factor in GCT patients.© 2021 Yapar A et al."

"35202215","The Usefulness of Peripheral Blood Cell Counts to Distinguish COVID-19 from Dengue during Acute Infection.","Trop Med Infect Dis","COVID-19 and dengue disease are challenging to tell apart because they have similarities in clinical and laboratory features during the acute phase of infection, leading to misdiagnosis and delayed treatment. The present study evaluated peripheral blood cell count accuracy to distinguish COVID-19 non-critical patients from non-severe dengue cases between the second and eleventh day after symptom onset. A total of 288 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (n = 105) or dengue virus (n = 183) were included in this study. Neutrophil, platelet, and lymphocyte counts were used to calculate the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), the platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and the neutrophil-lymphocyte*platelet ratio (NLPR). The logistic regression and ROC curves analysis revealed that neutrophil and platelet counts, NLR, LPR, and NLPR were higher in COVID-19 than dengue. The multivariate predictive model showed that the neutrophils, platelets, and NLPR were independently associated with COVID-19 with a good fit predictive value (p= 0.1041). The neutrophil (AUC = 0.95, 95% CI = 0.84-0.91), platelet (AUC = 0.89, 95% CI = 0.85-0.93) counts, and NLR (AUC = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.84-0.91) were able to discriminate COVID-19 from dengue with high sensitivity and specificity values (above 80%). Finally, based on predicted probabilities on combining neutrophils and platelets with NLR or NLPR, the adjusted AUC was 0.97 (95% CI = 0.94-0.98) to differentiate COVID-19 from dengue during the acute phase of infection with outstanding accuracy. These findings might suggest that the neutrophil, platelet counts, and NLR or NLPR provide a quick and cost-effective way to distinguish between dengue and COVID-19 in the context of co-epidemics in low-income tropical regions."

Accelerated aging, calculated from the discrepancy between the chronological age and the epigenetic age, has shown to predict morbidity and mortality rate. We assumed that deconvolution of epigenetic age to its components could shed light on the diversity of epigenetic, and by inference, on inter-individual variability in the causes of biological aging.Using the Horvath original epigenetic clock, we identified several CpG sites linked to distinct genes that quantitatively explain much of the inter-personal variability in epigenetic aging, with CpG sites related to secretagogin and malin being the most variable. We show that equal epigenetic age in different subjects can result from variable contribution size of the same CpG sites to the total epigenetic age. In a healthy cohort, the most variable CpG sites are responsible for accelerated and decelerated epigenetic aging, relative to chronological age.Of the 353 CpG sites that form the basis for the Horvath epigenetic age, we have found the CpG sites that are responsible for accelerated and decelerated epigenetic aging in healthy subjects. However, the relative contribution of each site to aging varies between individuals, leading to variable personal aging patterns. Our findings pave the way to form personalized aging cards allowing the identification of specific genes related to CpG sites, as aging markers, and perhaps treatment of these targets in order to hinder undesirable age drifting.© 2022.

Here, we investigate DNA methylation of recombinant unmodified, H3KC4me3 and H3KC36me3 containing mononucleosomes by DNMT3A2, DNMT3A catalytic domain (DNMT3AC) and the DNMT3AC/3B3C complex. We show strong protection of the nucleosomal bound DNA against methylation, but efficient linker-DNA methylation next to the nucleosome core. High and low methylation levels of two specific CpG sites next to the nucleosome core agree well with details of the DNMT3A2/3B3-nucleosome structure. Linker DNA methylation next to the nucleosome is increased in the absence of H3K4me3, likely caused by binding of the H3-tail to the ADD domain leading to relief of autoinhibition. Our data demonstrate a strong stimulatory effect of H3K36me3 on linker DNA methylation, which is independent of the DNMT3A-PWWP domain. This observation reveals a direct functional role of H3K36me3 on the stimulation of DNA methylation, which could be explained by hindering the interaction of the H3-tail and the linker DNA. We propose an evolutionary model in which the direct stimulatory effect of H3K36me3 on DNA methylation preceded its signaling function, which could explain the evolutionary origin of the widely distributed ""active gene body-H3K36me3-DNA methylation"" connection.© 2022.

This phenomenon, known as phenotypic plasticity, is common amongst plants and animals, but arguably the most striking examples are seen in insects. Well-known insect examples include seasonal morphs of butterfly wing patterns, sexual and asexual reproduction in aphids, and queen and worker castes of eusocial insects. Ultimately, we need to understand how phenotypic plasticity works at a mechanistic level; how do environmental signals alter gene expression, and how are changes in gene expression translated into novel morphology, physiology and behaviour? Understanding how plasticity works is of major interest in evolutionary-developmental biology and may have implications for understanding how insects respond to global change. It has been proposed that epigenetic mechanisms, specifically DNA methylation, are the key link between environmental cues and changes in gene expression. Here, we review the available evidence on the function of DNA methylation of insects, the possible role(s) for DNA methylation in phenotypic plasticity and also highlight key outstanding questions in this field as well as new experimental approaches to address these questions."

Nutrition is an important key factor in the prevention and treatment of lung cancer. Various factors appear to be involved in the development of the latter, such as cigarette smoking or certain external environmental factors. The increase in oxidative stress is therefore an integral part of the carcinogenesis process. The biological role of bioactive factors derived from adipose tissue, mainly adipokines, is implicated in various cancers, and an increasing body of evidence has shown that certain adipocytokines contribute to the development, progression and prognosis of lung cancer. Not all adipokines stimulate tumor growth; in fact, adiponectin inhibits carcinogenesis by regulating both cell growth and the levels of inflammatory cytokines. Adiponectin expression is deregulated in several cancer types. Many nutritional factors have been shown to increase adiponectin levels and therefore could be used as a new therapeutic strategy for combating lung cancer. In addition, foods with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties play a key role in the prevention of many human diseases, including lung cancer. The purpose of this review is to analyze the role of diet in lung cancer in order to recommend dietary habit and lifestyle changes to prevent or treat this pathology."

PD is considered a multifactorial disease, since both genetic and environmental factors contribute to its pathogenesis, although the molecular mechanisms linking these two key disease modifiers remain obscure. In this context, epigenetic mechanisms that alter gene expression without affecting the DNA sequence through DNA methylation, histone post-transcriptional modifications, and non-coding RNAs may represent the key mediators of the genetic-environmental interactions underlying PD pathogenesis. Environmental exposures may cause chemical alterations in several cellular functions, including gene expression. Emerging evidence has highlighted that smoking, coffee consumption, pesticide exposure, and heavy metals (manganese, arsenic, lead, etc.) may potentially affect the risk of PD development at least partially via epigenetic modifications. Herein, we discuss recent accumulating pre-clinical and clinical evidence of the impact of lifestyle and environmental factors on the epigenetic mechanisms underlying PD development, aiming to shed more light on the pathogenesis and stimulate future research."

However, the m6A writer complex, a key executor of m6A methylation modification, has not been independently investigated, and its specific bioinformatics analysis has not yet been performed in HCC. In this study, we used multiple public databases to evaluate the diagnostic, therapeutic, and prognostic value of the m6A writers in HCC. The results showed that expression levels of METTL3, VIRMA and CBLL1 were significantly increased, while expression levels of METTL14 and ZC3H13 were significantly decreased in HCC, which was closely related to clinicopathological factors, such as tumor stage and prognosis. Bioinformatics further explored the possible underlying mechanisms by which the m6A writer complex are involved in activation of tumor-promoting pathways and/or inhibition of tumor-suppressing pathways, including apoptosis, cell cycle, DNA damage response and EMT. Furthermore, we showed that the m6A writer complex is correlated with immune cell infiltration and immunoregulator expression in HCC. In conclusion, the m6A writer complex may represent a promising biomarker and target that can guide targeted therapy or immunotherapy for HCC patients.Copyright © 2022 Gu, Du, Zhao and Wang."

This failure can be related to a phenotype of accelerated aging. In this work, we considered 76 patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and 83 healthy controls. We concomitantly evaluated for the first time two measures that can be informative of the rate of aging, i.e., whole blood DNA methylation using the Illumina Infinium EPIC array and plasma levels of a selection of inflammatory/immunological proteins using multiplex immunoassays. First of all, we demonstrated accelerated aging in terms of the most common epigenetic age estimators in CKD patients. Moreover, we developed a new clock/predictor of age based on the inflammatory/immunological profile (ipAGE) and identified the inflammatory/immunological biomarkers differentially expressed between cases and controls. IpAGE appeared to be more sensitive than epigenetic clocks in quantifying the accelerated aging phenotype of ESRD patients. Interestingly, we did not find any correlation between the age acceleration evaluated according to the epigenetic clocks and ipAGE in either the ESRD group or the control group. On the whole, our data show a consistent accelerated aging phenotype in ESRD patients, which is better appreciated by quantifying the underlying inflammatory processes (inflammaging) by ipAGE than by using epigenetic clocks.© 2022.

There is, however, limited mechanistic knowledge of how the interplay between these determinants influences prostate tumor aggressiveness in AA men and other men of African ancestry. Growing evidence indicates that chronic psychosocial stress in AA populations leads to sustained glucocorticoid signaling through the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), with negative physiological and pathological consequences. Compelling evidence indicates that treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) with anti-androgen therapy activates GR signaling. This enhanced GR signaling bypasses androgen receptor (AR) signaling and transcriptionally activates both AR-target genes and GR-target genes, resulting in increased prostate tumor resistance to anti-androgen therapy, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. Given its enhanced signaling in AA men, GR-together with specific genetic drivers-may promote CRPC progression and exacerbate tumor aggressiveness in this population, potentially contributing to PCa mortality disparities. Ongoing and future CRPC clinical trials that combine standard of care therapies with GR modulators should assess racial differences in therapy response and clinical outcomes in order to improve PCa health disparities that continue to exist for AA men."

All samples were pooled for the path analysis.Association of BMI with type 2 diabetes and fasting glucose may be greater in those without obesity (OR=7.77, p=0.015 and β=0.213, p=9.53×10-5, respectively) than in those with obesity (OR=5.01, p=1.12×10-9and β=0.162, p=5.63×10-6, respectively). We did not observe evidence of differences in the association of BMI with type 2 diabetes or fasting glucose by genotype. In the path analysis, the minor allele has direct negative (lower odds of type 2 diabetes and fasting glucose) and indirect positive (higher odds of type 2 diabetes and fasting glucose) effects on type 2 diabetes risk and fasting glucose, with the indirect effects mediated through adirectpositive effect of rs373863828 on BMI.There may be a stronger effect of BMI on fasting glucose in Polynesian individuals without obesity than in those with obesity. Carrying the rs373863828 minor allele does not decouple higher BMI from higher odds of type 2 diabetes.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC. No commercial re-use.

"35215304","SAMe, Choline, and Valproic Acid as Possible Epigenetic Drugs: Their Effects in Pregnancy with a Special Emphasis on Animal Studies.","Pharmaceuticals (Basel)","In this review, we discuss the functions and main effects on pregnancy outcomes of three agents that have the ability to induce epigenetic modifications: valproic acid (VPA), a well-known teratogen that is a histone deacetylase inhibitor; S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe), the most effective methyl donor; and choline, an important micronutrient involved in the one methyl group cycle and in the synthesis of SAMe. Our aim was to describe the possible effects of these compounds when administered during pregnancy on the developing embryo and fetus or, if administered postnatally, their effects on the developing child. These substances are able to modify gene expression and possibly alleviate neurobehavioral changes in disturbances that have epigenetic origins, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), depression, Rett syndrome, and fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). Valproic acid and SAMe are antagonistic epigenetic modulators whether administered in utero or postnatally. However, VPA is a major human teratogen and, whenever possible, should not be used by pregnant women. Most currently relevant data come from experimental animal studies that aimed to explore the possibility of using these substances as epigenetic modifiers and possible therapeutic agents. In experimental animals, each of these substances was able to alleviate the severity of several well-known diseases by inducing changes in the expression of affected genes or by other yet unknown mechanisms. We believe that additional studies are needed to further explore the possibility of using these substances, and similar compounds, for the treatment of ""epigenetic human diseases""."

A potential role of such vesicles in AD pathology is unexplored.In a case-control study of randomly selected patients with AD and other neurological diseases (n = 14), and healthy controls (n = 7), we systematically analyzed the content of pEV, using different assay systems. In addition, we determined their entry path into brain tissue, employing animal (mice) injection experiments with ex vivo generated EV that were similar to AD-pEV, followed by multi antigen analysis (MAA) of brain tissue (n = 4 per condition). The results were compared with an IHC staining of human brain tissue in a small cohort of AD patients (n = 3) and controls with no neurodegenerative diseases (n = 3).We show that pEV levels are considerably upregulated in AD patients. Besides numerous inflammatory effectors, AD-pEV contained α-, β- and γ-secretases, able to cleave APP in in target cells. In vitro generated EV with similar characteristics as AD-pEV accumulated in the choroid plexus (CP) of injected animals and reached primarily hippocampal neurons. Corroborating findings were made in human brain samples. An inhibitor of hyaluronic-acid-synthetase (HAS) blocked uploading of proteases and Hyaluronan onto EV in vitro and abolished CP targeting in animal injection experiments.We conclude that protease-containing pEV could be part of a communication axis between the periphery and the brain that could be become detrimental depending on pEV concentration and duration of target cell impact.Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

"35232963","Robust Mendelian randomization in the presence of residual population stratification, batch effects and horizontal pleiotropy.","Nat Commun","Mendelian Randomization (MR) studies are threatened by population stratification, batch effects, and horizontal pleiotropy. Although a variety of methods have been proposed to mitigate those problems, residual biases may still remain, leading to highly statistically significant false positives in large databases. Here we describe a suite of sensitivity analysis tools that enables investigators to quantify the robustness of their findings against such validity threats. Specifically, we propose the routine reporting of sensitivity statistics that reveal the minimal strength of violations necessary to explain away the MR results. We further provide intuitive displays of the robustness of the MR estimate to any degree of violation, and formal bounds on the worst-case bias caused by violations multiple times stronger than observed variables. We demonstrate how these tools can aid researchers in distinguishing robust from fragile findings by examining the effect of body mass index on diastolic blood pressure and Townsend deprivation index.© 2022.

"35264783","Application of omics in hypertension and resistant hypertension.","Hypertens Res","Hypertension is a major modifiable risk factor that affects the global health burden. Despite the availability of multiple antihypertensive drugs, blood pressure is often not optimally controlled. The prevalence of true resistant hypertension in treated hypertensive patients is ~2-20%, and these patients are at higher risk for adverse events and poor clinical outcomes. Therefore, an in-depth dissection of the pathophysiological mechanisms of hypertension and resistant hypertension is needed to identify more effective targets for regulating blood pressure. Omics technologies, such as genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and microbiomics, can accurately present the characteristics of organisms at varying molecular levels. Integrative omics can further reveal the network of interactions between molecular levels and provide a complete dynamic view of the organism. In this review, we describe the applications, progress, and challenges of omics technologies in hypertension. Specifically, we discuss the application of omics in resistant hypertension. We believe that omics approaches will produce a better understanding of the pathogenesis of hypertension and resistant hypertension and improve diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, thus increasing rates of blood pressure control and reducing the public health burden of hypertension.© 2022.

Here, we obtained transcriptomes from subgenual anterior cingulate cortex and amygdala samples from post-mortem brains of individuals with BD and neurotypical controls, including 511 total samples from 295 unique donors. We examined differential gene expression between cases and controls and the transcriptional effects of BD-associated genetic variants. We found two coexpressed modules that were associated with transcriptional changes in BD: one enriched for immune and inflammatory genes and the other with genes related to the postsynaptic membrane. Over 50% of BD genome-wide significant loci contained significant expression quantitative trait loci (QTL) (eQTL), and these data converged on several individual genes, including SCN2A and GRIN2A. Thus, these data implicate specific genes and pathways that may contribute to the pathology of BP.© 2022. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc."

The expression levels ofSORT1, PSRC1, andCELSR2in liver cells were significantly associated with CAD. Higher expression levels ofSORT1, PSRC1, andCELSR2in the liver were significantly associated with lower circulating LDL-C levels and CAD risk.PSRC1variants were strongly associated withSORT1, PSRC1, andCELSR2gene expression in liver cells. Higher circulating granulin and apolipoprotein B levels, which were strongly affected byPSRC1variants, were significantly associated with higher LDL-C levels and CAD risk, with odds ratios of 1.15 (1.10-1.19) and 1.45 (1.21-1.74), respectively.This study showed that regulatory SNPs inPSRC1may affect CAD risk by alteringCELSR2, PSRC1, andSORT1gene expression in liver cells and circulating granulins and apolipoprotein B proteins.Copyright © 2022 Chai, Wang, Yang, Qiu and Chen."

In this study, we characterized the biological heterogeneity of PTSD symptom clusters by performing a multi-omics investigation integrating genetically regulated gene, splicing, and protein expression in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex tissue within a sample of US veterans enrolled in the Million Veteran Program (Ntotal = 186,689). We identified 30 genes in 19 regions across the three PTSD symptom clusters. We found nine genes to have cell-type specific expression, and over-representation of miRNA-families - miR-148, 30, and 8. Gene-drug target prioritization approach highlighted cyclooxygenase and acetylcholine compounds. Next, we tested molecular-profile based phenome-wide impact of identified genes with respect to 1678 phenotypes derived from the Electronic Health Records of the Vanderbilt University biorepository (N = 70,439). Lastly, we tested for local genetic correlation across PTSD symptom clusters which highlighted metabolic (e.g., obesity, diabetes, vascular health) and laboratory traits (e.g., neutrophil, eosinophil, tau protein, creatinine kinase). Overall, this study finds comprehensive genomic evidence including clinical and regulatory profiles between PTSD, hematologic and cardiometabolic traits, that support comorbidities observed in epidemiologic studies of PTSD.© 2022.

"35202437","Protein prediction for trait mapping in diverse populations.","PLoS One","Genetically regulated gene expression has helped elucidate the biological mechanisms underlying complex traits. Improved high-throughput technology allows similar interrogation of the genetically regulated proteome for understanding complex trait mechanisms. Here, we used the Trans-omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) Multi-omics pilot study, which comprises data from Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), to optimize genetic predictors of the plasma proteome for genetically regulated proteome-wide association studies (PWAS) in diverse populations. We built predictive models for protein abundances using data collected in TOPMed MESA, for which we have measured 1,305 proteins by a SOMAscan assay. We compared predictive models built via elastic net regression to models integrating posterior inclusion probabilities estimated by fine-mapping SNPs prior to elastic net. In order to investigate the transferability of predictive models across ancestries, we built protein prediction models in all four of the TOPMed MESA populations, African American (n = 183), Chinese (n = 71), European (n = 416), and Hispanic/Latino (n = 301), as well as in all populations combined. As expected, fine-mapping produced more significant protein prediction models, especially in African ancestries populations, potentially increasing opportunity for discovery. When we tested our TOPMed MESA models in the independent European INTERVAL study, fine-mapping improved cross-ancestries prediction for some proteins. Using GWAS summary statistics from the Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) study, which comprises ∼50,000 Hispanic/Latinos, African Americans, Asians, Native Hawaiians, and Native Americans, we applied S-PrediXcan to perform PWAS for 28 complex traits. The most protein-trait associations were discovered, colocalized, and replicated in large independent GWAS using proteome prediction model training populations with similar ancestries to PAGE. At current training population sample sizes, performance between baseline and fine-mapped protein prediction models in PWAS was similar, highlighting the utility of elastic net. Our predictive models in diverse populations are publicly available for use in proteome mapping methods at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4837327."

The reasons for the younger age of onset in relation to obesity, beta cell function and insulin sensitivity are under-explored.Two cohorts of Asian Indians, the ICMR-INDIAB cohort (Indian Council of Medical Research-India Diabetes Study) and the DMDSC cohort (Dr Mohan's Diabetes Specialties Centre), and one of white Europeans, the ESDC (East Scotland Diabetes Cohort), were used. Using a cross-sectional design, we examined the comparative prevalence of healthy, overweight and obese participants with young-onset diabetes, classified according to their BMI. We explored the role of clinically measured beta cell function in diabetes onset in Asian Indians. Finally, the comparative distribution of a partitioned polygenic score (pPS) for risk of diabetes due to poor beta cell function was examined. Replication of the genetic findings was sought using data from the UK Biobank.The prevalence of young-onset diabetes with normal BMI was 9.3% amongst white Europeans and 24-39% amongst Asian Indians. In Asian Indians with young-onset diabetes, after adjustment for family history of type 2 diabetes, sex, insulin sensitivity and HDL-cholesterol, stimulated C-peptide was 492 pmol/ml (IQR 353-616, p<0.0001) lower in lean compared with obese individuals. Asian Indians in our study, and South Asians from the UK Biobank, had a higher number of risk alleles than white Europeans. After weighting the pPS for beta cell function, Asian Indians have lower genetically determined beta cell function than white Europeans (p<0.0001). The pPS was associated with age of diagnosis in Asian Indians but not in white Europeans. The pPS explained 2% of the variation in clinically measured beta cell function, and 1.2%, 0.97%, and 0.36% of variance in age of diabetes amongst Asian Indians with normal BMI, or classified as overweight and obese BMI, respectively.The prevalence of lean BMI in young-onset diabetes is over two times higher in Asian Indians compared with white Europeans. This phenotype of lean, young-onset diabetes appears driven in part by lower beta cell function. We demonstrate that Asian Indians with diabetes also have lower genetically determined beta cell function.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35205424","Leveraging Gene-Level Prediction as Informative Covariate in Hypothesis Weighting Improves Power for Rare Variant Association Studies.","Genes (Basel)","Gene-based rare variant association studies (RVASs) have low power due to the infrequency of rare variants and the large multiple testing burden. To correct for multiple testing, traditional false discovery rate (FDR) procedures which depend solely on P-values are often used. Recently, Independent Hypothesis Weighting (IHW) was developed to improve the detection power while maintaining FDR control by leveraging prior information for each hypothesis. Here, we present a framework to increase power of gene-based RVASs by incorporating prior information using IHW. We first build supervised machine learning models to assign each gene a prediction score that measures its disease risk, using the input of multiple biological features, fed with high-confidence risk genes and local background genes selected near GWAS significant loci as the training set. Then we use the prediction scores as covariates to prioritize RVAS results via IHW. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework through applications to RVASs in schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder. We found sizeable improvements in the number of significant associations compared to traditional FDR approaches, and independent evidence supporting the relevance of the genes identified by our framework but not traditional FDR, demonstrating the potential of our framework to improve power of gene-based RVASs."

Genetic variants can place a child at risk of developing these metabolic complications. The fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) rs9939609 A allele has been associated with obesity and dietary energy intakes in healthy children but its relation to metabolic complications in SGA-treated children is not known.This study investigated the association of theFTOrs9939609 variant and SGA treatment with cardiometabolic complications and dietary intakes in children with mental health disorders.A cross-sectional population of children (≤18 y;n = 506) with mental health disorders that were SGA-treated (n = 197) and SGA-naïve (n = 309) were recruited through the Department of Psychiatry at BC Children's Hospital. Dietary intakes were estimated using 3-d food records in a subset of children (n = 73).Genotype frequencies were not different between SGA-treated (TT genotype 42.6%, TA genotype 38.6%, AA genotype 18.8%) and SGA-naïve (TT 41.1%, TA 39.5%, AA 19.4%) children. Children with the A allele had lower BMIz-sores compared with the TT genotype (0.84 ± 1.19 compared with 1.19 ± 1.36;P = 0.005, adjusted for ethnicity). We observed an interaction betweenFTOgenotype and SGA status on fasting glucose (P = 0.036). SGA-naïve children with the A allele had higher fasting glucose than those with the TT genotype (4.96 ± 0.35 compared with 4.81 ± 0.35 mmol/L;P = 0.001), in adjusted models (age, sex, ethnicity, and BMIz-score). This was not observed in SGA-treated children.

Fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO), the first identified m6A demethylase, is critical for cancer progression. Herein, we developed small-molecule inhibitors of FTO by virtual screening, structural optimization, and bioassay. As a result, two FTO inhibitors namely 18077 and 18097 were identified, which can selectively inhibit demethylase activity of FTO. Specifically, 18097 bound to the active site of FTO and then inhibited cell cycle process and migration of cancer cells. In addition, 18097 reprogrammed the epi-transcriptome of breast cancer cells, particularly for genes related to P53 pathway. 18097 increased the abundance of m6A modification of suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) mRNA, which recruited IGF2BP1 to increase mRNA stability ofSOCS1and subsequently activated the P53 signaling pathway. Further, 18097 suppressed cellular lipogenesisviadownregulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBPα), andC/EBPβ. Animal studies confirmed that 18097 can significantly suppressin vivogrowth and lung colonization of breast cancer cells.

"35256633","Shared genetic loci for body fat storage and adipocyte lipolysis in humans.","Sci Rep","Total body fat and central fat distribution are heritable traits and well-established predictors of adverse metabolic outcomes. Lipolysis is the process responsible for the hydrolysis of triacylglycerols stored in adipocytes. To increase our understanding of the genetic regulation of body fat distribution and total body fat, we set out to determine if genetic variants associated with body mass index (BMI) or waist-hip-ratio adjusted for BMI (WHRadjBMI) in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) mediate their effect by influencing adipocyte lipolysis. We utilized data from the recent GWAS of spontaneous and isoprenaline-stimulated lipolysis in the unique GENetics of Adipocyte Lipolysis (GENiAL) cohort. GENiAL consists of 939 participants who have undergone abdominal subcutaneous adipose biopsy for the determination of spontaneous and isoprenaline-stimulated lipolysis in adipocytes. We report 11 BMI and 15 WHRadjBMI loci with SNPs displaying nominal association with lipolysis and allele-dependent gene expression in adipose tissue according to in silico analysis. Functional evaluation of candidate genes in these loci by small interfering RNAs (siRNA)-mediated knock-down in adipose-derived stem cells identified ZNF436 and NUP85 as intrinsic regulators of lipolysis consistent with the associations observed in the clinical cohorts. Furthermore, candidate genes in another BMI-locus (STX17) and two more WHRadjBMI loci (NID2, GGA3, GRB2) control lipolysis alone, or in conjunction with lipid storage, and may hereby be involved in genetic control of body fat. The findings expand our understanding of how genetic variants mediate their impact on the complex traits of fat storage and distribution.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35205324","Functional Validation of Osteoporosis Genetic Findings Using Small Fish Models.","Genes (Basel)","The advancement of human genomics has revolutionized our understanding of the genetic architecture of many skeletal diseases, including osteoporosis. However, interpreting results from human association studies remains a challenge, since index variants often reside in non-coding regions of the genome and do not possess an obvious regulatory function. To bridge the gap between genetic association and causality, a systematic functional investigation is necessary, such as the one offered by animal models. These models enable us to identify causal mechanisms, clarify the underlying biology, and apply interventions. Over the past several decades, small teleost fishes, mostly zebrafish and medaka, have emerged as powerful systems for modeling the genetics of human diseases. Due to their amenability to genetic intervention and the highly conserved genetic and physiological features, fish have become indispensable for skeletal genomic studies. The goal of this review is to summarize the evidence supporting the utility of Zebrafish (Danio rerio) for accelerating our understanding of human skeletal genomics and outlining the remaining gaps in knowledge. We provide an overview of zebrafish skeletal morphophysiology and gene homology, shedding light on the advantages of human skeletal genomic exploration and validation. Knowledge of the biology underlying osteoporosis through animal models will lead to the translation into new, better and more effective therapeutic approaches."

Empathy may predispose an individual to respond to life events differently if high empathizers are emotionally more sensitive to trauma. For the first time, we test this hypothesis using genetic information.We applied polygenic scoring (PGS) to investigate the shared genetics linking empathy (measured using the Empathy Quotient (EQ), a self-report measure of empathy; N = 46,861) and PTSD symptom severity (measured using the 6-item PTSD Checklist 6-item (PCL-6)) in the UK Biobank (N = 126,219). Follow-up analyses were performed in the context of (1) experiencing any of 16 potential traumas, (2) the total number of traumas endorsed, and (3) the context of trauma. Autism, depression, generalized anxiety, and PCL-17 PGS were included as covariates to verify the specificity of the effect.EQPGSassociated with PCL-6 (R2 = 0.012%,P = 9.35 × 10-5). This effect remained significant after accounting for autism, depression, PTSD, and anxiety PGS but was observed only in those who endorsed experiencing at least one traumatic event. EQPGSshowed the strongest effect on PCL-6 (β = 2.32, s.e. = 0.762,P = 0.002) among those who endorsed childhood neglect/abuse(felt hated as a child). With respect to case status, the highest probability of PTSD was 17.93% and 10.04% for those who endorsed ""feeling hated as a child"" and those who did not, respectively (Pdiff = 0.011; Cohen'sd = 1.951, 95%CI 1.70-2.20).A genetic predisposition to higher empathy, which may index greater emotional sensitivity, predisposes an individual to more severe PTSD symptoms, especially after early-life adversity.© 2022 The Authors."

However, such analyses in bacteria are still in their infancy, being limited by difficulties including genome plasticity and strong population structure. Here we propose a suite of methods including linear mixed models, elastic net and LD-score regression, adapted to bacterial traits using innovations such as frequency-based allele coding, both insertion/deletion and nucleotide testing and heritability partitioning. We compare and validate our methods against the current state-of-art using simulations, and analyse three phenotypes of the major human pathogenStreptococcus pneumoniae, including the first analyses of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) for penicillin and ceftriaxone. We show that the MIC traits are highly heritable with high prediction accuracy, explained by many genetic associations under good population structure control. In ceftriaxone MIC, this is surprising because none of the isolates are resistant as per the inhibition zone criteria. We estimate that half of the heritability of penicillin MIC is explained by a known drug-resistance region, which also contributes a quarter of the ceftriaxone MIC heritability. For the within-host carriage duration phenotype, no associations were observed, but the moderate heritability and prediction accuracy indicate a moderately polygenic trait.© The Author(s) 2022.

Due to chromosomal linkage, the dynamics of the selected site affect the genetic variation at nearby neutral loci in a process commonly referred to as genetic hitchhiking. Changes in population size, however, can yield patterns in genomic data that mimic the effects of selection. Accurately modeling these dynamics is thus crucial to understanding how selection and past population size changes impact observed patterns of genetic variation. Here, we model the evolution of haplotype frequencies with the Wright-Fisher diffusion to study the impact of selection on linked neutral variation. Explicit solutions are not known for the dynamics of this diffusion when selection and recombination act simultaneously. Thus, we present a method for numerically evaluating the Wright-Fisher diffusion dynamics of 2 linked loci separated by a certain recombination distance when selection is acting. We can account for arbitrary population size histories explicitly using this approach. A key step in the method is to express the moments of the associated transition density, or sampling probabilities, as solutions to ordinary differential equations. Numerically solving these differential equations relies on a novel accurate and numerically efficient technique to estimate higher order moments from lower order moments. We demonstrate how this numerical framework can be used to quantify the reduction and recovery of genetic diversity around a selected locus over time and elucidate distortions in the site-frequency-spectra of neutral variation linked to loci under selection in various demographic settings. The method can be readily extended to more general modes of selection and applied in likelihood frameworks to detect loci under selection and infer the strength of the selective pressure.© The Author(s) 2022.

"35242170","The Promise of DNA Methylation in Understanding Multigenerational Factors in Autism Spectrum Disorders.","Front Genet","Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a group of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by impairments in social reciprocity and communication, restrictive interests, and repetitive behaviors. Most cases of ASD arise from a confluence of genetic susceptibility and environmental risk factors, whose interactions can be studied through epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation. While various parental factors are known to increase risk for ASD, several studies have indicated that grandparental and great-grandparental factors may also contribute. In animal studies, gestational exposure to certain environmental factors, such as insecticides, medications, and social stress, increases risk for altered behavioral phenotypes in multiple subsequent generations. Changes in DNA methylation, gene expression, and chromatin accessibility often accompany these altered behavioral phenotypes, with changes often appearing in genes that are important for neurodevelopment or have been previously implicated in ASD. One hypothesized mechanism for these phenotypic and methylation changes includes the transmission of DNA methylation marks at individual chromosomal loci from parent to offspring and beyond, called multigenerational epigenetic inheritance. Alternatively, intermediate metabolic phenotypes in the parental generation may confer risk from the original grandparental exposure to risk for ASD in grandchildren, mediated by DNA methylation. While hypothesized mechanisms require further research, the potential for multigenerational epigenetics assessments of ASD risk has implications for precision medicine as the field attempts to address the variable etiology and clinical signs of ASD by incorporating genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. In this review, we discuss the promise of multigenerational DNA methylation investigations in understanding the complex etiology of ASD.Copyright © 2022 Mouat and LaSalle."
"35228718","Roles of transposable elements in the regulation of mammalian transcription.","Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol","Transposable elements (TEs) comprise about half of the mammalian genome. TEs often contain sequences capable of recruiting the host transcription machinery, which they use to express their own products and promote transposition. However, the regulatory sequences carried by TEs may affect host transcription long after the TEs have lost the ability to transpose. Recent advances in genome analysis and engineering have facilitated systematic interrogation of the regulatory activities of TEs. In this Review, we discuss diverse mechanisms by which TEs contribute to transcription regulation. Notably, TEs can donate enhancer and promoter sequences that influence the expression of host genes, modify 3D chromatin architecture and give rise to novel regulatory genes, including non-coding RNAs and transcription factors. We discuss how TEs spur regulatory evolution and facilitate the emergence of genetic novelties in mammalian physiology and development. By virtue of their repetitive and interspersed nature, TEs offer unique opportunities to dissect the effects of mutation and genomic context on the function and evolution of cis-regulatory elements. We argue that TE-centric studies hold the key to unlocking general principles of transcription regulation and evolution.© 2022. Springer Nature Limited."
"35203380","Species-Specific Paternal Age Effects and Sperm Methylation Levels of Developmentally Important Genes.","Cells","A growing number of sperm methylome analyses have identified genomic loci that are susceptible to paternal age effects in a variety of mammalian species, including human, bovine, and mouse. However, there is little overlap between different data sets. Here, we studied whether or not paternal age effects on the sperm epigenome have been conserved in mammalian evolution and compared methylation patterns of orthologous regulatory regions (mainly gene promoters) containing both conserved and non-conserved CpG sites in 94 human, 36 bovine, and 94 mouse sperm samples, using bisulfite pyrosequencing. We discovered three (NFKB2,RASGEF1C, andRPL6) age-related differentially methylated regions (ageDMRs) in humans, four (CHD7,HDAC11,PAK1, andPTK2B) in bovines, and three (Def6,Nrxn2, andTbx19) in mice. Remarkably, the identified sperm ageDMRs were all species-specific. Most ageDMRs were in genomic regions with medium methylation levels and large methylation variation. Orthologous regions in species not showing this age effect were either hypermethylated (>80%) or hypomethylated (<20%). In humans and mice, ageDMRs lost methylation, whereas bovine ageDMRs gained methylation with age. Our results are in line with the hypothesis that sperm ageDMRs are in regions under epigenomic evolution and may be part of an epigenetic mechanism(s) for lineage-specific environmental adaptations and provide a solid basis for studies on downstream effects in the genes analyzed here."
"35201542","Resilience and Family Socialization Processes in Ethnic Minority Youth: Illuminating the Achievement-Health Paradox.","Clin Child Fam Psychol Rev","Youth in marginalized communities who ""strive"" to rise above adversity, including systemic racism and poverty, are considered ""resilient."" African-American, Latinx, and Asian-American youth often achieve admirable academic success despite limited social capital and high early life stress by adopting a ""striving persistent behavioral style"" (SPBS). SPBS may be supported by family socialization processes that facilitate reliance on self-regulation processes. Unfortunately, a young person's resilience in one domain (i.e., academic) can come at a cost in other domains, including physical and mental health morbidities that are under-identified and under-treated. Indeed, research suggests a link between SPBS in the face of adversity and later health morbidities among ethnic minority youth. Herein, we describe SPBS as an adaptation to minority stress that not only promotes social mobility but may also stoke physical and mental health disparities. We review how family processes related to academic, emotional, and ethnic-racial socialization can facilitate the striving persistent behavioral style. We emphasize the double bind that ethnic minority families are caught in and discuss directions for future research and clinical implications for individual and family-level interventions. While needed, we argue that individual and family-level interventions represent a near-term work around. Solutions and factors that shape the need for SPBS and its cost must be addressed structurally.© 2022.

"35213535","Mapping the gene network landscape of Alzheimer's disease through integrating genomics and transcriptomics.","PLoS Comput Biol","Integration of multi-omics data with molecular interaction networks enables elucidation of the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Using the latest genome-wide association studies (GWAS) including proxy cases and the STRING interactome, we identified an AD network of 142 risk genes and 646 network-proximal genes, many of which were linked to synaptic functions annotated by mouse knockout data. The proximal genes were confirmed to be enriched in a replication GWAS of autopsy-documented cases. By integrating the AD gene network with transcriptomic data of AD and healthy temporal cortices, we identified 17 gene clusters of pathways, such as up-regulated complement activation and lipid metabolism, down-regulated cholinergic activity, and dysregulated RNA metabolism and proteostasis. The relationships among these pathways were further organized by a hierarchy of the AD network pinpointing major parent nodes in graph structure including endocytosis and immune reaction. Control analyses were performed using transcriptomics from cerebellum and a brain-specific interactome. Further integration with cell-specific RNA sequencing data demonstrated genes in our clusters of immunoregulation and complement activation were highly expressed in microglia."
"35205757","Characterization of the pVHL Interactome in Human Testis Using High-Throughput Library Screening.","Cancers (Basel)","Functional impairment of the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (pVHL) is causative of a familiar increased risk of developing cancer. As an E3 substrate recognition particle, pVHL marks the hypoxia inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) for degradation in normoxic conditions, thus acting as a key regulator of both acute and chronic cell adaptation to hypoxia. The male mice model carrying VHL gene conditional knockout presents significant abnormalities in testis development paired with defects in spermatogenesis and infertility, indicating that pVHL exerts testis-specific roles. Here we aimed to explore whether pVHL could have a similar role in humans by performing a testis-tissue library screening complemented with in-depth bioinformatics analysis. We identified 55 novel pVHL binding proteins directly involved in spermatogenesis, cell differentiation and reproductive metabolism. In addition, computational investigation of these new interactors identified multiple pVHL-specific binding motifs and demonstrated that somatic mutations described in human cancers reside in these binding regions. Collectively, these findings suggest that, in addition to its role in cancer formation, pVHL may also be pivotal in normal gonadal development in humans."

Olfactory dysfunction manifests early in several neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease, however, disease-related alterations to the olfactory mucosal cells remain poorly described. The aim of this study was to evaluate the olfactory mucosa differences between cognitively healthy individuals and Alzheimer's disease patients. We report increased amyloid-beta secretion in Alzheimer's disease olfactory mucosal cells and detail cell-type-specific gene expression patterns, unveiling 240 differentially expressed disease-associated genes compared to the cognitively healthy controls, and five distinct cell populations. Overall, alterations of RNA and protein metabolism, inflammatory processes, and signal transduction were observed in multiple cell populations, suggesting their role in Alzheimer's disease-related olfactory mucosa pathophysiology. Furthermore, the single-cell RNA-sequencing proposed alterations in gene expression of mitochondrially located genes in AD OM cells, which were verified by functional assays, demonstrating altered mitochondrial respiration and a reduction of ATP production. Our results reveal disease-related changes of olfactory mucosal cells in Alzheimer's disease and demonstrate the utility of single-cell RNA sequencing data for investigating molecular and cellular mechanisms associated with the disease."
"35250265","Decoding Human Genome Regulatory Features That Influence HIV-1 Proviral Expression and Fate Through an Integrated Genomics Approach.","Bioinform Biol Insights","Fundamental principles of HIV-1 integration into the human genome have been revealed in the past 2 decades. However, the impact of the integration site on proviral transcription and expression remains poorly understood. Solving this problem requires the analysis of multiple genomic datasets for thousands of proviral integration sites. Here, we generated and combined large-scale datasets, including epigenetics, transcriptome, and 3-dimensional genome architecture to interrogate the chromatin states, transcription activity, and nuclear sub-compartments around HIV-1 integrations in Jurkat CD4+T cells to decipher human genome regulatory features shaping the transcription of proviral classes based on their position and orientation in the genome. Through a Hidden Markov Model and ranked informative values prior to a machine learning logistic regression model, we defined nuclear sub-compartments and chromatin states contributing to genomic architecture, transcriptional activity, and nucleosome density of regions neighboring the integration site, as additive features influencing HIV-1 expression. Our integrated genomics approach also allows for a robust experimental design, in which HIV-1 can be genetically introduced into precise genomic locations with known regulatory features to assess the relationship of integration positions to viral transcription and fate.© The Author(s) 2022."
"35223844","Histone 3 Methyltransferases Alter Melanoma Initiation and Progression Through Discrete Mechanisms.","Front Cell Dev Biol","Perturbations to the epigenome are known drivers of tumorigenesis. In melanoma, alterations in histone methyltransferases that catalyze methylation at histone 3 lysine 9 and histone 3 lysine 27-two sites of critical post-translational modification-have been reported. To study the function of these methyltransferases in melanoma, we engineered melanocytes to express histone 3 lysine-to-methionine mutations at lysine 9 and lysine 27, which are known to inhibit the activity of histone methyltransferases, in a zebrafish melanoma model. Using this system, we found that loss of histone 3 lysine 9 methylation dramatically suppressed melanoma formation and that inhibition of histone 3 lysine 9 methyltransferases in human melanoma cells increased innate immune response signatures. In contrast, loss of histone 3 lysine 27 methylation significantly accelerated melanoma formation. We identifiedFOXD1as a top target of PRC2 that is silenced in melanocytes and found that aberrant overexpression ofFOXD1accelerated melanoma onset. Collectively, these data demonstrate how histone 3 lysine-to-methionine mutations can be used to uncover critical roles for methyltransferases.Copyright © 2022 DiNapoli, Martinez-McFaline, Shen, Doane, Perez, Verma, Simon, Nelson, Balgobin, Bourque, Yao, Raman, Béguelin, Zippin, Elemento, Melnick and Houvras."
"35223840","Spatial Multiomics Analysis Reveals Only Minor Genetic and Epigenetic Changes in Human Liver Cancer Stem-Like Cells Compared With Other Tumor Parenchymal Cells.","Front Cell Dev Biol","Cancer stem cells (CSCs) usually account for a very small tumor cell population but play pivotal roles in human cancer development and recurrence. A fundamental question in cancer biology is what genetic and epigenetic changes occur in CSCs. Here we show that thein-situglobal levels of DNA cytosine modifications, including 5-methylcytosine (5mC), 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) and 5-formylcytosine (5fC), are similar between liver cancer stem-like (LCSL) cells and paratumor liver cells of liver cancer patients. We then developed a robust method combining immunohistochemistry, laser capture microdissection and genome sequencing with ultra-low-input cells (CIL-seq) to study the detailed genetic and DNA methylation changes in human LCSL cells. We first used clinical samples of mixed hepatocellular carcinoma-cholangiocarcinoma (HCC-CCA) with stem cell features to investigate human LCSL cells. The CIL-seq analysis of HCC-CCA and HCC patients showed that LCSL cells had strong spatial genetic and epigenetic heterogeneity. More interestingly, although the LCSL cells had some potential key changes in their genome, they had substantially fewer somatic single nucleotide variants (SNVs), copy number alterations (CNAs) and differentially methylated regions than other tumor parenchymal cells. The cluster analysis of SNVs, CNAs, DNA methylation patterns and spatial transcriptomes all clearly showed that the LCSL cells were clustered with the paratumor liver cells. Thus, spatial multiomics analysis showed that LCSL cells had only minor genetic and epigenetic changes compared with other tumor parenchymal cells. Targeting key changes in CSCs, not just changes in bulk tumor cells, should be more effective for human cancer therapy.Copyright © 2022 Liu, Li, Dong, Qu, Yang, Chen, Li, Wang and He."

However, the mechanism of the initial trigger that augments IFN-1 pathway in the peripheral immune system of NMOSD has yet to be elucidated.Clinical samples were obtained from 32 patients with aquaporin-4 antibody-positive NMOSD and 23 healthy subjects. IFN-1 induction in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) by serum-derived cell-free DNA (cfDNA) was assessed in combination with blockades of DNA sensors in vitro. CfDNA fraction was analyzed for DNA methylation profiles by bisulfite sequencing, elucidating the cellular origin of cfDNA. The induction of neutrophil extracellular trap related cell death (NETosis) was further analyzed in NMOSD and control groups, and the efficacy of pharmacologic intervention of NETosis was assessed.Enhanced IFN-1 induction by cfDNA derived from NMOSD was observed in PBMCs with cofactor of LL37 antimicrobial peptide. DNase treatment, cGAS inhibitor, and Toll-like receptor 9 antagonist efficiently inhibited IFN-1 production. DNA methylation pattern of cfDNA in patients with NMOSD demonstrated that the predominant cellular source of cfDNA was neutrophils. Whole blood transcriptome analysis also revealed neutrophil activation in NMOSD. In addition, enhanced NETosis induction was observed with NMOSD-derived sera, and efficient pharmacologic inhibition of NETosis with dipyridamole was observed.Our study highlights the previously unrevealed role of cfDNA predominantly released by neutrophil in the induction of IFN-1 signature in NMOSD and further indicate a novel pharmacologic target in NMOSD.Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).

Two new African-specific genome-wide significant loci for mean-max cIMT, SIRPA (p = 4.7E-08), and FBXL17 (p = 2.5E-08), were identified. Sex-stratified analysis revealed associations with one male-specific locus, SNX29 (p = 6.3E-09), and two female-specific loci, LARP6 (p = 2.4E-09) and PROK1 (p = 1.0E-08). We replicate previous cIMT associations with different lead SNPs in linkage disequilibrium with SNPs primarily identified in European populations. Our study find significant enrichment for genes involved in oestrogen response from female-specific signals. The genes identified show biological relevance to atherosclerosis and/or CVDs, sex-differences and transferability of signals from non-African studies.© 2022. The Author(s)."

Integrated, Multi-Omic Approaches to Predictions of Non-Communicable Disease Risk.","Front Genet","Epidemiological and associative research from humans and animals identifies correlations between the environment and health impacts. The environment-health inter-relationship is effected through an individual's underlying genetic variation and mediated by mechanisms that include the changes to gene regulation that are associated with the diversity of phenotypes we exhibit. However, the causal relationships have yet to be established, in part because the associations are reduced to individual interactions and the combinatorial effects are rarely studied. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that our genomes are highly dynamic; they integrate information across multiple levels (from linear sequence, to structural organisation, to temporal variation) each of which is open to and responds to environmental influence. To unravel the complexities of the genomic basis of human disease, and in particular non-communicable diseases that are also influenced by the environment (e.g., obesity, type II diabetes, cancer, multiple sclerosis, some neurodegenerative diseases, inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis) it is imperative that we fully integrate multiple layers of genomic data. Here we review current progress in integrated genomic data analysis, and discuss cases where data integration would lead to significant advances in our ability to predict how the environment may impact on our health. We also outline limitations which should form the basis of future research questions. In so doing, this review will lay the foundations for future research into the impact of the environment on our health.Copyright © 2022 Noble, Purcell, Adams, Lam, Ring, Anderson and Osborne."

Current immunosuppressive treatment provides limited efficacy and an important burden of adverse events. Epigenetic drugs are a source of novel therapeutic tools. Among them, bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) inhibitors (iBETs) block the interaction between bromodomains and acetylated proteins, including histones and transcription factors. iBETs have demonstrated protective effects on malignancy, inflammatory disorders and experimental kidney disease. Recently, Gremlin-1 was proposed as a urinary biomarker of disease progression in human anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated crescentic glomerulonephritis. We have now evaluated whether iBETs could regulate Gremlin-1 in experimental anti-glomerular basement membrane nephritis induced by nephrotoxic serum (NTS) in mice, a model resembling human crescentic glomerulonephritis. In NTS-injected mice, the iBET JQ1 inhibited renal Gremlin-1 overexpression and diminished glomerular damage, restoring podocyte numbers. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated BRD4 enrichment of theGrem-1gene promoter in injured kidneys, consistent with Gremlin-1 epigenetic regulation. Moreover, JQ1 blocked BRD4 binding and inhibitedGrem-1gene transcription. The beneficial effect of iBETs was also mediated by modulation of NOTCH pathway. JQ1 inhibited the gene expression of the NOTCH effectorsHes-1andHey-1in NTS-injured kidneys. Our results further support the role for epigenetic drugs, such as iBETs, in the treatment of rapidly progressive crescentic glomerulonephritis."

Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) and RNA-seq in the GDM fetal hippocampi showed altered methylated modification and differentially expressed genes enriched in common pathways involved in neural synapse organization and signal transmission. We further collected fetal mice brains for metabolome analysis and found that in GDM fetal brains, the metabolites displayed significant changes, in addition to directly inducing cognitive dysfunction, some of which are important to methylation status such as betaine, fumaric acid, L-methionine, succinic acid, 5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid, and S-adenosylmethionine (SAM).

Biological research can provide clues for a correct approach to clinical practice, assuming that it would lead to the conceptualization of a pathogenetic paradigm able to account for epidemiologic and clinical findings. The upward trajectory in ASD prevalence and the systemic involvement of other organs besides the brain suggest that the epigenetic paradigm is the most plausible one. The embryo-fetal period is the crucial window of opportunity for keeping neurodevelopment on the right tracks, suggesting that women's health in pregnancy should be a priority. Maladaptive molecular pathways beginning in utero, in particular, a vicious circle between the immune response, oxidative stress/mitochondrial dysfunction, and dysbiosis-impact neurodevelopment and brain functioning across the lifespan and are the basis for progressive multisystemic disorders that account for the substantial health loss and the increased mortality in ASD. Therefore, the biological complexity of ASD and its implications for health requires the enhancement of clinical skills on these topics, to achieve an effective multi-disciplinary healthcare model.

Despite the frequent use of paracetamol, concerns have been raised regarding the high variability in neonatal dosing regimens and the long-term safety of early life exposure.To investigate the available evidence on the long-term safety of prenatal and neonatal paracetamol exposure.We conducted a systematic search of the electronic databases Ovid Medline, Ovid Embase and Web of Science from inception to August 2021 for original research studies of any design that described the use of paracetamol in the prenatal or neonatal (within the first four weeks of life) periods and examined the occurrence of neurodevelopmental, atopic or reproductive adverse outcomes at or beyond birth.We identified 1313 unique articles and included 30 studies in the final review. Of all studies, 27 (90%), two (7%) and one (3%) were on the long-term safety of prenatal, neonatal and both prenatal and neonatal exposure, respectively. Thirteen (46%), 11 (39%) and four (15%) studies examined neurodevelopmental, atopic and reproductive outcomes. Eleven (100%), 11 (100%), and three (27%) studies on prenatal exposure reported adverse neurodevelopmental, atopic and reproductive outcomes.

We hypothesized that differences in DNA methylation (DNAm) play a role in racial disparities in cLBP.To determine the relationship between DNAm levels and racial group differences in adults with cLBP. Our study's secondary purpose was to perform a race-stratified comparison of adults with cLBP and pain-free controls and identify functional genomic pathways enriched by annotated differentially methylated genes.We recruited 49 NHBs and 49 NHWs (49 cLBP and 49 pain-free controls, PFCs), analyzed DNAm from whole blood using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing, and identified enriched genomic pathways.Among participants with cLBP, we identified 2873 differentially methylated loci (DML; methylation differences of at least 10% and p < 0.0001), many of which were annotated to genes of importance to pain pathology. These DMLs significantly enriched pathways to involved in nociception/pain processing (Dopamine-DARPP32 Feedback in cAMP signaling,GABA Receptor Signaling,Opioid Signaling) and neuronal differentiation (e.g.,Calcium Signaling, Axon Guidance Signaling, andEndocannabinoid Neuronal Synapse). Our race stratified analyses of individuals with cLBP versus PFCs revealed 2356 DMLs in NHBs and 772 DMLs in NHWs with p < 0.0001 and > 10% methylation difference. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis revealed that many pathways of significance to pain such asCorticotropin Releasing Hormone Signaling, White Adipose Tissue Browning,andGABA Receptor Signaling pathways, were more significant in NHBs than NHWs.Even though an individual's self-identified race is a social construct, not a biological variable, racism associated with that classification affects virtually every aspect of life, including disease risk.

The present study is an attempt to identify single nucleotide variations (SNVs) at CpG sites of promoters of ACAT1, APOB, APOE, CYBA, FAS, FLT1, KSR2, LDLR, MMP9, PCSK9, PHOX2A, REST, SH2B3, SORT1 and TIMP1 genes influencing CpG island (CGI) existence and size associated with the pathophysiology of Diabetes mellitus, Coronary artery disease and Cancers. Promoter sequences located between -2000 to + 2000 bp were retrieved from the EPDnew database and predicted the CpG island using MethPrimer. Further, SNVs at CpG sites were accessed from NCBI, Ensembl while transcription factor (TF) binding sites were accessed using AliBaba2.1. CGI existence and size were determined for each SNV at CpG site with respect to wild type and variant allele by MethPrimer. A total of 200 SNVs at CpG sites were analyzed from the promoters of ACAT1, APOB, APOE, CYBA, FAS, FLT1, KSR2, LDLR, MMP9, PCSK9, PHOX2A, REST, SH2B3, SORT1 and TIMP1 genes. Of these, only 17 (8.5%) SNVs were found to influence the loss of CGI while 70 (35%) SNVs were found to reduce the size of CGI. It has also been found that 59% (10) of CGI abolishing SNVs are showing differences in binding of TFs. The findings of the study suggest that the candidate SNVs at CpG sites regulating CGI existence and size might influence the DNA methylation status and expression of genes involved in molecular pathways associated with several diseases. The insights of the present study may pave the way for new experimental studies to undertake challenges in DNA methylation, gene expression and protein assays.© 2022. The Author(s)."

"35218396","A two-phase comprehensive NSCLC prognostic study identifies lncRNAs with significant main effect and interaction.","Mol Genet Genomics","Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) are involved in regulating physiological behaviors for various malignant tumors, including non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, few studies comprehensively evaluated both lncRNA-lncRNA interaction effects and main effects of lncRNA on overall survival of NSCLC. Hence, we performed a two-phase designed study of lncRNA expression in tumor tissues using 604 NSCLC patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas as the discovery phase and 839 patients from Gene Expression Omnibus as the validation phase. In the discovery phase, we adopted a two-step strategy, Screening before Testing, for dimension reduction and signal detection. These candidate lncRNAs first screened out by the weighted random forest (Ranger), were then tested through the Cox proportional hazards model adjusted for covariates. Significant lncRNAs with either type of effects aforementioned were carried forward into the validation phase to confirm their significances again. As a result, in the discovery phase, 19 lncRNAs were identified by Ranger, among which five lncRNAs and one pair of lncRNA-lncRNA interaction exhibited significant effects (FDR-q ≤ 0.05) main and interaction effects on NSCLC survival, respectively, through Cox model. After the independent validation, we finally observed that one lncRNA (ENSG00000227403.1) with main effect was robustly associated with NSCLC prognosis (HRdiscovery = 0.90, P = 1.20 × 10-3; HRvalidation = 0.94, P = 4.11 × 10-3) and one pair of lncRNAs (ENSG00000267121.4 and ENSG00000272369.1) had significant interaction effect on NSCLC survival (HRdiscovery = 1.12, P = 3.07 × 10-4; HRvalidation = 1.11, P = 0.0397). Our comprehensive NSCLC prognostic study of lncRNA provided population-level evidence for further functional study.© 2022. The Author(s)."

To interrogate cell-intrinsic and inter-cell type perturbations in ALS, single-nucleus RNA sequencing was performed on the lumbar spinal cord in the murine ALS model SOD1G93Atransgenic and littermate control mice at peri-symptomatic onset stage of disease, age 90 days. This work uncovered perturbed tripartite synapse functions, complement activation and metabolic stress in the affected spinal cord; processes evidenced by cell death and proteolytic stress-associated gene sets. Concomitantly, these pro-damage events in the spinal cord co-existed with dysregulated reparative mechanisms.

"35204687","piRNAs and PIWI Proteins as Diagnostic and Prognostic Markers of Genitourinary Cancers.","Biomolecules","piRNAs (PIWI-interacting RNAs) are small non-coding RNAs capable of regulation of transposon and gene expression. piRNAs utilise multiple mechanisms to affect gene expression, which makes them potentially more powerful regulators than microRNAs. The mechanisms by which piRNAs regulate transposon and gene expression include DNA methylation, histone modifications, and mRNA degradation. Genitourinary cancers (GC) are a large group of neoplasms that differ by their incidence, clinical course, biology, and prognosis for patients. Regardless of the GC type, metastatic disease remains a key therapeutic challenge, largely affecting patients' survival rates. Recent studies indicate that piRNAs could serve as potentially useful biomarkers allowing for early cancer detection and therapeutic interventions at the stage of non-advanced tumour, improving patient's outcomes. Furthermore, studies in prostate cancer show that piRNAs contribute to cancer progression by affecting key oncogenic pathways such as PI3K/AKT. Here, we discuss recent findings on biogenesis, mechanisms of action and the role of piRNAs and the associated PIWI proteins in GC. We also present tools that may be useful for studies on the functioning of piRNAs in cancers."

"35250478","Basolateral Amygdala Mediates Central Mechanosensory Feedback of Musculoskeletal System.","Front Mol Neurosci","Musculoskeletal diseases, such as osteoporosis and sarcopenia, are tremendous and growing public health concerns. Considering the intimate functional relationship between muscle and bone throughout development, growth, and aging, muscle provides the primary source of skeletal loading through contraction force. However, significant gaps exist in our knowledge regarding the role of muscle in bone homeostasis and little is known regarding the mechanism through which the central nervous system responds and regulates unloading-induced bone loss. Here, we showed that the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and medial part of the central nucleus (CeM) are anatomically connected with the musculoskeletal system. Unloading-induced bone loss is accompanied by a decrease in serum semaphorin 3A (Sema3A) levels as well as sensory denervation.In vivofiber photometry recordings indicated that the mechanical signal is integrated by the BLA and CeM within 24 h and subsequently regulates bone remodeling. Moreover, chemogenetic activation of BLACaMKIIneurons mitigates severe bone loss caused by mechanical unloadingviaincreased serum levels of Sema3A and sensory innervation. These results indicate that the BLA integrates the mechanosensory signals rapidly and mediates the systemic hormonal secretion of Sema3A to maintain bone homeostasis.Copyright © 2022 Liu, Li, Zhang, Yang and Yang."
"35205087","Comparative Investigation of Gene Regulatory Processes Underlying Avian Influenza Viruses in Chicken and Duck.","Biology (Basel)","The avian influenza virus (AIV) mainly affects birds and not only causes animals' deaths, but also poses a great risk of zoonotically infecting humans. While ducks and wild waterfowl are seen as a natural reservoir for AIVs and can withstand most virus strains, chicken mostly succumb to infection with high pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). To date, the mechanisms underlying the susceptibility of chicken and the effective immune response of duck have not been completely unraveled. In this study, we investigate the transcriptional gene regulation underlying disease progression in chicken and duck after AIV infection. For this purpose, we use a publicly available RNA-sequencing dataset from chicken and ducks infected with low-pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) H5N2 and HPAI H5N1 (lung and ileum tissues, 1 and 3 days post-infection). Unlike previous studies, we performed a promoter analysis based on orthologous genes to detect important transcription factors (TFs) and their cooperation, based on which we apply a systems biology approach to identify common and species-specific master regulators. We found master regulators such as EGR1, FOS, and SP1, specifically for chicken and ETS1 and SMAD3/4, specifically for duck, which could be responsible for the duck's effective and the chicken's ineffective immune response."
"35256746","Global DNA methylation changes in adults with attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder and its comorbidity with bipolar disorder: links with polygenic scores.","Mol Psychiatry","Genetic and environmental factors contribute to the etiology of Attention Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). In this sense, the study of epigenetic mechanisms could contribute to the understanding of the disorder's neurobiology. Global DNA methylation (GMe) evaluated through 5-methylcytosine levels could be a promising epigenetic biomarker to capture long-lasting biological effects in response to environmental and hormonal changes. We conducted the first assessment of GMe levels in subjects with ADHD (n = 394) and its main comorbidities in comparison to populational controls (n = 390). Furthermore, given the high genetic contribution to ADHD (heritability of 80%), polygenic risk scores (PRS) were calculated to verify the genetic contribution to GMe levels in ADHD and the comorbidities associated with GMe levels. The GMe levels observed in patients were lower than controls (P = 1.1e-8), with women being significantly less globally methylated than men (P = 0.002). Regarding comorbidities, the presence of bipolar disorder (BD) among patients with ADHD was associated with higher methylation levels compared to patients with ADHD without BD (P = 0.031). The results did not change when pharmacological treatment was accounted for in the analyses. The ADHD and BD most predictive PRSs were negatively (P = 0.0064) and positively (P = 0.0042) correlated with GMe, respectively. This study is the first to report an association between GMe, ADHD, and its comorbidity with BD and associations between PRSs for specific psychiatric disorders and GMe.

Urine cytology and recent biomarkers come short of replacing cystoscopy. Urine liquid biopsy promises to solve this problem and potentially allows early detection, evaluation of treatment efficacy, and surveillance. A previous study reached 52-68% sensitivity using small-panel sequencing but could increase sensitivity to 68-83% by adding aneuploidy and promoter mutation detection. Here, we explore whether a large 127-gene panel alone is sufficient to detect tumor mutations in urine from bladder cancer patients. We recruited twelve bladder cancer patients, obtained preoperative and postoperative urine samples, and successfully analyzed samples from eleven patients. In ten patients, we found at least one mutation in bladder-cancer-associated genes, i.e., a promising sensitivity of 91%. In total, we identified 114 variants, of which 90 were predicted as nonbenign, 30% were associated with cancer, and 13% were actionable according to the CIViC database. Sanger sequencing of the patients' formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissues confirmed the findings. We concluded that incorporating urine liquid biopsy is a promising strategy in the management of bladder cancer patients."

The aim of this research was to assess sociodemographic differences, selected elements of lifestyle, and functional fitness in the older residents of social welfare homes and community dwellers Methods: The analysed group comprised 693 women aged 65-79, including 173 subjects living in social welfare homes and 520 community-dwelling women. Basic anthropometric features were measured, and functional fitness was assessed using the Senior Fitness Test. Basic sociodemographic characteristics, as well as data on health self-assessment and selected elements of lifestyle, were also collected.The female residents of social welfare homes were found to have a lower body mass index (BMI), and they came from smaller cities, compared with community-dwelling older women. Furthermore, almost a third of them had no children and completed primary or vocational education. They also reported smoking, poor health conditions, and lack of physical activity. The functional fitness of women living in social welfare homes was significantly lower than in community-dwelling women.As seniors living in social welfare homes have such a significantly reduced level of functional fitness, compared with their peers living independently, it is necessary to include them in adaptive physical activity and diversified daily activities."

Here, we analyzed EIF4EBP1 expression in different glioma patient cohorts and investigated its mode of transcriptional regulation in glioblastoma cells. We verified that EIF4EBP1 mRNA is overexpressed in malignant gliomas, including isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-wildtype glioblastomas, relative to non-neoplastic brain tissue in multiple publically available datasets. Our analyses revealed that EIF4EBP1 overexpression in malignant gliomas is neither due to gene amplification nor to altered DNA methylation, but rather results from aberrant transcriptional activation by distinct transcription factors. We found seven transcription factor candidates co-expressed with EIF4EBP1 in gliomas and bound to the EIF4EBP1 promoter, as revealed by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-sequencing data. We investigated the ability of these candidates to activate the EIF4EBP1 promoter using luciferase reporter assays, which supported four transcription factors as candidate EIF4EBP1 regulators, namely MYBL2, ETS1, HIF-1A, and E2F6. Finally, by employing transient knock-down experiments to repress either of these transcription factors, we identified MYBL2 and ETS1 as the relevant transcriptional drivers of enhanced EIF4EBP1 expression in malignant glioma cells. Taken together, our findings confirm enhanced expression of EIF4EBP1 in malignant gliomas relative to non-neoplastic brain tissue and characterize the underlying molecular pathomechanisms.© 2022.

"35264789","A non-canonical tricarboxylic acid cycle underlies cellular identity.","Nature","The tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle is a central hub of cellular metabolism, oxidizing nutrients to generate reducing equivalents for energy production and critical metabolites for biosynthetic reactions. Despite the importance of the products of the TCA cycle for cell viability and proliferation, mammalian cells display diversity in TCA-cycle activity1,2. How this diversity is achieved, and whether it is critical for establishing cell fate, remains poorly understood. Here we identify a non-canonical TCA cycle that is required for changes in cell state. Genetic co-essentiality mapping revealed a cluster of genes that is sufficient to compose a biochemical alternative to the canonical TCA cycle, wherein mitochondrially derived citrate exported to the cytoplasm is metabolized by ATP citrate lyase, ultimately regenerating mitochondrial oxaloacetate to complete this non-canonical TCA cycle. Manipulating the expression of ATP citrate lyase or the canonical TCA-cycle enzyme aconitase 2 in mouse myoblasts and embryonic stem cells revealed that changes in the configuration of the TCA cycle accompany cell fate transitions. During exit from pluripotency, embryonic stem cells switch from canonical to non-canonical TCA-cycle metabolism. Accordingly, blocking the non-canonical TCA cycle prevents cells from exiting pluripotency. These results establish a context-dependent alternative to the traditional TCA cycle and reveal that appropriate TCA-cycle engagement is required for changes in cell state.© 2022.

Due to disease aggressiveness, more other malignancies, the standard of care is based on clinical efficacy rather than helpful biomarkers. Lurbinectedin is a small molecule RNA polymerase II inhibitor that binds the minor groove of DNA to induce double-strand breaks. Lurbinectedin has efficacy towards SCLC cells at sub-nM concentration and received accelerated FDA approval in 2020 for metastatic SCLC that progressed on platinum-based therapy. ONC201/TIC10 is a TRAIL pathway-inducing compound that with demonstrated clinical efficacy in H3K27M-mutated diffuse midline glioma and neuroendocrine tumors, in early phase clinical trials. We hypothesized that combining ONC201 and lurbinectedin may yield synergistic and targeted killing of SCLC cells. SCLC cell lines H1048, H1105, H1882, and H1417 were treated with ONC201 and lurbinectedin and cell viability was determined using a CellTiter-Glo assay using varying drug concentrations. Synergistic growth inhibition of SCLC cells was noted with combination of ONC201 and lurbinectedin. Induction of the integrated stress response mediator ATF4 and CHOP was observed with ONC201 and lurbinectedin along with induction of PARP cleavage indicative of apoptosis in response to cellular stress. Additionally, SCLC lines treated with the combination therapy displayed increased DNA breakage-related proteins such as phosphorylated Chk-1, Wee1 and γ-H2AX. Combination index revealed the most potent synergy occurred at the concentrations of 0.16 μM ONC201 and 0.05 nM lurbinectedin in the H1048 cell line, demonstrating highly efficient and selective killing of these tumor cellsin vitro. While these therapies showed potency against the cell lines derived from SCLC patients, it is noteworthy that the combination showed significantly less toxicity to healthy human lung epithelial cells. Future studies could explore the combination of ONC201 and lurbinectedin in SCLC cell lines, SCLC patient-derived organoids, other tumor types, including in vivo studies and clinical translation.AJCR Copyright © 2022."
"35260660","Histone H2AX promotes metastatic progression by preserving glycolysis via hexokinase-2.","Sci Rep","Genomic stability is essential for organismal development, cellular homeostasis, and survival. The DNA double-strand breaks are particularly deleterious, creating an environment prone to cellular transformation and oncogenic activation. The histone variant H2AX is an essential component of the nucleosome responsible for initiating the early steps of the DNA repair process. H2AX maintains genomic stability by initiating a signaling cascade that collectively functions to promote DNA double-strand breaks repair. Recent advances have linked genomic stability to energetic metabolism, and alterations in metabolism were found to interfere with genome maintenance. Utilizing genome-wide transcripts profiling to identify differentially-expressed genes involved in energetic metabolism, we compared control and H2AX-deficient metastatic breast cancer cell lines, and found that H2AX loss leads to the repression of key genes regulating glycolysis, with a prominent effect on hexokinase-2 (HK2). These observations are substantiated by evidence that H2AX loss compromises glycolysis, effect which was reversed by ectopic expression of HK2. Utilizing models of experimental metastasis, we found that H2AX silencing halts progression of metastatic breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231. Most interestingly, ectopic expression of HK2 in H2AX-deficient cells restores their metastatic potential. Using multiple publicly available datasets, we found a significantly strong positive correlation between H2AX expression levels in patients with invasive breast cancer, and levels of glycolysis genes, particularly HK2. These observations are consistent with the evidence that high H2AX expression is associated with shorter distant metastasis-free survival. Our findings reveal a role for histone H2AX in controlling the metastatic ability of breast cancer cells via maintenance of HK2-driven glycolysis.© 2022. The Author(s)."

The Met RTK exhibits such reciprocal crosstalk with several members of the human EGFR (HER) family of RTKs when amplified in cancer cells. We show that Met signaling converges on HER3-tyrosine phosphorylation across a panel of seven MET-amplified cancer cell lines and that HER3 is required for cancer cell expansion and oncogenic capacity in vitro and in vivo. Gene expression analysis of HER3-depleted cells identified MPZL3, encoding a single-pass transmembrane protein, as HER3-dependent effector in multiple MET-amplified cancer cell lines. MPZL3 interacts with HER3 and MPZL3 loss phenocopies HER3 loss in MET-amplified cells, while MPZL3 overexpression can partially rescue proliferation upon HER3 depletion.

Nevertheless, their roles in clear cell renal carcinoma (ccRCC) are still ill defined. Herein, this study was conducted to uncover the implications of AS and APA events in ccRCC progression. Through consensus molecular clustering analysis, two AS or APA RNA processing phenotypes were separately constructed with distinct prognosis, tumor-infiltrating immune cells, responses to immunotherapy, and chemotherapy. The AS or APA score was constructed to quantify AS or APA RNA processing patterns of individual ccRCCs with principal-component analysis. Both high AS and APA scores were characterized by undesirable survival outcomes, relatively high response to immunotherapy, and low sensitivity to targeted drugs, such as sorafenib and pazopanib. Moreover, several small molecular compounds were predicted for patients with a high AS or APA score. There was a positive correlation between AS and APA scores. Their interplay contributed to poor prognosis and reshaped the tumor immune microenvironment. Collectively, this study is the first to comprehensively analyze two major posttranscriptional events in ccRCC.

However, the role of PLK1 in some malignant tumors remains unclear.To obtain a comprehensive view of PLK1 expression patterns, public databases including The Cancer Genome Atlas, Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia, the Genotype-Tissue Expression, and human cell landscape databases were employed. The correlation of PLK1 expression with prognosis, immune infiltrations, immune checkpoint genes, tumor mutational burden (TMB), microsatellite instability (MSI), mismatch repair (MMR), and DNA methylation was examined. Besides, we validated the results of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) in two cohorts, with quantitative real-time PCR, Western blot, and loss-of-function experiments.By mining public datasets, we discovered that PLK1 expression in tumor tissues and cancer cell lines displayed heterogeneity compared to normal controls across different cancers. Besides, high expression of PLK1 results in shorter survival time in 15 cancer types, especially in ccRCC. PLK1 expression showed strong association with immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoint genes across cancer types. Moreover, we identified a strong association between PLK1 expression and TMB, MSI MMR, and DNA methylation. PLK1 was validated to be highly expressed in ccRCC tissues and promote ccRCC cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and cell cycle. Mechanistically, PLK1 could regulate forkhead box protein M1 and target cell cycle-associated genes to participate in cell cycle control.PLK1 has important prognostic value and is associated with tumor immunity across cancer types including ccRCC.© 2022 Qian et al."

However, there is no consensus on which methodologies and parameters are the most optimal to conduct such analysis. Aiming to fill this gap, new benchmarking standards were developed to quantitatively evaluate drug retrieval performance. Investigations of potential factors influencing drug retrieval were conducted based on these standards. As a result, we determined an optimal approach for LINCS data-based therapeutic discovery. With this approach, homoharringtonine (HHT) was identified to be a candidate agent with potential therapeutic and preventive effects on liver cancer. The antitumor and antifibrotic activity of HHT was validated experimentally using subcutaneous xenograft tumor model and carbon tetrachloride (CCL4)-induced liver fibrosis model, demonstrating the reliability of the prediction results. In summary, our findings will not only impact the future applications of LINCS data but also offer new opportunities for therapeutic intervention of liver cancer.© 2022, Yang et al."
"35254651","A Mutant Variant of E2F4 Triggers Multifactorial Therapeutic Effects in 5xFAD Mice.","Mol Neurobiol","Alzheimer's disease (AD) has a complex etiology, which requires a multifactorial approach for an efficient treatment. We have focused on E2 factor 4 (E2F4), a transcription factor that regulates cell quiescence and tissue homeostasis, controls gene networks affected in AD, and is upregulated in the brains of Alzheimer's patients and of APPswe/PS1dE9and 5xFAD transgenic mice. E2F4 contains an evolutionarily conserved Thr-motif that, when phosphorylated, modulates its activity, thus constituting a potential target for intervention. In this study, we generated a knock-in mouse strain with neuronal expression of a mouse E2F4 variant lacking this Thr-motif (E2F4DN), which was mated with 5xFAD mice. Here, we show that neuronal expression of E2F4DN in 5xFAD mice potentiates a transcriptional program consistent with the attenuation of the immune response and brain homeostasis. This correlates with reduced microgliosis and astrogliosis, modulation of amyloid-β peptide proteostasis, and blocking of neuronal tetraploidization. Moreover, E2F4DN prevents cognitive impairment and body weight loss, a known somatic alteration associated with AD. We also show that our finding is significant for AD, since E2F4 is expressed in cortical neurons from Alzheimer patients in association with Thr-specific phosphorylation, as evidenced by an anti-E2F4/anti-phosphoThr proximity ligation assay. We propose E2F4DN-based gene therapy as a promising multifactorial approach against AD.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35242159","CG and CHG Methylation Contribute to the Transcriptional Control of OsPRR37-Output Genes in Rice.","Front Plant Sci","Plant circadian clock coordinates endogenous transcriptional rhythms with diurnal changes of environmental cues. OsPRR37, a negative component in the rice circadian clock, reportedly regulates transcriptome rhythms, and agronomically important traits. However, the underlying regulatory mechanisms of OsPRR37-output genes remain largely unknown. In this study, whole genome bisulfite sequencing and high-throughput RNA sequencing were applied to verify the role of DNA methylation in the transcriptional control of OsPRR37-output genes. We found that the overexpression ofOsPRR37suppressed rice growth and altered cytosine methylations in CG and CHG sequence contexts in but not the CHH context (H represents A, T, or C). In total, 35 overlapping genes were identified, and 25 of them showed negative correlation between the methylation level and gene expression. The promoter of the hexokinase geneOsHXK1was hypomethylated at both CG and CHG sites, and the expression ofOsHXK1was significantly increased. Meanwhile, the leaf starch content was consistently lower inOsPRR37overexpression lines than in the recipient parent Guangluai 4. Further analysis with published data of time-course transcriptomes revealed that most overlapping genes showed peak expression phases from dusk to dawn. The genes involved in DNA methylation, methylation maintenance, and DNA demethylation were found to be actively expressed around dusk. A DNA glycosylase, namely ROS1A/DNG702, was probably the upstream candidate that demethylated the promoter ofOsHXK1. Taken together, our results revealed that CG and CHG methylation contribute to the transcriptional regulation of OsPRR37-output genes, and hypomethylation ofOsHXK1leads to decreased starch content and reduced plant growth in rice.Copyright © 2022 Liu, Li, Lu, Sun, Pang, Xiang, Deng, Xiong, Shu, Yang and Hu."
"35260865","Dissection of artifactual and confounding glial signatures by single-cell sequencing of mouse and human brain.","Nat Neurosci","A key aspect of nearly all single-cell sequencing experiments is dissociation of intact tissues into single-cell suspensions. While many protocols have been optimized for optimal cell yield, they have often overlooked the effects that dissociation can have on ex vivo gene expression. Here, we demonstrate that use of enzymatic dissociation on brain tissue induces an aberrant ex vivo gene expression signature, most prominently in microglia, which is prevalent in published literature and can substantially confound downstream analyses. To address this issue, we present a rigorously validated protocol that preserves both in vivo transcriptional profiles and cell-type diversity and yield across tissue types and species. We also identify a similar signature in postmortem human brain single-nucleus RNA-sequencing datasets, and show that this signature is induced in freshly isolated human tissue by exposure to elevated temperatures ex vivo. Together, our results provide a methodological solution for preventing artifactual gene expression changes during fresh tissue digestion and a reference for future deeper analysis of the potential confounding states present in postmortem human samples.© 2022.

"35170429","NMDA receptors in visual cortex are necessary for normal visuomotor integration and skill learning.","Elife","The experience of coupling between motor output and visual feedback is necessary for the development of visuomotor skills and shapes visuomotor integration in visual cortex. Whether these experience-dependent changes of responses in V1 depend on modifications of the local circuit or are the consequence of circuit changes outside of V1 remains unclear. Here, we probed the role ofN-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-dependent signaling, which is known to be involved in neuronal plasticity, in mouse primary visual cortex (V1) during visuomotor development. We used a local knockout of NMDA receptors and a photoactivatable inhibition of CaMKII in V1 during the first visual experience to probe for changes in neuronal activity in V1 as well as the influence on performance in a visuomotor task. We found that a knockout of NMDA receptors before, but not after, first visuomotor experience reduced responses to unpredictable stimuli, diminished the suppression of predictable feedback in V1, and impaired visuomotor skill learning later in life. Our results demonstrate that NMDA receptor-dependent signaling in V1 is critical during the first visuomotor experience for shaping visuomotor integration and enabling visuomotor skill learning.© 2022, Widmer et al."

Nevertheless, several issues exist ahead of people with a drug use disorder during addiction. Accordingly, various types of studies have been conducted to understand better the problems that people with a drug use disorder encountered. People with a drug use disorder usually have a problem tolerating the withdrawal period and some relapse to drug abuse. Complementary studies further revealed that some hormones like oxytocin (OXT), vasopressin, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) axis hormones, sex hormones, thyroid hormones, and nutritional hormones are probably involved in addiction processes. These hormones completely with different mechanisms can influence drug users' ultimate outcome. As we will see, these hormones influence tolerance, sensitization, and compulsive drug seeking and taking behavior. In this review, they have been further discussed.© the Author(s)."
"35250605","Histone Deacetylases as Modulators of the Crosstalk Between Skeletal Muscle and Other Organs.","Front Physiol","Skeletal muscle plays a major role in controlling body mass and metabolism: it is the most abundant tissue of the body and a major source of humoral factors; in addition, it is primarily responsible for glucose uptake and storage, as well as for protein metabolism. Muscle acts as a metabolic hub, in a crosstalk with other organs and tissues, such as the liver, the brain, and fat tissue. Cytokines, adipokines, and myokines are pivotal mediators of such crosstalk. Many of these circulating factors modulate histone deacetylase (HDAC) expression and/or activity. HDACs form a numerous family of enzymes, divided into four classes based on their homology to their orthologs in yeast. Eleven family members are considered classic HDACs, with a highly conserved deacetylase domain, and fall into Classes I, II, and IV, while class III members are named Sirtuins and are structurally and mechanistically distinct from the members of the other classes. HDACs are key regulators of skeletal muscle metabolism, both in physiological conditions and following metabolic stress, participating in the highly dynamic adaptative responses of the muscle to external stimuli. In turn, HDAC expression and activity are closely regulated by the metabolic demands of the skeletal muscle. For instance, NAD+ levels link Class III (Sirtuin) enzymatic activity to the energy status of the cell, and starvation or exercise affect Class II HDAC stability and intracellular localization. SUMOylation or phosphorylation of Class II HDACs are modulated by circulating factors, thus establishing a bidirectional link between HDAC activity and endocrine, paracrine, and autocrine factors. Indeed, besides being targets of adipo-myokines, HDACs affect the synthesis of myokines by skeletal muscle, altering the composition of the humoral milieu and ultimately contributing to the muscle functioning as an endocrine organ. In this review, we discuss recent findings on the interplay between HDACs and circulating factors, in relation to skeletal muscle metabolism and its adaptative response to energy demand. We believe that enhancing knowledge on the specific functions of HDACs may have clinical implications leading to the use of improved HDAC inhibitors for the treatment of metabolic syndromes or aging.Copyright © 2022 Renzini, D’Onghia, Coletti and Moresi."

"35223782","Clinical Significance of TET2 in Female Cancers.","Front Bioeng Biotechnol","Female cancers refer to malignant tumors of the female reproductive system and breasts, which severely affect the physical and mental health of women. Although emerging experiment-based studies have indicated a potential correlation between ten-eleven translocation methylcytosine dioxygenase (TET2) and female cancers, no comprehensive studies have been conducted. Therefore, this study aimed to summarize the clinical value and underlying oncogenic functions of TET2 in female cancers, such as breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA), cervical squamous cell carcinoma and endocervical adenocarcinoma (CESC), ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma (OV), uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC), and uterine carcinosarcoma (UCS), based on the data obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas. The expression of TET2 was decreased in most female cancers, and its high expression was distinctly associated with the favorable prognosis of most female cancers. Furthermore, CD8+T-cell infiltration was not correlated with TET2 in OV, UCEC, and UCS, whereas tumor-associated fibroblast infiltration was significantly correlated with TET2 in BRCA, CESC, and OV. TET2 was co-expressed with the immune checkpoint molecules ADORA2A, CD160, CD200, CD200R1, CD44, CD80, NRP1 TNFSF4, and TNFSF15 in most female cancers. Enrichment analysis revealed that some signaling pathways involving TET2 and related genes were related to tumorigenesis. Immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence staining confirmed the results of cancer immune infiltration analysis in BRCA tissues. Therefore, this study provides evidence for the oncogenic functions and clinical value of TET2 in female cancers.Copyright © 2022 Wan, Chen, Fan and Chen."

However, risk factors might trigger the oncogenic transformation of cells. Among other regulatory signals, hypermethylation ofRAD9Aintron 2 is responsible for the increased expression of RAD9A protein, which may play a role in oncogenic transformation. Here, we analyzed theRAD9Aintron 2 methylation in primary fibroblasts of 20 patients with primary cancer in childhood and second primary cancer (2N) later in life, 20 matched patients with only one primary cancer in childhood (1N) and 20 matched cancer-free controls (0N), using bisulfite pyrosequencing and deep bisulfite sequencing (DBS). Four 1N patients and one 2N patient displayed elevated mean methylation levels (≥ 10 %) ofRAD9A. DBS revealed ≥ 2 % hypermethylated alleles ofRAD9A,indicative for constitutive mosaic epimutations. Bone marrow samples of NHL and AML tumor patients (n=74), EBV (Epstein Barr Virus) lymphoblasts (n=6), tumor cell lines (n=5) and FaDu subclones (n=13) were analyzed to substantiate our findings. We find a broad spectrum of tumor entities with an aberrant methylation ofRAD9A. We detected a significant difference in mean methylation ofRAD9Afor NHL versus AML patients (p ≤0.025). Molecular karyotyping of AML samples during therapy with hypermethylatedRAD9Ashowed an evolving duplication of 1.8 kb on Chr16p13.3 including the PKD1 gene. Radiation, colony formation assays, cell proliferation, PCR and molecular karyotyping SNP-array experiments using generated FaDu subclones suggest that hypermethylation ofRAD9Aintron 2 is associated with genomic imbalances in regions with tumor-relevant genes and survival of the cells. In conclusion, this is the very first study ofRAD9Aintron 2 methylation in childhood cancer and Leukemia.RAD9Aepimutations may have an impact on leukemia and tumorigenesis and can potentially serve as a biomarker.Copyright © 2022 Galetzka et al."

A crucial challenge for long-term economic viability and environmental sustainability is also to optimize the production of biomass composition and carbon sequestration. Sugarcane varieties such as KQ228 and Q253 are highly utilized in the industry. These varieties are characterized by a high early-season sugar content associated with high yield. In order to investigate these correlations, 1,440 internodes were collected and combined to generate a set of 120 samples in triplicate across 24 sugarcane cultivars at five different development stages. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used and revealed for the first time two sets of co-expressed genes with a distinct and opposite correlation between fibre and sugar content. Gene identification and metabolism pathways analysis was used to define these two sets of genes. Correlation analysis identified a large number of interconnected metabolic pathways linked to sugar content and fibre content. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of gene expression revealed a stronger level of segregation associated with the genotypes than the stage of development, suggesting a dominant genetic influence on biomass composition and facilitating breeding selection. Characterization of these two groups of co-expressed key genes can help to improve breeding program for high fibre, high sugar species or plant synthetic biology.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35211187","Maximal Information Coefficient-Based Testing to Identify Epistasis in Case-Control Association Studies.","Comput Math Methods Med","Interactions between genetic variants (epistasis) are ubiquitous in the model system and can significantly affect evolutionary adaptation, genetic mapping, and precision medical efforts. In this paper, we proposed a method for epistasis detection, called EpiMIC (epistasis detection through a maximal information coefficient (MIC)). MIC is a promising bivariate dependence measure explicitly designed for rapidly exploring various function types equally and for interpreting and comparing them on the same scale. Most epistasis detection approaches make assumptions about the form of the association between genetic variants, resulting in limited statistical performance. Based on the notion that if two SNPs do not interact, their joint distribution in all samples and in only cases should not be substantially different. We developed a statistic that utilizes the difference of MIC as a signal of epistasis and combined it with a permutation resampling strategy to estimate the empirical distribution of our statistic. Results of simulation and real-world data set showed that EpiMIC outperformed previous approaches for identifying epistasis at varying degrees of heredity.Copyright © 2022 Yingjie Guo et al."
"35208228","Metabolomics and the Multi-Omics View of Cancer.","Metabolites","Cancer is widely regarded to be a genetic disease. Indeed, over the past five decades, the genomic perspective on cancer has come to almost completely dominate the field. However, this genome-only view is incomplete and tends to portray cancer as a disease that is highly heritable, driven by hundreds of complex genetic interactions and, consequently, difficult to prevent or treat. New evidence suggests that cancer is not as heritable or purely genetic as once thought and that it really is a multi-omics disease. As highlighted in this review, the genome, the exposome, and the metabolome all play roles in cancer's development and manifestation. The data presented here show that >90% of cancers are initiated by environmental exposures (the exposome) which lead to cancer-inducing genetic changes. The resulting genetic changes are, then, propagated through the altered DNA of the proliferating cancer cells (the genome). Finally, the dividing cancer cells are nourished and sustained by genetically reprogrammed, cancer-specific metabolism (the metabolome). As shown in this review, all three ""omes"" play roles in initiating cancer. Likewise, all three ""omes"" interact closely, often providing feedback to each other to sustain or enhance tumor development. Thanks to metabolomics, these multi-omics feedback loops are now much more evident and their roles in explaining the hallmarks of cancer are much better understood. Importantly, this more holistic, multi-omics view portrays cancer as a disease that is much more preventable, easier to understand, and potentially, far more treatable."

We found that lipid-related effects were confined to erythroid traits. In contrast, BMI affected multiple blood lineages, indicating broad effects on hematopoiesis. Increased truncal adipose distribution opposed BMI effects, increasing hemoglobin and blood cell counts across lineages. Conditional analyses indicated genes, pathways, and cell types responsible for these effects, includingLeptin Receptorand other blood cell-extrinsic factors in adipocytes and endothelium that regulate hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell biology.

We applied Mendelian randomization including >3,000 blood proteins as exposures to identify potential biomarkers that may indicate risk for hospitalization or need for respiratory support or death due to COVID-19, respectively. After multiple testing correction, using genetic instruments and under the assumptions of Mendelian Randomization, our results were consistent with higher blood levels of five proteins GCNT4, CD207, RAB14, C1GALT1C1, and ABO being causally associated with an increased risk of hospitalization or respiratory support/death due to COVID-19 (ORs = 1.12-1.35). Higher levels of FAAH2 were solely associated with an increased risk of hospitalization (OR = 1.19). On the contrary, higher levels of SELL, SELE, and PECAM-1 decrease risk of hospitalization or need for respiratory support/death (ORs = 0.80-0.91). Higher levels of LCTL, SFTPD, KEL, and ATP2A3 were solely associated with a decreased risk of hospitalization (ORs = 0.86-0.93), whilst higher levels of ICAM-1 were solely associated with a decreased risk of respiratory support/death of COVID-19 (OR = 0.84). Our findings implicate blood group markers and binding proteins in both hospitalization and need for respiratory support/death. They, additionally, suggest that higher levels of endocannabinoid enzymes may increase the risk of hospitalization. Our research replicates findings of blood markers previously associated with COVID-19 and prioritises additional blood markers for risk prediction of severe forms of COVID-19.

We aimed to investigate the association of the serum folate and total magnesium (Mg) and calcium (Ca) levels before ovarian stimulation with the outcomes of assisted reproductive technology (ART) in normogonadotropic women.We used a subanalysis of data obtained from a multicentre, randomized prospective study (NCT03088137). A total of 110 normogonadotropic, non-advanced aged, non-obese women with tubal and/or male infertility factors were enrolled for the single fresh ovarian stimulation GnRH antagonist cycle. The main outcome measures were the total oocyte yield, mature oocytes, fertilization rate, biochemical, clinical pregnancy, and live birth. Multivariable generalized linear models adjusted for covariates were used with a Poisson distribution and the log link function for adjusted oocyte counts, and a binomial distribution and the log link function were used for adjusted clinical ART outcomes.The medians (interquartile range (IQR)) were as follows: baseline serum folate, 20.55 ng/ml (10.8, 32.9); Mg, 19.4 mg/L (18.7, 20.7); Ca, 94 mg/L (91.2, 96.4); and Ca/Mg ratio, 4.78 (4.55, 5.02). Women with higher serum folate concentrations (Q4≥33.0 ng/ml) had significantly lower total numbers of oocytes retrieved (adjusted mean (95% CI) 9.2 (7.6-11.3) vs 12.9 (10.9-15.4, p-trend=0.006)) and lower odds ratios (ORs) (95% CI) of 0.12 (0.02, 0.79) for clinical pregnancy and 0.10 (0.01, 0.70) for live birth compared with women in the lowest quartile (<10.8 ng/ml), all p-trend<0.001. Women in the highest Ca/Mg ratio quartile (≥5.02) had ORs (95% CI) of 6.58 (1.31, 33.04) for biochemical pregnancy, 4.85 (1.02, 23.08) for clinical pregnancy and 4.07 (0.83, 19.9) for the live birth rate compared with women in the lowest quartile (<4.55), all p-trend<0.001.Using multivariable models, we suggested that a baseline elevated serum folate level (≥33.0 ng/ml) and a lower Ca/Mg ratio were associated with worse ART outcomes in normogonadotropic women. Our findings might be useful for choosing safe dosages of folate, calcium, magnesium and complex supplementation for both fertile women and women undergoing infertility treatment.

However, the role of LLPS in digestive system tumors is still largely unknown.Results:Here, we characterized the expression profiles of LLPS regulators in 3 digestive tract tumor types such as COAD, STAD, and ESCA with The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data. Our results for the first time showed that LLPS regulatory factors, such as Brd4, FBN1, and TP53, were frequently mutated in all types of digestive system tumors. Variant allele frequency (VAF) and APOBEC analysis demonstrated that genetic alterations of LLPS regulators were related to the progression of digestive system neoplasms (DSNs), such as TP53, NPHS1, TNRC6B, ITSN1, TNPO1, PML, AR, BRD4, DLG4, and PTPN1. KM plotter analysis showed that the mutation status of LLPS regulators was significantly related to the overall survival (OS) time of DSNs, indicating that they may contribute to the progression of DSN. The expression analysis of LLPS regulatory factors showed that a variety of LLPS regulatory factors were significantly dysregulated in digestive system tumors, such as SYN2 and MAPT. It is worth noting that we first found that LLPS regulatory factors were significantly correlated with tumor immune infiltration of B cells, CD4+ T cells, and CD8+ T cells in digestive system tumors. Bioinformatics analysis showed that the LLPS regulators' expression was closely related to multiple signaling, including the ErbB signaling pathway and T-cell receptor signaling pathway. Finally, several LLPS signatures were constructed and had a strong prognostic stratification ability in different digestive gland tumors. Finally, the results demonstrated the LLPS regulators' signature score was significantly positively related to the infiltration levels of CD4+T cells, neutrophil cells, macrophage cells, and CD8+T cells.Conclusion:Our study for the first time showed the potential roles of LLPS regulators in carcinogenesis and provide novel insights to identify novel biomarkers for the prediction of immune therapy and prognosis of DSNs.Copyright © 2022 Zhang, Li, Feng, Peng, Wang, Han and Zhang."
"35236887","Identification of a novel immune-related long noncoding RNA signature to predict the prognosis of bladder cancer.","Sci Rep","Tumour immune regulation has attracted widespread attention, and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play an important role in this process. Therefore, we evaluated patient prognosis by exploring the relationship between bladder cancer (BLCA) and immune-related lncRNAs (IRlncRNAs). Transcriptome data and immune-related genes were analysed for coexpression, and then, the IRlncRNAs were analysed to determine the differentially expressed IRlncRNAs (DEIRlncRNAs) between normal and tumour samples in The Cancer Genome Atlas. The screened lncRNAs were pairwise paired and combined with clinical data, and finally, a signature was constructed by Lasso regression and Cox regression in 13 pairs of DEIRlncRNAs. According to the Akaike information criterion (AIC) values of the 1-year receiver operating characteristic curve, BLCA patients were stratified into high- or low-risk groups. The high-risk group had a worse prognosis. A comprehensive analysis showed that differences in risk scores were associated with the immune status of BLCA-infiltrated patients. The identified signature was correlated with the expression of immune checkpoint inhibitor-related molecules and sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs. We also identified three BLCA clusters with different immune statuses and prognoses that are also associated with immunotherapy response and drug sensitivity. In conclusion, we constructed a powerful predictive signature with high accuracy and validated its prognostic value.© 2022. The Author(s)."

We collected gene expression data and clinical information from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) databases. Cox regression analysis and LASSO-cox regression analysis were performed to get survival-related genes and establish the overall survival prediction model. The ROC curve and Kaplan Meier analysis were used to evaluate the prediction ability of the model in training set and two independent cohorts. We also analyzed the biological functions of survival-related genes by GO and KEGG enrichment analysis. We identified 99 genes associated with overall survival and selected 16 genes (IGFBP2,GPRASP1,C1R,CHRM3,CLSTN2,NELL1,SEZ6L2,NMB,ICAM5,HPCAL4,SNAP91,PCSK1N,PGBD5,INA,UCHL1andLHX6) to establish the survival risk prediction model. Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicted that the risk score could predict overall survival independent of age and gender. ROC analyses showed that our model was more robust than four existing signatures.

Bayesian distributed lag interaction models (BDLIMs) were used to examine time-varying associations between prenatal PM2.5and repeated wheeze (≥2 episodes) and effect modification by AI, race/ethnicity, and child sex. Covariates included maternal age, education, asthma, and temperature. Women were 39% Black and 33% Hispanic, 36% with ≤high school education; 21% of children had repeated wheeze. Higher AI was associated with decreased wheeze in Blacks (OR = 0.37 (0.19-0.73), per IQR increase). BDLIMs identified a sensitive window for PM2.5effects on wheeze among boys born to Black mothers with low AI (at 33-40 weeks gestation; OR = 1.74 (1.19-2.54), per µg/m3increase in PM2.5). Relationships among prenatal PM2.5, antioxidant intake, and child wheeze were modified by race/ethnicity and sex."

Non-mutational events, particularly DNA and RNA epigenetic dysregulation, are emerging as key players in tumorigenesis. In this review we summarize the molecular changes linked to epigenetic and epitranscriptomic dysregulation in prostate cancer and the role that alterations to DNA and RNA modifications play in the initiation and progression of prostate cancer."

We studied polygenic scores and phenotypic data from pairs of partners (n = 26,681), siblings (n = 2,170), siblings-in-law (n = 3,905), and co-siblings-in-law (n = 1,763) in the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study. Using structural equation models, we estimated associations between measurement error-free latent genetic and phenotypic variables. We found evidence of genetic similarity between partners for educational attainment (rg = 0.37), height (rg = 0.13), and depression (rg = 0.08). Common genetic variants associated with educational attainment correlated between siblings above 0.50 (rg = 0.68) and between siblings-in-law (rg = 0.25) and co-siblings-in-law (rg = 0.09). Indirect assortment on secondary traits accounted for partner similarity in education and depression, but not in height. Comparisons between the genetic similarities of partners and siblings indicated that genetic variances were in intergenerational equilibrium. This study shows genetic similarities between extended family members and that assortative mating has taken place for several generations.© 2022. The Author(s)."

We introduce TADA, a method to prioritise pathogenic CNVs through assisted manual filtering and automated classification, based on an extensive catalogue of functional annotation supported by rigourous enrichment analysis. We demonstrate that our classifiers are able to accurately predict pathogenic CNVs, outperforming current alternative methods, and produce a well-calibrated pathogenicity score. Our results suggest that functional annotation-based prioritisation of pathogenic CNVs is a promising approach to support clinical diagnostics and to further the understanding of mechanisms controlling the disease impact of larger genomic alterations.© 2022.

Epigenetic alterations have been reported to be important in tumorigenesis, especially the chromatin accessibility changes and transcription factor binding differences. However, the regulatory mechanism underlying epigenetic alterations in EC development remains unclear. Here, we identified and characterized transcription factor binding site clustered regions (TFCRs) by integrating chromatin accessibility and transcription factor binding information. We totally identified 78,820 TFCRs and explored the relationship between TFCRs and regulatory elements, gene expression and mutation. Finally, we constructed a bioinformatic framework to identify candidate oncogenes and screened 13 candidate key genes, which may serve as potential diagnostic markers or therapeutic targets of EC.© 2022 The Authors."
"35210933","Transfer Learning for High-Dimensional Linear Regression: Prediction, Estimation and Minimax Optimality.","J R Stat Soc Series B Stat Methodol","This paper considers estimation and prediction of a high-dimensional linear regression in the setting of transfer learning where, in addition to observations from the target model, auxiliary samples from different but possibly related regression models are available. When the set of informative auxiliary studies is known, an estimator and a predictor are proposed and their optimality is established. The optimal rates of convergence for prediction and estimation are faster than the corresponding rates without using the auxiliary samples. This implies that knowledge from the informative auxiliary samples can be transferred to improve the learning performance of the target problem. When the set of informative auxiliary samples is unknown, we propose a data-driven procedure for transfer learning, called Trans-Lasso, and show its robustness to non-informative auxiliary samples and its efficiency in knowledge transfer. The proposed procedures are demonstrated in numerical studies and are applied to a dataset concerning the associations among gene expressions. It is shown that Trans-Lasso leads to improved performance in gene expression prediction in a target tissue by incorporating data from multiple different tissues as auxiliary samples."

To investigate its function, we studied the morphological consequences of Fkbp51 deletion. Artificial Intelligence-assisted morphological analysis revealed that male Fkbp51 knock-out (KO) mice possess more elongated dentate gyrus (DG) but shorter hippocampal height in coronal sections when compared to WT. Primary cultured Fkbp51 KO hippocampal neurons were shown to exhibit larger dendritic outgrowth than wild-type (WT) controls and pharmacological manipulation experiments suggest that this may occur through the regulation of microtubule-associated protein. Both in vitro primary culture and in vivo labeling support a role for FKBP51 in the regulation of microtubule-associated protein expression. Furthermore, Fkbp51 KO hippocampi exhibited decreases in βIII-tubulin, MAP2, and Tau protein levels, but a greater than 2.5-fold increase in Parkin protein. Overexpression and knock-down FKBP51 demonstrated that FKBP51 negatively regulates Parkin in a dose-dependent and ubiquitin-mediated manner. These results indicate a potential novel post-translational regulatory mechanism of Parkin by FKBP51 and the significance of their interaction on disease onset.

This exposure to traumatic stress can trigger several physiological pathways, which are associated with genetic variability. Exposure to traumatic stress can result in the development of behavioural and psychiatric disorders, such as aggressive behaviour and anxiety disorders. Several genes play a crucial role in the neurophysiological response to chronic stress and trauma. These essential genes include monoamine oxidase A (MAOA), solute carrier family 6 member 4 (SLC6A4), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), dopamine receptor 2 and 4 (DRD2 and DRD4), and FK506 binding protein 5 (FKBP5). Genetic variations in several genes have been found to have altered physiological response, which associates with the development of several behavioural traits. Interestingly, previous studies show that there is an interplay between aggressive behaviour and anxiety disorders, which may be associated with physiological genomics structure. The physiological responses are based on genetic architecture and its molecular reaction. Understanding physiological genomics may show underpinnings related to the development of aggressive behaviours and their interaction with anxiety disorders. This review aims to discuss the association between different physiological genes and the development of psychiatric disorders related to aggressive behaviours and anxiety disorders, such as post-traumatic stress disorder."
"35246212","Allele-specific expression reveals genes with recurrent cis-regulatory alterations in high-risk neuroblastoma.","Genome Biol","Neuroblastoma is a pediatric malignancy with a high frequency of metastatic disease at initial diagnosis. Neuroblastoma tumors have few recurrent protein-coding mutations but contain extensive somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs) suggesting that mutations that alter gene dosage are important drivers of tumorigenesis. Here, we analyze allele-specific expression in 96 high-risk neuroblastoma tumors to discover genes impacted by cis-acting mutations that alter dosage.We identify 1043 genes with recurrent, neuroblastoma-specific allele-specific expression. While most of these genes lie within common SCNA regions, many of them exhibit allele-specific expression in copy neutral samples and these samples are enriched for mutations that are predicted to cause nonsense-mediated decay. Thus, both SCNA and non-SCNA mutations frequently alter gene expression in neuroblastoma. We focus on genes with neuroblastoma-specific allele-specific expression in the absence of SCNAs and find 26 such genes that have reduced expression in stage 4 disease. At least two of these genes have evidence for tumor suppressor activity including the transcription factor TFAP2B and the protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPRH.In summary, our allele-specific expression analysis discovers genes that are recurrently dysregulated by both large SCNAs and other cis-acting mutations in high-risk neuroblastoma.© 2022.

PAH samples at eight schools were collected using a low volume sampler for 24 h and quantified using Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry. Two hundred and twenty-eight buccal cells of children were assessed for DNA damage using Comet Assay. Monte-Carlo simulation was performed to determine incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR) and to check the uncertainty and sensitivity of the estimated risk. Total PAH concentrations in the schools in HT area were higher than LT area ranging from 4.4 to 5.76 ng m-3and 1.36 to 3.79 ng m-3, respectively. The source diagnostic ratio showed that PAHs in the HT area is pyrogenic, mainly from diesel emission. The 95th percentile of the ILCR for children in HT and LT area were 2.80 × 10-7and 1.43 × 10-7, respectively. The degree of DNA damage was significantly more severe in children in the HT group compared to LT group. This study shows that total indoor PAH exposure was the most significant factor that influenced the DNA damage among children. Further investigation of the relationship between PAH exposure and genomic integrity in children is required to shed additional light on potential health risks."

The autonomic nervous system and several compounds known as cardiovascular factors, especially those targeting the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), the vasopressin system (VPS), and the oxytocin system (OTS), are also efficient modulators of several other processes in the CNS. The components of the RAS, VPS, and OTS, regulating pain, emotions, learning, memory, and other cognitive processes, are present in the neurons, glial cells, and blood vessels of the CNS. Increasing evidence shows that the combined function of the RAS, VPS, and OTS is altered in neuropsychiatric/neurodegenerative diseases, and in particular in patients with depression, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, autism, and schizophrenia. The altered function of the RAS may also contribute to CNS disorders in COVID-19. In this review, we present evidence that there are multiple causes for altered combined function of the RAS, VPS, and OTS in psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders, such as genetic predispositions and the engagement of the RAS, VAS, and OTS in the processes underlying emotions, memory, and cognition. The neuroactive pharmaceuticals interfering with the synthesis or the action of angiotensins, vasopressin, and oxytocin can improve or worsen the effectiveness of treatment for neuropsychiatric/neurodegenerative diseases. Better knowledge of the multiple actions of the RAS, VPS, and OTS may facilitate programming the most efficient treatment for patients suffering from the comorbidity of neuropsychiatric/neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases."

In this perspective, we review key knowledge gaps between the clinical phenotype and our biological models. We then propose a reappraisal of the key driving forces behind DCM and an individual's susceptibility, including the proposal of a new framework.Present pathobiological and mechanistic knowledge does not adequately explain the disease phenotype; why only a subset of patients with visualized cord compression show clinical myelopathy, and the amount of cord compression only weakly correlates with disability. We propose that DCM is better represented as a function of several interacting mechanical forces, such as shear, tension and compression, alongside an individual's vulnerability to spinal cord injury, influenced by factors such as age, genetics, their cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and nervous system status, and time.Understanding the disease pathobiology is a fundamental research priority. We believe a framework of mechanical stress, vulnerability, and time may better represent the disease as a whole. Whilst this remains theoretical, we hope that at the very least it will inspire new avenues of research that better encapsulate the full spectrum of disease."

Bisulfite pyrosequencing (BPS) was used to determine the methylation levels of the rDNA core promoter and the rDNA upstream control element (UCE) along with two oppositely genomically imprinted control genes (PEG3andGTL2) in individual human germinal vesicle (GV) oocytes from 90 consenting women undergoing fertility treatment because of male infertility. Apart from a few (4%) oocytes with single imprinting defects (in eitherPEG3orGTL2), the analyzed GV oocytes displayed correct imprinting patterns. In 95 GV oocytes from 42 younger women (26-32 years), the mean methylation levels of the rDNA core promoter and UCE were 7.4±4.0% and 9.3±6.1%, respectively. In 79 GV oocytes from 48 older women (33-39 years), methylation levels increased to 9.3±5.3% (P= 0.014) and 11.6±7.4% (P= 0.039), respectively. An age-related increase in oocyte rDNA methylation was also observed in 123 mouse GV oocytes from 29 4-16-months-old animals. Similar to the continuously mitotically dividing male germline, ovarian aging is associated with a gain of rDNA methylation in meiotically arrested oocytes. Oocytes from the same woman can exhibit varying rDNA methylation levels and, by extrapolation, different epigenetic ages."

CH is a risk factor for the development of hematologic malignancies, most commonly myeloid neoplasms (MNs) including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN). Recent work has elucidated how the development and cellular fitness of CH is shaped by aging, environmental exposures, and the germline (inherited) genetic background of an individual. This in turn has provided valuable insights into the pathogenesis of MNs including MDS. Here, in this review, we discuss the genetic origins of CH, the environmental stressors that influence CH, and the implications of CH on health outcomes including MDS. Since MNs have shared risk factors and underlying biology, most of our discussion regarding the implications of CH surrounds MN in general rather than focusing specifically on MDS. We conclude with future directions and areas of investigation including how intervention studies of CH might inform future therapeutic approaches to MN including MDS.Copyright © 2022 Chan, Wiley and Bolton."

This new entity of IDH-mutant astrocytoma not only signifies an exception to the generally favorable outcome of IDH-mutant glioma, but also brings into question whether, and, if so, how,CDKN2A/Bhomozygous deletion overrides the anti-tumor activity of IDH mutation by promoting the proliferation of stem/neural progenitor-like cells.

Chordomas are considered insensitive to conventional chemotherapy, and their rarity complicates running timely and adequately powered trials to identify effective treatments. Therefore, there is a need for discovery of novel therapeutic approaches. Patient-derived organoids can accelerate drug discovery and development studies and predict patient responses to therapy. In this proof-of-concept study, we successfully established organoids from seven chordoma tumor samples obtained from five patients presenting with tumors in different sites and stages of disease. The organoids recapitulated features of the original parent tumors and inter- as well as intrapatient heterogeneity. High-throughput screenings performed on the organoids highlighted targeted agents such as PI3K/mTOR, EGFR, and JAK2/STAT3 inhibitors among the most effective molecules. Pathway analysis underscored how the NF-κB and IGF-1R pathways are sensitive to perturbations and potential targets to pursue for combination therapy of chordoma."
"35203961","Emerging Treatments for Disorders of Consciousness in Paediatric Age.","Brain Sci","The number of paediatric patients living with a prolonged Disorder of Consciousness (DoC) is growing in high-income countries, thanks to substantial improvement in intensive care. Life expectancy is extending due to the clinical and nursing management achievements of chronic phase needs, including infections. However, long-known pharmacological therapies such as amantadine and zolpidem, as well as novel instrumental approaches using direct current stimulation and, more recently, stem cell transplantation, are applied in the absence of large paediatric clinical trials and rigorous age-balanced and dose-escalated validations. With evidence building up mainly through case reports and observational studies, there is a need for well-designed paediatric clinical trials and specific research on 0-4-year-old children. At such an early age, assessing residual and recovered abilities is most challenging due to the early developmental stage, incompletely learnt motor and cognitive skills, and unreliable communication; treatment options are also less explored in early age. In middle-income countries, the lack of rehabilitation services and professionals focusing on paediatric age hampers the overall good assistance provision. Young and fast-evolving health insurance systems prevent universal access to chronic care in some countries. In low-income countries, rescue networks are often inadequate, and there is a lack of specialised and intensive care, difficulty in providing specific pharmaceuticals, and lower compliance to intensive care hygiene standards. Despite this, paediatric cases with DoC are reported, albeit in fewer numbers than in countries with better-resourced healthcare systems. For patients with a poor prospect of recovery, withdrawal of care is inhomogeneous across countries and still heavily conditioned by treatment costs as well as ethical and cultural factors, rather than reliant on protocols for assessment and standardised treatments. In summary, there is a strong call for multicentric, international, and global health initiatives on DoC to devote resources to the paediatric age, as there is now scope for funders to invest in themes specific to DoC affecting the early years of the life course."

Once recruited within the CNS, inflammatory Th cells produce several inflammatory cytokines and chemokines that activate resident glial cells, thus contributing to the breakdown of blood-brain barrier (BBB), demyelination and axonal loss. Astrocytes are recognized as key players of MS immunopathology, which respond to Th cell-defining cytokines by acquiring a reactive phenotype that amplify neuroinflammation into the CNS and contribute to MS progression. In this review, we summarize current knowledge of the astrocytic changes and behaviour in both MS and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), and the contribution of pathogenic Th1, Th17 and Th1-like Th17 cell subsets, and CD8+T cells to the morphological and functional modifications occurring in astrocytes and their pathological outcomes.Copyright © 2022 Kunkl, Amormino, Tedeschi, Fiorillo and Tuosto."

Neurodegenerative diseases (ND), such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, pose a global challenge in the aging population due to the lack of treatments for their cure. Despite various disease-specific clinical symptoms, ND have some fundamental common pathological mechanisms involving oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. The present review focuses on the major causes of central nervous system (CNS) redox homeostasis imbalance comprising mitochondrial dysfunction and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Mitochondrial disturbances, leading to reduced mitochondrial function and elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, are thought to be a major contributor to the pathogenesis of ND. ER dysfunction has been implicated in ND in which protein misfolding evidently causes ER stress. The consequences of ER stress ranges from an increase in ROS production to altered calcium efflux and proinflammatory signaling in glial cells. Both pathological pathways have links to ferroptotic cell death, which has been implicated to play an important role in ND. Pharmacological targeting of these pathological pathways may help alleviate or slow down neurodegeneration."

To date, the microbiome has not been a major focus of deprogramming efforts despite its emerging role in every aspect of ACE-related dysbiosis and dysfunction. This article examines: (1) the utility of incorporating microorganism-based, anti-aging approaches to combat ACE-programmed chronic diseases (also known as noncommunicable diseases and conditions, NCDs) and (2) microbiome regulation of core systems biology cycles that affect NCD comorbid risk. In this review, microbiota influence over three key cyclic rhythms (circadian cycles, the sleep cycle, and the lifespan/longevity cycle) as well as tissue inflammation and oxidative stress are discussed as an opportunity to deprogram ACE-driven chronic disorders. Microbiota, particularly those in the gut, have been shown to affect host-microbe interactions regulating the circadian clock, sleep quality, as well as immune function/senescence, and regulation of tissue inflammation. The microimmunosome is one of several systems biology targets of gut microbiota regulation. Furthermore, correcting misregulated inflammation and increased oxidative stress is key to protecting telomere length and lifespan/longevity and extending what has become known as the healthspan. This review article concludes that to reverse the tragedy of ACE-programmed NCDs and premature aging, managing the human holobiont microbiome should become a routine part of healthcare and preventative medicine across the life course."

Participants underwent an assessment at age 45 years and had data for at least 1 adolescent health condition (asthma, smoking, obesity, and psychological disorders) and outcome measure (pace of aging, gait speed, brain age, and facial age). Data analysis was performed from February 11 to September 27, 2021.Asthma, cigarette smoking, obesity, and psychological disorders were assessed at age 11, 13, and 15 years.The outcome was a midlife aging factor composite score comprising 4 measures of biological aging: pace of aging, gait speed, brain age (specifically, BrainAGE score), and facial age.A total of 910 participants (459 men [50.4%]) met the inclusion criteria, including an assessment at age 45 years. Participants who had smoked daily (0.61 [95% CI, 0.43-0.79] SD units), had obesity (0.82 [95% CI, 0.59-1.06] SD units), or had a psychological disorder diagnosis (0.43 [95% CI, 0.29-0.56] SD units) during adolescence were biologically older at midlife compared with participants without these conditions. Participants with asthma were not biologically older at midlife (0.02 [95% CI, -0.14 to 0.19] SD units) compared with those without asthma. These results remained unchanged after adjusting for childhood risk factors such as poor health, socioeconomic disadvantage, and adverse experiences.This study found that adolescent smoking, obesity, and psychological disorder diagnoses were associated with older biological age at midlife. These health conditions could be treated during adolescence to reduce the risk of accelerated biological aging later in life."

The opportunity to use minimally invasive liquid biopsy testing to screen asymptomatic individuals at-risk for multiple cancers simultaneously could benefit from the aggregated diseases prevalence and a fixed specificity. Increasing both latter parameters is paramount to mediate high positive predictive value-a useful metric to evaluate a screening test accuracy and its potential harm-benefit. Thus, the use of a single test for multi-cancer early detection (stMCED) has emerged as an appealing strategy for increasing early cancer detection rate efficiency and benefit population health. A recent flurry of these stMCED technologies have been reported for clinical potential; however, their development is facing unique challenges to effectively improve clinical cost-benefit. One promising avenue is the analysis of circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) for detecting DNA methylation biomarker fingerprints of malignancies-a hallmark of disease aetiology and progression holding the potential to be tissue- and cancer-type specific. Utilizing panels of epigenetic biomarkers could potentially help to detect earlier stages of malignancies as well as identify a tumour of origin from blood testing, useful information for follow-up clinical decision making and subsequent patient care improvement. Overall, this review collates the latest and most promising stMCED methodologies, summarizes their clinical performances, and discusses the specific requirements multi-cancer tests should meet to be successfully implemented into screening guidelines."

An LB is not limited to the blood and may include other fluids such as cerebrospinal fluid, pleural effusion, and urine, among others.The objective of this paper, devised by international experts from various disciplines, is to review current challenges as well as state-of-the-art applications of ctDNA mutation testing in metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We consider pragmatic scenarios for the use of ctDNA from blood plasma to identify actionable targets for therapy selection in NSCLCs.Clinical scenarios where ctDNA mutation testing may be implemented in clinical practice include complementary tissue and LB testing to provide the full picture of patients' actual predictive profiles to identify resistance mechanism (i.e. secondary mutations), and ctDNA mutation testing to assist when a patient has a discordant clinical history and is suspected of showing intertumor or intratumor heterogeneity. ctDNA mutation testing may provide interesting insights into possible targets that may have been missed on the TB. Complementary ctDNA LB testing also provides an option if the tumor location is hard to biopsy or if an insufficient sample was taken. These clinical use cases highlight practical scenarios where ctDNA LB may be considered as a complementary tool to TB analysis.Proper implementation of ctDNA LB testing in routine clinical practice is envisioned in the near future. As the clinical evidence of utility expands, the use of LB alongside tissue sample analysis may occur in the patient cases detailed here.Copyright © 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd..

"35222432","Cohesin-Mediated Chromatin Interactions and Autoimmunity.","Front Immunol","Proper physiological functioning of any cell type requires ordered chromatin organization. In this context, cohesin complex performs important functions preventing premature separation of sister chromatids after DNA replication. In partnership with CCCTC-binding factor, it ensures insulator activity to organize enhancers and promoters within regulatory chromatin. Homozygous mutations and dysfunction of individual cohesin proteins are embryonically lethal in humans and mice, which limitsin vivoresearch work to embryonic stem cells and progenitors. Conditional alleles of cohesin complex proteins have been generated to investigate their functional roles in greater detail at later developmental stages. Thus, genome regulation enabled by action of cohesin proteins is potentially crucial in lineage cell development, including immune homeostasis. In this review, we provide current knowledge on the role of cohesin complex in leukocyte maturation and adaptive immunity. Conditional knockout and shRNA-mediated inhibition of individual cohesin proteins in mice demonstrated their importance in haematopoiesis, adipogenesis and inflammation. Notably, these effects occur rather through changes in transcriptional gene regulation than through expected cell cycle defects. This positions cohesin at the crossroad of immune pathways including NF-kB, IL-6, and IFNγ signaling. Cohesin proteins emerged as vital regulators at early developmental stages of thymocytes and B cells and after antigen challenge. Human genome-wide association studies are remarkably concordant with these findings and present associations between cohesin and rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis and HLA-B27 related chronic inflammatory conditions. Furthermore, bioinformatic prediction based on protein-protein interactions reveal a tight connection between the cohesin complex and immune relevant processes supporting the notion that cohesin will unearth new clues in regulation of autoimmunity.Copyright © 2022 Chandrasekaran, Oparina, Garcia-Bonete, Wasén, Erlandsson, Malmhäll-Bah, Andersson, Jensen, Silfverswärd, Katona and Bokarewa."

However, its comprehensive chemical fingerprint is uncertain, and the mechanisms, especially the potential therapeutic target for anti-hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are still unclear. Using UPLC‒Q-TOF/MS, 139 chemical components were identified inA. cinnamomeadropping pills (ACDPs). Based on these chemical components, network pharmacology demonstrated that the targets of active components were significantly enriched in the pathways in cancer, which were closely related with cell proliferation regulation. Next, HCC data was downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus database (GEO). The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and DisGeNET were analyzed by bioinformatics, and 79 biomarkers were obtained. Furtherly, nine targets of ACDP active components were revealed, and they were significantly enriched in PI3K/AKT and cell cycle signaling pathways. The affinity between these targets and their corresponding active ingredients was predicted by molecular docking. Finally,in vivoandin vitroexperiments showed that ACDPs could reduce the activity of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and downregulate the expression of cell cycle-related proteins, contributing to the decreased growth of liver cancer.

Data for trend analyses in 89 countries from 2000 to 2019 were retrieved from the Global Burden of Disease 2019 platform. Age standardized incidence rate (ASIR) and mortality rate (ASMR) were calculated by using the Segi's population. The average annual percent changes (AAPC) of ASIRs and ASMRs were evaluated by joinpoint regression analysis.A total of 1 414 259 new cases of prostate cancer and 375 304 related deaths were reported in 2020 globally. HDI was positively correlated with ASIRs (P< 0.001) and negatively correlated with ASMRs (P< 0.001). In the past two decades, ASIRs have been increasing in 65 countries, stable in 15 countries and decreasing in 9 countries, and ASMRs have been increasing in 19 countries, stable in 25 countries and decreasing in 45 countries, respectively. In the most recent period, 44 countries have increasing ASIRs, and 32 countries have decreasing ASMRs, respectively. For instance, in the United States of America, the AAPC of ASIRs significantly decreased by 0.62% and ASMRs significantly decreased by 1.22% from 2000 to 2019, while the AAPC from 2015 to 2019 significantly increased by 0.49% for ASIRs and significantly increased by 0.48% for ASMRs.The magnitude of increasing incidence and decreasing mortality of prostate cancer is attenuated in the recent period.

"35222290","New Insights and Emerging Therapeutic Approaches in Prostate Cancer.","Front Endocrinol (Lausanne)","Prostate cancer is the second most frequently diagnosed cancer in men and several therapeutic approaches are currently available for patient's care. Although the androgen receptor status represents a good predictor of response to androgen deprivation therapy, prostate cancer frequently becomes resistant to this approach and spreads. The molecular mechanisms that contribute to progression and drug-resistance of this cancer remain still debated. However, few therapeutic options are available for patient's management, at this stage. Recent years have seen a great expansion of the studies concerning the role of stromal-epithelial interactions and tumor microenvironment in prostate cancer progression. The findings so far collected have provided new insights into diagnostic and clinical management of prostate cancer patients. Further, new fascinating aspects concerning the intersection of the androgen receptor with survival factors as well as calcium channels have been reported in cultured prostate cancer cells and mouse models. The results of these researches have opened the way for a better understanding of the basic mechanisms involved in prostate cancer invasion and drug-resistance. They have also significantly expanded the list of new biomarkers and druggable targets in prostate cancer. The primary aim of this manuscript is to provide an update of these issues, together with their translational aspects. Exploiting the power of novel promising therapeutics would increase the success rate in the diagnostic path and clinical management of patients with advanced disease.Copyright © 2022 Licitra, Giovannelli, Di Donato, Monaco, Galasso, Migliaccio and Castoria."

While the last several decades of research have definitively demonstrated that genetic variation can influence measures of cognitive function, the inferences drawn by some participants in the controversy regarding the implications of these findings for racial differences in cognitive ability are highly dubious. Of equal importance, there is no compelling scientific rationale for focusing on and devoting substantial effort to determining mean differences in intelligence or other cognitive functions between groups with incompletely defined and dynamic (and therefore not definitively definable) boundaries."
"35203507","Perspectives in Sports Genomics.","Biomedicines","Human athletic performance is a complex phenotype influenced by environmental and genetic factors, with most exercise-related traits being polygenic in nature. The aim of this article is to outline some of the challenge faced by sports genetics as this relatively new field moves forward. This review summarizes recent advances in sports science and discusses the impact of the genome, epigenome and other omics (such as proteomics and metabolomics) on athletic performance. The article also highlights the current status of gene doping and examines the possibility of applying genetic knowledge to predict athletes' injury risk and to prevent the rare but alarming occurrence of sudden deaths during sporting events. Future research in large cohorts of athletes has the potential to detect new genetic variants and to confirm the previously identified DNA variants believed to explain the natural predisposition of some individuals to certain athletic abilities and health benefits. It is hoped that this article will be useful to sports scientists who seek a greater understanding of how genetics influences exercise science and how genomic and other multi-omics approaches might support performance analysis, coaching, personalizing nutrition, rehabilitation and sports medicine, as well as the potential to develop new rationale for future scientific investigation."
"35264730","Uncovering the genetic profiles underlying the intrinsic organization of the human cerebellum.","Mol Psychiatry","The functional diversity of the human cerebellum is largely believed to be derived more from its extensive connections rather than being limited to its mostly invariant architecture. However, whether and how the determination of cerebellar connections in its intrinsic organization interact with microscale gene expression is still unknown. Here we decode the genetic profiles of the cerebellar functional organization by investigating the genetic substrates simultaneously linking cerebellar functional heterogeneity and its drivers, i.e., the connections. We not only identified 443 network-specific genes but also discovered that their co-expression pattern correlated strongly with intra-cerebellar functional connectivity (FC). Ninety of these genes were also linked to the FC of cortico-cerebellar cognitive-limbic networks. To further discover the biological functions of these genes, we performed a ""virtual gene knock-out"" by observing the change in the coupling between gene co-expression and FC and divided the genes into two subsets, i.e., a positive gene contribution indicator (GCI+) involved in cerebellar neurodevelopment and a negative gene set (GCI-) related to neurotransmission. A more interesting finding is that GCI-is significantly linked with the cerebellar connectivity-behavior association and many recognized brain diseases that are closely linked with the cerebellar functional abnormalities. Our results could collectively help to rethink the genetic substrates underlying the cerebellar functional organization and offer possible micro-macro interacted mechanistic interpretations of the cerebellum-involved high order functions and dysfunctions in neuropsychiatric disorders.© 2022.

Today, translational research in population health science offers a means of fostering their convergence, with potentially great benefit to both domains. Although evidence that the two fields need not and should not be entirely distinct in their methods and goals has been accumulating for over a decade, the prodigious efforts of biomedical and social sciences over the past year to address the COVID-19 pandemic has placed this unifying approach to translational research in both fields in a new light. Specifically, the coalescence of clinical and population-level strategies to control disease and novel uses of population-level data and tools in research relating to the pandemic have illuminated a promising future for translational research.

"35215435","Blood DNA Methylation Predicts Diabetic Kidney Disease Progression in High Fat Diet-Fed Mice.","Nutrients","Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) progresses at different rates among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). Early identification of patients with a higher risk of DKD progression is essential to improve prognosis. Epigenetic modifications, particularly DNA methylation, have been independently implicated in T2D and chronic kidney disease. The current study aimed to determine changes in blood DNA methylation that reflects and predicts DKD progression. C57BL/6 mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) from weaning and subclassified into two groups, HFD-1 and HFD-2, according to urinary kidney injury marker KIM-1/creatinine ratios (low vs. high) and histological abnormalities (mild-moderate vs. advanced). DNA methylation profiles were determined by reduced representative bisulfide sequencing (RRBS). Our results confirmed early and established DKD at week 9 and week 32, respectively. At week 32, advanced kidney injury was associated with dysregulation of methylation and demethylation enzymes in the kidney. Blood RRBS revealed 579 and 203 differentially methylated sites (DMS) between HFD-1 and HFD-2 animals at week 32 and week 9, respectively, among which 11 were common. The DMS in blood and kidney at week 32 were both related to organ development, neurogenesis, cell junction, and Wnt signalling, while the DMS in blood at week 9 suggested a specific enrichment of kidney development processes. In conclusion, our data strongly support the implication of early blood DNA methylation modifications and DKD progression in T2D that could be used to improve the disease's prognostication."

The predictive performance of maternal first-trimester and parental pre-pregnancy BMI for macrosomia was assessed using the area under the receiver-operating characteristics curve (AUC). Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate the independent effect of maternal first-trimester low BMI on macrosomia. Interactions were investigated to evaluate the potential variation of the effect of first-trimester low BMI across different groups. Furthermore, interactions were also examined across groups determined by multiple factors jointly: a) gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM)/GDM history status, parity, and maternal age; and b) GDM/GDM history status, fetal sex, and season of delivery.The proportion of macrosomia was 6.14% (5,215 of 84,900). Maternal first-trimester BMI showed the best discrimination of macrosomia (all Delong tests:P< 0.001). The protective effect of maternal first-trimester low BMI against macrosomia remained significant after adjusting for all confounders of this study [adjusted odds ratios (aOR) = 0.37, 95% CI: 0.32-0.43]. Maternal first-trimester low BMI was inversely associated with macrosomia, irrespective of parity, fetal sex, season of delivery, maternal age, and GDM/GDM history status. The protective effect was most pronounced among pregnant women without GDM/GDM history aged 25 to 29 years old, irrespective of parity (multipara: aOR = 0.32, 95% CI: 0.22-0.47; nullipara: aOR = 0.32, 95% CI: 0.24-0.43). In multipara with GDM/GDM history, the protective effect of low BMI was only observed in the 30- to 34-year-old group (aOR = 0.12, 95% CI: 0.02-0.86). For pregnant women without GDM/GDM history, the protective effect of maternal first-trimester low BMI against macrosomia was the weakest in infants born in winter, irrespective of fetal sex (female: aOR = 0.45, 95% CI: 0.29-0.69; male: aOR = 0.39, 95% CI: 0.28-0.55).Maternal first-trimester low BMI was inversely associated with macrosomia, and the protective effect was most pronounced among 25- to 29-year-old pregnant women without GDM/GDM history and was only found among 30- to 34-year-old multipara with GDM/GDM history.

Distinguished mainly by psychosis, behavioral alterations could range from hallucinations to delusions. This systematic review examines evidence of a relationship between childhood trauma/adverse life events and psychosis, especially in SCZ. A methodical search provided reproducible results using these five databases: PubMed, ScienceDirect, Semantic Scholar, JSTOR, and Cochrane Library. The systematic search focused on articles published between July 2016 and July 2021. The search strategy utilized specific keywords relevant to SCZ, psychosis, and childhood trauma. The formulation of specified inclusion and exclusion criteria was necessary to ensure a comprehensive narrowed-down search, such as the inclusion of free full-text articles published or translated in English and exclusion of irrelevant subject areas. Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, a strategic search initially identified 741 articles; three additional articles were identified from citation searching. After relevance screening, duplicate removal, and quality appraisal, 12 studies from databases/registers and three from citation searching met the criteria proving relevance to our review with minimal evidence of bias. The final selected 15 studies included observational studies and reviews. A review of relevant data unveiled findings on childhood adversity, individual lived experiences, and their involvement in SCZ. Evidence suggests that certain neurobiological processes occur in brain after trauma. The inflammation and dysregulation from oxidative stress predispose patients to an at-risk-mental state, facilitating the progression to SCZ. This review encourages further evaluation of early trauma detection and the potential benefits of early intervention.Copyright © 2022, Inyang et al."
"35251048","Insights Gained and Future Outlook From scRNAseq Studies in Autoimmune Rheumatic Diseases.","Front Immunol","Autoimmune rheumatic diseases have a major impact on public health as one of the most common morbidities, and many of these disorders involve both local and systemic manifestations with severe consequences for patient health and quality of life. However, treatment options for many of these diseases remain inadequate for a substantial portion of patients, and progress in developing novel therapeutics has been slow. This lack of progress can be largely attributed to an insufficient understanding of the complex mechanisms driving pathogenesis. Recently, the emergence of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) has offered a powerful new tool for interrogating rheumatic diseases, with the potential to assess biological heterogeneity and individual cell function in rheumatic diseases. In this review, we discuss the major insights gained from current scRNAseq interrogations of human rheumatic diseases. We highlight novel cell populations and key molecular signatures uncovered, and also raise a number of hypotheses for follow-up study that may be of interest to the field. We also provide an outlook into two emerging single-cell technologies (repertoire sequencing and spatial transcriptomics) that have yet to be utilized in the field of rheumatic diseases, but which offer immense potential in expanding our understanding of immune and stromal cell behavior. We hope that scRNAseq may serve as a wellspring for the generation and interrogation of novel hypotheses regarding autoreactive lymphocytes and tissue infiltration patterns, and help uncover novel avenues for therapeutic development.Copyright © 2022 Zheng, Chang, Li, Wu, Chen and Zou."

While recent studies suggest an endocrine descent of PanNETs, the origin of PanNECs remains unknown.We performed DNA methylation analysis for 57 PanNEN samples and found that distinct methylation profiles separated PanNENs into two major groups, clearly distinguishing high-grade PanNECs from other PanNETs including high-grade NETG3. DNA alterations and immunohistochemistry of cell-type markers PDX1, ARX, and SOX9 were utilized to further characterize PanNECs and their cell of origin in the pancreas.Phylo-epigenetic and cell-type signature features derived from alpha, beta, acinar, and ductal adult cells suggest an exocrine cell of origin for PanNECs, thus separating them in cell lineage from other PanNENs of endocrine origin.Our study provides a robust and clinically applicable method to clearly distinguish PanNECs from G3 PanNETs, improving patient stratification.© 2022.

"35213254","Epigenetic Inheritance From Normal Origin Cells Can Determine the Aggressive Biology of Tumor-Initiating Cells and Tumor Heterogeneity.","Cancer Control","The acquisition of genetic- and epigenetic-abnormalities during transformation has been recognized as the two fundamental factors that lead to tumorigenesis and determine the aggressive biology of tumor cells. However, there is a regularity that tumors derived from less-differentiated normal origin cells (NOCs) usually have a higher risk of vascular involvement, lymphatic and distant metastasis, which can be observed in both lymphohematopoietic malignancies and somatic cancers. Obviously, the hypothesis of genetic- and epigenetic-abnormalities is not sufficient to explain how the linear relationship between the cellular origin and the biological behavior of tumors is formed, because the cell origin of tumor is an independent factor related to tumor biology. In a given system, tumors can originate from multiple cell types, and tumor-initiating cells (TICs) can be mapped to different differentiation hierarchies of normal stem cells, suggesting that the heterogeneity of the origin of TICs is not completely chaotic. TIC's epigenome includes not only genetic- and epigenetic-abnormalities, but also established epigenetic status of genes inherited from NOCs. In reviewing previous studies, we found much evidence supporting that the status of many tumor-related ""epigenetic abnormalities"" in TICs is consistent with that of the corresponding NOC of the same differentiation hierarchy, suggesting that they may not be true epigenetic abnormalities. So, we speculate that the established statuses of genes that control NOC's migration, adhesion and colonization capabilities, cell-cycle quiescence, expression of drug transporters, induction of mesenchymal formation, overexpression of telomerase, and preference for glycolysis can be inherited to TICs through epigenetic memory and be manifested as their aggressive biology. TICs of different origins can maintain different degrees of innate stemness from NOC, which may explain why malignancies with stem cell phenotypes are usually more aggressive."
"35222097","Epigenetic Regulation of TET1-SP1 During Spermatogonia Self-Renewal and Proliferation.","Front Physiol","Spermatogonia are the source of spermatogenic waves. Abnormal spermatogonia can cause ab-normal spermatogenic waves, which manifest as spermatogenic disorders such as oligospermia, hypospermia, and azoospermia. Among them, the self-renewal of spermatogonia serves as the basis for maintaining the process of spermatogenesis, and the closely regulated balance between self-renewal and differentiation of spermatogonia can maintain the continuous production of spermatozoa. Tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 1(TET1) is an important epitope modifying enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC), thereby causing the methylation of specific genes site hydroxylation, enabling the DNA de-methylation process, and regulating gene expression. However, the hydroxymethylation sites at which TET1 acts specifically and the mechanisms of interaction affecting key differential genes are not clear. In the present study, we provide evidence that the expression of PLZF, a marker gene for spermatogonia self-renewal, was significantly elevated in the TET1 overexpression group, while the expression of PCNA, a proliferation-related marker gene, was also elevated at the mRNA level. Significant differential expression of SP1 was found by sequencing. SP1 expression was increased at both mRNA level and protein level after TET1 overexpression, while differential gene DAXX expression was downregulated at protein level, while the expression of its reciprocal protein P53 was upregulated. In conclusion, our results suggest that TET1 overexpression causes changes in the expression of SP1, DAXX and other genes, and that there is a certain antagonistic effect between SP1 and DAXX, which eventually reaches a dynamic balance to maintain the self-renewal state of spermatogonia for sustained sperm production. These findings may contribute to the understanding of male reproductive system disorders.Copyright © 2022 Liu, Wang, Wang, Wang, Chen and Zheng."
"35222223","Developing Biomarkers of Mild Traumatic Brain Injury: Promise and Progress of CNS-Derived Exosomes.","Front Neurol","Mild traumatic brain injuries (mTBI) are common injuries across civilian and military populations. Although most individuals recover after mTBI, some individuals continue to show long-term symptoms as well as increased risk for neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders. Currently, diagnosing TBI severity relies primarily on self-report and subjective symptoms, with limited tools for diagnosis or prognosis. Brain-derived exosomes, a form of extracellular vesicle, may offer a solution for interpreting injury states by aiding in diagnosis as well as outcome prediction with relatively low patient burden. Exosomes, which are released into circulation, contain both protein and RNA cargo that can be isolated and quantified, providing a molecular window into molecular status of the exosome source. Here we examined the current literature studying the utility of exosomes, in particular neuronal- and astrocyte-derived exosomes, to identify protein and miRNA biomarkers of injury severity, trajectory, and functional outcome. Current evidence supports the potential for these emerging new tools to capture an accessible molecular window into the brain as it responds to a traumatic injury, however a number of limitations must be addressed in future studies. Most current studies are relatively small and cross sectional; prospective, longitudinal studies across injury severity, and populations are needed to track exosome cargo changes after injury. Standardized exosome isolation as well as advancement in identifying/isolating exosomes from CNS-specific tissue sources will improve mechanistic understanding of cargo changes as well as reliability of findings. Exosomes are also just beginning to be used in model systems to understand functional effects of TBI-associated cargo such as toxicity. Finally linking exosome cargo changes to objective markers of neuronal pathology and cognitive changes will be critical in validating these tools to provide insights into injury and recovery states after TBI.Copyright © 2022 Vaughn, Winston, Levin, Rissman and Risbrough."

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), which belong to the family of non-protein-coding transcripts, have been linked to the pathogenesis, progression, and prognosis of these lesions. Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) are critical for the transmission of visual information to the brain, damage to which results in visual loss. Apoptosis has been identified as one of the most essential modes of RGC death. Emerging evidence suggests that lncRNAs can regulate RGC degeneration by directly or indirectly modulating apoptosis-associated signaling pathways. This review presents a comprehensive overview of the role of lncRNAs in RGC apoptosis at transcriptional, post-transcriptional, translational, and post-translational levels, emphasizing on the potential mechanisms of action. The current limitations and future perspectives of exploring the connection between lncRNAs and RGC apoptosis have been summarized. Understanding the intricate molecular interaction network of lncRNAs and RGC apoptosis will open new avenues for the identification of novel diagnostic biomarkers, therapeutic targets, and molecules for prognostic evaluation of diseases related to RGC injury.© 2022.

Apart from Chromogranin A, specific biomarkers predicting residual tumor disease, tumor burden, and disease progression in NEN are scant. Thus, there is a strong clinical need for new and minimally invasive biomarkers that allow for an evaluation of the prognosis, clinical course, and response to treatment of NEN patients, thereby helping implement individualized treatment decisions in this heterogeneous group of patients. In the current prospective study, we evaluated the role of plasma cell-free DNA concentration and its global hypomethylation and fragmentation as possible diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in patients with neuroendocrine neoplasias.The plasma cfDNA concentration, cfDNAAluhypomethylation, andLINE-1cfDNA integrity were evaluated prospectively in 63 NEN patients with presumably cured or advanced metastatic disease. The cfDNA characteristics in NEN patients were compared to the results of a group of 29 healthy controls and correlated with clinical and histopathological data of the patients.Patients with advanced NEN showed a significantly higher cfDNA concentration and percentage ofAluhypomethylation and a reducedLINE-1cfDNA integrity as compared to the surgically cured NET patients and the healthy control group. The increased hypomethylation and concentration of cfDNA and the reduced cfDNA integrity in NEN patients were strongly associated with tumor burden and poor prognosis, while no correlation with tumor grading, differentiation, localization, or hormonal activity could be found. Multiparametric ROC analysis of plasma cfDNA characteristics was able to distinguish NEN patients with metastatic disease from the control group and the cured NEN patients with AUC values of 0.694 and 0.908, respectively. This was significant even for the group with only a low tumor burden.The present study, for the first time, demonstrates that the combination of plasma cfDNA concentration, global hypomethylation, and fragment length pattern has the potential to serve as a potent and sensitive prognostic and therapeutic ""liquid biopsy"" biomarker for tumor burden and disease progression in patients with neuroendocrine neoplasias."

Low-density lipoproteins (LDL) have been successfully targeted, and their reduction is one of the key preventing measures in patients with atherosclerotic disease. LDL particles are pivotal for the formation and progression of atherosclerotic plaques; yet, they are quite heterogeneous, and smaller, denser LDL species are the most atherogenic. These particles have greater arterial entry and retention, higher susceptibility to oxidation, as well as reduced affinity for the LDL receptor. Increased proportion of small, dense LDL particles is an integral part of the atherogenic lipoprotein phenotype, the most common form of dyslipidemia associated with insulin resistance. Recent data suggest that both genetic and epigenetic factors might induce expression of this specific lipid pattern. In addition, a typical finding of increased small, dense LDL particles was confirmed in different categories of patients with elevated cardiovascular risk. Small, dense LDL is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, which emphasizes the clinical importance of both the quality and the quantity of LDL. An effective management of atherosclerotic disease should take into account the presence of small, dense LDL in order to prevent cardiovascular complications."
"35157801","Evolved DNA Duplex Readers for Strand-Asymmetrically Modified 5-Hydroxymethylcytosine/5-Methylcytosine CpG Dyads.","J Am Chem Soc","5-Methylcytosine (mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (hmC), the two main epigenetic modifications of mammalian DNA, exist in symmetric and asymmetric combinations in the two strands of CpG dyads. However, revealing such combinations in single DNA duplexes is a significant challenge. Here, we evolve methyl-CpG-binding domains (MBDs) derived from MeCP2 by bacterial cell surface display, resulting in the first affinity probes for hmC/mC CpGs. One mutant has low nanomolar affinity for a single hmC/mC CpG, discriminates against all 14 other modified CpG dyads, and rivals the selectivity of wild-type MeCP2. Structural studies indicate that this protein has a conserved scaffold and recognizes hmC and mC with two dedicated sets of residues. The mutant allows us to selectively address and enrich hmC/mC-containing DNA fragments from genomic DNA backgrounds. We anticipate that this novel probe will be a versatile tool to unravel the function of hmC/mC marks in diverse aspects of chromatin biology."

The pathogenesis of the disease is still not elucidated. Receptor for Advanced Glycation End Product (RAGE) is a major component of the innate immune system and has implications in ALS pathogenesis. Multiple studies suggest the role of RAGE and its ligands in ALS. RAGE and its ligands are overexpressed in human and murine ALS motor neurons, astrocytes, and microglia. Here, we demonstrated the expression of RAGE and its ligands during the progression of the disease in the transgenic SOD1 G93A mouse lumbar spinal cord. We observed the highest expression of HMGB1 and S100b proteins at ALS onset. Our results highlight the potential role of RAGE and its ligands in ALS pathogenesis and suggest that some of the RAGE ligands might be used as biomarkers in early ALS diagnosis and potentially be useful in targeted therapeutic interventions at the early stage of this devastating disease."
"35257042","H<sub>2</sub> Inhibits the Formation of Neutrophil Extracellular Traps.","JACC Basic Transl Sci","Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) contribute to inflammatory pathogenesis in numerous conditions, including infectious and cardiovascular diseases, and have attracted attention as potential therapeutic targets. H2acts as an antioxidant and has been clinically and experimentally proven to ameliorate inflammation. This study was performed to investigate whether H2could inhibit NET formation and excessive neutrophil activation. Neutrophils isolated from the blood of healthy volunteers were stimulated with phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) or the calcium ionophore A23187 in H2-exposed or control media. Compared with control neutrophils, PMA- or A23187-stimulated human neutrophils exposed to H2exhibited reduced neutrophil aggregation, citrullination of histones, membrane disruption by chromatin complexes, and release of NET components. CXCR4highneutrophils are highly prone to NETs, and H2suppressed Ser-139 phosphorylation in H2AX, a marker of DNA damage, thereby suppressing the induction of CXCR4 expression. H2suppressed both myeloperoxidase chlorination activity and production of reactive oxygen species to the same degree as N-acetylcysteine and ascorbic acid, while showing a more potent ability to inhibit NET formation than these antioxidants do in PMA-stimulated neutrophils. Although A23187 formed NETs in a reactive oxygen species-independent manner, H2inhibited A23187-induced NET formation, probably via direct inhibition of peptidyl arginine deiminase 4-mediated histone citrullination. Inhalation of H2inhibited the formation and release of NET components in the blood and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in animal models of lipopolysaccharide-induced sepsis (mice and aged mini pigs). Thus, H2therapy can be a novel therapeutic strategy for NETs associated with excessive neutrophil activation.© 2022 The Authors."
"35241643","miR-146a impedes the anti-aging effect of AMPK via NAMPT suppression and NAD<sup>+</sup>/SIRT inactivation.","Signal Transduct Target Ther","Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) is indispensable for the anti-aging activity of the sirtuin (SIRT) family enzymes. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) upregulates NAD+synthesis and SIRT activity in a nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT)-dependent manner. However, the molecular mechanisms that affect AMPK-driven NAMPT expression and NAD+/SIRT activation remain unclear. In this study, we tried to identify senescence-associated microRNAs (miRNAs) that negatively regulate the cascade linking AMPK and NAMPT expression. miRNA-screening experiments showed that the expression of miR-146a increased in senescent cells but decreased following AMPK activation. Additionally, miR-146a overexpression weakened the metformin-mediated upregulation of NAMPT expression, NAD+synthesis, SIRT activity, and senescence protection, whereas treatment with the miR-146a inhibitor reversed this effect. Importantly, these findings were observed both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, miR-146a directly targeted the 3'-UTR of Nampt mRNA to reduce the expression of NAMPT. AMPK activators metformin and 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide (AICAR) hindered miR-146a expression at the transcriptional level by promoting IκB kinase (IKK) phosphorylation to attenuate nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) activity. These findings identified a novel cascade that negatively regulates the NAD+/SIRT pathway by suppressing miR-146a-mediated NAMPT downregulation. Furthermore, our results showed that miR-146a impedes the anti-aging effect of AMPK. This mutual inhibitory relationship between miR-146a and AMPK enriches our understanding of the molecular connections between AMPK and SIRT and provides new insight into miRNA-mediated NAD+/SIRT regulation and an intervention point for the prevention of aging and age-related diseases.© 2022.

Flavonoids have excellent antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective effects. Recent studies have shown that flavonoids can delay aging and prolong a healthy lifespan by eliminating senescent cells, inhibiting senescence-related secretion phenotypes (SASPs), and maintaining metabolic homeostasis. However, only a few systematic studies have described flavonoids in clinical treatment for anti-aging, which needs to be explored further. This review first highlights the association between aging and macromolecular damage. Then, we discuss advances in the role of flavonoid molecules in prolonging the health span and lifespan of organisms. This study may provide crucial information for drug design and developmental and clinical applications based on flavonoids."
"35171671","Integrated -omics approach reveals persistent DNA damage rewires lipid metabolism and histone hyperacetylation via MYS-1/Tip60.","Sci Adv","Although DNA damage is intricately linked to metabolism, the metabolic alterations that occur in response to DNA damage are not well understood. We use a DNA repair-deficient model of ERCC1-XPF inCaenorhabditis elegansto gain insights on how genotoxic stress drives aging. Using multi-omic approach, we discover that nuclear DNA damage promotes mitochondrial β-oxidation and drives a global loss of fat depots. This metabolic shift to β-oxidation generates acetyl-coenzyme A to promote histone hyperacetylation and an associated change in expression of immune-effector and cytochrome genes. We identify the histone acetyltransferase MYS-1, as a critical regulator of this metabolic-epigenetic axis. We show that in response to DNA damage, polyunsaturated fatty acids, especially arachidonic acid (AA) and AA-related lipid mediators, are elevated and this is dependent onmys-1. Together, these findings reveal that DNA damage alters the metabolic-epigenetic axis to drive an immune-like response that can promote age-associated decline."

The limitations of mouse models for the study of human telomere biology and difficulties in accurately measuring the length of telomere repeats in chromosomes and cells have diverted attention from many important and relevant observations. The goal of this perspective is to summarize some of these observations and to discuss the antagonistic role of telomere loss in aging and cancer in the context of developmental biology, cell turnover, and evolution. It is proposed that both damage to DNA and replicative loss of telomeric DNA contribute to aging in humans, with the differences in leukocyte telomere length between humans being linked to the risk of developing specific diseases.

"35232274","Social ageing: exploring the drivers of late-life changes in social behaviour in mammals.","Biol Lett","Social interactions help group-living organisms cope with socio-environmental challenges and are central to survival and reproductive success. Recent research has shown that social behaviour and relationships can change across the lifespan, a phenomenon referred to as 'social ageing'. Given the importance of social integration for health and well-being, age-dependent changes in social behaviour can modulate how fitness changes with age and may be an important source of unexplained variation in individual patterns of senescence. However, integrating social behaviour into ageing research requires a deeper understanding of the causes and consequences of age-based changes in social behaviour. Here, we provide an overview of the drivers of late-life changes in sociality. We suggest that explanations for social ageing can be categorized into three groups: changes in sociality that (a) occur as a result of senescence; (b) result from adaptations to ameliorate the negative effects of senescence; and/or (c) result from positive effects of age and demographic changes. Quantifying the relative contribution of these processes to late-life changes in sociality will allow us to move towards a more holistic understanding of how and why these patterns emerge and will provide important insights into the potential for social ageing to delay or accelerate other patterns of senescence."

The common features of corona virus family helped to resolve structural characteristics and entry mechanism of SARS-CoV-2. However, rapid mutagenesis leads to the emergence of new strains that may have different reproduction rates or infectivity and may impact the course and severity of the disease. Host related factors may also play a role in the susceptibility for infection as well as the severity and outcomes of the COVID-19. We have performed a literature and database search to summarize potential viral and host-related genomic and epigenomic biomarkers, such as genetic variability, miRNA, and DNA methylation in the molecular pathway of SARS-CoV-2 entry into the host cell, that may be related to COVID-19 susceptibility and severity. Bioinformatics tools may help to predict the effect of mutations in the spike protein on the binding to the ACE2 receptor and the infectivity of the strain. SARS-CoV-2 may also target several transcription factors and tumour suppressor genes, thus influencing the expression of different host genes and affecting cell signalling. In addition, the virus may interfere with RNA expression in host cells by exploiting endogenous miRNA and its viral RNA. Our analysis showed that numerous human miRNA may form duplexes with different coding and non-coding regions of viral RNA. Polymorphisms in human genes responsible for viral entry and replication, as well as in molecular damage response and inflammatory pathways may also contribute to disease prognosis and outcome. Gene ontology analysis shows that proteins encoded by such polymorphic genes are highly interconnected in regulation of defense response. Thus, virus and host related genetic and epigenetic biomarkers may help to predict the course of the disease and the response to treatment."
"35166834","DNA methylation cues in nucleosome geometry, stability and unwrapping.","Nucleic Acids Res","Cytosine methylation at the 5-carbon position is an essential DNA epigenetic mark in many eukaryotic organisms. Although countless structural and functional studies of cytosine methylation have been reported, our understanding of how it influences the nucleosome assembly, structure, and dynamics remains obscure. Here, we investigate the effects of cytosine methylation at CpG sites on nucleosome dynamics and stability. By applying long molecular dynamics simulations on several microsecond time scale, we generate extensive atomistic conformational ensembles of full nucleosomes. Our results reveal that methylation induces pronounced changes in geometry for both linker and nucleosomal DNA, leading to a more curved, under-twisted DNA, narrowing the adjacent minor grooves, and shifting the population equilibrium of sugar-phosphate backbone geometry. These DNA conformational changes are associated with a considerable enhancement of interactions between methylated DNA and the histone octamer, doubling the number of contacts at some key arginines. H2A and H3 tails play important roles in these interactions, especially for DNA methylated nucleosomes. This, in turn, prevents a spontaneous DNA unwrapping of 3-4 helical turns for the methylated nucleosome with truncated histone tails, otherwise observed in the unmethylated system on several microseconds time scale.Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research 2022."
"35216673","A blood atlas of COVID-19 defines hallmarks of disease severity and specificity.","Cell","Treatment of severe COVID-19 is currently limited by clinical heterogeneity and incomplete description of specific immune biomarkers. We present here a comprehensive multi-omic blood atlas for patients with varying COVID-19 severity in an integrated comparison with influenza and sepsis patients versus healthy volunteers. We identify immune signatures and correlates of host response. Hallmarks of disease severity involved cells, their inflammatory mediators and networks, including progenitor cells and specific myeloid and lymphocyte subsets, features of the immune repertoire, acute phase response, metabolism, and coagulation. Persisting immune activation involving AP-1/p38MAPK was a specific feature of COVID-19. The plasma proteome enabled sub-phenotyping into patient clusters, predictive of severity and outcome. Systems-based integrative analyses including tensor and matrix decomposition of all modalities revealed feature groupings linked with severity and specificity compared to influenza and sepsis.

Cardiopulmonary symptoms including chest pain, shortness of breath, fatigue, and autonomic manifestations such as postural orthostatic tachycardia are common and associated with significant disability, heightened anxiety, and public awareness. A range of cardiovascular (CV) abnormalities has been reported among patients beyond the acute phase and include myocardial inflammation, myocardial infarction, right ventricular dysfunction, and arrhythmias. Pathophysiological mechanisms for delayed complications are still poorly understood, with a dissociation seen between ongoing symptoms and objective measures of cardiopulmonary health. COVID-19 is anticipated to alter the long-term trajectory of many chronic cardiac diseases which are abundant in those at risk of severe disease. In this review, we discuss the definition of long COVID and its epidemiology, with an emphasis on cardiopulmonary symptoms. We further review the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying acute and chronic CV injury, the range of post-acute CV sequelae, and impact of COVID-19 on multiorgan health. We propose a possible model for referral of post-COVID-19 patients to cardiac services and discuss future directions including research priorities and clinical trials that are currently underway to evaluate the efficacy of treatment strategies for long COVID and associated CV sequelae.© The Author(s) 2022.

The relationship between immune cell activation of the peripheral compartment and survival in critical COVID-19 remains to be established. Here we use single-cell RNA sequencing and Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitomes by sequence mapping to elucidate cell type specific transcriptional signatures that associate with and predict survival in critical COVID-19. Patients who survive infection display activation of antibody processing, early activation response, and cell cycle regulation pathways most prominent within B-, T-, and NK-cell subsets. We further leverage cell specific differential gene expression and machine learning to predict mortality using single cell transcriptomes. We identify interferon signaling and antigen presentation pathways within cDC2 cells, CD14 monocytes, and CD16 monocytes as predictors of mortality with 90% accuracy. Finally, we validate our findings in an independent transcriptomics dataset and provide a framework to elucidate mechanisms that promote survival in critically ill COVID-19 patients.

Genetic and transcriptome studies for T1D indicate that a relatively large number of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), detected in both immune cells and β cells, contribute to the underlying inflammation and autoimmune pathology. Although lncRNAs do not encode proteins, their biochemical versatility as RNA molecules enables them to interact with proteins, DNA or RNA to exert regulatory effects on various cellular processes. Recent studies have begun to determine these effects for a small number of lncRNAs in modulating specific immune cell and β-cell responses to elevated glucose levels and pro-inflammatory cytokines that are present within the islets during T1D pathogenesis. These findings are reviewed here and highlight the potential for different lncRNAs to act in concert to inhibit or exacerbate inflammatory and autoimmune responses. Despite this progress to date, additional investigations are required for a more in-depth understanding of their individual functional roles in this interplay, as well as identifying which lncRNAs are likely diagnostic biomarkers or therapeutic targets for autoimmune diseases such as T1D.© 2022.

While fusion detection so far has been from bulk samples, full-length single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) offers the possibility of detecting gene fusions at the single-cell level. However, scRNA-seq data have a high noise level and contain various technical artifacts that can lead to spurious fusion discoveries. Here, we present a computational tool, scFusion, for gene fusion detection based on scRNA-seq. We evaluate the performance of scFusion using simulated and five real scRNA-seq datasets and find that scFusion can efficiently and sensitively detect fusions with a low false discovery rate. In a T cell dataset, scFusion detects the invariant TCR gene recombinations in mucosal-associated invariant T cells that many methods developed for bulk data fail to detect; in a multiple myeloma dataset, scFusion detects the known recurrent fusion IgH-WHSC1, which is associated with overexpression of the WHSC1 oncogene. Our results demonstrate that scFusion can be used to investigate cellular heterogeneity of gene fusions and their transcriptional impact at the single-cell level.© 2022. The Author(s)."

This aspect of mitochondrial biology underlies their putative role in age-associated tissue dysfunction. Proper functioning of the electron transport chain (ETC), which is partially encoded by the extra-nuclear mitochondrial genome (mtDNA), is key to maintaining this energy production. The acquisition ofde novosomatic mutations that interrupt the function of the ETC have long been associated with aging and common diseases of the elderly. Yet, despite over 30 years of study, the exact role(s) mtDNA mutations play in driving aging and its associated pathologies remains under considerable debate. Furthermore, even fundamental aspects of age-related mtDNA mutagenesis, such as when mutations arise during aging, where and how often they occur across tissues, and the specific mechanisms that give rise to them, remain poorly understood. In this review, we address the current understanding of the somatic mtDNA mutations, with an emphasis of when, where, and how these mutations arise during aging. Additionally, we highlight current limitations in our knowledge and critically evaluate the controversies stemming from these limitations.

"35228526","Bacterial N4-methylcytosine as an epigenetic mark in eukaryotic DNA.","Nat Commun","DNA modifications are used to regulate gene expression and defend against invading genetic elements. In eukaryotes, modifications predominantly involve C5-methylcytosine (5mC) and occasionally N6-methyladenine (6mA), while bacteria frequently use N4-methylcytosine (4mC) in addition to 5mC and 6mA. Here we report that 4mC can serve as an epigenetic mark in eukaryotes. Bdelloid rotifers, tiny freshwater invertebrates with transposon-poor genomes rich in foreign genes, lack canonical eukaryotic C5-methyltransferases for 5mC addition, but encode an amino-methyltransferase, N4CMT, captured from bacteria >60 Mya. N4CMT deposits 4mC at active transposons and certain tandem repeats, and fusion to a chromodomain shapes its ""histone-read-DNA-write"" architecture recognizing silent chromatin marks. Furthermore, amplification of SETDB1 H3K9me3 histone methyltransferases yields variants preferentially binding 4mC-DNA, suggesting ""DNA-read-histone-write"" partnership to maintain chromatin-based silencing. Our results show how non-native DNA methyl groups can reshape epigenetic systems to silence transposons and demonstrate the potential of horizontal gene transfer to drive regulatory innovation in eukaryotes.© 2022.

In total, 105 newly diagnosed MM patients treated with thalidomide (n = 27), bortezomib (n = 41) and bortezomib with thalidomide (n = 37) were studied. For miRNA analysis, the column method and the Real-Time PCR technique with specific TaqMan Fast Advanced Master Mix and TaqMan probes were used.

It has been demonstrated that there is a strong association between m6A and viral infection in the human system. The life cycles of plant RNA viruses are often coordinated with the mechanisms of their RNA modification. Here, we reviewed recent advances in m6A methylation in plant viruses. It appears that m6A methylation plays a dual role during viral infection in plants. On the one hand, m6A methylation acts as an antiviral immune response induced by virus infection, which inhibits viral replication or translation through the methylation of viral genome RNAs. On the other hand, plant viruses could disrupt the m6A methylation through interacting with the key proteins of the m6A pathway to avoid modification. Those plant viruses containing ALKB domain are discussed as well. Based on this mechanism, we propose that new strategies for plant virus control could be designed with competitive antagonists of m6A-associated proteins."
