epigenetics,35157611,Ribosomal DNA methylation in human and mouse oocytes increases with age.,Aging (Albany NY),"An age-dependent increase in ribosomal DNA (rDNA) methylation has been observed across a broad spectrum of somatic tissues and the male mammalian germline. Bisulfite pyrosequencing (BPS) was used to determine the methylation levels of the rDNA core promoter and the rDNA upstream control element (UCE) along with two oppositely genomically imprinted control genes (PEG3andGTL2) in individual human germinal vesicle (GV) oocytes from 90 consenting women undergoing fertility treatment because of male infertility. Apart from a few (4%) oocytes with single imprinting defects (in eitherPEG3orGTL2), the analyzed GV oocytes displayed correct imprinting patterns. In 95 GV oocytes from 42 younger women (26-32 years), the mean methylation levels of the rDNA core promoter and UCE were 7.4±4.0% and 9.3±6.1%, respectively. In 79 GV oocytes from 48 older women (33-39 years), methylation levels increased to 9.3±5.3% (P= 0.014) and 11.6±7.4% (P= 0.039), respectively. An age-related increase in oocyte rDNA methylation was also observed in 123 mouse GV oocytes from 29 4-16-months-old animals. Similar to the continuously mitotically dividing male germline, ovarian aging is associated with a gain of rDNA methylation in meiotically arrested oocytes. Oocytes from the same woman can exhibit varying rDNA methylation levels and, by extrapolation, different epigenetic ages."
epigenetics,35166834,"DNA methylation cues in nucleosome geometry, stability and unwrapping.",Nucleic Acids Res,"Cytosine methylation at the 5-carbon position is an essential DNA epigenetic mark in many eukaryotic organisms. Although countless structural and functional studies of cytosine methylation have been reported, our understanding of how it influences the nucleosome assembly, structure, and dynamics remains obscure. Here, we investigate the effects of cytosine methylation at CpG sites on nucleosome dynamics and stability. By applying long molecular dynamics simulations on several microsecond time scale, we generate extensive atomistic conformational ensembles of full nucleosomes. Our results reveal that methylation induces pronounced changes in geometry for both linker and nucleosomal DNA, leading to a more curved, under-twisted DNA, narrowing the adjacent minor grooves, and shifting the population equilibrium of sugar-phosphate backbone geometry. These DNA conformational changes are associated with a considerable enhancement of interactions between methylated DNA and the histone octamer, doubling the number of contacts at some key arginines. H2A and H3 tails play important roles in these interactions, especially for DNA methylated nucleosomes. This, in turn, prevents a spontaneous DNA unwrapping of 3-4 helical turns for the methylated nucleosome with truncated histone tails, otherwise observed in the unmethylated system on several microseconds time scale.Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research 2022."
methods,35245419,Sparse latent factor regression models for genome-wide and epigenome-wide association studies.,Stat Appl Genet Mol Biol,"Association of phenotypes or exposures with genomic and epigenomic data faces important statistical challenges. One of these challenges is to account for variation due to unobserved confounding factors, such as individual ancestry or cell-type composition in tissues. This issue can be addressed with penalized latent factor regression models, where penalties are introduced to cope with high dimension in the data. If a relatively small proportion of genomic or epigenomic markers correlate with the variable of interest, sparsity penalties may help to capture the relevant associations, but the improvement over non-sparse approaches has not been fully evaluated yet. Here, we present least-squares algorithms that jointly estimate effect sizes and confounding factors in sparse latent factor regression models. In simulated data, sparse latent factor regression models generally achieved higher statistical performance than other sparse methods, including the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator and a Bayesian sparse linear mixed model. In generative model simulations, statistical performance was slightly lower (while being comparable) to non-sparse methods, but in simulations based on empirical data, sparse latent factor regression models were more robust to departure from the model than the non-sparse approaches. We applied sparse latent factor regression models to a genome-wide association study of a flowering trait for the plantArabidopsis thalianaand to an epigenome-wide association study of smoking status in pregnant women. For both applications, sparse latent factor regression models facilitated the estimation of non-null effect sizes while overcoming multiple testing issues. The results were not only consistent with previous discoveries, but they also pinpointed new genes with functional annotations relevant to each application.© 2022 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston."

omics,35241783,Genetically regulated multi-omics study for symptom clusters of posttraumatic stress disorder highlights pleiotropy with hematologic and cardio-metabolic traits.,Mol Psychiatry,"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric disorder that may arise in response to severe traumatic event and is diagnosed based on three main symptom clusters (reexperiencing, avoidance, and hyperarousal) per the Diagnostic Manual of Mental Disorders (version DSM-IV-TR). In this study, we characterized the biological heterogeneity of PTSD symptom clusters by performing a multi-omics investigation integrating genetically regulated gene, splicing, and protein expression in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex tissue within a sample of US veterans enrolled in the Million Veteran Program (Ntotal = 186,689). We identified 30 genes in 19 regions across the three PTSD symptom clusters. We found nine genes to have cell-type specific expression, and over-representation of miRNA-families - miR-148, 30, and 8. Gene-drug target prioritization approach highlighted cyclooxygenase and acetylcholine compounds. Next, we tested molecular-profile based phenome-wide impact of identified genes with respect to 1678 phenotypes derived from the Electronic Health Records of the Vanderbilt University biorepository (N = 70,439). Lastly, we tested for local genetic correlation across PTSD symptom clusters which highlighted metabolic (e.g., obesity, diabetes, vascular health) and laboratory traits (e.g., neutrophil, eosinophil, tau protein, creatinine kinase). Overall, this study finds comprehensive genomic evidence including clinical and regulatory profiles between PTSD, hematologic and cardiometabolic traits, that support comorbidities observed in epidemiologic studies of PTSD.© 2022.
