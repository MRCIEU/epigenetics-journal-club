"35051273","The role of DNA methylation in genome-wide gene regulation during development.","Development","Although it is well known that DNA methylation serves to repress gene expression, precisely how it functions during the process of development remains unclear. Here, we propose that the overall pattern of DNA methylation established in the early embryo serves as a sophisticated mechanism for maintaining a genome-wide network of gene regulatory elements in an inaccessible chromatin structure throughout the body. As development progresses, programmed demethylation in each cell type then provides the specificity for maintaining select elements in an open structure. This allows these regulatory elements to interact with a large range of transcription factors and thereby regulate the gene expression profiles that define cell identity.© 2022.

"35050078","DNA Methylation Changes and Its Associated Genes in Mulberry (<i>Morus alba</i> L.) Yu-711 Response to Drought Stress Using MethylRAD Sequencing.","Plants (Basel)","Drought stress remains one of the most detrimental environmental cues affecting plant growth and survival. In this work, the DNA methylome changes in mulberry leaves under drought stress (EG) and control (CK) and their impact on gene regulation were investigated by MethylRAD sequencing. The results show 138,464 (37.37%) and 56,241 (28.81%) methylation at the CG and CWG sites (W = A or T), respectively, in the mulberry genome between drought stress and control. The distribution of the methylome was prevalent in the intergenic, exonic, intronic and downstream regions of the mulberry plant genome. In addition, we discovered 170 DMGs (129 in CG sites and 41 in CWG sites) and 581 DMS (413 in CG sites and 168 in CWG sites). Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis indicates that phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, spliceosome, amino acid biosynthesis, carbon metabolism, RNA transport, plant hormone, signal transduction pathways, and quorum sensing play a crucial role in mulberry response to drought stress. Furthermore, the qRT-PCR analysis indicates that the selected 23 genes enriched in the KEGG pathways are differentially expressed, and 86.96% of the genes share downregulated methylation and 13.04% share upregulation methylation status, indicating the complex link between DNA methylation and gene regulation. This study serves as fundamentals in discovering the epigenomic status and the pathways that will significantly enhance mulberry breeding for adaptation to a wide range of environments."
"35047830","An activating germline <i>IDH1</i> variant associated with a tumor entity characterized by unilateral and bilateral chondrosarcoma of the mastoid.","HGG Adv","Chondrogenic tumors involving the temporal bone are rare and typically arise spontaneously with unilateral presentation. SomaticIDHmutations are common in these tumors, but germline inheritance has not been documented to our knowledge. We describe familial chondrosarcoma, grade 1, of the mastoid with unilateral presentation in the mother and bilateral presentation in each of her two children. Each individual presented with headaches, facial paresis, and conductive hearing loss between the ages of 9-12. Exome sequencing of all three affected family members identified a shared germline heterozygous c.299G>A (p.Arg100Gln) missense variant inIDH1. The p.Arg100Gln variant has only rarely been observed as a somatic mutation in glial tumors, and previousin vitroexperiments have shown that p.Arg100Gln produces small amounts of the oncometabolite D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D2HG). Biochemical testing in all three affected family members on urine and plasma was unable to detect increases in D2HG in these sample types. Due to insufficient tumor for methylation studies, we performed genome-wide methylation analysis of anIDH1p.Arg100Gln mutant brain tumor from an unrelated individual to functionally evaluate this variant. These studies demonstrated a global hypermethylation phenotype consistent with other known isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutant brain tumors, suggesting that this variant has neomorphic activity despite low-level production of D2HG. The bones of the facial skeleton are formed by membranous ossification and we hypothesize that abnormal embryonic cartilage that rests within the suture lines may be involved in this tumor entity. Testing of additional individuals with similar presentations is needed to confirm this finding and clarify the associated phenotypes.© 2020."
"35047011","Using Machine Learning to Predict Obesity Based on Genome-Wide and Epigenome-Wide Gene-Gene and Gene-Diet Interactions.","Front Genet","Obesity is associated with many chronic diseases that impair healthy aging and is governed by genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors and their complex interactions. This study aimed to develop a model that predicts an individual's risk of obesity by better characterizing these complex relations and interactions focusing on dietary factors. For this purpose, we conducted a combined genome-wide and epigenome-wide scan for body mass index (BMI) and up to three-way interactions among 402,793 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 415,202 DNA methylation sites (DMSs), and 397 dietary and lifestyle factors using the generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction (GMDR) method. The training set consisted of 1,573 participants in exam 8 of the Framingham Offspring Study (FOS) cohort. After identifying genetic, epigenetic, and dietary factors that passed statistical significance, we applied machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict participants' obesity status in the test set, taken as a subset of independent samples (n = 394) from the same cohort. The quality and accuracy of prediction models were evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC). GMDR identified 213 SNPs, 530 DMSs, and 49 dietary and lifestyle factors as significant predictors of obesity. Comparing several ML algorithms, we found that the stochastic gradient boosting model provided the best prediction accuracy for obesity with an overall accuracy of 70%, with ROC-AUC of 0.72 in test set samples. Top predictors of the best-fit model were 21 SNPs, 230 DMSs in genes such asCPT1A,ABCG1,SLC7A11,RNF145, andSREBF1, and 26 dietary factors, including processed meat, diet soda, French fries, high-fat dairy, artificial sweeteners, alcohol intake, and specific nutrients and food components, such as calcium and flavonols. In conclusion, we developed an integrated approach with ML to predict obesity using omics and dietary data. This extends our knowledge of the drivers of obesity, which can inform precision nutrition strategies for the prevention and treatment of obesity.Clinical Trial Registration:[www.ClinicalTrials.gov], the Framingham Heart Study (FHS), [NCT00005121].Copyright © 2022 Lee, Christensen, Parnell, Smith, Shao, McKeown, Ordovás and Lai."

However, epigenetic changes in neonates born to mothers with GDM diagnosed before 24 gestational weeks (early GDM (E-GDM)) have not been reported. We investigated DNA methylation in neonates born to mothers with E-GDM using cord blood samples.Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis was performed using an Illumina EPIC array to compare methylation rates of 754 255 autosomal sites in cord blood samples from term neonates born to 162 mothers with GDM (E-GDM: n=84, L-GDM: n=78) and 60 normal glucose tolerance (normal OGTT) pregnancies. GDM was diagnosed based on Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology criteria modified with International Association of Diabetes in Pregnancy Study Group criteria. In this study, all GDM mothers underwent dietary management, while self-monitoring of blood glucose and insulin administration was initiated when dietary modification did not achieve glycemic control.There were no significant differences in genome-wide DNA methylation of cord blood samples between the GDM (E-GDM and L-GDM) groups and normal OGTT group or between the E-GDM and normal OGTT groups, L-GDM and normal OGTT groups, and E-GDM and L-GDM groups.This is the first report to determine the DNA methylation patterns in neonates born to mothers with E-GDM. Neonates born to mothers with GDM, who were diagnosed based on Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology criteria, may not differ in DNA methylation compared with those born to normal OGTT mothers.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022.

"35045206","DNA methylation signatures in Blood DNA of Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria syndrome.","Aging Cell","Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS) is an extremely rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the LMNA gene and characterized by premature and accelerated aging beginning in childhood. In this study, we performed the first genome-wide methylation analysis on blood DNA of 15 patients with progeroid laminopathies using Infinium Methylation EPIC arrays including 8 patients with classical HGPS. We could observe DNA methylation alterations at 61 CpG sites as well as 32 significant regions following a 5 Kb tiling analysis. Differentially methylated probes were enriched for phosphatidylinositol biosynthetic process, phospholipid biosynthetic process, sarcoplasm, sarcoplasmic reticulum, phosphatase regulator activity, glycerolipid biosynthetic process, glycerophospholipid biosynthetic process, and phosphatidylinositol metabolic process. Differential methylation analysis at the level of promoters and CpG islands revealed no significant methylation changes in blood DNA of progeroid laminopathy patients. Nevertheless, we could observe significant methylation differences in classic HGPS when specifically looking at probes overlapping solo-WCGW partially methylated domains. Comparing aberrantly methylated sites in progeroid laminopathies, classic Werner syndrome, and Down syndrome revealed a common significantly hypermethylated region in close vicinity to the transcription start site of a long non-coding RNA located anti-sense to the Catenin Beta Interacting Protein 1 gene (CTNNBIP1). By characterizing epigenetically altered sites, we identify possible pathways/mechanisms that might have a role in the accelerated aging of progeroid laminopathies.© 2022 The Authors.

"35045165","Polycomb Proteins Control Floral Determinacy by H3K27me3-mediated Repression of Pluripotency Genes in Arabidopsis thaliana.","J Exp Bot","Polycomb group (PcG) protein-mediated histone methylation (H3K27me3) controls the correct spatiotemporal expression of numerous developmental regulators in Arabidopsis. Epigenetic silencing of the stem cell factor WUS in floral meristems (FMs) depends on H3K27me3 deposition by PcG proteins. However, the role of H3K27me3 in silencing of other meristematic regulator and pluripotency genes during FM determinacy has not yet been studied. To this end, we report the genome-wide dynamics of H3K27me3 levels during FM arrest and the consequences of strongly depleted PcG activity on early flower morphogenesis including enlarged and indeterminate FMs. Strong depletion of H3K27me3 levels results in misexpression of the FM identity gene AGL24, which partially leads to floral reversion causing ap1-like flowers and indeterminate FMs expressing ectopically WUS and STM. Loss of STM can rescue supernumerary floral organs and FM indeterminacy in H3K27me3-deficient flowers indicating that the hyperactivity of the FMs is at least partially a result of ectopic STM expression. Nonetheless, WUS remained essential for the FM activity. Our results demonstrate that PcG proteins promote FM determinacy at multi-levels of the floral gene regulatory network, silencing initially floral regulators like AGL24 that promotes FM indeterminacy, and subsequently, meristematic pluripotency genes such as WUS and STM during FM arrest.© The Author(s) 2022.

"35043535","The utility of DNA methylation signatures in directing genome sequencing workflow: Kabuki syndrome and CDK13-related disorder.","Am J Med Genet A","Kabuki syndrome (KS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by hypotonia, intellectual disability, skeletal anomalies, and postnatal growth restriction. The characteristic facial appearance is not pathognomonic for KS as several other conditions demonstrate overlapping features. For 20-30% of children with a clinical diagnosis of KS, no causal variant is identified by conventional genetic testing of the two associated genes, KMT2D and KDM6A. Here, we describe two cases of suspected KS that met clinical diagnostic criteria and had a high gestalt match on the artificial intelligence platform Face2Gene. Although initial KS testing was negative, genome-wide DNA methylation (DNAm) was instrumental in guiding genome sequencing workflow to establish definitive molecular diagnoses. In one case, a positive DNAm signature for KMT2D led to the identification of a cryptic variant in KDM6A by genome sequencing; for the other case, a DNAm signature different from KS led to the detection of another diagnosis in the KS differential, CDK13-related disorder. This approach illustrates the clinical utility of DNAm signatures in the diagnostic workflow for the genome analyst or clinical geneticist-especially for disorders with overlapping clinical phenotypes.© 2022 The Authors.

"35042054","Genome-wide lone strand adenine methylation in Deinococcus radiodurans R1: Regulation of gene expression through DR0643-dependent adenine methylation.","Microbiol Res","DNA methylation is a covalent modification of adenine or cytosine in the genome of an organism and is found in diverse microbes including the radiation resistant bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans R1. Although earlier findings have confirmed repression or de-repression of certain genes in adenine methyltransferase (DR_0643/Dam1DR) deficient D. radiodurans mutant however, the overall regulatory aspects of Dam1DR-mediated adenine methylation remain mostly unexplored. In the present study, we compared the genome-wide methylome and the corresponding transcriptome of D. radiodurans WT and Δdam1 mutant to explore the correlation between methylation and gene expression. In D. radiodurans, deletion of DR_0643 ORF (Δdam1) led to hypomethylation of 512 genes resulting in differential expression of 168 genes (99 genes are upregulated and 69 genes are downregulated). The modification patterns deduced for Dam1DR(DR_0643) and Dam2DR(DR_2267) were non-palindromic and atypical. Moreover, we observed methylation at opportunistic sites that show adenine methylation only in D. radiodurans Δdam1 and not in D. radiodurans WT. Correlation between the methylome and transcriptome suggests that hypomethylation at Dam1DRspecific sites had both negative as well as a positive effects on gene expression. Pathways such as amino acid metabolism, transport, oxidative phosphorylation, quorum sensing, signal transduction, two-component system, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, TCA cycle, glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism were modulated by Dam1DR-mediated adenine methylation in D. radiodurans. Processes such as DNA repair, recombination, ATPase and transmembrane transporter activity were enriched when Dam1DRmutant was subjected to radiation stress. We further evaluated the molecular interactions and mode of binding between Dam1DRprotein and S-adenosyl methionine using molecular docking followed by MD simulation. To get a better insight into the methylation mechanism, the Dam1DR-SAM complex was also docked with a DNA molecule to elucidate DNA-Dam1DRstructural interaction during methyl-group transfer reaction. In summary, our work presents comprehensive and integrative approaches to investigate both functional and structural aspects of DNA adenine methyltransferase (Dam1DR) in D. radiodurans biology.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier GmbH.

"35041105","Genome-Wide Differential DNA Methylomes Provide Insights into the Infertility of Triploid Oysters.","Mar Biotechnol (NY)","Chromosomal incompatibility and gene expression changes would affect the development of polyploid gonad and gamete formation. The role of epigenetics like DNA methylation in reproductive development is fully demonstrated in diploid animals. The lack of polyploid species and the infertility of polyploid animals, especially the odd ploidy, limit the study of epigenetic regulation mechanism of polyploid reproduction. Fertile and infertile individuals exist in triploid Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas, which provide an interesting model for studies on the effect of epigenetic regulation on gonadal development. The whole genome single base resolution DNA methylomes in gonads of triploid females α (F-3nα), triploid females β (F-3nβ), triploid males α (M-3nα), triploid hermaphrodite predominantly males (HPM-3n), diploid females (F-2n), and diploid males (M-2n) were generated by using bisulfite-sequencing. The overall DNA methylation profiles in gene regions and transposable regions of fertile and infertile triploid oysters were consistent with those of diploid oysters. The DNA methylation level of CG context decreased in infertile triploid oysters, with more hypomethylated than hypermethylated regions, and the opposite is true in fertile triploid oysters. Genes harbored with differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in infertile triploids were mainly related to the metabolism pathways and the signal pathways. Correlation analysis indicated that the expression of gene transcriptions was generally positively associated with DNA methylation in gene body regions, and DMRs in infertile triploid oysters played significant roles in gonadal development as a possible critical epigenetic regulator of gonadal development gene transcriptional activity. These findings indicate a potential relationship between DNA methylation variability and gene expression plasticity in newly formed polyploidy. As far as we know, this is the first study revealing the epigenetic regulation of gonadal development in invertebrates based on fertile and infertile models, meanwhile providing a new mentality to explore the regulatory mechanisms of infertility in triploids.© 2021.

We aimed to develop DNA methylation markers that recapitulate the densities of TILs in gastric carcinoma (GC). Through genome-wide methylation profiling, NCOR2, PARK2, and ZSCAN12 were found to be highly methylated in CD3-positive and CD8-positive cells and rarely methylated in tumor cells. Scores of the three methylation markers were analyzed for their relationship with the overall survival and recurrence-free survival of patients with advanced GC (n = 471). The scores of three methylation markers were closely associated with densities of CD3-positive or CD8-positive cells at the tumor center or invasive front of GCs and found to be a significant prognostic factor in univariate analysis of overall survival and recurrence-free survival. In multivariate analysis, the highest score showed hazard ratios of 0.513 (CI 0.306-0.857) and 0.434 (CI 0.261-0.720) for overall survival and recurrence-free survival, respectively. The findings suggest that methylation markers signifying TILs might be utilized for the recapitulation of TIL density in GCs and serve as biomarkers for predicting prognosis in patients with GC.© 2022.

This study aims to explore the potential underlying mechanism of such toxic effects by integrating DNA methylation and gene expression profiles.In this study, C28/I2 chondrocytes were treated with T-2 toxin (5 ng/mL) for 24 h and 72 h. Global DNA methylation level of chondrocyte was tested by Enzyme-Linked Immuno Sorbent Assay. Genome-wide DNA methylation and expression profiles were detected using Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation850 BeadChip and RNA-seq technique, respectively. Differentially methylated genes (DMGs) and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified mainly for two stages including 24 h group versus Control group and 72 h group versus 24 h group. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analyses were performed by Metascape. DMGs and DEGs were further validated by Sequenom MassARRAY system and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.The global DNA methylation levels of chondrocytes exposed to T-2 toxin were significantly increased (P < 0.05). For 24 h group versus Control group (24 VS C), 189 DEGs and 590 DMGs were identified, and 4 of them were overlapping. For 72 h group versus 24 h group (72 VS 24), 1671 DEGs and 637 DMGs were identified, and 45 of them were overlapping. The enrichment analysis results of DMGs and DEGs both showed that MAPK was the one of the mainly involved signaling pathways in the regulation of chondrocytes after T-2 toxin exposure (DEGs: P24VSc = 1.62 × 10- 7; P72VS24 = 1.20 × 10- 7; DMGs: P24VSc = 0.0056; P72VS24 = 3.80 × 10- 5).The findings depicted a landscape of genomic methylation and transcriptome changes of chondrocytes after T-2 toxin exposure and suggested that dysfunction of MAPK pathway may play important roles in the chondrocytes damage induced by T-2 toxin, which could provide new clues for understanding the potential biological mechanism of KBD cartilage damage induced by T-2 toxin.© 2022.

"35037016","Comethyl: a network-based methylome approach to investigate the multivariate nature of health and disease.","Brief Bioinform","Health outcomes are frequently shaped by difficult to dissect inter-relationships between biological, behavioral, social and environmental factors. DNA methylation patterns reflect such multivariate intersections, providing a rich source of novel biomarkers and insight into disease etiologies. Recent advances in whole-genome bisulfite sequencing enable investigation of DNA methylation over all genomic CpGs, but existing bioinformatic approaches lack accessible system-level tools. Here, we develop the R package Comethyl, for weighted gene correlation network analysis of user-defined genomic regions that generates modules of comethylated regions, which are then tested for correlations with multivariate sample traits. First, regions are defined by CpG genomic location or regulatory annotation and filtered based on CpG count, sequencing depth and variability. Next, correlation networks are used to find modules of interconnected nodes using methylation values within the selected regions. Each module containing multiple comethylated regions is reduced in complexity to a single eigennode value, which is then tested for correlations with experimental metadata. Comethyl has the ability to cover the noncoding regulatory regions of the genome with high relevance to interpretation of genome-wide association studies and integration with other types of epigenomic data. We demonstrate the utility of Comethyl on a dataset of male cord blood samples from newborns later diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) versus typical development. Comethyl successfully identified an ASD-associated module containing regions mapped to genes enriched for brain glial functions. Comethyl is expected to be useful in uncovering the multivariate nature of health disparities for a variety of common disorders.

"35036834","Differential DNA Methylation by Hispanic Ethnicity Among Firefighters in the United States.","Epigenet Insights","Firefighters are exposed to a variety of environmental hazards and are at increased risk for multiple cancers. There is evidence that risks differ by ethnicity, yet the biological or environmental differences underlying these differences are not known. DNA methylation is one type of epigenetic regulation that is altered in cancers. In this pilot study, we profiled DNA methylation with the Infinium MethylationEPIC in blood leukocytes from 31 Hispanic white and 163 non-Hispanic white firefighters. We compared DNA methylation (1) at 12 xenobiotic metabolizing genes and (2) at all loci on the array (>740 000), adjusting for confounders. Five of the xenobiotic metabolizing genes were differentially methylated at a rawP-value <.05 when comparing the 2 ethnic groups, yet were not statistically significant at a 5% false discovery rate (q-value <.05). In the epigenome-wide analysis, 76 loci exhibited DNA methylation differences atq < .05. Among these, 3 CpG sites in the promoter region of the biotransformation geneSULT1C2had lower methylation in Hispanic compared to non-Hispanic firefighters. Other differentially methylated loci included genes that have been implicated in carcinogenesis in published studies (FOXK2, GYLTL1B, ZBTB16, ARHGEF10, and more). In this pilot study, we report differential DNA methylation between Hispanic and non-Hispanic firefighters in xenobiotic metabolism genes and other genes with functions related to cancer. Epigenetic susceptibility by ethnicity merits further study as this may alter risk for cancers linked to toxic exposures.© The Author(s) 2021."

Mice were divided randomly into DA model, rosiglitazone, as well as low-, medium-, and high-dose YQHX groups. Ten healthy C57BL/6J mice were the control group. Serum levels of fasting insulin, blood glucose, homeostasis model-insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR), serum lipids, and inflammatory factors were analyzed after the final treatment. Aorta tissues were collected for staining (hematoxylin and eosin, and Oil red O). Genomic DNA was extracted for methyl-capture sequencing (MC-seq). Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING) databases were used to analyze differentially methylated genes. Pyrosequencing was used to verify MC-seq data.Low-dose and high-dose YQHX could reduce the HOMA-IR (P< 0.05). Low-dose YQHX reduced expression of total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), TNF-α, andI L-6 in serum compared with that in the model group (P< 0.05). Medium-dose YQHX decoction inhibited the expression level of TNF-α (P< 0.05). High-dose YQHX decreased the expression level of IL-6 (P< 0.05). Staining also showed the anti-atherosclerosis effects of YQHX (P< 0.05). MC-seq revealed many abnormally hypermethylated and hypomethylated genes in DA mice compared with those in the control group. KEGG database analysis showed that the hypermethylated genes induced by YQHX treatment were related to pathways in cancer, Hippo signaling, and mitogen activated protein kinase. The network analysis suggested that the hypermethylated genes epidermal growth factor receptor(Egfr) and phosphoinositide-3-kinase regulatory subunit 1(Pik3r1) induced by YQHX treatment had important roles in DA. Pyrosequencing revealed that YQHX treatment increased methylation ofAKT1, Nr1h3andFabp4significantly (P< 0.05).YQHX decoction had positive treatment effects against DA, because it could regulate aberrant hypomethylation of DNA.© 2022 Zhou et al."

Here, we aimed to identify DNA methylation patterns associated with lung function in pediatric asthma among Latinos.We conducted an EWAS in whole blood from 250 Puerto Rican and 148 Mexican American children and young adults with asthma. A total of five CpGs exceeded the genome-wide significance threshold of p = 1.17 × 10-7in the combined analyses from Puerto Ricans and Mexican Americans: cg06035600 (MAP3K6, p = 6.13 × 10-8) showed significant association with pre-bronchodilator Tiffeneau-Pinelli index, the probes cg00914963 (TBC1D16, p = 1.04 × 10-7), cg16405908 (MRGPRE, p = 2.05 × 10-8), and cg07428101 (MUC2, p = 5.02 × 10-9) were associated with post-bronchodilator forced vital capacity (FVC), and cg20515679 (KCNJ6) with post-bronchodilator Tiffeneau-Pinelli index (p = 1.13 × 10-8). However, these markers did not show significant associations in publicly available data from Europeans (p > 0.05). A methylation quantitative trait loci analysis revealed that methylation levels at these CpG sites were regulated by genetic variation in Latinos and the Biobank-based Integrative Omics Studies (BIOS) consortium. Additionally, two differentially methylated regions in REXOC and AURKC were associated with pre-bronchodilator Tiffeneau-Pinelli index (adjusted p < 0.05) in Puerto Ricans and Mexican Americans. Moreover, we replicated some of the previous differentially methylated signals associated with lung function in non-Latino populations.We replicated previous associations of epigenetic markers with lung function in whole blood and identified novel population-specific associations shared among Latino subgroups.© 2022.

Although aberrant DNA methylation is induced by HPG and the level correlates with the risk of gastric cancer, DNA methylation induction by AIG is unknown.Gastric mucosa samples from the corpus were collected from 12 people with AIG without H. pylori infection, 10 people with HPG, and eight healthy volunteers. Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis was conducted using Infinium Methylation EPIC array. Gene expression was analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR.The AIG samples had extensive aberrant DNA methylation but presented unique methylation profiles against the HPG samples after correction of leucocyte fractions. Comparison between the AIG and HPG samples showed that AIG induced methylation, but less than HPG, in overall CpG sites and also in promoter CpG islands. Promoter CpG islands of tumor-suppressor genes in the pathway of cell cycle, cell adhesion, p53, and WNT were highly methylated in the AIG samples, but more so in the HPG samples. The expression levels of IL1B and IL8, secreted by macrophage, were significantly lower in the AIG samples than in the HPG samples, suggesting that a difference in inflammatory response affected the degree and patterns of aberrant DNA methylation.AIG induced aberrant DNA methylation in gastric mucosa. However, the degree of DNA methylation was less than that by HPG, which reflected carcinogenic risk.© 2022. Japanese Society of Gastroenterology."
"35033534","Methyl-lysine readers PHF20 and PHF20L1 define two distinct gene expression-regulating NSL complexes.","J Biol Chem","The methyl lysine readers PHF (plant homeodomain finger) 20 (PHF20) and its homolog PHF20-Like 1 (PHF20L1) are known components of the NSL (non-specific lethal) complex that regulates gene expression through its histone acetyltransferase activity. In the current model, both PHF homologs coexist in the same NSL complex, although this was not formally tested; nor have the functions of PHF20 and PHF20L1 regarding NSL complex integrity and transcriptional regulation been investigated. Here we perform an in-depth biochemical and functional characterization of PHF20 and PHF20L1 in the context of the NSL complex. Using mass spectrometry, genome-wide chromatin analysis and protein-domain mapping, we identify the existence of two distinct NSL complexes that exclusively contain either PHF20 or PHF20L1. We show that the C-terminal domains of PHF20 and PHF20L1 are essential for complex formation with NSL, and the Tudor 2 domains are required for chromatin binding. The genome-wide chromatin landscape of PHF20/PHF20L1 shows that these proteins bind mostly to the same genomic regions, at promoters of highly expressed/housekeeping genes. Yet, deletion of PHF20 and PHF20L1 does not abrogate gene expression or impact the recruitment of the NSL complex to those target gene promoters, suggesting the existence of an alternative mechanism that compensates for the transcription of genes whose sustained expression is important for critical cellular functions. This work shifts the current paradigm and lays the foundation for studies on the differential roles of PHF20 and PHF20L1 in regulating NSL complex activity in physiological and diseases states.Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

"35032864","Pregnancy exposure to phthalates and DNA methylation in male placenta - An epigenome-wide association study.","Environ Int","Exposure to phthalates during pregnancy may alter DNA methylation in the placenta, a crucial organ for the growth and development of the fetus.We studied associations between urinary concentrations of phthalate biomarkers during pregnancy and placental DNA methylation.We measured concentrations of 11 phthalate metabolites in maternal spot urine samples collected between 22 and 29 gestational weeks in 202 pregnant women. We analyzed DNA methylation levels in placental tissue (fetal side) collected at delivery. We first investigated changes in global DNA methylation of repetitive elements Alu and LINE-1. We then performed an adjusted epigenome-wide association study using IlluminaHM450 BeadChips and identified differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with phthalate exposure.Monobenzyl phthalate concentration was inversely associated with placental methylation of Alu repeats. Moreover, all phthalate biomarkers except for monocarboxy-iso-octyl phthalate and mono(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate were associated with at least one DMR. All but three DMRs showed increased DNA methylation with increased phthalate exposure. The largest identified DMR (22 CpGs) was positively associated with monocarboxy-iso-nonyl phthalate and encompassed heat shock proteins (HSPA1A, HSPA1L). The remaining DMRs encompassed transcription factors and nucleotide exchange factors, among other genes.This is the first description of genome-wide modifications of placental DNA methylation in association with pregnancy exposure to phthalates. Our results suggest epigenetic mechanisms by which exposure to these compounds could affect fetal development. Of interest, four identified DMRs had been previously associated with maternal smoking, which may suggest particular sensitivity of these genomic regions to the effect of environmental contaminants.Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

Conversely, the molecular underpinnings of the rare juvenile granulosa cell tumor (JGCT) have not been well elucidated. To this end, we applied a tumor-only integrated approach to investigate the genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenomic landscape of 31 JGCTs to identify putative oncogenic drivers.Multipronged analyses of 31 JGCTs were performed utilizing a clinically validated next-generation sequencing (NGS)-panel targeting 580 cancer-related genes for genomic interrogation, in addition to targeted RNA NGS for transcriptomic exploration. Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling was conducted using an Infinium Methylation EPIC array targeting 866,562 CpG methylation sites.We identified frequentKMT2C-truncating mutations along with other mutated genes implicated in the switch/sucrose nonfermentable (SWI/SNF) chromatin remodeling complex, in addition to previously reported hotspotAKT1andDICER1mutations. Targeted transcriptome sequencing revealed recurrentTERTrearrangements (13%) involving partnersCLPTM1LorDROSHA, and differential gene expression analysis showedFGFR1upregulation in theTERTnon-rearranged JGCTs under direct promoter control. Genome-wide DNA methylation rendered a clear delineation between AGCTs and JGCTs at the epigenomic level further supporting its diagnostic utility in distinguishing among these tumors.This is the largest comprehensive molecular study of JGCTs, where we further expand our current understanding of JGCT pathogenesis and demonstrate putative oncogenic drivers andTERTrearrangements in a subset of tumors.

"35031073","Functional genomics analysis identifies T and NK cell activation as a driver of epigenetic clock progression.","Genome Biol","Epigenetic clocks use DNA methylation (DNAm) levels of specific sets of CpG dinucleotides to accurately predict individual chronological age. A popular application of these clocks is to explore whether the deviation of predicted age from chronological age is associated with disease phenotypes, where this deviation is interpreted as a potential biomarker of biological age. This wide application, however, contrasts with the limited insight in the processes that may drive the running of epigenetic clocks.We perform a functional genomics analysis on four epigenetic clocks, including Hannum's blood predictor and Horvath's multi-tissue predictor, using blood DNA methylome and transcriptome data from 3132 individuals. The four clocks result in similar predictions of individual chronological age, and their constituting CpGs are correlated in DNAm level and are enriched for similar histone modifications and chromatin states. Interestingly, DNAm levels of CpGs from the clocks are commonly associated with gene expression in trans. The gene sets involved are highly overlapping and enriched for T cell processes. Further analysis of the transcriptome and methylome of sorted blood cell types identifies differences in DNAm between naive and activated T and NK cells as a probable contributor to the clocks. Indeed, within the same donor, the four epigenetic clocks predict naive cells to be up to 40 years younger than activated cells.The ability of epigenetic clocks to predict chronological age involves their ability to detect changes in proportions of naive and activated immune blood cells, an established feature of immuno-senescence. This finding may contribute to the interpretation of associations between clock-derived measures and age-related health outcomes.© 2022. The Author(s)."

To fill in this gap, we conducted an integrative two-phase epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of PanC using genomic DNA from 44 cases and 556 controls (20 local controls and 536 public controls in the Framingham Heart Study) in phase 1 and 23 cases and 22 controls in phase 2. We validated the findings using pre-diagnostic blood samples from 13 cases and 26 controls in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) Study. We further examined gene expression in peripheral leukocytes of 47 cases and 31 controls involved in the methylation study using RNA sequencing and performed bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis using existing single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data. In phase 1, we identified 2776 significantly differentially methylated CpG sites (DMPs) and 154 significantly differentially methylated regions (DMRs). In phase 2, we validated six DMPs (in or nearAIM2, DGKA, STK39, andTNFSF8) and three DMRs (in or nearnc886, LY6G5C, andHLA-DPB1). The DMR nearnc886was further validated in the WHI samples (P = 6.69 × 10-5). MR analysis suggested that the CpG sites cg00308130 and cg16684184 fornc886and cg16875057 forSTK39were causally related to PanC susceptibility and that PanC influenced methylation of cg15354065 forDGKA. This first integrative EWAS of PanC provides novel insights into the role of DNA methylation and its interplay with SNPs and gene expression in the disease susceptibility."

"35028889","Decreased DNA Methylation of RGMA is Associated with Intracranial Hypertension After Severe Traumatic Brain Injury: An Exploratory Epigenome-Wide Association Study.","Neurocrit Care","Cerebral edema and intracranial hypertension are major contributors to unfavorable prognosis in traumatic brain injury (TBI). Local epigenetic changes, particularly in DNA methylation, may influence gene expression and thus host response/secondary injury after TBI. It remains unknown whether DNA methylation in the central nervous system is associated with cerebral edema severity or intracranial hypertension post TBI. We sought to identify epigenome-wide DNA methylation patterns associated with these forms of secondary injury after TBI.We obtained genome-wide DNA methylation profiles of DNA extracted from ventricular cerebrospinal fluid samples at three different postinjury time points from a prospective cohort of patients with severe TBI (n = 89 patients, 254 samples). Cerebral edema and intracranial pressure (ICP) measures were clustered to generate composite end points of cerebral edema and ICP severity. We performed an unbiased epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) to test associations between DNA methylation at 419,895 cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites and cerebral edema/ICP severity categories. Given inflated p values, we conducted permutation tests for top CpG sites to filter out potential false discoveries.Our data-driven hierarchical clustering across six cerebral edema and ICP measures identified two groups differing significantly in ICP based on the EWAS-identified CpG site cg22111818 in RGMA (Repulsive guidance molecule A, permutation p = 4.20 × 10-8). At 3-4 days post TBI, patients with severe intracranial hypertension had significantly lower levels of methylation at cg22111818.We report a novel potential relationship between intracranial hypertension after TBI and an acute, nonsustained reduction in DNA methylation at cg22111818 in the RGMA gene. To our knowledge, this is the largest EWAS in severe TBI. Our findings are further strengthened by previous findings that RGMA modulates axonal repair in other central nervous system disorders, but a role in intracranial hypertension or TBI has not been previously identified. Additional work is warranted to validate and extend these findings, including assessment of its possible role in risk stratification, identification of novel druggable targets, and ultimately our ability to personalize therapy in TBI.© 2022.

To provide insight into the molecular regulation of S100β and its potential causal associations with Alzheimer's disease, we carried out genome- and epigenome-wide association studies (GWAS/EWAS) of serum S100β levels in older adults and performed Mendelian randomisation with Alzheimer's disease.Methods:GWAS (N=769, mean age 72.5 years, sd = 0.7) and EWAS (N=722, mean age 72.5 years, sd = 0.7) of S100β levels were performed in participants from the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936. Conditional and joint analysis (COJO) was used to identify independent loci. Expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analyses were performed for lead loci that had genome-wide significant associations with S100β. Bidirectional, two-sample Mendelian randomisation was used to test for causal associations between S100β and Alzheimer's disease. Colocalisation between S100β and Alzheimer's disease GWAS loci was also examined.Results:We identified 154 SNPs from chromosome 21 that associated (P<5x10-8) with S100β protein levels. The lead variant was located in theS100βgene (rs8128872, P=5.0x10-17). We found evidence that two independent causal variants existed for both transcription ofS100βand S100β protein levels in our eQTL analyses.No CpG sites were associated with S100β levels at the epigenome-wide significant level (P<3.6x10-8); the lead probe was cg06833709 (P=5.8x10-6), which mapped to theLGI1gene. There was no evidence of a causal association between S100β levels and Alzheimer's disease or vice versa and no evidence for colocalisation betweenS100βand Alzheimer's disease loci.Conclusions:These data provide insight into the molecular regulators of S100β levels. This context may aid in understanding the role of S100β in brain inflammation and neurological disease.Copyright: © 2021 A Gadd D et al."

In this study, we explored the interaction mechanism among SMY, DNA methylation, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). We identified differences in DNA methylation levels in NPC CNE-2 cells and its radioresistant cells (CNE-2R) using the methylated DNA immunoprecipitation array and found that CNE-2R cells showed genome-wide changes in methylation status towards a state of hypomethylation. SMY may restore its original DNA methylation status, and thus, enhance radiosensitivity. Furthermore, we confirmed that the differential gene Tenascin-C (TNC) was overexpressed in CNE-2R cells and that SMY downregulated TNC expression. This downregulation of TNC inhibited NPC cell radiation resistance, migration, and invasion. Furthermore, we found that TNC was hypomethylated in CNE-2R cells and partially restored to a hypermethylated state after SMY intervention. DNA methyltransferases 3a may be the key protein in DNA methylation of TNC.© 2020 Xi'an Jiaotong University. Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V."

DNA was collected for 11 of these individuals and 2 previously reported individuals in an attempt to delineate a specific DNA methylation signature in GADEVS.Phenotype in most individuals overlapped with the previously described features. We described 1 individual with atypical phenotype, heterozygous for a missense variant in a domain usually not involved in individuals with YY1 pathogenic missense variations. We also described a specific peripheral blood DNA methylation profile associated with YY1 variants.We reported a distinct DNA methylation episignature in GADEVS.

The molecular mechanisms that contribute to these transcriptomic changes are largely unknown. The aim of this study was to characterize the DNA methylation landscape of human microglia and the factors that contribute to variations in the microglia methylome. We hypothesized that both age and brain region would have a large impact on DNA methylation in microglia.Microglia from postmortem brain tissue of four different brain regions of 22 donors, encompassing 1 patient with schizophrenia, 13 patients with mood disorder pathology, and 8 control subjects, were isolated and assayed using a genome-wide methylation array.We found that human microglial cells have a methylation profile distinct from bulk brain tissue and neurons, and age explained a considerable part of the variation. Additionally, we showed that interindividual factors had a much larger effect on the methylation landscape of microglia than brain region, which was also seen at the transcriptome level. In our exploratory analysis, we found various differentially methylated regions that were related to disease status (mood disorder vs. control). This included differentially methylated regions that are linked to gene expression in microglia, as well as to myeloid cell function or neuropsychiatric disorders.Although based on relatively small samples, these findings suggest that the methylation profile of microglia is responsive to interindividual variations and thereby plays an important role in the heterogeneity of microglia observed at the transcriptome level.Published by Elsevier Inc."

However, characterising epigenetic influences could further inform disease predictions. Here, we leverage epigenome-wide data to study links between the DNAm signatures of the circulating proteome and incident diseases. Using data from four cohorts, we trained and tested epigenetic scores (EpiScores) for 953 plasma proteins, identifying 109 scores that explained between 1% and 58% of the variance in protein levels after adjusting for known protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) genetic effects. By projecting these EpiScores into an independent sample, (Generation Scotland; n=9,537) and relating them to incident morbidities over a follow-up of 14 years, we uncovered 137 EpiScore - disease associations. These associations were largely independent of immune cell proportions, common lifestyle and health factors and biological aging. Notably, we found that our diabetes-associated EpiScores highlighted previous top biomarker associations from proteome-wide assessments of diabetes. These EpiScores for protein levels can therefore be a valuable resource for disease prediction and risk stratification.© 2022, Gadd et al."
"35021220","Mapping the cord blood transcriptome of pregnancies affected by early maternal anemia to identify signatures of fetal programming.","J Clin Endocrinol Metab","Anemia during early pregnancy (EP) is common in developing countries and is associated with adverse health consequences for both mother and children. Offspring of women with EP anemia often have low birth-weight, the latter being a risk factor for cardiometabolic diseases including type 2 diabetes (T2D) later in life. Mechanisms underlying developmental programming of adult cardiometabolic disease include epigenetic and transcriptional alterations potentially detectable in umbilical cord blood (UCB) at time of birth.We leveraged global transcriptome- and accompanying epigenome-wide changes in 48 UCB from newborns of EP-anemic Tanzanian mothers and 50 controls to identify differentially expressed genes (DEG) in UCB exposed to maternal EP-anemia. DEGs were assessed for association with neonatal anthropometry and cord insulin levels. These genes were further studied in expression data from human fetal pancreas and adult islets to understand their role in beta-cell development and/or function.The expression of 137 genes was altered in UCB of newborns exposed to maternal EP anemia. These putative signatures of fetal programming which included the birth-weight locus LCORL, were potentially mediated by epigenetic changes in 27 genes and associated with neonatal anthropometry. Among the DEGs were P2RX7, PIK3C2B, and NUMBL which potentially influence beta-cell development. Insulin levels were lower in EP anemia exposed UCB, supporting the notion of developmental programming of pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction and subsequently increased risk of T2D in offspring of EP anemic mothers.Our data provide proof-of-concept on distinct transcriptional and epigenetic changes detectable in UCB from newborns exposed to maternal EP anemia.© The Author(s) 2022.

SEZ is promiscuous in host range and is commonly recovered from horses as a commensal. Comparison of a single strain each of SEE and SEZ using whole-genome sequencing, supplemented by PCR of selected genes in additional SEE and SEZ strains, was used to characterize the evolution of SEE. But the known genetic variability of SEZ warrants comparison of the whole genomes of multiple SEE and SEZ strains. To fill this knowledge gap, we utilized whole-genome sequencing to characterize the accessory genome elements (AGEs; i.e., elements present in some SEE strains but absent in SEZ or vice versa) and methylomes of 50 SEE and 50 SEZ isolates from Texas. Consistent with previous findings, AGEs consistently found in all SEE isolates were primarily from mobile genetic elements that might contribute to host restriction or pathogenesis of SEE. Fewer AGEs were identified in SEZ because of the greater genomic variability among these isolates. The global methylation patterns of SEE isolates were more consistent than those of the SEZ isolates. Among homologous genes of SEE and SEZ, differential methylation was identified only in genes of SEE encoding proteins with functions of quorum sensing, exopeptidase activity, and transitional metal ion binding. Our results indicate that effects of genetic mobile elements in SEE and differential methylation of genes shared by SEE and SEZ might contribute to the host specificity of SEE.IMPORTANCEStrangles, caused by the host-specific bacterium Streptococcus equi subsp.equi(SEE), is the most commonly diagnosed infectious disease of horses worldwide. Its ancestor, Streptococcus equi subsp.zooepidemicus(SEZ), is frequently isolated from a wide array of hosts, including horses and humans. A comparison of the genomes of a single strain of SEE and SEZ has been reported, but sequencing of further isolates has revealed variability among SEZ strains. Thus, the importance of this study is that it characterizes genomic and methylomic differences of multiple SEE and SEZ isolates from a common geographic region (viz., Texas). Our results affirm many of the previously described differences between the genomes of SEE and SEZ, including the role of mobile genetic elements in contributing to host restriction. We also provide the first characterization of the global methylome of Streptococcus equi and evidence that differential methylation might contribute to the host restriction of SEE."

Alterations in DNA methylation (DNAm) may be a mechanism through which suboptimal prenatal conditions confer disease risk later in life. One-carbon metabolism (OCM) is critical to both fetal development and in supplying methyl donors needed for DNAm. Plasma concentrations of one-carbon metabolites across maternal first trimester (M1), maternal term (M3), and infant cord blood (CB) at birth were tested for association with DNAm patterns in CB from the Michigan Mother and Infant Pairs (MMIP) pregnancy cohort. The Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip was used to quantitatively evaluate DNAm across the epigenome. Global and single-site DNAm and metabolite models were adjusted for infant sex, estimated cell type proportions, and batch as covariates. Change in mean metabolite concentration across pregnancy (M1 to M3) was significantly different for S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), betaine, and choline. Both M1 SAH and CB SAH were significantly associated with the global distribution of DNAm in CB, with indications of a shift toward less methylation. M3 SAH and CB SAH also displayed significant associations with locus-specific DNAm in infant CB (FDR<0.05). Our findings underscore the role of maternal one-carbon metabolites in shifting the global DNAm pattern in CB and emphasizes the need to closely evaluate how dietary status influences cellular methylation potential and ultimately offspring health.Copyright © 2022.

HIV infection can modify the host epigenome and as such can impact disease progression, as well as the molecular processes driving non-AIDS comorbidities in PWH. Epigenetic epidemiologic studies including epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) offer a unique set of tools to expand our understanding of HIV disease and to identify novel strategies applicable to treatment and diagnosis in this patient population. In this review, we summarize the current state of knowledge from epigenetic epidemiologic studies of PWH, identify the main challenges of this approach, and highlight future directions for the field. Emerging epigenetic epidemiologic studies of PWH can expand our understanding of HIV infection and health outcomes, improve scientific validity through collaboration and replication, and increase the coverage of diverse populations affected by the global HIV pandemic.

Unavoidably, the uremic milieu disturbs homeostatic processes such as DNA methylation and other vital gene regulatory mechanisms. Here, we aimed to investigate how dialysis or kidney transplantation modifies the epigenome-wide methylation signature over 12 months of treatment. We used the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip on whole blood samples from CKD-patients undergoing either dialysis (n = 11) or kidney transplantation (n = 12) and 24 age- and sex-matched population-based controls. At baseline, comparison between patients and controls identified several significant (PFDR < 0.01) CpG methylation differences in genes with functions relevant to inflammation, cellular ageing and vascular calcification. Following 12 months, the global DNA methylation pattern of patients approached that seen in the control group. Notably, 413 CpG sites remained differentially methylated at follow-up in both treatment groups compared to controls. Together, these data indicate that the uremic milieu drives genome-wide methylation changes that are partially reversed with kidney failure replacement therapy. Differentially methylated CpG sites unaffected by treatment may be of particular interest as they could highlight candidate genes for kidney disease per se.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35013473","The impact of methodology on the reproducibility and rigor of DNA methylation data.","Sci Rep","Epigenetic modifications are crucial for normal development and implicated in disease pathogenesis. While epigenetics continues to be a burgeoning research area in neuroscience, unaddressed issues related to data reproducibility across laboratories remain. Separating meaningful experimental changes from background variability is a challenge in epigenomic studies. Here we show that seemingly minor experimental variations, even under normal baseline conditions, can have a significant impact on epigenome outcome measures and data interpretation. We examined genome-wide DNA methylation and gene expression profiles of hippocampal tissues from wild-type rats housed in three independent laboratories using nearly identical conditions. Reduced-representation bisulfite sequencing and RNA-seq respectively identified 3852 differentially methylated and 1075 differentially expressed genes between laboratories, even in the absence of experimental intervention. Difficult-to-match factors such as animal vendors and a subset of husbandry and tissue extraction procedures produced quantifiable variations between wild-type animals across the three laboratories. Our study demonstrates that seemingly minor experimental variations, even under normal baseline conditions, can have a significant impact on epigenome outcome measures and data interpretation. This is particularly meaningful for neurological studies in animal models, in which baseline parameters between experimental groups are difficult to control. To enhance scientific rigor, we conclude that strict adherence to protocols is necessary for the execution and interpretation of epigenetic studies and that protocol-sensitive epigenetic changes, amongst naive animals, may confound experimental results.© 2022.

In this study, we quantified genome-wide patterns of DNA methylation using the Infinium Human DNA Methylation EPIC BeadChip array (""850 K"") in DNA samples isolated from whole blood collected from a group of 7 monozygotic twin pairs discordant for AN. Results were then validated performing a genome-wide DNA methylation profiling using DNA extracted from whole blood of a group of non-family-related AN patients and a group of healthy controls. Our first analysis using the twin sample revealed 9 CpGs associated to a gene. The validation analysis showed two statistically significant CpGs with the rank regression method related to two genes associated to metabolic traits, PPP2R2C and CHST1. When doing beta regression, 6 of them showed statistically significant differences, including 3 CpGs associated to genes JAM3, UBAP2L and SYNJ2. Finally, the overall pattern of results shows genetic links to phenotypes which the literature has constantly related to AN, including metabolic and psychological traits. The genes PPP2R2C and CHST1 have both been linked to the metabolic traits type 2 diabetes through GWAS studies. The genes UBAP2L and SYNJ2 have been related to other psychiatric comorbidity.© 2022.

Considering that MB is heterogeneous, this study aimed to define the molecular landscape of MBs in TYAs. We collated more than 2000 MB samples that included 287 TYA patients (13-24 years). We performed computational analyses consisting of genome-wide methylation and transcriptomic profiles and developed a prognostics model for the TYAs with MB. We identified that TYAs predominantly comprised of Group 4 (40%) and Sonic Hedgehog (SHH)-activated (33%) tumours, with Wingless-type (WNT, 17%) and Group 3 (10%) being less common. TYAs with SHH tumours displayed significantly more gene expression alterations, whereas no gene was detected in the Group 4 tumours. Across MB subgroups, we identified unique and shared sets of TYA-specific differentially methylated probes and DNA-binding motifs. Finally, a 22-gene signature stratified TYA patients into high- and low-risk groups, and the prognostic significance of these risk groups persisted in multivariable regression models (P= 0.001). This study is an important step toward delineating the molecular landscape of TYAs with MB.

Based on unsupervised clustering with 567 most variably methylated CpG sites, patients were categorized into four clusters associated with genetic alterations. Clusters 1 and 3 were characterized by the presence of known favorable prognostic factors, such as RUNX1-RUNX1T1 fusion and KMT2A rearrangement with low MECOM expression, and biallelic CEBPA mutations (all 8 patients), respectively. Clusters 2 and 4 comprised patients exhibiting molecular features associated with adverse outcomes, namely FLT3-ITD, KMT2A-PTD, and high PRDM16 expression. Depending on the methylation values of the 1243 CpG sites that were significantly different between FLT3-ITD positive and negative AML, patients were categorized into three clusters: A, B, and C. The STAT5-binding motif was most frequently found close to the 1,243 CpG sites. All eight patients with FLT3-ITD in Cluster A harbored high PRDM16 expression and experienced adverse events, whereas only one of seven patients with FLT3-ITD in the other clusters experienced adverse events. PRDM16 expression levels were also related to DNA methylation patterns, which were drastically changed at the cutoff value of PRDM16/ABL1 = 0.10. The assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing of AMLs supported enhanced chromatin accessibilities around genomic regions, such as HOXB cluster genes, SCHIP1, and PRDM16, which were associated with DNA methylation changes in AMLs with FLT3-ITD and high PRDM16 expression.

Anomalous abundance and genome-wide localization of these modifications can negatively tune gene expression and propagate into unbalanced epigenetics regulation, which is known to be associated with multiple conditions such as cancer, diabetes and aging. We present a direct injection mass spectrometry (DI-MS) platform that offers fast, accurate and precise quantitation of global levels of DNA cytidine methylation (mC) and hydroxymethylation (hmC) in less than one minute per sample. On the contrary to most methods adopting mass spectrometry for the analysis of nucleotide modifications, in this DI-MS approach we eliminate the use of liquid chromatography, increasing throughput, eliminating issues of carryover and batch effects caused by column contamination across samples. In addition, potential biases in detection efficiency of modified nucleotides with different binding efficiency to stationary phases is eliminated, as no chromatographic separation is adopted. This method can analyze >1000 samples per day, overcoming the throughput of next-generation sequencing.•Direct injection mass spectrometry improves throughput and precision compared to liquid chromatography.•Direct injection can be used to quantify in less than one minute global levels of DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation.•The unbiased acquisition can be potentially utilized to analyze other nucleotide modifications.© 2021 The Authors.

This study aims to explore the potentialH.pylori-associated methylation biomarkers in blood leukocyte and gastric mucosa.Methods:Five candidateH.pylori-associated aberrant methylation genes were selected from the previous genome-wide profiling panels and validated in blood leukocyte and gastric mucosa in multi-stages (case-control validation betweenH.pyloripositive and negative subjects and self-control validation before and after anti-H.pyloritreatment).Results:GNASmethylation level was decreased in blood leukocyte (62.07%v.s.46.33%,p<0.001) and gastric mucosa (56.30%v.s.32.42%,p<0.001) ofH.pyloripositive subjects compared to negative controls. While,MTERF1methylation level was increased significantly in blood leukocyte (29.57%v.s.56.02%,p<0.001) and gastric mucosa (31.10%v.s.47.50%,p<0.001) of positive subjects compared to controls. After successfulH.pylorieradication, the methylation levels were increased from 44.87% to 60.88% (p<0.001) forGNASand decreased from 46.19% to 34.56% (p<0.001) forMTERF1in blood leukocyte. Similar increasing and decreasing methylation alterations were also found for the two genes after successful eradication in paired gastric mucosa. In TCGA database, an inverse relationship was found betweenGNASmethylation and mRNA expression (r=-0.12,p=0.027). The GC cases with higherGNASexpression levels showed significantly worse survival (HR, 2.09, 95%CI, 1.22-3.57,p=0.007) compared to lower expression subjects.Conclusions:GNASandMTERF1methylation levels may be affected byH.pyloriinfection in gastric mucosa and blood leukocyte.GNASmay be involved in advanced stage of GC development, although the possible mechanism still needs further study in precancerous lesions.© The author(s)."
"35003108","DNA Methylation Profiles of Purified Cell Types in Bronchoalveolar Lavage: Applications for Mixed Cell Paediatric Pulmonary Studies.","Front Immunol","In epigenome-wide association studies analysing DNA methylation from samples containing multiple cell types, it is essential to adjust the analysis for cell type composition. One well established strategy for achieving this is reference-based cell type deconvolution, which relies on knowledge of the DNA methylation profiles of purified constituent cell types. These are then used to estimate the cell type proportions of each sample, which can then be incorporated to adjust the association analysis. Bronchoalveolar lavage is commonly used to sample the lung in clinical practice and contains a mixture of different cell types that can vary in proportion across samples, affecting the overall methylation profile. A current barrier to the use of bronchoalveolar lavage in DNA methylation-based research is the lack of reference DNA methylation profiles for each of the constituent cell types, thus making reference-based cell composition estimation difficult. Herein, we use bronchoalveolar lavage samples collected from children with cystic fibrosis to define DNA methylation profiles for the four most common and clinically relevant cell types: alveolar macrophages, granulocytes, lymphocytes and alveolar epithelial cells. We then demonstrate the use of these methylation profiles in conjunction with an established reference-based methylation deconvolution method to estimate the cell type composition of two different tissue types; a publicly available dataset derived from artificial blood-based cell mixtures and further bronchoalveolar lavage samples. The reference DNA methylation profiles developed in this work can be used for future reference-based cell type composition estimation of bronchoalveolar lavage. This will facilitate the use of this tissue in studies examining the role of DNA methylation in lung health and disease.Copyright © 2021 Shanthikumar, Neeland, Saffery, Ranganathan, Oshlack and Maksimovic."
"34998235","A network-based integration for understanding racial disparity in prostate cancer.","Transl Oncol","Compared to Caucasians (CAs), African Americans (AAs) have a higher rate of incidence and mortality in prostate cancer and are prone to be diagnosed at later stages. To understand this racial disparity, molecular features of different types, including gene expression, DNA methylation and other genomic alterations, have been compared between tumor samples from the two races, but led to different disparity associated genes (DAGs). In this study, we applied a network-based algorithm to integrate a comprehensive set of genomic datasets and identified 130 core DAGs. Out of these genes, 78 were not identified by any individual dataset but prioritized and selected through network propagation. We found DAGs were highly enriched in several critical prostate cancer-related signaling transduction and cell cycle pathways and were more likely to be associated with patient prognosis in prostate cancer. Furthermore, DAGs were over-represented in prostate cancer risk genes identified from previous genome wide association studies. We also found DAGs were enriched in kinase and transcription factor encoding genes. Interestingly, for many of these prioritized kinases their association with racial disparity did not manifest from the original genomic/transcriptomic data but was reflected by their differential phosphorylation levels between AA and CA prostate tumor samples. Similarly, the disparity relevance of some transcription factors was not reflected at the mRNA or protein expression level, but at the activity level as demonstrated by their differential ability in regulating target gene expression. Our integrative analysis provided new candidate targets for improving prostate cancer treatment and addressing the racial disparity problem.Copyright © 2021. Published by Elsevier Inc."
"34997020","Genome-wide aberrant methylation in primary metastatic UM and their matched metastases.","Sci Rep","Uveal melanoma (UM) is an aggressive intra-ocular cancer with a strong tendency to metastasize. Metastatic UM is associated with mutations in BAP1 and SF3B1, however only little is known about the epigenetic modifications that arise in metastatic UM. In this study we aim to unravel epigenetic changes contributing to UM metastasis using a new genome-wide methylation analysis technique that covers over 50% of all CpG's. We identified aberrant methylation contributing to BAP1 and SF3B1-mediated UM metastasis. The methylation data was integrated with expression data and surveyed in matched UM metastases from the liver, skin and bone. UM metastases showed no commonly shared novel epigenetic modifications, implying that epigenetic changes contributing to metastatic spreading and colonization in distant tissues occur early in the development of UM and epigenetic changes that occur after metastasis are mainly patient-specific. Our findings reveal a plethora of epigenetic modifications in metastatic UM and its metastases, which could subsequently result in aberrant repression or activation of many tumor-related genes. This observation points towards additional layers of complexity at the level of gene expression regulation, which may explain the low mutational burden of UM.© 2022. The Author(s)."

However, long-term effects on lung function in humans are largely unknown.We investigated the associations of Ascaris exposure with lung function, asthma, and DNA methylation.Serum Ascaris IgG antibodies were measured in 671 adults aged 18 to 47 years (46% women) from Aarhus, Bergen, and Tartu RHINESSA study centers. Seropositivity was defined as IgG above the 90th percentile. Linear and logistic regressions were used to analyze Ascaris seropositivity as associated with lung function and asthma, adjusted for age, height, and smoking and clustered by center. DNA methylation in blood was profiled by a commercial methylation assay.Ascaris seropositivity was associated with lower FEV1(-247 mL; 95% CI, -460, -34) and higher odds for asthma (adjusted odds ratio, 5.84; 95% CI, 1.67, 20.37) among men but not women, also after further adjusting for house dust mite sensitivity, consistent across study centers. At a genome-wide level, Ascaris exposure was associated with 23 differentially methylated sites in men and 3 in women. We identified hypermethylation of the MYBPC1 gene, which can regulate airway muscle contraction. We also identified genes linked to asthma pathogenesis such as CRHR1 and GRK1, as well as a differentially methylated region in the PRSS22 gene linked to nematode infection.Ascaris exposure was associated with substantially lower lung function and increased asthma risk among men. Seropositive participants had sex-specific differences in DNA methylation compared to the unexposed, thus suggesting that exposure may lead to sex-specific epigenetic changes associated with lung pathology.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

To screen cytosine-phosphate-guanine site (CpGs) potentially associated with asthma acquisition, at the genome scale, we examined differentially methylated regions (DMR) using dmrff R package and individual CpG sites using linear regression on such associations. For CpGs that passed screening, we examined their enrichment in biological pathways using their mapping genes and tested their associations with asthma acquisitions using logistic regressions. Findings in IOWBC were tested in an independent cohort, the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) cohort.In total, 2636 unique CpGs passed screening, based on which we identified one biological pathway linked to asthma acquisition during adolescence in females (FDR adjusted p-value = .003 in IOWBC). Via logistic regressions, for females, four CpGs were shown to be associated with asthma acquisition during adolescence, and another four CpGs with asthma acquisition in young adulthood (FDR adjusted p-value < .05 in IOWBC) and these eight CpGs were replicated in ALSPAC (all p-values < .05). DNAm at all the identified CpGs was shown to be temporally consistent, and at six of the CpGs was associated with expressions of adjacent or mapping genes in females (all p-values < .05). For males, 622 CpGs were identified in IOWBC (FDR = 0.01), but these were not tested in ALSPAC due to small sample sizes.Eight CpGs on LHX5, IL22RA2, SOX11, CBX4, ACPT, CFAP46, MUC4, and ATP1B2 genes have the potential to serve as candidate epigenetic biomarkers in newborns for asthma acquisition in females during adolescence or young adulthood.© 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

Identification of epigenetic changes that associate with PTSD is therefore a crucial step in deciphering mechanisms of risk and resilience. In this study, our goal is to identify epigenetic signatures associated with PTSD symptom severity (PTSS) and changes in PTSS over time, using whole blood DNA methylation (DNAm) data (MethylationEPIC BeadChip) of military personnel prior to and following combat deployment. A total of 429 subjects (858 samples across 2 time points) from three male military cohorts were included in the analyses. We conducted two different meta-analyses to answer two different scientific questions: one to identify a DNAm profile of PTSS using a random effects model including both time points for each subject, and the other to identify a DNAm profile of change in PTSS conditioned on pre-deployment DNAm. Four CpGs near four genes (F2R, CNPY2, BAIAP2L1, and TBXAS1) and 88 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were associated with PTSS. Change in PTSS after deployment was associated with 15 DMRs, of those 2 DMRs near OTUD5 and ELF4 were also associated with PTSS. Notably, three PTSS-associated CpGs near F2R, BAIAP2L1 and TBXAS1 also showed nominal evidence of association with change in PTSS. This study, which identifies PTSD-associated changes in genes involved in oxidative stress and immune system, provides novel evidence that epigenetic differences are associated with PTSS.© 2021.

DNA methyltransferase inhibitors can promote antitumor immune responses. This clinical trial investigated whether concurrent treatment with azacitidine enhances the antitumor activity of pembrolizumab in mCRC.We conducted a phase 2 single-arm trial evaluating activity and tolerability of pembrolizumab plus azacitidine in patients with chemotherapy-refractory mCRC (NCT02260440). Patients received pembrolizumab 200 mg IV on day 1 and azacitidine 100 mg SQ on days 1-5, every 3 weeks. A low fixed dose of azacitidine was chosen in order to reduce the possibility of a direct cytotoxic effect of the drug, since the main focus of this study was to investigate its potential immunomodulatory effect. The primary endpoint of this study was overall response rate (ORR) using RECIST v1.1., and secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Tumor tissue was collected pre- and on-treatment for correlative studies.Thirty chemotherapy-refractory patients received a median of three cycles of therapy. One patient achieved partial response (PR), and one patient had stable disease (SD) as best confirmed response. The ORR was 3%, median PFS was 1.9 months, and median OS was 6.3 months. The combination regimen was well-tolerated, and 96% of treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were grade 1/2. This trial was terminated prior to the accrual target of 40 patients due to lack of clinical efficacy. DNA methylation on-treatment as compared to pre-treatment decreased genome wide in 10 of 15 patients with paired biopsies and was significantly lower in gene promoter regions after treatment. These promoter demethylated genes represented a higher proportion of upregulated genes, including several immune gene sets, endogenous retroviral elements, and cancer-testis antigens. CD8+TIL density trended higher on-treatment compared to pre-treatment. Higher CD8+TIL density at baseline was associated with greater likelihood of benefit from treatment. On-treatment tumor demethylation correlated with the increases in tumor CD8+TIL density.The combination of pembrolizumab and azacitidine is safe and tolerable with modest clinical activity in the treatment for chemotherapy-refractory mCRC. Correlative studies suggest that tumor DNA demethylation and immunomodulation occurs. An association between tumor DNA demethylation and tumor-immune modulation suggests immune modulation and may result from treatment with azacitidine.

We describe non-coding RNAs, pseudogenes, and transposable elements, and highlight tissue specific expression and methylation patterns. Resequencing of forty wild accessions provided insights into genome-wide genetic variation and QTL regions were identified for a seedling color phenotype. Altogether, these data will serve as a tool for pennycress improvement in general and for translational research across the Brassicaceae.This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
"34988438","Fast and memory-efficient mapping of short bisulfite sequencing reads using a two-letter alphabet.","NAR Genom Bioinform","DNA cytosine methylation is an important epigenomic mark with a wide range of functions in many organisms. Whole genome bisulfite sequencing is the gold standard to interrogate cytosine methylation genome-wide. Algorithms used to map bisulfite-converted reads often encode the four-base DNA alphabet with three letters by reducing two bases to a common letter. This encoding substantially reduces the entropy of nucleotide frequencies in the resulting reference genome. Within the paradigm of read mapping by first filtering possible candidate alignments, reduced entropy in the sequence space can increase the required computing effort. We introduce another bisulfite mapping algorithm (abismal), based on the idea of encoding a four-letter DNA sequence as only two letters, one for purines and one for pyrimidines. We show that this encoding can lead to greater specificity compared to existing encodings used to map bisulfite sequencing reads. Through the two-letter encoding, the abismal software tool maps reads in less time and using less memory than most bisulfite sequencing read mapping software tools, while attaining similar accuracy. This allowsin silicomethylation analysis to be performed in a wider range of computing machines with limited hardware settings.© The Author(s) 2021.

"34987166","The importance of enhancer methylation for epigenetic regulation of tumorigenesis in squamous lung cancer.","Exp Mol Med","Lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) is a subtype of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). LUSC occurs at the bronchi, shows a squamous appearance, and often occurs in smokers. To determine the epigenetic regulatory mechanisms of tumorigenesis, we performed a genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation in tumor and adjacent normal tissues from LUSC patients. With the Infinium Methylation EPIC Array, > 850,000 CpG sites, including ~350,000 CpG sites for enhancer regions, were profiled, and the differentially methylated regions (DMRs) overlapping promoters (pDMRs) and enhancers (eDMRs) between tumor and normal tissues were identified. Dimension reduction based on DMR profiles revealed that eDMRs alone and not pDMRs alone can differentiate tumors from normal tissues with the equivalent performance of total DMRs. We observed a stronger negative correlation of LUSC-specific gene expression with methylation for enhancers than promoters. Target genes of eDMRs rather than pDMRs were found to be enriched for tumor-associated genes and pathways. Furthermore, DMR methylation associated with immune infiltration was more frequently observed among enhancers than promoters. Our results suggest that methylation of enhancer regions rather than promoters play more important roles in epigenetic regulation of tumorigenesis and immune infiltration in LUSC.© 2021.

We aimed to seek more novel AS-associated DNA methylation alterations and delineate the regulatory effect of DNA methylation and gene expression with integrated analysis of methylome and transcriptome.Epigenome-wide DNA methylation and mRNA expression were profiled in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 45 individuals (AS: health controls (HCs) = 30:15) with high-throughput array. The methylome was validated in an independent cohort (AS: HCs = 12:12). Pearson correlation analysis and causal inference tests (CIT) were conducted to determine potentially causative regulatory effects of methylation on mRNA expression.A total of 4794 differentially methylated positions (DMPs) were identified associated with AS, 2526 DMPs of which were validated in an independent cohort. Both cohorts highlighted T cell receptor (TCR) signaling and Th17 differentiation pathways. Besides, AS patients manifested increased DNA methylation variability. The methylation levels of 158 DMPs were correlated with the mRNA expression levels of 112 genes, which formed interconnected network concentrated on Th17 cell differentiation and TCR signaling pathway (LCK, FYN, CD3G, TCF7, ZAP70, CXCL12, and PLCG1). We also identified several cis-acting DNA methylation and gene expression changes associated with AS risk, which might regulate the cellular mechanisms underlying AS.Our studies outlined the landscapes of epi-signatures of AS and several methylation-gene expression-AS regulatory axis and highlighted the Th17 cell differentiation and TCR signaling pathway, which might provide innovative molecular targets for therapeutic interventions for AS.© 2022.

At the same time, for potential clinical usability, we calculated the diagnostic and subtyping scores to classify RCC from normal tissue and distinguish the different RCC subtypes. Additionally, the CpG sites were mapped to their corresponding genes, which could also be used to predict the prognosis of RCC.Different methylation sites can be used as diagnostic and subtyping markers that are specific to RCC and RCC subtypes (KIRC and KIRP) with high sensitivity and accuracy.2021 Translational Andrology and Urology.

This study examined the association between neighborhood-level factors and DNA methylation in non-Hispanic Black and White women diagnosed with breast cancer.Genome-wide DNA methylation was measured using the EPIC array in the tumor tissue of 96 women. Linear regression models were used to examine the association between nine neighborhood-level factors and methylation, regressing β values for each cytosine-phosphate guanine dinucleotide (CpG) site on neighborhood-level factors while adjusting for covariates. Neighborhood data were obtained from the Opportunity Atlas. We used a false discovery rate (FDR) threshold < 0.05, and for CpGs below this threshold, we examined interactions with race. We employed multivariable Cox proportional-hazards models to estimate whether aberrant methylation was associated with all-cause mortality.26 of the CpG sites were associated with job density or college education (FDR < 0.05). Further exploration of these 26 CpG sites revealed no interactions by race, but a single probe in TMEM204 was associated with all-cause mortality.We identified novel associations between neighborhood-level factors and the breast tumor DNA methylome. Our data are the first to show that dysregulation in neighborhood associated CpG sites may be associated with all-cause mortality. Neighborhood-level factors may contribute to differential tumor methylation in genes related to tumor progression and metastasis. This contributes to the increasing body of evidence that area-level factors (such as neighborhood characteristics) may play an important role in cancer disparities through modulation of the breast tumor epigenome.© 2021.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified more than 100 loci associated with AF, but the underlying biological interpretation remains largely unknown. The goal of this study is to identify gene expression and DNA methylation (DNAm) that are pleiotropically or potentially causally associated with AF, and to integrate results from transcriptome and methylome.Methods:We used the summary data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR) to integrate GWAS with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) studies and methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTL) studies. The HEIDI (heterogeneity in dependent instruments) test was introduced to test against the null hypothesis that there is a single causal variant underlying the association.Results:We prioritized 22 genes by eQTL analysis and 50 genes by mQTL analysis that passed the SMR & HEIDI test. Among them, 6 genes were overlapped. By incorporating consistent SMR associations between DNAm and AF, between gene expression and AF, and between DNAm and gene expression, we identified several mediation models at which a genetic variant exerted an effect on AF by altering the DNAm level, which regulated the expression level of a functional gene. One example was the genetic variant-cg18693985-CPEB4-AF axis.Conclusion:In conclusion, our integrative analysis identified multiple genes and DNAm sites that had potentially causal effects on AF. We also pinpointed plausible mechanisms in which the effect of a genetic variant on AF was mediated by genetic regulation of transcription through DNAm. Further experimental validation is necessary to translate the identified genes and possible mechanisms into clinical practice.Copyright © 2021 Liu, Li, Ma, Huang, Ouyang and Liu."
"34971718","H3K9me2 genome-wide distribution in the holocentric insect Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae).","Genomics","Eukaryotic genomes are packaged by Histone proteins in a structure called chromatin. There are different chromatin types. Euchromatin is typically associated with decondensed, transcriptionally active regions and heterochromatin to more condensed regions of the chromosomes. Methylation of Lysine 9 of Histone H3 (H3K9me) is a conserved biochemical marker of heterochromatin. In many organisms, heterochromatin is usually localized at telomeric as well as pericentromeric regions but can also be found at interstitial chromosomal loci. This distribution may vary in different species depending on their general chromosomal organization. Holocentric species such as Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) possess dispersed centromeres instead of a monocentric one and thus no observable pericentromeric compartment. To identify the localization of heterochromatin in such species we performed ChIP-Seq experiments and analyzed the distribution of the heterochromatin marker H3K9me2 in the Sf9 cell line and whole 4th instar larvae (L4) in relation to RNA-Seq data.In both samples we measured an enrichment of H3K9me2 at the (sub) telomeres, rDNA loci, and satellite DNA sequences, which could represent dispersed centromeric regions. We also observed that density of H3K9me2 is positively correlated with transposable elements and protein-coding genes. But contrary to most model organisms, H3K9me2 density is not correlated with transcriptional repression.This is the first genome-wide ChIP-Seq analysis conducted in S. frugiperda for H3K9me2. Compared to model organisms, this mark is found in expected chromosomal compartments such as rDNA and telomeres. However, it is also localized at numerous dispersed regions, instead of the well described large pericentromeric domains, indicating that H3K9me2 might not represent a classical heterochromatin marker in Lepidoptera.

Lentiviral delivery of the dCas9-TET1CD demethylase tool and guide RNA (gRNA) constructs targeting the CpG sites associated with differential expression of ANK1 and BIN1 in AD was validated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Bisulphite pyrosequencing was applied to confirm the DNA methylation edit.High transduction efficiencies were observed during FACS of SH-SY5Y cells transduced with CRISPR-dCas9 constructs targeting the BIN1 locus and IHM-SV40 cells with constructs against the ANK1 locus.

"34969956","Pancreatoblastomas and mixed and pure acinar cell carcinomas share epigenetic signatures distinct from other neoplasms of the pancreas.","Mod Pathol","Pancreatic neoplasms are heterogenous and have traditionally been classified by assessing their lines of cellular differentiation using histopathologic methods, particularly morphologic and immunohistochemical evaluation. These methods frequently identify overlapping differentiation along ductal, acinar, and neuroendocrine lines, raising diagnostic challenges as well as questions regarding the relationship of these neoplasms. Neoplasms with acinar differentiation, in particular, frequently show more than one line of differentiation based on immunolabeling. Genome methylation signatures, in contrast, are better conserved within cellular lineages, and are increasingly used to support the classification of neoplasms. We characterized the epigenetic relationships between pancreatoblastomas, acinar cell carcinomas (including mixed variants), pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, solid pseudopapillary neoplasms, and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas using a genome-wide array platform. Using unsupervised learning approaches, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, solid pseudopapillary neoplasms, ductal adenocarcinomas, and normal pancreatic tissue samples all localized to distinct clusters based on their methylation profiles, whereas all neoplasms with acinar differentiation occupied a broad overlapping region located between the predominantly acinar normal pancreatic tissue and ductal adenocarcinoma clusters. Our data provide evidence to suggest that acinar cell carcinomas and pancreatoblastomas are similar at the epigenetic level. These findings are consistent with genomic and clinical observations that mixed acinar neoplasms are closely related to pure acinar cell carcinomas rather than to neuroendocrine tumors or ductal adenocarcinomas.© 2021.

"34968304","Quantitative Epigenetics: A New Avenue for Crop Improvement.","Epigenomes","Plant breeding conventionally depends on genetic variability available in a species to improve a particular trait in the crop. However, epigenetic diversity may provide an additional tier of variation. The recent advent of epigenome technologies has elucidated the role of epigenetic variation in shaping phenotype. Furthermore, the development of epigenetic recombinant inbred lines (epi-RILs) in model species such as Arabidopsis has enabled accurate genetic analysis of epigenetic variation. Subsequently, mapping of epigenetic quantitative trait loci (epiQTL) allowed association between epialleles and phenotypic traits. Likewise, epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) and epi-genotyping by sequencing (epi-GBS) have revolutionized the field of epigenetics research in plants. Thus, quantitative epigenetics provides ample opportunities to dissect the role of epigenetic variation in trait regulation, which can be eventually utilized in crop improvement programs. Moreover, locus-specific manipulation of DNA methylation by epigenome-editing tools such as clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) can potentially facilitate epigenetic based molecular breeding of important crop plants."

Hence, we present an EWAS implementation tested for non-model plant species and describe its use."
"34968257","Ultra-Low DNA Input into Whole Genome Methylation Assays and Detection of Oncogenic Methylation and Copy Number Variants in Circulating Tumour DNA.","Epigenomes","Abnormal CpG methylation in cancer is ubiquitous and generally detected in tumour specimens using a variety of techniques at a resolution encompassing single CpG loci to genome wide coverage. Analysis of samples with very low DNA inputs, such as formalin fixed (FFPE) biopsy specimens from clinical trials or circulating tumour DNA is challenging at the genome-wide level because of lack of available input. We present the results of low input experiments into the Illumina Infinium HD methylation assay on FFPE specimens and ctDNA samples.For all experiments, the Infinium HD assay for methylation was used. In total, forty-eight FFPE specimens were used at varying concentrations (lowest input 50 ng); eighteen blood derived specimens (lowest input 10 ng) and six matched ctDNA input (lowest input 10 ng)/fresh tumour specimens (lowest input 250 ng) were processed. Downstream analysis was performed in R/Bioconductor for quality control metrics and differential methylation analysis as well as copy number calls.Correlation coefficients for CpG methylation were high at the probe level averaged R2 = 0.99 for blood derived samples and R2 > 0.96 for the FFPE samples. When matched ctDNA/fresh tumour samples were compared, R2 > 0.91 between the two. Results of differential methylation analysis did not vary significantly by DNA input in either the blood or FFPE groups. There were differences seen in the ctDNA group as compared to their paired tumour sample, possibly because of enrichment for tumour material without contaminating normal. Copy number variants observed in the tumour were generally also seen in the paired ctDNA sample with good concordance via DQ plot.The Illumina Infinium HD methylation assay can robustly detect methylation across a range of sample types, including ctDNA, down to an input of 10 ng. It can also reliably detect oncogenic methylation changes and copy number variants in ctDNA. These findings demonstrate that these samples can now be accessed by methylation array technology, allowing analysis of these important sample types."

The primary aim of the current study was to identify differentially methylated regions of DNA between males and females with schizophrenia. We collected DNA samples from 134 schizophrenia patients to measure genome-wide methylation at single-base resolution in 96 males and 38 females. We further repeated the analysis in 13 subjects (9 females, 4 males) to confirm the sex differences and to reduce the effect of potential confounders. The longitudinal methylation analysis found significant replication of several genes across the genome. These genes included RFTN1, TLE1, DAZL, PRR4, UTP14C, RNU12, and LOC644649. The overall results showed robust association between autosomal CpG sites and sex.

We examined the propensity prediction to cardiovascular lineage using 5-Aza, a well-known cardiac lineage inducer. The customized 180 K microarray was performed and further analysis of global differentially methylated regions by Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) in both MSCs and 5-AC-treated MSCs. The cluster enrichment tools sorted differentially enriched genes and further annotated to construct the interactive networks. Prediction analysis revealed pathways pertaining to the cardiovascular lineage found active in the native MSCs, suggesting its higher propensity to undergo cardiac, smooth muscle cell, and endothelial lineages in vitro. Interestingly, gene interaction network also proposed majorly stemness gene networkNANOGandKLF6, cardiac-specific transcription factorsGATA4, NKX2.5, andTBX5were upregulated in the native MSCs. Furthermore, the expression of cardiovascular lineage specific markers such asBrachury, CD105, CD90, CD31,KDRand various forms ofACTIN(cardiac, sarcomeric, smooth muscle) were validated in native MSCs using real time PCR and immunostaining and blotting analysis. In 5-AC-treated MSCs, mosaic interactive networks were observed to persuade towards osteogenesis and cardiac lineage, indicating that 5-AC treatment resulted in nonspecific lineage induction in MSCs, while MSCs by default have a higher propensity to undergo cardiovascular lineage.The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s13205-021-03058-2.© King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology 2021."
"34966481","RASAL2 suppresses the proliferative and invasive ability of PC3 prostate cancer cells.","Oncotarget","The RAS protein activator like 2 (RASAL2) negatively regulates RAS proto-oncogene which is activated by high mutation rate in cancer. Thus, RASAL2 expression could potentially limit the function of RAS in prostate cancer (PCa). Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis demonstrated that RASAL2 is differentially hypermethylated in PCa tissues compared to benign prostate tissues. The PCR analysis of RASAL2 mRNA transcript showed differential expression in a panel of prostate cell lines with most PCa showing lower RASAL2 expression compared to benign prostatic epithelial cells. In PCa PC3 cells, the ectopic expression of RASAL2 significantly inhibited cell proliferation and invasion and induced an S phase plus G2/M phase cell cycle arrest. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) demonstrated a cross talk between RASAL2 and TNFα, a key cytokine in immune signaling pathway that is relevant in PCa. Over-expression of RASAL2 downregulated TNFα expression whereas the knockdown of RASAL2 caused increased expression of TNFα. Taken together, our data demonstrates tumor suppressor role for RASAL2 in human PCa cells, despite increased RAS oncogenic activity. Our observation provides a new mechanistic insight of RASAL2 expression in aberrant Ras expression and immune signaling in PCa cells suggesting a potential novel therapeutic target for PCa.Copyright: © 2021 Tailor et al."
"34965853","Epigenetic features improve TALE target prediction.","BMC Genomics","The yield of many crop plants can be substantially reduced by plant-pathogenic Xanthomonas bacteria. The infection strategy of many Xanthomonas strains is based on transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs), which are secreted into the host cells and act as transcriptional activators of plant genes that are beneficial for the bacteria.The modular DNA binding domain of TALEs contains tandem repeats, each comprising two hyper-variable amino acids. These repeat-variable diresidues (RVDs) bind to their target box and determine the specificity of a TALE.All available tools for the prediction of TALE targets within the host plant suffer from many false positives. In this paper we propose a strategy to improve prediction accuracy by considering the epigenetic state of the host plant genome in the region of the target box.To this end, we extend our previously published tool PrediTALE by considering two epigenetic features: (i) chromatin accessibility of potentially bound regions and (ii) DNA methylation of cytosines within target boxes. Here, we determine the epigenetic features from publicly available DNase-seq, ATAC-seq, and WGBS data in rice.We benchmark the utility of both epigenetic features separately and in combination, deriving ground-truth from RNA-seq data of infections studies in rice. We find an improvement for each individual epigenetic feature, but especially the combination of both.Having established an advantage in TALE target predicting considering epigenetic features, we use these data for promoterome and genome-wide scans by our new tool EpiTALE, leading to several novel putative virulence targets.Our results suggest that it would be worthwhile to collect condition-specific chromatin accessibility data and methylation information when studying putative virulence targets of Xanthomonas TALEs.© 2021.

However, none Asian ancestry studies have been included in this or previous meta-analyses. I performed a GWAS on blood DNA methylation (DNAm) levels of 2309 Taiwan Biobank (TWB) participants. Owing to the fact that the sample size of an individual GWAS of DNAm data is still not large, I adopted the ""prioritized subset analysis"" (PSA) method to boost the power of a GWAS. The four epigenetic clocks and the two epigenetic surrogate markers were investigated, respectively. I replicated 21 out of the 137 aging-associated genetic loci by applying the PSA method to the TWB DNAm data. Moreover, I identified five novel loci, including rs117530284 that was associated with the ""epigenetic age acceleration"" (EAA) according to Lu et al.'s GrimAge (called ""GrimEAA""). Considering 16 covariates (sex, BMI, smoking status, drinking status, regular exercise, educational attainment, and the first 10 ancestry principal components), each ""A"" allele of rs117530284 in the IBA57 gene was found to be associated with a 1.5943-year GrimEAA (95% C.I. = [1.0748, 2.1138]). IBA57 is a protein coding gene and is associated with multiple mitochondrial dysfunctions syndromes. A decline in mitochondrial activity and quality is associated with aging and many age-related diseases. This is one of the first DNAm GWAS for individuals of Asian ancestry.© The Author(s) 2021.

There is emerging evidence for its implication in metabolic disease. No comprehensive analyses on gene expression of m6A regulators in human adipose tissue, especially in paired adipose tissue depots, and its correlation with clinical variables were reported so far. We hypothesized that inter-depot specific gene expression of m6A regulators may differentially correlate with clinical variables related to obesity and fat distribution.We extracted intra-individually paired gene expression data (omental visceral adipose tissue (OVAT)N=48; subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT)N=56) of m6A regulators from an existing microarray dataset. We also measured gene expression in another sample set of paired OVAT and SAT (N=46) using RT-qPCR. Finally, we extracted existing gene expression data from peripheral mononuclear blood cells (PBMCs) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) inMETTL3andYTHDF3from genome wide data from the Sorbs population (N=1049). The data were analysed for differential gene expression between OVAT and SAT; and for association with obesity and clinical variables. We further tested for association of SNP markers with gene expression and clinical traits.In adipose tissue we observed that several m6A regulators (WTAP,VIRMA,YTHDC1andALKBH5) correlate with obesity and clinical variables. Moreover, we found adipose tissue depot specific gene expression forMETTL3,WTAP,VIRMA,FTOandYTHDC1.In PBMCs, we identifiedALKBH5andYTHDF3correlated with obesity. Genetic markers inMETTL3associate with BMI whilst SNPs inYTHDF3are associated with its gene expression.Our data show that expression of m6A regulators correlates with obesity, is adipose tissue depot-specific and related to clinical traits.

We tested adultCntnap2heterozygous mice (Cntnap2+/-, lacking behavioral or neuropathological abnormalities) subjected to a prenatal stress and found that prenatally stressedCntnap2+/- female mice showed repetitive behaviors and altered sociability, similar to the homozygote phenotype. Genomic profiling revealed disruptions in hippocampal and striatal 5hmC levels that were correlated to altered transcript levels of genes linked to these phenotypes (e.g.,Reln,Dst,Trio,andEpha5). Chromatin-immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing and hippocampal nuclear lysate pull-down data indicated that 5hmC abundance alters the binding of the transcription factor CLOCK in the promoters of these genes (e.g.,Palld,Gigyf1, andFry), providing a mechanistic role for 5hmC in gene regulation. Together, these data support gene by environment hypotheses for the origins of mental illness and provide a means to identify the elusive factors contributing to complex human diseases.Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press."

Here, we perform genome-wide DNA methylation analyses in blood of AMD patients with a documented smoking history (14 AMD, 16 Normal), identifying loci of differential methylation (DML) with a relaxedp-value criterion (p≤ 10-4). We conduct DNAm age analyses using the Horvath-multi tissue, Hannum and Skin & Blood epigenetic clocks in both blood and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). We perform Ingenuity Pathway Analysis Causal Network Analysis (IPA CNA) on the topmost significantly differentially methylated CpG probes in blood and RPE. Results show poor performance of epigenetic clocks in RPE. Epigenetic age acceleration (EAA) was not observed in AMD. However, we observe positive EAA in blood of smokers, and in smokers with AMD. DML analysis revealed hypomethylation at cg04953735 withinRPTOR(p= 6.51 × 10-5; Δβ = -11.95%). IPA CNA in the RPE also identifiedRPTORas the putative master regulator, predicted to be inhibited in AMD. In conclusion, this is the first study evaluating an association of epigenetic ageing in AMD. We posit a role forRPTORas a common master regulator of methylation changes in the RPE in AMD."

At the genome scale, DNA methylation differences have been reported in ART conceptions at birth, but it is still unclear if those differences remain at childhood. Here, we performed an epigenome-wide DNA methylation association study using Illumina InfiniumEPIC BeadChip to assess the effects of the mode of conception on the methylome of buccal cells from 7- to 8-year-old children (48 children conceived after ART or naturally (control, CTL)) and according to the embryo culture medium in which they were conceived. We identified 127 differentially methylated positions (DMPs) and 16 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) (FDR < 0.05) with low delta beta differences between the two groups (ART vs. CTL). DMPs were preferentially located inside promoter proximal regions and CpG islands and were mostly hypermethylated with ART. We highlighted that the use of distinct embryo culture medium was not associated with DNA methylation differences in childhood. Overall, we bring additional evidence that children conceived via ART display limited genome-wide DNA methylation variation compared with those conceived naturally."

We hypothesize that epigenetic factors are a significant contributor to SLE risk and may be informative for identifying pathogenic mechanisms and therapeutic targets. To test this hypothesis while controlling for genetic background, we performed an epigenome-wide analysis of DNA methylation in genomic DNA from whole blood in three pairs of female monozygotic (MZ) twins of European ancestry, discordant for SLE. Results were replicated on the same array in four cell types from a set of four Danish female MZ twin pairs discordant for SLE. Genes implicated by the epigenetic analyses were then evaluated in 10 independent SLE gene expression datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). There were 59 differentially methylated loci between unaffected and affected MZ twins in whole blood, including 11 novel loci. All but two of these loci were hypomethylated in the SLE twins relative to the unaffected twins. The genes harboring these hypomethylated loci exhibited increased expression in multiple independent datasets of SLE patients. This pattern was largely consistent regardless of disease activity, cell type, or renal tissue type. The genes proximal to CpGs exhibiting differential methylation (DM) in the SLE-discordant MZ twins and exhibiting differential expression (DE) in independent SLE GEO cohorts (DM-DE genes) clustered into two pathways: the nucleic acid-sensing pathway and the type I interferon pathway. The DM-DE genes were also informatically queried for potential gene-drug interactions, yielding a list of 41 drugs including a known SLE therapy. The DM-DE genes delineate two important biologic pathways that are not only reflective of the heterogeneity of SLE but may also correlate with distinct IFN responses that depend on the source, type, and location of nucleic acid molecules and the activated receptors in individual patients. Cell- and tissue-specific analyses will be critical to the understanding of genetic factors dysregulating the nucleic acid-sensing and IFN pathways and whether these factors could be appropriate targets for therapeutic intervention."

Therefore, identifying the 5mC sites in the promoters is a critical step towards further understanding the diverse functions of DNA methylation in genetic diseases such as cancers and aging. However, most wet-lab experimental techniques are often time consuming and laborious for detecting 5mC sites. In this study, we proposed a deep learning-based approach, called BiLSTM-5mC, for accurately identifying 5mC sites in genome-wide DNA promoters. First, we randomly divided the negative samples into 11 subsets of equal size, one of which can form the balance subset by combining with the positive samples in the same amount. Then, two types of feature vectors encoded by the one-hot method, and the nucleotide property and frequency (NPF) methods were fed into a bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) network and a full connection layer to train the 22 submodels. Finally, the outputs of these models were integrated to predict 5mC sites by using the majority vote strategy. Our experimental results demonstrated that BiLSTM-5mC outperformed existing methods based on the same independent dataset."

We identified 524 RNA, 807 methylation sites, 29 proteins, seven cytokines, and 22 metabolites having a significant association with at least one of 14 brain disorders. Simulation analyses indicated that a cross-omics combination of biomarkers had better performance for most disorders, and different disorders could associate with different omics. We identified an 11-methylation-site model for SCZ diagnosis (Area Under Curve, AUC = 0.74) by analyzing selected candidate markers in published datasets (total N = 6098). Moreover, we constructed an 18-methylation-sites model that could predict the prognosis of elders with mild cognitive impairment (hazard ratio = 2.32). We provided an association landscape between blood cross-omic biomarkers and 14 brain disorders as well as a suggestion guide for future clinical discovery and application."

Previously, DNA methylation has been shown as a determinant of telomere-related gene (TRG) expression and TL to assess risk in different types of cancer. We mapped genome-wide DNA methylation in a cohort of newly diagnosed MM (NDMM;n= 53) patients of major molecular subgroups, compared to age-matched healthy donors (n= 4). Differential methylation and expression at TRG-loci were analyzed in combination with overlapping chromatin marks and underlying DNA-sequences. We observed a strong correlation (R2≥ 0.5) between DNA methylation and expression amongst selective TRGs, such that demethylation at the promoters ofDDX1andTERF1were associated to their oncogenic upregulation, while demethylation at the bodies of two key tumor suppressorsZNF208andRAP1Aled to downregulation of the genes. We demonstrated that TRG expression may be controlled by DNA methylation alone or in cooperation with chromatin modifications or CCCTC-binding factor at the regulatory regions. Additionally, we showed that hypomethylated DMRs of TRGs in NDMM are stabilized with G-quadruplex forming sequences, suggesting a crucial role of these epigenetically vulnerable loci in MM pathogenesis. We have identified a panel of five TRGs, which are epigenetically deregulated in NDMM patients and may serve as early detection biomarkers or therapeutic targets in the disease."

Accumulating data indicate that klotho is a tumor suppressor in a wide array of malignancies, and designate the subdomain KL1 as the active region of the protein towards this activity. We aimed to study the role of klotho as a tumor suppressor in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Bioinformatics analyses of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets revealed a correlation between the survival of PDAC patients, levels of klotho expression, and DNA methylation, and demonstrated a unique hypermethylation pattern of klotho in pancreatic tumors. The in vivo effects of klotho and KL1 were examined using three mouse models. Employing a novel genetic model, combining pancreatic klotho knockdown with a mutation in Kras, the lack of klotho contributed to PDAC generation and decreased mousece survival. In a xenograft model, administration of viral particles carrying sKL, a spliced klotho isoform containing the KL1 domain, inhibited pancreatic tumors. Lastly, treatment with soluble sKL prolonged survival of Pdx1-Cre; KrasG12D/+;Trp53R172H/+(KPC) mice, a model known to recapitulate human PDAC. In conclusion, this study provides evidence that klotho is a tumor suppressor in PDAC. Furthermore, these data suggest that the levels of klotho expression and DNA methylation could have prognostic value in PDAC patients, and that administration of exogenous sKL may serve as a novel therapeutic strategy to treat PDAC."

This study aimed to determine whether the methylation signature of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) prior to and after the first cycle of DOX-based chemotherapy could predict the risk of cardiotoxicity in breast cancer patients. Cardiotoxicity was defined as a decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) by >10%. DNA methylation of PBMCs from 9 patients with abnormal LVEF and 10 patients with normal LVEF were examined using Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. We have identified 14,883 differentially methylated CpGs at baseline and 18,718 CpGs after the first cycle of chemotherapy, which significantly correlated with LVEF status. Significant differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were found in the promoter and the gene body of SLFN12, IRF6 and RNF39 in patients with abnormal LVEF. The pathway analysis found enrichment for regulation of transcription, mRNA splicing, pathways in cancer and ErbB2/4 signaling. The preliminary results from this study showed that the DNA methylation profile of PBMCs may predict the risk of DOX-induced cardiotoxicity prior to chemotherapy. Further studies with larger cohorts of patients are needed to confirm these findings."

Recent advances in genome-wide methylation methods have revealed that aberrant changes in the pattern of DNA methylation play an important role in many aspects of cancer progression, including cell proliferation and migration, evasion of cell death, invasion, and metastasization. The purpose of the current review was to gather evidence regarding the usefulness of DNA methylation tracking in liquid biopsy as a potential biomarker in melanoma. We investigated the key genes and signal transduction pathways that have been found to be altered epigenetically in melanoma. We then highlighted the circulating tumor components present in blood, including circulating melanoma cells (CMC), circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), and tumor-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs), as a valuable source for identifying relevant aberrations in DNA methylation. Finally, we focused on DNA methylation signatures as a marker for tracking response to therapy and resistance, thus facilitating personalized medicine and decision-making in the treatment of melanoma patients."

Here, we analyzed genome-wide DNA methylation and transcriptome data to reveal the epigenetic basis of disease pathways that may lead to benign or malignant GTDs. RNA-Seq, mRNA microarray, and Human Methylation 450 BeadChip data from complete moles and choriocarcinoma cells were bioinformatically analyzed. Paraffin-embedded tissues from complete moles and control placentas were used for tissue microarray construction, DNMT3B immunostaining and immunoscoring. We found that DNA methylation increases with disease severity in GTDs. Differentially expressed genes are mainly upregulated in moles while predominantly downregulated in choriocarcinoma. DNA methylation principally influences the gene expression of villous trophoblast differentiation-related or predominantly placenta-expressed genes in moles and choriocarcinoma cells. Affected genes in these subsets shared focal adhesion and actin cytoskeleton pathways in moles and choriocarcinoma. In moles, cell cycle and differentiation regulatory pathways, essential for trophoblast/placental development, were enriched. In choriocarcinoma cells, hormone biosynthetic, extracellular matrix-related, hypoxic gene regulatory, and differentiation-related signaling pathways were enriched. In moles, we found slight upregulation of DNMT3B protein, a developmentally important de novo DNA methylase, which is strongly overexpressed in choriocarcinoma cells that may partly be responsible for the large DNA methylation differences. Our findings provide new insights into the shared and disparate molecular pathways of disease in GTDs and may help in designing new diagnostic and therapeutic tools."

We mapped epigenome changes and identified 23,394 and 13,133 peaks in ND and T2D individuals, respectively. Out of all the peaks, 753 domains near the transcription start site (TSS) were unique to T2D. We found that T2D in atherosclerosis leads to an H3K9ac increase in 118, and loss in 63 genomic regions. Furthermore, we discovered an association between the genomic locations of significant H3K9ac changes with genetic variants identified in previous T2D GWAS. The transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) rs7903146, together with several human leukocyte antigen (HLA) variants, were among the domains with the most dramatic changes of H3K9ac enrichments. Pathway analysis revealed multiple activated pathways involved in immunity, including type 1 diabetes. Our results present novel evidence on the interaction between genetics and epigenetics, as well as epigenetic changes related to immunity in patients with T2D and advanced atherosclerotic disease."

African American men have higher incidence and mortality rates of PCa than other racial groups in U.S. The goal of this study was to identify differentially methylated CpG sites and genes between clinically defined aggressive and nonaggressive PCa in African Americans. We performed genome-wide DNA methylation profiling in leukocyte DNA from 280 African American PCa patients using Illumina MethylationEPIC array that contains about 860K CpG sties. There was a slight increase of overall methylation level (mean β value) with the increasing Gleason scores (GS = 6, GS = 7, GS ≥ 8, P for trend = 0.002). There were 78 differentially methylated CpG sites with P < 10-4and 9 sites with P < 10-5in the trend test. We also found 77 differentially methylated regions/genes (DMRs), including 10 homeobox genes and six zinc finger protein genes. A gene ontology (GO) molecular pathway enrichment analysis of these 77 DMRs found that the main enriched pathway was DNA-binding transcriptional factor activity. A few representative DMRs include HOXD8, SOX11, ZNF-471, and ZNF-577. Our study suggests that leukocyte DNA methylation may be valuable biomarkers for aggressive PCa and the identified differentially methylated genes provide biological insights into the modulation of immune response by aggressive PCa."

Its incidence in China has been increasing yearly, and the identification of early-stage biomarkers is urgently required.ANOVA was carried out in the case of a primary tumor, adjacent normal tissue, and tumor metastasis of breast cancer, and on pan-cancer samples using the genome-wide methylation data of 31 solid tumor Illumina Methylation 450K chips downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) website in September 2018. Methylation sites showing a significant difference (P ≤ 0.05) were screened and compared with the whole-genome methylation data of 31 other solid tumor species in the TCGA database using t-tests in order to screen the methylation sites of breast cancer-specific expression. The expression of the screened methylation sites was confirmed through pyrosequencing in 45 cases of breast cancer, lung cancer, gastric cancer, and colorectal cancer.A total of 10 specific breast cancer methylation sites (cg13683194, cg07996594, cg21646032, cg07671949, cg21185686, cg03625109, cg16429070, cg23601468, cg24818566, and cg01240931) were analyzed; nine genes (C9orf125, RARB, ESR1, RUNX3, PCDHGB7, DBC1, PDGFRB, TIMP3, and APC) were involved. The overall effect was excellent; a total of 4 methylation sites (2 in the DBC1 gene [cg03625109 and cg24818566], 1 in the C9orf125 gene [cg13683194], and 1 in the PDGFRB gene [cg16429070]) could effectively distinguish breast cancer from 31 other cancer species. The pyrosequencing results revealed that 7 screened methylation sites could significantly distinguish between breast cancer, lung cancer, gastric cancer, and colorectal cancer samples; these sites could also specifically distinguish between luminal A, luminal B, HER2, and Basal-like types of breast cancer.The 10 breast cancer methylation sites screened in the present study can effectively distinguish breast cancer from 31 other solid tumors, and they are expected to be used as biomarkers for early screening of breast cancer.© 2021 Wang et al."

Recurrent loss-of-function mutations in TET proteins are frequent in human diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Here, we investigate the role of TET proteins in B cell homeostasis and development of B cell lymphomas with features of DLBCL. We show that deletion of Tet2 and Tet3 genes in mature B cells in mice perturbs B cell homeostasis and results in spontaneous development of germinal center (GC)-derived B cell lymphomas with increased G-quadruplexes and R-loops. At a genome-wide level, G-quadruplexes and R-loops were associated with increased DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) at immunoglobulin switch regions. Deletion of the DNA methyltransferase DNMT1 in TET-deficient B cells prevented expansion of GC B cells, diminished the accumulation of G-quadruplexes and R-loops and delayed B lymphoma development, consistent with the opposing functions of DNMT and TET enzymes in DNA methylation and demethylation. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-mediated depletion of nucleases and helicases that regulate G-quadruplexes and R-loops decreased the viability of TET-deficient B cells. Our studies suggest a molecular mechanism by which TET loss of function might predispose to the development of B cell malignancies.© 2021.

Using extensive DNA methylation data from the ALSPAC child cohort, we characterized the genome-wide landscape of DNA methylation variations associated with the duration of exclusive breastfeeding and assessed whether these variations mediate the association between exclusive breastfeeding and BMI over different epochs of child growth.Exclusive breastfeeding elicits more substantial DNA methylation variations during infancy than at other periods of child growth. At the genome-wide level, 13 CpG sites in girls (miR-21, SNAPC3, ATP6V0A1, DHX15/PPARGC1A, LINC00398/ALOX5AP, FAM238C, NATP/NAT2, CUX1, TRAPPC9, OSBPL1A, ZNF185, FAM84A, PDPK1) and 2 CpG sites in boys (IL16 and NREP), mediate the association between exclusive breastfeeding and longitudinal BMI. We found enrichment of CpG sites located within miRNAs and key pathways (AMPK signaling pathway, insulin signaling pathway, endocytosis). Overall DNA methylation variation corresponding to 3 to 5 months of exclusive breastfeeding was associated with slower BMI growth the first 6 years of life compared to no breastfeeding and in a dose-response manner with exclusive breastfeeding duration.Our study confirmed the early postnatal period as a critical developmental period associated with substantial DNA methylation variations, which in turn could mitigate the development of overweight and obesity from infancy to early childhood. Since an accelerated growth during these developmental periods has been linked to the development of sustained obesity later in life, exclusive breastfeeding could have a major role in preventing the risks of overweight/obesity and children and adults through DNA methylation mechanisms occurring early in life.© 2021.

"34934057","The long noncoding RNA H19 regulates tumor plasticity in neuroendocrine prostate cancer.","Nat Commun","Neuroendocrine (NE) prostate cancer (NEPC) is a lethal subtype of castration-resistant prostate cancer (PCa) arising either de novo or from transdifferentiated prostate adenocarcinoma following androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Extensive computational analysis has identified a high degree of association between the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) H19 and NEPC, with the longest isoform highly expressed in NEPC. H19 regulates PCa lineage plasticity by driving a bidirectional cell identity of NE phenotype (H19 overexpression) or luminal phenotype (H19 knockdown). It contributes to treatment resistance, with the knockdown of H19 re-sensitizing PCa to ADT. It is also essential for the proliferation and invasion of NEPC. H19 levels are negatively regulated by androgen signaling via androgen receptor (AR). When androgen is absent SOX2 levels increase, driving H19 transcription and facilitating transdifferentiation. H19 facilitates the PRC2 complex in regulating methylation changes at H3K27me3/H3K4me3 histone sites of AR-driven and NEPC-related genes. Additionally, this lncRNA induces alterations in genome-wide DNA methylation on CpG sites, further regulating genes associated with the NEPC phenotype. Our clinical data identify H19 as a candidate diagnostic marker and predictive marker of NEPC with elevated H19 levels associated with an increased probability of biochemical recurrence and metastatic disease in patients receiving ADT. Here we report H19 as an early upstream regulator of cell fate, plasticity, and treatment resistance in NEPC that can reverse/transform cells to a treatable form of PCa once therapeutically deactivated.© 2021.

To address this, we developed Accessible Region Conformation Capture (ARC-C), which profiles interactions between regulatory elements genome-wide without a capture step. Applied toCaenorhabditis elegans, ARC-C identifies approximately 15,000 significant interactions between regulatory elements at 500-bp resolution. Of 105 TFs or chromatin regulators tested, we find that the binding sites of 60 are enriched for interacting with each other, making them candidates for mediating interactions. These include cohesin and condensin II. Applying ARC-C to a mutant of transcription factor BLMP-1 detected changes in interactions between its targets. ARC-C simultaneously profiles domain-level architecture, and we observe thatC. eleganschromatin domains defined by either active or repressive modifications form topologically associating domains (TADs) that interact with A/B (active/inactive) compartment-like structure. Furthermore, we discover that inactive compartment interactions are dependent on H3K9 methylation. ARC-C is a powerful new tool to interrogate genome architecture and regulatory interactions at high resolution.© 2022 Huang et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press."

The mechanism of KSHV-induced oncogenesis remains unclear. By performing a CRISPR-Cas9 screening in a model of KSHV-induced cellular transformation of primary cells, we identified epigenetic regulators that were essential for KSHV-induced cellular transformation. Examination of TCGA data sets of the top 9 genes, including glutamate-rich WD repeat containing 1 (GRWD1), a WD40 family protein upregulated by KSHV, that had positive effects on cell proliferation and survival of KSHV-transformed cells (KMM) but not the matched primary cells (MM), uncovered the predictive values of their expressions for patient survival in numerous types of cancer. We revealed global epigenetic remodeling including H3K4me3 epigenetic active mark in KMM cells compared to MM cells. Knockdown of GRWD1 inhibited cell proliferation, cellular transformation, and tumor formation and caused downregulation of global H3K4me3 mark in KMM cells. GRWD1 interacted with WD repeat domain 5 (WDR5), the core protein of H3K4 methyltransferase complex, and several H3K4me3 methyltransferases, including myeloid leukemia 2 (MLL2). Knockdown of WDR5 and MLL2 phenocopied GRWD1 knockdown, caused global reduction of H3K4me3 mark, and altered the expression of similar sets of genes. Transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) analyses further identified common and distinct cellular genes and pathways that were regulated by GRWD1, WDR5, and MLL2. These results indicate that KSHV hijacks the GRWD1-WDR5-MLL2 epigenetic complex to regulate H3K4me3 methylation of specific genes, which is essential for KSHV-induced cellular transformation. Our work has identified an epigenetic complex as a novel therapeutic target for KSHV-induced cancers.IMPORTANCEBy performing a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screening, we have identified cellular epigenetic regulators that are essential for KSHV-induced cellular transformation. Among them, GRWD1 regulates epigenetic active mark H3K4me3 by interacting with WDR5 and MLL2 and recruiting them to chromatin loci of specific genes in KSHV-transformed cells. Hence, KSHV hijacks the GRWD1-WDR5-MLL2 complex to remodel cellular epigenome and induce cellular transformation. Since the dysregulation of GRWD1 is associated with poor prognosis in several types of cancer, GRWD1 might also be a critical driver in other viral or nonviral cancers."

There is a pressing need to develop more precise risk assessment methods to tailor clinical treatment. Epigenome-wide association studies in OSCC have not produced a viable biomarker. These studies have relied on methylation array platforms, which are limited in their ability to profile the methylome. In this study, we use MethylCap-Seq (MC-Seq), a comprehensive methylation quantification technique, and brush swab samples, to develop a noninvasive, readily translatable approach to profile the methylome in OSCC patients.Three OSCC patients underwent collection of cancer and contralateral normal tissue and brush swab biopsies, totaling 4 samples for each patient. Epigenome-wide DNA methylation quantification was performed using the SureSelectXT Methyl-Seq platform. DNA quality and methylation site resolution were compared between brush swab and tissue samples. Correlation and methylation value difference were determined for brush swabs vs. tissues for each respective patient and site (i.e., cancer or normal). Correlations were calculated between cancer and normal tissues and brush swab samples for each patient to determine the robustness of DNA methylation marks using brush swabs in clinical biomarker studies.There were no significant differences in DNA yield between tissue and brush swab samples. Mapping efficiency exceeded 90% across all samples, with no differences between tissue and brush swabs. The average number of CpG sites with at least 10x depth of coverage was 2,716,674 for brush swabs and 2,903,261 for tissues. Matched tissue and brush swabs had excellent correlation (r = 0.913 for cancer samples and r = 0.951 for normal samples). The methylation profile of the top 1000 CpGs was significantly different between cancer and normal samples (mean p-value = 0.00021) but not different between tissues and brush swabs (mean p-value = 0.11).Our results demonstrate that MC-Seq is an efficient platform for epigenome profiling in cancer biomarker studies, with broader methylome coverage than array-based platforms. Brush swab biopsy provides adequate DNA yield for MC-Seq, and taken together, our findings set the stage for development of a non-invasive methylome quantification technique for oral cancer with high translational potential.© 2021.

Epigenetics involves alterations in gene expression without altering the DNA sequence. DNA methylation is a critical epigenetic mechanism that influences both viral and host factors. This review has five focal points, which examines (i) fluctuations in the expression of methylation modifying factors upon HIV infection (ii) the effect of DNA methylation on HIV viral genes and (iii) host genome (iv) inferences from other infectious and non-communicable diseases, we provide a list of HIV-associated host genes that are regulated by methylation in other disease models (v) the potential of DNA methylation as an epi-therapeutic strategy and biomarker. DNA methylation has also been shown to serve as a robust therapeutic strategy and precision medicine biomarker against diseases such as cancer and autoimmune conditions. Despite new drugs being discovered for HIV, drug resistance is a problem in high disease burden settings such as Sub-Saharan Africa. Furthermore, genetic therapies that are under investigation are irreversible and may have off target effects. Alternative therapies that are nongenetic are essential.

Passive DNA demethylation has been suggested as one of the mechanisms implicated in the development of these conditions, and most studies have investigated this relationship in older adult populations. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the relationship between corporal composition and biochemical and haematological indicators with plasma homocysteine levels and genome-wide methylation (Alu, LINE-1, and SAT2) in a population of healthy young adults (median age, 18 years). We showed that the prevalence of hyperhomocysteinemia was significantly higher in men (18.5%) than in women (6.6%) (P= 0.034). Increased Hcy level was substantially associated with higher levels of body mass index and visceral fat in females, whereas in males, it was significantly associated with reduced red cell distribution width and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (HDL-C) levels and increased low-density lipoprotein/HDL ratio. Hypomethylation of Alu was significantly associated with reduced levels of HDL-C (<40.0 mg dL-1), whereas hypomethylation of LINE-1 and SAT2 was significantly associated with higher levels of skeletal muscle (<39.3%) in males. These results highlight the participation of hormonal factors in regulating Hcy metabolism, primarily in the female population, whereas changes in DNA methylation observed in males might be associated with the consumption of a protein diet with high levels of methionine, independent of increased Hcy levels."

In plant tissue culture, variation of DNA methylation is a potential source of phenotypic variation in regenerated plants. However, the genome wide dynamic methylation patterns of strawberry tissue culture remain unclear. In this study, we used whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) to study genomic DNA methylation changes of a wild strawberryFragaria nilgerrensisat six stages: from explants of shoot tips to outplanting and acclimation. Global methylation levels showed that CG sites exhibited the highest methylation level in all stages with an average of 49.5%, followed by CHG (33.2%) and CHH (12.4%). Although CHH accounted for the lowest proportion of total cytosine methylation, it showed the most obvious methylation change and the most of these changes occurred in the transposable element regions. The overall methylation levels alternately decreased and increased during the entire tissue culture process and the distribution of DNA methylation was non-uniform among different genetic regions. Furthermore, much more differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were detected in dedifferentiation and redifferentiation stages and most of them were transposable elements, suggesting these processes involved activating or silencing of amounts of transposons. The functional enrichment of the DMR-related genes indicated that genes involved in hormone metabolic processes, plant development and the stress response changed methylation throughout the tissue culture process. Finally, the quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was conducted to examine the association of methylation and gene expression of a set of different methylated genes.

SAP predication models were built based on cfDNA methylation and conventional blood biomarkers separately and in combination.We identified 565 and 59 cfDNA methylation markers informative for acute pancreatitis and its severity. These markers were used to develop prediction models for AP and SAP with area under the receiver operating characteristic of 0.92 and 0.81, respectively. Twelve blood biomarkers were systematically screened for a predictor of SAP with a sensitivity of 87.5% for SAP, and a specificity of 100% in mild acute pancreatitis, significantly higher than existing blood tests. An expanded model integrating 12 conventional blood biomarkers with 59 cfDNA methylation markers further improved the SAP prediction sensitivity to 92.2%.These findings have demonstrated that accurate prediction of SAP by the integration of conventional and novel blood molecular markers, paving the way for early and effective SAP intervention through a non-invasive rapid diagnostic test.© 2021.

However, their contribution to MS pathogenesis remains poorly understood partly because of sample heterogeneity and limited coverage of array-based methods. To fill this gap, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of genome-wide DNA methylation patterns in four peripheral immune cell populations isolated from 29 MS patients at clinical disease onset and 24 healthy controls. We show that B cells from new-onset untreated MS cases display more significant methylation changes than other disease-implicated immune cell types, consisting of a global DNA hypomethylation signature. Importantly, 4,933 MS-associated differentially methylated regions in B cells were identified, and this epigenetic signature underlies specific genetic programs involved in B cell differentiation and activation. Integration of the methylome to changes in gene expression and susceptibility-associated regions further indicates that hypomethylated regions are significantly associated with the up-regulation of cell activation transcriptional programs. Altogether, these findings implicate aberrant B cell function in MS etiology.Copyright © 2021 the Author(s). Published by PNAS."

Compared to the reference genome (NC_007605), a total of 3995 variations were detected across pLELC-derived EBV sequences, with the mutational hotspots located in latent genes. Combined with 180 published EBV sequences derived from healthy people in Southern China, we performed a genome-wide association study and identified 32 variations significantly related to pLELC (p< 2.56×10-05, Bonferroni correction), with the top signal of SNP coordinate T7327C (OR = 1.22,p= 2.39×10-15) locating in the origin of plasmid replication (OriP). The results of population structure analysis of EBV isolates in East Asian showed the EBV strains derived from pLELC were more similar to those from nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) than other EBV-associated diseases. In addition, typical latency type-II infection were recognized for EBV of pLELC at both transcription and methylation levels.

"34906904","Analysis of DNA methylation in potato tuber in response to light exposure during storage.","Plant Physiol Biochem","Exposure to light induces tuber greening and the accumulation of the toxic alkaloid Solanine in potato (Solanum tuberosum L) during storage greatly reduce tuber value. While the mechanism of this greening process remains unclear, it is well understood that DNA methylation plays an important role in regulating gene expression in response to environmental conditions. In this study, methylation-sensitive amplified polymorphism was used to assess the effect of light exposure on DNA methylation during storage of potato tubers. Light-induced genome-wide DNA demethylation and the rate of DNA methylation decreased with long storage times. Following, the sequencing of 14 differentially amplified fragments and analysis using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool, eight genomic sequences and six annotated fragment sequences were identified. The latter included ADP glucose pyrophosphorylase 1/2, chlorophyllide a oxygenase 1 (CAO1), receptor-like protein kinase HAIKU2, and repressor of GA4, all of which are involved in starch biosynthesis, chlorophyll synthesis, endosperm development, and gibberellic acid signaling, respectively. Demethylation was observed in the CpG island (-273 to -166 bp) of the CAO1 promoter in response to light, which further confirmed that the variations in genome methylation are dependent upon the light exposure and suggests a direct role for DNA methylation.

Twenty-five affected individuals carrying a variant of uncertain significance, did not show a methylation profile matching any of the known episignatures. Three additional variant of uncertain significance cases with an identified KDM6A variant were re-classified as likely pathogenic (n = 2) or re-assigned as Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome (n = 1). Thirty of the 33 Next Generation Sequencing negative cases did not match a defined episignature while three matched Kabuki syndrome, Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome and BAFopathy respectively.With the expanding clinical utility of the EpiSign assay, DNA methylation analysis should be considered part of the testing cascade for individuals presenting with clinical features of Mendelian chromatinopathy disorders.Copyright © 2021 American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics.

"34904755","Early-life thermal stress mediates long-term alterations in hypothalamic microglia.","Glia","Stressful environmental events in early life have long-lasting consequences on later stress responses. We previously showed that heat conditioning of 3-day-old chicks during the critical period of heat-response development leads to heat vulnerability later in life. Here we assessed the role of early-life heat stress on the inflammatory response in the chick anterior hypothalamus (AH), focusing on hypothalamic microglia. We identified the microglial cell population in the chick AH using anti-KUL01 and anti-CD45 antibodies. Specific microglial features were also confirmed by expression of their signature genes. Under normal environmental conditions, hypothalamic microglia isolated from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-injected chicks displayed a classical activated proinflammatory profile accompanied by a decreased homeostatic signature, demonstrating similarity of immune response with mammalian microglial cells. In accordance with our previous observations, conditioning of 3-day-old chicks under high ambient temperature decreased the number of newborn cells in the AH, among them microglial precursors. Although heat exposure did not affect microglial cell viability, it had a long-term impact on LPS-induced inflammatory response. Exposure to harsh heat led to heat vulnerability, and attenuated recruitment of peripheral monocytes and T cells into the AH following LPS challenge. Moreover, heat conditioning altered microglial reactivity, manifested as suppressed microglial activation in response to LPS. Innate immune memory developed by heat conditioning might underlie suppression of the microglial response to LPS challenge. We describe alterations in genome-wide CpG methylation profile of hypothalamic microglia, demonstrating probable epigenetic involvement in the reprogramming of microglial function, leading to heat-induced inflammatory cross-tolerance.© 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC."
"34903243","Longitudinal DNA methylation dynamics as a practical indicator in clinical epigenetics.","Clin Epigenetics","One of the fundamental assumptions of DNA methylation in clinical epigenetics is that DNA methylation status can change over time with or without interplay with environmental and clinical conditions. However, little is known about how DNA methylation status changes over time under ordinary environmental and clinical conditions. In this study, we revisited the high frequency longitudinal DNA methylation data of two Japanese males (24 time-points within three months) and characterized the longitudinal dynamics.The results showed that the majority of CpGs on Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip probe set were longitudinally stable over the time period of three months. Focusing on dynamic and stable CpGs extracted from datasets, dynamic CpGs were more likely to be reported as epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) markers of various traits, especially those of immune- and inflammatory-related traits; meanwhile, the stable CpGs were enriched in metabolism-related genes and were less likely to be EWAS markers, indicating that the stable CpGs are stable both in the short-term within individuals and under various environmental and clinical conditions.This study indicates that CpGs with different stabilities are involved in different functions and traits, and thus, they are potential indicators that can be applied for clinical epigenetic studies to outline underlying mechanisms.© 2021.

"34901024","DNA Methylation Signature in Monozygotic Twins Discordant for Psoriatic Disease.","Front Cell Dev Biol","Background:Psoriatic disease is a multifactorial inflammatory condition spanning from skin and nail psoriasis (Pso) to spine and joint involvement characterizing psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Monozygotic twins provide a model to investigate genetic, early life environmental exposure and stochastic influences to complex diseases, mainly mediated by epigenetics.Methods:We performed a genome-wide DNA methylation study on whole blood of monozygotic twins from 7 pairs discordant for Pso/PsA using the Infinium Methylation EPIC array (Illumina). MeDiP-qPCR was used to confirm specific signals. Data were replicated in an independent cohort of seven patients with Pso/PsA and 3 healthy controls. Transcriptomic profiling was performed by RNAsequence on the same 7 monozygotic twin pairs.Results:We identified 2,564 differentially methylated positions between psoriatic disease and controls, corresponding to 1,703 genes, 59% within gene bodies. There were 19 regions with at least two DMPs within 1 kb of distance and significant within-pair Δβ-values (p< 0.005), among them SNX25, BRG1 and SMAD3 genes, all involved in TGF-β signaling pathway, were identified. Co-expression analyses on transcriptome data identified IL-6/JAK/STAT3 and TNF-α pathways as important signaling axes involved in the disease, and they also suggested an altered glucose metabolism in patients' immune cells, characteristic of pro-inflammatory T lymphocytes.Conclusion:The study suggests the presence of an epigenetic signature in affected individuals, pointing to genes involved in immunological and inflammatory responses. This result is also supported by transcriptome data, that altogether suggest a higher activation state of the immune system, that could promote the disease status.Copyright © 2021 Vecellio, Paraboschi, Ceribelli, Isailovic, Motta, Cardamone, Robusto, Asselta, Brescianini, Sacrini, Costanzo, De Santis, Stazi, Duga and Selmi."
"34901003","Crosstalk Between Inflammatory Signaling and Methylation in Cancer.","Front Cell Dev Biol","Inflammation is an intricate immune response against infection and tissue damage. While the initial immune response is important for preventing tumorigenesis, chronic inflammation is implicated in cancer pathogenesis. It has been linked to various stages of tumor development including transformation, proliferation, angiogenesis, and metastasis. Immune cells, through the production of inflammatory mediators such as cytokines, chemokines, transforming growth factors, and adhesion molecules contribute to the survival, growth, and progression of the tumor in its microenvironment. The aberrant expression and secretion of pro-inflammatory and growth factors by the tumor cells result in the recruitment of immune cells, thus creating a mutual crosstalk. The reciprocal signaling between the tumor cells and the immune cells creates and maintains a successful tumor niche. Many inflammatory factors are regulated by epigenetic mechanisms including DNA methylation and histone modifications. In particular, DNA and histone methylation are crucial forms of transcriptional regulation and aberrant methylation has been associated with deregulated gene expression in oncogenesis. Such deregulations have been reported in both solid tumors and hematological malignancies. With technological advancements to study genome-wide epigenetic landscapes, it is now possible to identify molecular mechanisms underlying altered inflammatory profiles in cancer. In this review, we discuss the role of DNA and histone methylation in regulation of inflammatory pathways in human cancers and review the merits and challenges of targeting inflammatory mediators as well as epigenetic regulators in cancer.Copyright © 2021 Das, Karthik and Taneja."

Few ASD studies have considered prospective designs with DNA methylation measured in multiple tissues and tested overlap with ASD genetic risk loci.Objectives:To estimate associations between DNA methylation in maternal blood, cord blood, and placenta and later diagnosis of ASD, and to evaluate enrichment of ASD-associated DNA methylation for known ASD-associated genes.Methods:In the Early Autism Risk Longitudinal Investigation (EARLI), an ASD-enriched risk birth cohort, genome-scale maternal blood (earlyn= 140 and laten= 75 pregnancy), infant cord blood (n= 133), and placenta (maternaln= 106 and fetaln= 107 compartments) DNA methylation was assessed on the Illumina 450k HumanMethylation array and compared to ASD diagnosis at 36 months of age. Differences in site-specific and global methylation were tested with ASD, as well as enrichment of single site associations for ASD risk genes (n= 881) from the Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative (SFARI) database.Results:No individual DNA methylation site was associated with ASD at genome-wide significance, however, individual DNA methylation sites nominally associated with ASD (P< 0.05) in each tissue were highly enriched for SFARI genes (cord bloodP= 7.9 × 10-29, maternal blood early pregnancyP= 6.1 × 10-27, maternal blood late pregnancyP= 2.8 × 10-16, maternal placentaP= 5.6 × 10-15, fetal placentaP= 1.3 × 10-20). DNA methylation sites nominally associated with ASD across all five tissues overlapped at 144 (29.5%) SFARI genes.Conclusion:DNA methylation sites nominally associated with later ASD diagnosis in multiple tissues were enriched for ASD risk genes.

"34895303","Genome-wide methylation patterns in Marfan syndrome.","Clin Epigenetics","Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a connective tissue disorder caused by mutations in the Fibrillin-1 gene (FBN1). Here, we undertook the first epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) in patients with MFS aiming at identifying DNA methylation loci associated with MFS phenotypes that may shed light on the disease process.The Illumina 450 k DNA-methylation array was used on stored peripheral whole-blood samples of 190 patients with MFS originally included in the COMPARE trial. An unbiased genome-wide approach was used, and methylation of CpG-sites across the entire genome was evaluated. Additionally, we investigated CpG-sites across the FBN1-locus (15q21.1) more closely, since this is the gene defective in MFS. Differentially Methylated Positions (DMPs) and Differentially Methylated Regions (DMRs) were identified through regression analysis. Associations between methylation levels and aortic diameters and presence or absence of 21 clinical features of MFS at baseline were analyzed. Moreover, associations between aortic diameter change, and the occurrence of clinical events (death any cause, type-A or -B dissection/rupture, or aortic surgery) and methylation levels were analyzed.We identified 28 DMPs that are significantly associated with aortic diameters in patients with MFS. Seven of these DMPs (25%) could be allocated to a gene that was previously associated with cardiovascular diseases (HDAC4, IGF2BP3, CASZ1, SDK1, PCDHGA1, DIO3, PTPRN2). Moreover, we identified seven DMPs that were significantly associated with aortic diameter change and five DMP's that associated with clinical events. No significant associations at p < 10-8or p < 10-6were found with any of the non-cardiovascular phenotypic MFS features. Investigating DMRs, clusters were seen mostly on X- and Y, and chromosome 18-22. The remaining DMRs indicated involvement of a large family of protocadherins on chromosome 5, which were not reported in MFS before.This EWAS in patients with MFS has identified a number of methylation loci significantly associated with aortic diameters, aortic dilatation rate and aortic events. Our findings add to the slowly growing literature on the regulation of gene expression in MFS patients.© 2021. The Author(s)."

We analysed associations between newborn DNA methylation (DNAm), neonatal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) neuroimaging data, and neurodevelopment.Neurodevelopment was assessed in 161 children from the South African Drakenstein Child Health Study at 2 years of age using the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development III. We performed an epigenome-wide association study of neurodevelopmental delay using DNAm from cord blood. Subsequently, we analysed if associations between DNAm and neurodevelopmental delay were mediated by altered neonatal brain volumes (subset of 51 children).Differential DNAm atSPTBN4(cg26971411,Δbeta = -0.024,p-value = 3.28 × 10-08), and two intergenic regions (chromosome 11: cg00490349,Δbeta = -0.036,p-value = 3.02 × 10-08; chromosome 17: cg15660740,Δbeta = -0.078,p-value = 6.49 × 10-08) were significantly associated with severe neurodevelopmental delay. While these associations were not mediated by neonatal brain volume, neonatal caudate volumes were independently associated with neurodevelopmental delay, particularly in language (Δcaudate volume = 165.30 mm3,p = 0.0443) and motor (Δcaudate volume = 365.36 mm3,p-value = 0.0082) domains.Differential DNAm from cord blood and increased neonatal caudate volumes were independently associated with severe neurodevelopmental delay at 2 years of age. These findings suggest that neurobiological signals for severe developmental delay may be detectable in very early life."
"34894232","Identification of Novel Regulatory Regions Induced by Intrauterine Growth Restriction in Rat Islets.","Endocrinology","Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) leads to the development of type 2 diabetes in adulthood, and the permanent alterations in gene expression implicate an epigenetic mechanism. Using a rat model of IUGR, we performed TrueSeq-HELP Tagging to assess the association of DNA methylation changes and gene dysregulation in islets. We identified 511 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and 4377 significantly altered single CpG sites. Integrating the methylome and our published transcriptome data sets resulted in the identification of pathways critical for islet function. The identified DMRs were enriched with transcription factor binding motifs, such as Elk1, Etv1, Foxa1, Foxa2, Pax7, Stat3, Hnf1, and AR. In silico analysis of 3-dimensional chromosomal interactions using human pancreas and islet Hi-C data sets identified interactions between 14 highly conserved DMRs and 35 genes with significant expression changes at an early age, many of which persisted in adult islets. In adult islets, there were far more interactions between DMRs and genes with significant expression changes identified with Hi-C, and most of them were critical to islet metabolism and insulin secretion. The methylome was integrated with our published genome-wide histone modification data sets from IUGR islets, resulting in further characterization of important regulatory regions of the genome altered by IUGR containing both significant changes in DNA methylation and specific histone marks. We identified novel regulatory regions in islets after exposure to IUGR, suggesting that epigenetic changes at key transcription factor binding motifs and other gene regulatory regions may contribute to gene dysregulation and an abnormal islet phenotype in IUGR rats.© The Author(s) 2021.

"34894053","Genome-wide methylomic analyses identify prognostic epigenetic signature in lower grade glioma.","J Cell Mol Med","Glioma is the most malignant and aggressive type of brain tumour with high heterogeneity and mortality. Although some clinicopathological factors have been identified as prognostic biomarkers, the individual variants and risk stratification in patients with lower grade glioma (LGG) have not been fully elucidated. The primary aim of this study was to identify an efficient DNA methylation combination biomarker for risk stratification and prognosis in LGG. We conducted a retrospective cohort study by analysing whole genome DNA methylation data of 646 patients with LGG from the TCGA and GEO database. Cox proportional hazard analysis was carried out to screen and construct biomarker model that predicted overall survival (OS). The Kaplan-Meier survival curves and time-dependent ROC were constructed to prove the efficiency of the signature. Then, another independent cohort was used to further validate the finding. A two-CpG site DNA methylation signature was identified by multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis. Further analysis indicated that the signature was an independent survival predictor from other clinical factors and exhibited higher predictive accuracy compared with known biomarkers. This signature was significantly correlated with immune-checkpoint blockade, immunotherapy-related signatures and ferroptosis regulator genes. The expression pattern and functional analysis showed that these two genes corresponding with two methylation sites contained in the model were correlated with immune infiltration level, and involved in MAPK and Rap1 signalling pathway. The signature may contribute to improve the risk stratification of patients and provide a more accurate assessment for precision medicine in the clinic.© 2021 The Authors.

In contrast to genetics, the environment can have dramatic impacts on epigenetics that associate with disease etiology. The current study used buccal cells and purified blood monocytes from two different clinical cohorts involving Caucasian or African American female populations with or without arthritis. The differential DNA methylation regions (DMRs) between the control and RA populations were identified with an epigenome-wide association study. The DMRs (i.e., epimutations) identified in the buccal cells and monocytes were found to be distinct. The DMR associated genes were identified and many have previously been shown to be associated with arthritis. Observations demonstrate DNA methylation epimutation RA biomarkers are cell type specific and similar findings were observed with the two racial background populations. Rheumatoid arthritis susceptibility epigenetic diagnosis appears feasible and may improve the clinical management of RA and allowpreventative medicine considerations.© 2021. The Author(s)."
"34890771","Maternal obesity increases DNA methylation and decreases RNA methylation in the human placenta.","Reprod Toxicol","Maternal obesity is associated with increased risk of adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes. While increasing body of evidence supports that the etiology is related to fetal and placental hypoxia, molecular signaling changes in response to this pathophysiological condition in human placenta have remained elusive. Here by using varied approaches including immunocytochemistry staining, Western blot, RT-qPCR, and ELISA, we aimed to investigate the changes in epigenetic markers in placentas from obese pregnant women following delivery by Caesarean-section at term. Our results revealed that the levels of 5-methylcytosine (5mC), a methylated form commonly occurring in CpG dinucleotides and an important repressor of gene transcription in the genome, were significantly increased coupled with decreased activity of Ten-Eleven Translocation (TETs) enzymes that principally function by oxidizing 5mC in the obese placenta, consistent with hypoxia-induced genome-wide DNA hypermethylation observed in varied types of cells and tissues. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) represents the most abundant and conserved modification of gene transcripts, especially within mRNAs, which is stalled by m6A methyltransferases or ""writers"" including METTL-3/-14, WTAP, RBM15B, and KIAA1429. We further showed that obese placentas demonstrated significantly down-regulated levels of m6A along with reduced gene expression of WTAP, RBM15B, and KIAA1429. Our data support that maternal obesity-induced hypoxia may play an important role in triggering genome-wide DNA hypermethylation in the human placenta, and in turn leading to transcriptome-wide inhibition of RNA modifications. Our results further suggest that selectively modulating these pathways may facilitate development of novel therapeutic approaches for controlling and managing maternal obesity-associated adverse clinical outcomes.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

DNA methylation in whole blood captures genetic and environmental influences and is assessed in transethnic meta-analysis of epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) of serum urate (discovery, n = 12,474, replication, n = 5522). The 100 replicated, epigenome-wide significant (p < 1.1E-7) CpGs explain 11.6% of the serum urate variance. At SLC2A9, the serum urate locus with the largest effect in genome-wide association studies (GWAS), five CpGs are associated with SLC2A9 gene expression. Four CpGs at SLC2A9 have significant causal effects on serum urate levels and/or gout, and two of these partly mediate the effects of urate-associated GWAS variants. In other genes, including SLC7A11 and PHGDH, 17 urate-associated CpGs are associated with conditions defining metabolic syndrome, suggesting that these CpGs may represent a blood DNA methylation signature of cardiometabolic risk factors. This study demonstrates that EWAS can provide new insights into GWAS loci and the correlation of serum urate with other complex traits.© 2021. The Author(s)."
"34886889","Genome-wide methylation and expression analyses reveal the epigenetic landscape of immune-related diseases for tobacco smoking.","Clin Epigenetics","Smoking is a major causal risk factor for lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cardiovascular disease (CVD), and is the main preventable cause of deaths in the world. The components of cigarette smoke are involved in immune and inflammatory processes, which may increase the prevalence of cigarette smoke-related diseases. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms linking smoking and diseases have not been well explored. This study was aimed to depict a global map of DNA methylation and gene expression changes induced by tobacco smoking and to explore the molecular mechanisms between smoking and human diseases through whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) and RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq).We performed WGBS on 72 samples (36 smokers and 36 nonsmokers) and RNA-seq on 75 samples (38 smokers and 37 nonsmokers), and cytokine immunoassay on plasma from 22 males (9 smokers and 13 nonsmokers) who were recruited from the city of Jincheng in China. By comparing the data of the two groups, we discovered a genome-wide methylation landscape of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with smoking. Functional enrichment analyses revealed that both smoking-related hyper-DMR genes (DMGs) and hypo-DMGs were related to synapse-related pathways, whereas the hypo-DMGs were specifically related to cancer and addiction. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) revealed by RNA-seq analysis were significantly enriched in the ""immunosuppression"" pathway. Correlation analysis of DMRs with their corresponding gene expression showed that genes affected by tobacco smoking were mostly related to immune system diseases. Finally, by comparing cytokine concentrations between smokers and nonsmokers, we found that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was significantly upregulated in smokers.In sum, we found that smoking-induced DMRs have different distribution patterns in hypermethylated and hypomethylated areas between smokers and nonsmokers. We further identified and verified smoking-related DMGs and DEGs through multi-omics integration analysis of DNA methylome and transcriptome data. These findings provide us a comprehensive genomic map of the molecular changes induced by smoking which would enhance our understanding of the harms of smoking and its relationship with diseases.© 2021.

We use two large sets of duplicate sample measurements with 450 K and EPIC arrays, along with mixtures of isogenic methylated and unmethylated cell line DNA to compare raw data and that preprocessed via different pipelines.Our evaluations show that the ENmix pipeline performs the best with significantly higher correlation and lower absolute difference between duplicate pairs, higher intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and smaller deviations from expected methylation level in mixture experiments. In addition to the pipeline function, ENmix software provides an integrated set of functions for reading in raw data files from mouse and human arrays, quality control, data preprocessing, visualization, detection of differentially methylated regions (DMRs), estimation of cell type proportions, and calculation of methylation age clocks. ENmix is computationally efficient, flexible and allows parallel computing. To facilitate further evaluations, we make all datasets and evaluation code publicly available.Careful selection of robust data preprocessing methods is critical for DNA methylation array studies.

However, epigenetic changes modify gene expression significantly. Here, we evaluated genome-wide methylation changes focusing on miR genes from primary CRC and corresponding normal tissues. Differentially methylated CpGs spanning CpG islands, open seas, and north and south shore regions were evaluated, with the largest number of changes observed within open seas and islands. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis revealed several of these miRs to act in important cancer-related pathways, including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-protein kinase B (Akt) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. We found 18 miR genes to be significantly differentially methylated, with MIR124-2, MIR124-3, MIR129-2, MIR137, MIR34B, MIR34C, MIR548G, MIR762, and MIR9-3 hypermethylated and MIR1204, MIR17, MIR17HG, MIR18A, MIR19A, MIR19B1, MIR20A, MIR548F5, and MIR548I4 hypomethylated in CRC tumor compared with normal tissue, most of these miRs having been shown to regulate steps of metastasis. Generally, methylation changes were distributed evenly across all chromosomes with predominance for chromosomes 1/2 and protein-coding genes. Interestingly, chromosomes abundantly affected by methylation changes globally were rarely affected by methylation changes within miR genes. Our findings support additional mechanisms of methylation changes affecting (miR) genes that orchestrate CRC progression and metastasis."

A total of 984 DMRs were identified between the WT and KO groups consisting of 559 hypermethylation and 425 hypomethylation DMRs. Furthermore, DMR-related genes were enriched in metabolism pathways such as carbon metabolism (serine hydroxymethyltransferase 2(Shmt2), acyl-Coenzyme A dehydrogenase medium chain(Acadm)), arginine and proline metabolism (spermine synthase(Sms),proline dehydrogenase(Prodh2)) and purine metabolism (phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase 2(Prps2)). In summary, we are the first to report the change in whole-genome methylation levels bymiR-143-null through WGBS inmiceliver, and provide an experimental basis for clinical diagnosis and treatment in liver diseases, indicating thatmiR-143may be a potential therapeutic target and biomarker for liver damage-associated diseases and hepatocellular carcinoma."

To identify genes that contribute to neutrophil activation and infiltration, we analyzed the transcriptomes of circulating neutrophils from normal pregnant and preeclamptic women. Neutrophils were collected at 30 weeks' gestation and RNA and DNA were isolated for RNA sequencing and 5-hydroxy-methylcytosine (5-hmC) sequencing as an index of dynamic changes in neutrophil DNA methylation. Women with normal pregnancy who went on to develop mild preeclampsia at term had the most uniquely expressed genes (697) with 325 gene ontology pathways upregulated, many related to neutrophil activation and function. Women with severe preeclampsia who delivered prematurely had few pathways up- or downregulated. Cluster analysis revealed that gene expression in women with severe preeclampsia was an inverse mirror image of gene expression in normal pregnancy, while gene expression in women who developed mild preeclampsia was remarkably different from both. DNA methylation marks, key regulators of gene expression, are removed by the action of ten-eleven translocation (TET) enzymes, which oxidize 5-methylcytosines (5mCs), resulting in locus-specific reversal of DNA methylation. DNA sequencing for 5-hmC revealed no differences among the three groups. Genome-wide DNA methylation revealed extremely low levels in circulating neutrophils suggesting they are de-methylated. Collectively, these data demonstrate that neutrophil gene expression profiles can distinguish different preeclampsia phenotypes, and in the case of mild preeclampsia, alterations in gene expression occur well before clinical symptoms emerge. These findings serve as a foundation for further evaluation of neutrophil transcriptomes as biomarkers of preeclampsia phenotypes. Changes in DNA methylation in circulating neutrophils do not appear to mediate differential patterns of gene expression in either mild or severe preeclampsia."

Disturbed DNA methylation contributes to a wide array of human diseases from single-gene disorders to sporadic metabolic diseases or cancer. DNA methylation was also shown to affect several neurodegenerative disorders, including Huntington's disease (HD), a fatal, monogenic inherited disease. HD is caused by a polyglutamine repeat expansion in the Huntingtin protein that brings about a multifaceted pathogenesis affecting several cellular processes. Research of the last decade found complex, genome-wide DNA methylation changes in HD pathogenesis that modulate transcriptional activity and genome stability. This article reviews current evidence that sheds light on the role of DNA methylation in HD."
"34882728","Genome-wide host methylation profiling of anal and cervical carcinoma.","PLoS One","HPV infection results in changes in host gene methylation which, in turn, are thought to contribute to the neoplastic progression of HPV-associated cancers. The objective of this study was to identify joint and disease-specific genome-wide methylation changes in anal and cervical cancer as well as changes in high-grade pre-neoplastic lesions. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) anal tissues (n = 143; 99% HPV+) and fresh frozen cervical tissues (n = 28; 100% HPV+) underwent microdissection, DNA extraction, HPV genotyping, bisulfite modification, DNA restoration (FFPE) and analysis by the Illumina HumanMethylation450 Array. Differentially methylated regions (DMR; t test q<0.01, 3 consecutive significant CpG probes and mean Δβ methylation value>0.3) were compared between normal and cancer specimens in partial least squares (PLS) models and then used to classify anal or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia-3 (AIN3/CIN3). In AC, an 84-gene PLS signature (355 significant probes) differentiated normal anal mucosa (NM; n = 9) from AC (n = 121) while a 36-gene PLS signature (173 significant probes) differentiated normal cervical epithelium (n = 10) from CC (n = 9). The CC progression signature was validated using three independent publicly available datasets (n = 424 cases). The AC and CC progression PLS signatures were interchangeable in segregating normal, AIN3/CIN3 and AC and CC and were found to include 17 common overlapping hypermethylated genes. Moreover, these signatures segregated AIN3/CIN3 lesions similarly into cancer-like and normal-like categories. Distinct methylation changes occur across the genome during the progression of AC and CC with overall similar profiles and add to the evidence suggesting that HPV-driven oncogenesis may result in similar non-random methylomic events. Our findings may lead to identification of potential epigenetic drivers of HPV-associated cancers and also, of potential markers to identify higher risk pre-cancerous lesions."

Cg13824500 is 10% hypomethylated in hypertriglyceridemic patients and is located in VTI1A, which is a limiting gene in the transit of chylomicrons in the enterocyte through the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus. Cg26468118 in the RAB20 gene (13% hypomethylated) and cg21560722 in the SBF2 gene (33% hypermethylated) are involved in the regulation of Golgi apparatus vesicles.Our results suggest that there are differentially methylated regions related to the formation of chylomicrons in hypertriglyceridemic patients.Copyright © 2021 Sociedad Española de Arteriosclerosis.

"34879277","Stage-specific regulation of DNA methylation by TET enzymes during human cardiac differentiation.","Cell Rep","Changes in DNA methylation are associated with normal cardiogenesis, whereas altered methylation patterns can occur in congenital heart disease. Ten-eleven translocation (TET) enzymes oxidize 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and promote locus-specific DNA demethylation. Here, we characterize stage-specific methylation dynamics and the function of TETs during human cardiomyocyte differentiation. Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) in which all three TET genes are inactivated fail to generate cardiomyocytes (CMs), with altered mesoderm patterning and defective cardiac progenitor specification. Genome-wide methylation analysis shows TET knockout causes promoter hypermethylation of genes encoding WNT inhibitors, leading to hyperactivated WNT signaling and defects in cardiac mesoderm patterning. TET activity is also needed to maintain hypomethylated status and expression of NKX2-5 for subsequent cardiac progenitor specification. Finally, loss of TETs causes a set of cardiac structural genes to fail to be demethylated at the cardiac progenitor stage. Our data demonstrate key roles for TET proteins in controlling methylation dynamics at sequential steps during human cardiac development.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

"34878926","Epigenetic silencing of recombinant AAV genomes by NP220 and the HUSH complex.","J Virol","The single-stranded DNA genome of adeno-associated viruses (AAV) undergoes second-strand synthesis and transcription in the host cell nucleus. While wild-type AAV genomes are naturally silenced upon integration into the host genome, recombinant AAV (rAAV) genomes typically provide robust expression of transgenes persisting as extrachromosomal DNA or episomes. Episomal DNA associating with host histones are subject to epigenetic modifications, although the mechanisms underlying such are not well understood. Here, we provide evidence that the double-stranded DNA binding protein NP220, in association with the human silencing hub (HUSH) complex, mediates transcriptional silencing of single-stranded as well as self-complementary rAAV genomes. In cells lacking NP220 or other components of the HUSH complex, AAV genome transcript levels are increased and correlate with a marked reduction in repressive H3K9 histone methylation marks. We also provide evidence that the AAV capsid (serotype) can profoundly influence NP220-mediated mediated silencing of packaged genomes, indicating potential role(s) for capsid-genome or capsid-host factor interactions in regulating epigenetic silencing of rAAV genomes.ImportanceRecombinant AAV vectors can enable long term gene expression in a wide variety of tissues. However, transgene silencing has been reported in some human gene therapy clinical trials. Here, we demonstrate the human silencing hub (HUSH) complex can suppress transcript formation from rAAV vector genomes by epigenetic modification of associated host histones. Further, the AAV capsid appears to play an important role in this pathway. We postulate that modulation of epigenetic pathways could help improve rAAV expression."

In this observational study, a genome-wide characterization of epigenetic changes in blood DNA, before and after acupuncture treatment, was performed in a cohort of 11 patients suffering from burnout.Burnout was assessed using the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) and DNA was extracted from blood samples and analyzed by Illumina EPIC BeadChip.Before acupuncture, all patients suffered of emotional exhaustion (EE) (MBI-EE score, 44±6), 81% suffered of depersonalization (DP) (MBI-DP score, 16±6), and 72% of low feelings of personal accomplishment (PA) (MBI-PA score, 29±9). After acupuncture, all MBI dimensions improved significantly (EE, 16±11 [p=1.5*10-4]; DP, 4±5 [p=5.3*10-4]; and PA, 40±6 [p=4.1*10-3]). For each patient, both methylomes obtained before and after acupuncture co-clustered in the multidimensional scaling plot, indicating a high level of similarity. Genes corresponding to the 10 most differentially methylated CpGs showed enrichment in the brain dopaminergic signalling, steroid synthesis and in the insulin sensitivity pathways.Acupuncture treatment was found to be highly effective on all burnout dimensions and the epigenetic targets identified were involved in some major disturbances of this syndrome.S.

The aims of this study were to assess associations between DNA methylation in cord blood leucocytes at birth, and caries experience and enamel hypomineralisation at six years of age.The study sample was from a birth cohort study of twins. Dental examinations at six years identified the presence/absence of (i) 'any caries' (untreated and treated caries), (ii) 'advanced caries' (untreated, advanced caries and/or past treatment) and (iii) hypomineralised second primary molars (HSPM). Genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation was performed on cord blood of 27 twin pairs (14 dizygotic and 13 monozygotic) using the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip array. Differentially methylated CpGs (DMCpGs) and regions (DMRs) associated with each dental outcome were investigated, while accounting for the relatedness of twins. Results with a false discovery rate <0.05 were treated as statistically significant.19 children had 'any caries', 15 had 'advanced' caries, and 18 had HSPM. No DMCpGs were associated with 'any caries', 16 and 19 DMCpGs were associated with 'advanced caries' and HSPM, respectively. DMRs were identified in association with all three outcomes. Genes implicated by these analyses included PBX1, ACAT2, LTBP3 and DDR1 which have been linked with dental tissue development in genetic studies.This exploratory study identified differential methylation in several genes at birth associated with dental caries and HSPM at six years. Further research may provide valuable insights into aetiology of dental disease and/or reveal novel molecular-based approaches for early risk stratification.Epigenetic differences at birth are likely to be associated with dental health at six years and may be valuable biomarkers of early influences on dental health.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

The protective effects of FA on retinal vascular endothelial cells against high glucose levels involve in multiple aspects in DR; however, the underlying mechanism is not fully elucidated. In present study, we investigated the transcriptome as well as genome-wide DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation signature in human retinal microvascular endothelial ACBRI 181 cells cultured within high glucose (HG) medium supplemented with or without FA by RNA-seq, MeDIP-seq, and hMeDIP-seq. Total 3308 differential expressed genes (DEGs) were involved in multiple biological processes and molecular functions containing angiogenesis, inflammation, S-adenosyl methionine metabolism, and hypoxia response. Moreover, the global DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation in ACBRI 181 cells with FA treatment were both compromised compared to HG. Combined with transcriptome data, four subclusters of DEGs with hyper- or hypomethylated promoters were further verified. Unexpectedly, promoters of these 487 genes all displayed a pattern of increased DNA hydroxymethylation. Furthermore, hyperglycemia rat model was established and administered with FA. The DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation changes of selected target genes COL1A1, ITGA7, MMP-14, and VEGFB confirmed by MeDIP-qPCR were consistent with the results in human ACBRI 181 cells. Finally, the presence of activated DNMT1 and TET2 induced by FA was determined in ACBRI 181 cells and hyperglycemia rat. Taken together, this research provided a resource of expression and epigenetic profiles in retinal microvascular endothelial cell, emphasizing a pharmacological mechanism of FA on DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation regulation in retinal microvessel cells of DR."

In this study, we collected previous identified significant thyroid cancer associated SNPs from UKB cohort (358 cases and 407,399 controls) and ICR cohort (3,001 patients and 287,550 controls) and thyroid eQTL (sample size = 574 from GTEx project) and m6A-SNP (N = 1,678,126) were applied to prioritize the candidate SNPs. Finally, five candidate genes (PLEKHA8, SMUG1, CDC123, RMI2, ACSM5) were identified to be thyroid cancer associated m6A-related genetic susceptibility. Loss and gain function studies of m6A writer proteins confirm that ACSM5 is regulated by m6A methylation of mRNA. Moreover, ACSM5 is downregulated in thyroid cancer and inversely correlated with PTC malignancy and patient survival.

"34873300","Focal disruption of DNA methylation dynamics at enhancers in IDH-mutant AML cells.","Leukemia","Recurrent mutations in IDH1 or IDH2 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are associated with increased DNA methylation, but the genome-wide patterns of this hypermethylation phenotype have not been comprehensively studied in AML samples. We analyzed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing data from 15 primary AML samples with IDH1 or IDH2 mutations, which identified ~4000 focal regions that were uniquely hypermethylated in IDHmutsamples vs. normal CD34+ cells and other AMLs. These regions had modest hypermethylation in AMLs with biallelic TET2 mutations, and levels of 5-hydroxymethylation that were diminished in IDH and TET-mutant samples, indicating that this hypermethylation results from inhibition of TET-mediated demethylation. Focal hypermethylation in IDHmutAMLs occurred at regions with low methylation in CD34+ cells, implying that DNA methylation and demethylation are active at these loci. AML samples containing IDH and DNMT3AR882mutations were significantly less hypermethylated, suggesting that IDHmut-associated hypermethylation is mediated by DNMT3A. IDHmut-specific hypermethylation was highly enriched for enhancers that form direct interactions with genes involved in normal hematopoiesis and AML, including MYC and ETV6. These results suggest that focal hypermethylation in IDH-mutant AML occurs by altering the balance between DNA methylation and demethylation, and that disruption of these pathways at enhancers may contribute to AML pathogenesis.© 2021.

"34872358","A Hyperthermoactive-Cas9 Editing Tool Reveals the Role of a Unique Arsenite Methyltransferase in the Arsenic Resistance System of Thermus thermophilus HB27.","mBio","Arsenic detoxification systems can be found in a wide range of organisms, from bacteria to humans. In a previous study, we discovered an arsenic-responsive transcriptional regulator in the thermophilic bacterium Thermus thermophilus HB27 (TtSmtB). Here, we characterize the arsenic resistance system of T. thermophilus in more detail. We employedTtSmtB-based pulldown assays with protein extracts from cultures treated with arsenate and arsenite to obtain anS-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM)-dependent arsenite methyltransferase (TtArsM).In vivoandin vitroanalyses were performed to shed light on this new component of the arsenic resistance network and its peculiar catalytic mechanism. Heterologous expression ofTtarsMin Escherichia coli resulted in arsenite detoxification at mesophilic temperatures. AlthoughTtArsM does not contain a canonical arsenite binding site, the purified protein does catalyze SAM-dependent arsenite methylation with formation of monomethylarsenites (MMAs) and dimethylarsenites (DMAs). In addition,in vitroanalyses confirmed the unique interaction betweenTtArsM andTtSmtB. Next, a highly efficient ThermoCas9-based genome-editing tool was developed to delete theTtArsM-encoding gene on the T. thermophilus genome and to confirm its involvement in the arsenite detoxification system. Finally, theTtarsXefflux pump gene in the T. thermophilus ΔTtarsMgenome was substituted by a gene encoding a stabilized yellow fluorescent protein (sYFP) to create a sensitive genome-based bioreporter system for the detection of arsenic ions.IMPORTANCEWe here describe the discovery of an unknown protein by using a proteomics approach with a transcriptional regulator as bait. Remarkably, we successfully obtained a novel type of enzyme through the interaction with a transcriptional regulator controlling the expression of this enzyme. Employing this strategy, we isolatedTtArsM, the first thermophilic prokaryotic arsenite methyltransferase, as a new enzyme of the arsenic resistance mechanism in T. thermophilus HB27. The atypical arsenite binding site ofTtArsM categorizes the enzyme as the first member of a new arsenite methyltransferase type, exclusively present in theThermusgenus. The enzyme methylates arsenite-producing MMAs and DMAs. Furthermore, we developed an hyperthermophilic Cas9-based genome-editing tool, active up to 65°C. The tool allowed us to perform highly efficient, marker-free modifications (either gene deletion or insertion) in the T. thermophilus genome. With these modifications, we confirmed the critical role ofTtArsM in the arsenite detoxification system and developed a sensitive whole-cell bioreporter for arsenic ions. We anticipate that the developed tool can be easily adapted for editing the genomes of other thermophilic bacteria, significantly boosting fundamental and metabolic engineering in hyperthermophilic microorganisms."

Using genome-wide methylation profiling, we evaluated 32 histopathologically and dermoscopically characterized nevi, to identify key epigenetic regulatory mechanisms involved in nevogenesis. Benign (69% globular and 31% non-specific dermoscopic pattern) and dysplastic (95% reticular/nonspecific dermoscopic pattern) nevi were dissimilar with only two shared differentially methylated (DM) loci. Benign nevi demonstrated an increase in both genome-scale methylation and methylation of Alu/LINE-1 retrotransposable elements, a marker of genomic stability, as well as global methylation. In contrast, dysplastic nevi showed evidence for genomic instability via hypomethylation of Alu/LINE-1 (Alu; P=0.00019 and LINE-1; P=0.000035). Using dermoscopic classifications, reticular/non-specific patterned nevi had 59,572 CpG DM loci (Q < 0.05), whereas globular nevi had no significant DM loci. In reticular/non-specific patterned nevi, the tumor suppressor PTEN had the greatest proportion of hypermethylated CpG loci in its promoter region compared to all other assayed gene promoters. The relative activity of reticular/non-specific nevi was evidenced by 50,720 hypomethylated loci being enriched for accessible chromatin, and 8,852 hypermethylated loci strongly enriched, for example, marks of active gene promoters, which suggests that gain of DNA methylation observed in these nevus types plays a role in gene regulation.Copyright © 2021.

Liver fibrosis (LF) is a common response to chronic liver injury and may lead to cirrhosis and even liver cancer. However, the involvement of m6A methylation in the development of LF is still unknown. In this study, we performed a systematic evaluation of hepatic genome-wide m6A modification and mRNA expression by m6A-seq and RNA-seq using LF mice. There were 3,315 genes with significant differential m6A levels, of which 2,498 were hypermethylated and 817 hypomethylated. GO and KEGG analyses illustrated that differentially expressed m6A genes were closely correlated with processes such as the endoplasmic reticulum stress response, PPAR signaling pathway and TGF-β signaling pathway. Moreover, a total of 90 genes had both a significant change in the m6A level and mRNA expression shown by joint analysis of m6A-seq and RNA-seq. Hence, the critical elements of m6A modification, including methyltransferase WTAP, demethylases ALKBH5 and binding proteins YTHDF1 were confirmed by RT-qPCR and Western blot. In an additional cell experiment, we also observed that the decreased expression of WTAP induced the development of LF as a result of promoting hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation. Therefore, this study revealed unique differential m6A methylation patterns in LF mice and suggested that m6A methylation was associated with the occurrence and course of LF to some extent.Copyright © 2021 Fan, Ma, Chen, Zhou, Jiang, Zhang and Wu."

To reach sufficient cell yield for treatment,ex vivoisolated autologous or allogenic Tregs need to be expanded extensivelyin vitroduring manufacturing of the Treg product. However, repetitive cycles of restimulation and prolonged culture have been shown to impact T cell phenotypes, functionality and fitness. It is therefore critical to scrutinize the molecular changes which occur during T cell product generation, and reexamine current manufacturing practices. We performed genome-wide DNA methylation profiling of cells throughout the manufacturing process of a polyclonal Treg product that has proven safety and hints of therapeutic efficacy in kidney transplant patients. We found progressive DNA methylation changes over the duration of culture, which were donor-independent and reproducible between manufacturing runs. Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in the final products were significantly enriched at promoters and enhancers of genes implicated in T cell activation. Additionally, significant hypomethylation did also occur in promoters of genes implicated in functional exhaustion in conventional T cells, some of which, however, have been reported to strengthen immunosuppressive effector function in Tregs. At the same time, a set of reported Treg-specific demethylated regions increased methylation levels with culture, indicating a possible destabilization of Treg identity during manufacturing, which was independent of the purity of the starting material. Together, our results indicate that the repetitive TCR-mediated stimulation lead to epigenetic changes that might impact functionality of Treg products in multiple ways, by possibly shifting to an effector Treg phenotype with enhanced functional activity or by risking destabilization of Treg identity and impaired TCR activation. Our analyses also illustrate the value of epigenetic profiling for the evaluation of T cell product manufacturing pipelines, which might open new avenues for the improvement of current adoptive Treg therapies with relevance for conventional effector T cell products.Copyright © 2021 Ou, Hamo, Schulze, Roemhild, Kaiser, Gasparoni, Salhab, Zarrinrad, Amini, Schlickeiser, Streitz, Walter, Volk, Schmueck-Henneresse, Reinke and Polansky."

In the current study, we applied an omics approach to explore how this plant adapts to salt stress by integrating transcriptomic and metabolomic changes in the roots and leaves ofS. argelplants under salt stress.De novoassembly of transcriptome produced 57,796 unigenes represented by 165,147 transcripts/isoforms. A total of 730 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in the roots (396 and 334 were up- and down-regulated, respectively). In the leaves, 927 DEGs were identified (601 and 326 were up- and down-regulated, respectively). Gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes And Genomes pathway enrichment analyses revealed that several defense-related biological processes, such as response to osmotic and oxidative stress, hormonal signal transduction, mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling, and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathways are the potential mechanisms involved in the tolerance ofS. argelplants to salt stress. Furthermore, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was used to detect the metabolic variations of the leaves and roots ofS. argelunder control and salt stress. 45 and 56 critical metabolites showed changes in their levels in the stressed roots and leaves, respectively; there were 20 metabolites in common between the roots and leaves. Differentially accumulated metabolites included amino acids, polyamines, hydroxycinnamic acids, monolignols, flavonoids, and saccharides that improve antioxidant ability and osmotic adjustment ofS. argelplants under salt stress.

Therefore, researchers are now exploring the epigenome, a biological interface at which genetics and the environment can interact. There is a growing body of evidence supporting the role of epigenetic mechanisms in complex disease pathophysiology. Epigenome-wide association studies (EWASes) investigate the association between a phenotype and epigenetic variants, most commonly DNA methylation. The decreasing cost of measuring epigenome-wide methylation and the increasing accessibility of bioinformatic pipelines have contributed to the rise in EWASes published in recent years. Here, we review the current literature on these EWASes and provide further recommendations and strategies for successfully conducting them. We have constrained our review to studies using methylation data as this is the most studied epigenetic mechanism; microarray-based data as whole-genome bisulphite sequencing remains prohibitively expensive for most laboratories; and blood-based studies due to the non-invasiveness of peripheral blood collection and availability of archived DNA, as well as the accessibility of publicly available blood-cell-based methylation data. Further, we address multiple novel areas of EWAS analysis that have not been covered in previous reviews: (1) longitudinal study designs, (2) the chip analysis methylation pipeline (ChAMP), (3) differentially methylated region (DMR) identification paradigms, (4) methylation quantitative trait loci (methQTL) analysis, (5) methylation age analysis and (6) identifying cell-specific differential methylation from mixed cell data using statistical deconvolution.© 2021.

While DNA sequencing is the gold standard for determining IDH mutational status, genome-wide methylation arrays and gene expression profiling have been used for surrogate mutational determination. Previous studies by our group suggest that 1p/19q-codeletion and IDH mutational status can be predicted by genome-wide somatic copy number alteration (SCNA) data alone, however a rigorous model to accomplish this task has yet to be established. In this study, we used SCNA data from 786 adult diffuse gliomas in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to develop a two-stage classification system that identifies 1p/19q-codeleted oligodendrogliomas and predicts the IDH mutational status of astrocytic tumors using a machine-learning model. Cross-validated results on TCGA SCNA data showed near perfect classification results. Furthermore, our astrocytic IDH mutation model validated well on four additional datasets (AUC = 0.97, AUC = 0.99, AUC = 0.95, AUC = 0.96) as did our 1p/19q-codeleted oligodendroglioma screen on the two datasets that contained oligodendrogliomas (MCC = 0.97, MCC = 0.97). We then retrained our system using data from these validation sets and applied our system to a cohort of REMBRANDT study subjects for whom SCNA data, but not IDH mutational status, is available. Overall, using genome-wide SCNAs, we successfully developed a system to robustly predict 1p/19q-codeletion and IDH mutational status in diffuse gliomas. This system can assign molecular subtype labels to tumor samples of retrospective diffuse glioma cohorts that lack 1p/19q-codeletion and IDH mutational status, such as the REMBRANDT study, recasting these datasets as validation cohorts for diffuse glioma research.© 2021.

Compared with the non-pregnant patients, the duration is shorter, and the growth rate of the tumor is faster in pregnant patients with CPA (P < 0.05). Morphology and cell proliferation assay showed that the percentage of Ki-67 positive cells in CPA were higher in pregnant group than non-pregnant group (8.0% vs 5.5%, P < 0.05). The DNA methylation analysis showed that Genome-wide DNA methylation signature difference between pregnant and non-pregnant with CPA, that the pregnant group had more hypermethylated DMPs (67.94% vs 22.16%) and less hypomethylated DMPs (32.93% vs 77.84%). The proportion of hypermethylated DMPs was relatively high on chromosomes 1 (9.68% vs 8.67%) and X (4.99% vs 3.35%) but lower on chromosome 2(7.98% vs 12.92%). In pregnant patients with CPA, 576 hypomethylated DMPs and 1109 hypermethylated DMPs were identified in the DNA promoter region. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that the Wnt/β-Catenin pathway, Ras/MAPK Pathway and PI3K-AKT Pathway were associated with the development of CPA during pregnancy.Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling of CPA in non-pregnant and pregnant patients was identified in the present study. Alterations of DNA methylation were associated with the pathogenesis and exacerbation of CPA during pregnancy.© 2021. The Author(s)."

Genome-wide identification of imprinted genes have been completed in several dicot Cruciferous plant and monocot crops.Here, we analyzed global patterns of allelic gene expression in developing endosperm of sunflower which belongs to the composite family. Totally, 691 imprinted loci candidates were identified in 12 day-after-pollination sunflower endosperm including 79 maternally expressed genes (MEG) and 596 paternally expressed genes (PEG), 6 maternally expressed noncoding RNAs (MNC) and 10 paternally expressed noncoding RNAs (PNC). And a clear clustering of imprinted genes throughout the rapeseed genome was identified. Generally, imprinting in sunflower is conserved within a species, but intraspecific variation also was detected. Limited loci in sunflower are imprinted in other several different species. The DNA methylation pattern around imprinted genes were investigated in embryo and endosperm tissues. In CG context, the imprinted genes were significantly associated with differential methylated regions exhibiting hypomethylation in endosperm and hypermethylation in embryo, which indicated that the maternal demethylation in CG context potentially induce the genomic imprinting in endosperm.Our study would be helpful for understanding of genomic imprinting in plants and provide potential basis for further research in imprinting in sunflower.© 2021.

"34862756","Epigenome-wide association study of sarcopenia: findings from the Hertfordshire Sarcopenia Study (HSS).","J Cachexia Sarcopenia Muscle","Sarcopenia is the age-related loss of muscle mass, strength, and function. Epigenetic processes such as DNA methylation, which integrate both genetic and environmental exposures, have been suggested to contribute to the development of sarcopenia. This study aimed to determine whether differences in the muscle methylome are associated with sarcopenia and its component measures: grip strength, appendicular lean mass index (ALMi), and gait speed.Using the Infinium Human MethylationEPIC BeadChip, we measured DNA methylation in vastus lateralis muscle biopsies of 83 male participants (12 with sarcopenia) with a mean (standard deviation) age of 75.7 (3.6) years from the Hertfordshire Sarcopenia Study (HSS) and Hertfordshire Sarcopenia Study extension (HSSe) and examined associations with sarcopenia and its components. Pathway, histone mark, and transcription factor enrichment of the differentially methylated CpGs (dmCpGs) were determined, and sodium bisulfite pyrosequencing was used to validate the sarcopenia-associated dmCpGs. Human primary myoblasts (n = 6) isolated from vastus lateralis muscle biopsies from male individuals from HSSe were treated with the EZH2 inhibitor GSK343 to assess how perturbations in epigenetic processes may impact myoblast differentiation and fusion, measured by PAX7 and MYHC immunocytochemistry, and mitochondrial bioenergetics determined using the Seahorse XF96.Sarcopenia was associated with differential methylation at 176 dmCpGs (false discovery rate ≤ 0.05) and 141 differentially methylated regions (Stouffer ≤ 0.05). The sarcopenia-associated dmCpGs were enriched in genes associated with myotube fusion (P = 1.40E-03), oxidative phosphorylation (P = 2.78E-02), and voltage-gated calcium channels (P = 1.59E-04). ALMi was associated with 71 dmCpGs, grip strength with 49 dmCpGs, and gait speed with 23 dmCpGs (false discovery rate ≤ 0.05). There was significant overlap between the dmCpGs associated with sarcopenia and ALMi (P = 3.4E-35), sarcopenia and gait speed (P = 4.78E-03), and sarcopenia and grip strength (P = 7.55E-06). There was also an over-representation of the sarcopenia, ALMi, grip strength, and gait speed-associated dmCpGs with sites of H3K27 trimethylation (all P ≤ 0.05) and amongst EZH2 target genes (all P ≤ 0.05). Furthermore, treatment of human primary myoblasts with the EZH2 inhibitor GSK343 inhibitor led to an increase in PAX7 expression (P ≤ 0.05), decreased myotube fusion (P = 0.043), and an increase in ATP production (P = 0.008), with alterations in the DNA methylation of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation and myogenesis.These findings show that differences in the muscle methylome are associated with sarcopenia and individual measures of muscle mass, strength, and function in older individuals. This suggests that changes in the epigenetic regulation of genes may contribute to impaired muscle function in later life.© 2021 The Authors.

"34860830","MLL1 is required for maintenance of intestinal stem cells.","PLoS Genet","Epigenetic mechanisms are gatekeepers for the gene expression patterns that establish and maintain cellular identity in mammalian development, stem cells and adult homeostasis. Amongst many epigenetic marks, methylation of histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4) is one of the most widely conserved and occupies a central position in gene expression. Mixed lineage leukemia 1 (MLL1/KMT2A) is the founding mammalian H3K4 methyltransferase. It was discovered as the causative mutation in early onset leukemia and subsequently found to be required for the establishment of definitive hematopoiesis and the maintenance of adult hematopoietic stem cells. Despite wide expression, the roles of MLL1 in non-hematopoietic tissues remain largely unexplored. To bypass hematopoietic lethality, we used bone marrow transplantation and conditional mutagenesis to discover that the most overt phenotype in adult Mll1-mutant mice is intestinal failure. MLL1 is expressed in intestinal stem cells (ISCs) and transit amplifying (TA) cells but not in the villus. Loss of MLL1 is accompanied by loss of ISCs and a differentiation bias towards the secretory lineage with increased numbers and enlargement of goblet cells. Expression profiling of sorted ISCs revealed that MLL1 is required to promote expression of several definitive intestinal transcription factors including Pitx1, Pitx2, Foxa1, Gata4, Zfp503 and Onecut2, as well as the H3K27me3 binder, Bahcc1. These results were recapitulated using conditional mutagenesis in intestinal organoids. The stem cell niche in the crypt includes ISCs in close association with Paneth cells. Loss of MLL1 from ISCs promoted transcriptional changes in Paneth cells involving metabolic and stress responses. Here we add ISCs to the MLL1 repertoire and observe that all known functions of MLL1 relate to the properties of somatic stem cells, thereby highlighting the suggestion that MLL1 is a master somatic stem cell regulator."

This study investigates the diagnostic capacity of the 4-gene methylation biomarker panel, which included ADAMTS1, BNC1, LRFN5, and PXDN genes, in a case-control study.A genome-wide pharmacoepigenetic approach identified ADAMTS1, BNC1, LRFN5, and PXDN genes as putative targets. Tissue samples including stage I-IV PC (n = 44), pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (n = 15), intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (n = 24), and normal pancreas (n = 8), and cell-free DNA, which was acquired through methylation on beads technology from PC (n = 22) and control patients (n = 10), were included. The 2-∆ct was the outcome of interest and underwent receiver operating characteristic analysis to determine the diagnostic accuracy of the panel.Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed an area under the curve of 0.93 among ADAMTS1, 0.76 among BNC1, 0.75 among PXDN, and 0.69 among LRFN5 gene. The combination gene methylation panel (ADAMTS1, BNC1, LRFN5, and PXDN) had an area under the curve of 0.94, with a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 90%.This methylation-based biomarker panel had promising accuracy for PC detection and warranted further validation in prospective PC surveillance trials.Copyright © 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

"34858454","Functional Analysis of the ""Green Revolution"" Gene <i>Photoperiod-1</i> and Its Selection Trends During Bread Wheat Breeding.","Front Plant Sci","Flowering is central to the transformation of plants from vegetative growth to reproductive growth. The circadian clock system enables plants to sense the changes in the external environment and to modify the growth and development process at an appropriate time.Photoperiod-1(Ppd-1), which is controlled by the output signal of the circadian clock, has played an important role in the wheat ""Green Revolution."" In the current study, we systematically studied the relationship betweenPpd-1haplotypes and both wheat yield- and quality-related traits, using genome-wide association analysis and transgenic strategies, and found that highly appropriate haplotypes had been selected in the wheat breeding programs. Genome-wide association analysis showed thatPpd-1is associated with significant differences in yield-related traits in wheat, including spike length (SL), heading date (HD), plant height (PH), and thousand-grain weight (TGW).Ppd-1-Hapl-A1 showed increased SL by 4.72-5.93%, whereasPpd-1-Hapl-B1 andPpd-1-Hapl-D1displayed earlier HD by 0.58-0.75 and 1.24-2.93%, respectively, decreased PH by 5.64-13.08 and 13.62-27.30%, respectively, and increased TGW by 4.89-10.94 and 11.12-21.45%, respectively. Furthermore, the constitutive expression of thePpd-D1gene in rice significantly delayed heading date and resulted in reduced plant height, thousand-grain weight, grain width (GW), and total protein content. With reference to 40years of data from Chinese wheat breeding, it was found that the appropriate haplotypesPpd-1-Hapl-A1,Ppd-1-Hapl-B1, andPpd-1-Hapl-D1 had all been subjected to directional selection, and that their distribution frequencies had increased from 26.09, 60.00, and 52.00% in landraces to 42.55, 93.62, and 96.23% in wheat cultivars developed in the 2010s. APpd-B1methylation molecular marker was also developed to assist molecular wheat breeding. This research is of significance for fully exploring the function of thePpd-1gene and its genetic resource diversity, to effectively use the most appropriate haplotypes and to improve crop yield and sustainability.Copyright © 2021 Wu, Liu, Hu, Xue, Xu, Zhao, Qin, Cui and Sun."
"34858344","DNA Methylation Differences Between Zona Pellucida-Bound and Manually Selected Spermatozoa Are Associated With Autism Susceptibility.","Front Endocrinol (Lausanne)","Children conceived through intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) have been reported to have a higher risk of many abnormalities and disorders, including autism and intellectual disability, which may be due to bypassing of the natural sperm selection process during ICSI. Zona pellucida (ZP)-bound spermatozoa (ZPBS) have normal morphology and nuclear DNA. Using these spermatozoa for ICSI results in better outcomes compared with conventional ICSI. However, differences besides morphology that exist between sperm selected by ZP and by an embryologist and whether these differences affect the risk of autism in offspring after ICSI are unclear. To explore these questions, we compared genome-wide DNA methylation profiles between ZPBS and manually selected spermatozoa (MSS)using single-cell bisulfite sequencing. Global DNA methylation levels were significantly lower in ZPBS than in MSS. Using gene ontology (GO) analysis, genes overlapping differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were enriched in biological processes involving neurogenesis. Furthermore, we found that 47.8% of autism candidate genes were associated with DMRs, compared with 37.1% of matched background genes (P<0.001). This was mainly because of the high proportion of autism candidate genes with bivalent chromatin structure. In conclusion, bivalent chromatin structure results in large differences in the methylation of autism genes between MSS and ZPBS. ICSI using MSS, which increases the risk of methylation mutations compared with ZPBS, may lead to a higher risk of autism in offspring.Copyright © 2021 Wang, Chen, Yan and Zhao."
"34857913","Epigenome-wide association study of alcohol consumption in N = 8161 individuals and relevance to alcohol use disorder pathophysiology: identification of the cystine/glutamate transporter SLC7A11 as a top target.","Mol Psychiatry","Alcohol misuse is common in many societies worldwide and is associated with extensive morbidity and mortality, often leading to alcohol use disorders (AUD) and alcohol-related end-organ damage. The underlying mechanisms contributing to the development of AUD are largely unknown; however, growing evidence suggests that alcohol consumption is strongly associated with alterations in DNA methylation. Identification of alcohol-associated methylomic variation might provide novel insights into pathophysiology and novel treatment targets for AUD. Here we performed the largest single-cohort epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of alcohol consumption to date (N = 8161) and cross-validated findings in AUD populations with relevant endophenotypes, as well as alcohol-related animal models. Results showed 2504 CpGs significantly associated with alcohol consumption (Bonferroni p value < 6.8 × 10-8) with the five leading probes located in SLC7A11 (p = 7.75 × 10-108), JDP2 (p = 1.44 × 10-56), GAS5 (p = 2.71 × 10-47), TRA2B (p = 3.54 × 10-42), and SLC43A1 (p = 1.18 × 10-40). Genes annotated to associated CpG sites are implicated in liver and brain function, the cellular response to alcohol and alcohol-associated diseases, including hypertension and Alzheimer's disease. Two-sample Mendelian randomization confirmed the causal relationship of consumption on AUD risk (inverse variance weighted (IVW) p = 5.37 × 10-09). A methylation-based predictor of alcohol consumption was able to discriminate AUD cases in two independent cohorts (p = 6.32 × 10-38and p = 5.41 × 10-14). The top EWAS probe cg06690548, located in the cystine/glutamate transporter SLC7A11, was replicated in an independent cohort of AUD and control participants (N = 615) and showed strong hypomethylation in AUD (p < 10-17). Decreased CpG methylation at this probe was consistently associated with clinical measures including increased heavy drinking days (p < 10-4), increased liver function enzymes (GGT (p = 1.03 × 10-21), ALT (p = 1.29 × 10-6), and AST (p = 1.97 × 10-8)) in individuals with AUD. Postmortem brain analyses documented increased SLC7A11 expression in the frontal cortex of individuals with AUD and animal models showed marked increased expression in liver, suggesting a mechanism by which alcohol leads to hypomethylation-induced overexpression of SLC7A11. Taken together, our EWAS discovery sample and subsequent validation of the top probe in AUD suggest a strong role of abnormal glutamate signaling mediated by methylomic variation in SLC7A11. Our data are intriguing given the prominent role of glutamate signaling in brain and liver and might provide an important target for therapeutic intervention.© 2021.

"34857876","Differential placental CpG methylation is associated with chronic lung disease of prematurity.","Pediatr Res","Chronic lung disease (CLD) is the most common pulmonary morbidity in extremely preterm infants. It is unclear to what extent prenatal exposures influence the risk of CLD. Epigenetic variation in placenta DNA methylation may be associated with differential risk of CLD, and these associations may be dependent upon sex.Data were obtained from a multi-center cohort of infants born extremely preterm (<28 weeks' gestation) and an epigenome-wide approach was used to identify associations between placental DNA methylation and CLD (n = 423). Associations were evaluated using robust linear regression adjusting for covariates, with a false discovery rate of 0.05. Analyses stratified by sex were used to assess differences in methylation-CLD associations.CLD was associated with differential methylation at 49 CpG sites representing 46 genes in the placenta. CLD was associated with differential methylation of probes within genes related to pathways involved in fetal lung development, such as p53 signaling and myo-inositol biosynthesis. Associations between CpG methylation and CLD differed by sex.Differential placental methylation within genes with key roles in fetal lung development may reflect complex cell signaling between the placenta and fetus which mediate CLD risk. These pathways appear to be distinct based on fetal sex.In extremely preterm infants, differential methylation of CpG sites within placental genes involved in pathways related to cell signaling, oxidative stress, and trophoblast invasion is associated with chronic lung disease of prematurity. DNA methylation patterns associated with chronic lung disease were distinctly based on fetal sex, suggesting a potential mechanism underlying dimorphic phenotypes. Mechanisms related to fetal hypoxia and placental myo-inositol signaling may play a role in fetal lung programming and the developmental origins of chronic lung disease. Continued research of the relationship between the placental epigenome and chronic lung disease could inform efforts to ameliorate or prevent this condition.© 2021.

"34855066","Transcriptome and DNA methylome analyses provide insight into the heterosis in flag leaf of inter-subspecific hybrid rice.","Plant Mol Biol","Flag leaf heterosis of inter-subspecific hybrid rice is suggested to be related to leaf area, gene expression pattern and allele-specific expression, putatively related to DNA methylation differences between the hybrid and its parents. Inter-subspecific hybrid rice combinations of indica × japonica have great potential to broaden genetic diversity and enhance the heterosis. The genetic and epigenetic molecular mechanism of its heterosis is not completely understood. Here, the dissection of gene expression and epigenetic regulation of an elite inter-subspecific hybrid rice were reported. In the hybrid, plant height, flag leaf area and Pn showed significant heterosis at the heading stage. Chloroplast-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 530 allele-specific expression genes in hybrid were identified. Analysis of the genome-wide distribution of DNA methylation (5-methylcytosine, 5mC) and its association with transcription showed that there were variant DNA methylation maps and that the regulation of gene expression levels was negatively regulated by DNA methylation in the inter-subspecific hybrid rice. Differentially methylated DEGs were significantly enriched in photosynthetic functions. Moreover, distinct 5mC sequence contexts and distinct functional elements (promoter/gene body) may have different influences on heterosis related genes. The data identified heterosis related molecular mechanisms in inter-subspecific hybrid rice and suggested that epigenetic changes could extensively influence the flag leaf gene expression and heterosis.© 2021.

"34853632","Melanoma susceptibility: an update on genetic and epigenetic findings.","Int J Mol Epidemiol Genet","Malignant melanoma is one of the most highly ranked cancers in terms of years of life lost. Hereditary melanoma with its increased familial susceptibility is thought to affect up to 12% of all melanoma patients. In the past, only a few high-penetrance genes associated with familial melanoma, such asCDKN2AandCDK4, have been clinically tested. However, findings now indicate that melanoma is a cancer most likely to develop not only due to high-penetrance variants but also due to polygenic inheritance patterns, leaving no clear division between the hereditary and sporadic development of malignant melanoma. Various pathogenic low-penetrance variants were recently discovered through genome-wide association studies, and are now translated into polygenic risk scores. These can show superior sensitivity rates for the prediction of melanoma susceptibility and related mixed cancer syndromes than risk scores based on phenotypic traits of the patients, with odds ratios of up to 5.7 for patients in risk groups. In addition to describing genetic findings, we also review the first results of epigenetic research showing constitutional methylation changes that alter the susceptibility to cutaneous melanoma and its risk factors.IJMEG Copyright © 2021."

The effect of ionizing radiations (IRs) is well known regarding their ability to induce genetic alterations; however, their impact on the epigenome landscape in cancer, notably at the CpG dinucleotide resolution, remains to be further deciphered. In addition, no evidence is available regarding the effect of IRs on the DNA methylome profile according to the methionine dependency phenotype, which represents a hallmark of metabolic adaptation in cancer.We used a case-control study design with a fractionated irradiation regimen on four cancerous cell lines representative of HCC (HepG2), melanoma (MeWo and MeWo-LC1, which exhibit opposed methionine dependency phenotypes), and glioblastoma (U251). We performed high-resolution genome-wide DNA methylome profiling using the MethylationEPIC BeadChip on baseline conditions, irradiated cell lines (cumulative dose of 10 Gy), and non-irradiated counterparts. We performed epigenome-wide association studies to assess the effect of IRs and methionine-dependency-oriented analysis by carrying out epigenome-wide conditional logistic regression. We looked for epigenome signatures at the locus and single-probe (CpG dinucleotide) levels and through enrichment analyses of gene ontologies (GO). The EpiMet project was registered under the ID#AAP-BMS_003_211.EWASs revealed shared GO annotation pathways associated with increased methylation signatures for several biological processes in response to IRs, including blood circulation, plasma membrane-bounded cell projection organization, cell projection organization, multicellular organismal process, developmental process, and animal organ morphogenesis. Epigenome-wide conditional logistic regression analysis on the methionine dependency phenotype highlighted several epigenome signatures related to cell cycle and division and responses to IR and ultraviolet light.IRs generated a variation in the methylation level of a high number of CpG probes with shared biological pathways, including those associated with cell cycle and division, responses to IRs, sustained angiogenesis, tissue invasion, and metastasis. These results provide insight on shared adaptive mechanisms of the epigenome in cancerous cell lines in response to IR. Future experiments should focus on the tryptic association between IRs, the initiation of a radioresistance phenotype, and their interaction with methionine dependency as a hallmark of metabolic adaptation in cancer.© 2021.

To gain a deeper understanding of the molecular characteristics associated with CAR T cell differentiation, we performed longitudinal genome-wide DNA methylation profiling of CD8+CD19-CAR T cells post-infusion in ALL patients. We report that CAR T cells undergo a rapid and broad erasure of repressive DNA methylation reprograms at effector-associated genes. The CAR T cell post-infusion changes are further characterized by repression of genes (e.g., TCF7 and LEF1) associated with memory potential and a DNA methylation signature (e.g., demethylation at CX3CR1, BATF, and TOX) demarcating a transition toward exhaustion-progenitor T cells. Thus, CD19-CAR T cells undergo exhaustion-associated DNA methylation programming, indicating that efforts to prevent this process may be an attractive approach to improve CAR T cell efficacy.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).

Human lifespan is challenging for prospective studies, therefore data from longitudinal studies are limited. Projecting data from mouse models of early-life exposure to human studies offers a tool to address this challenge.C57BL/6J mice were fed low/normal folate diets before and during pregnancy and lactation. Genome-wide promoter methylation was measured in male offspring livers at 17.5 days gestation and 28 weeks. Eight promoters were concurrently hypermethylated by folate depletion in fetuses and adults (>1.10 fold-change; p < 0.05). Processes/pathways potentially influenced by global changes, and function of these eight genes, suggest neurocognitive effects. Human observational and randomized controlled trial data were interrogated for translation. Methylation at birth was inversely associated with maternal plasma folate in six genes (-1.15% to -0.16% per nmol L-1; p < 0.05), while maternal folic acid supplementation was associated with differential methylation of four genes in adulthood. Three CpGs were persistently hypermethylated with lower maternal folate (p = 0.04).Some persistent folate-induced methylation changes in mice are mirrored in humans. This demonstrates utility of mouse data in identifying human loci for interrogation as biomarkers of later-life health.© 2021 The Authors.

Here, we examined the utility of LHFPL6 as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for GC.We explored the clinical relevance, function, and molecular role of LHFPL6 in GC using the MethSurv, cBioPortal, TIMER, Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis, ONCOMINE, MEXPRESS, and EWAS Atlas databases. The GSE118919, GSE29272, and GSE13861 datasets were used for differential expression analysis. Using The Cancer Genome Atlas, we developed a Cox regression model and assessed the clinical significance of LHFPLs. In addition, we used the ""CIBERSORT"" algorithm to make reliable immune infiltration estimations. Western blot and immunohistochemistry were used to examine protein expression. Cell migration and invasion were assessed using transwell experiments. THP-1-derived macrophages and GC cells were co-cultured in order to model tumor-macrophage interactions in vitro. The levels of CD206 and CD163 were measured using immunofluorescence assays. The results were visualized with the ""ggplot2"" and ""circlize"" packages.Our results showed that in GC, LHFPL6 overexpression was significantly associated with a poor prognosis. Our findings also suggested that LHFPL6 may be involved in the activation of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Furthermore, LHFPL6 expression showed a positive correlation with the abundance of M2 macrophages, which are potent immunosuppressors.LHFPL6 could be a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for GC.© 2021 Liu et al."

However, whether DNA methylation dynamics may contribute to cope with mercury (Hg) stress in plants remains to be fully investigated.To probe the potential roles of DNA methylation dynamics in coping with Hg stress in rice.Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing was used to profile the DNA methylation patterns of a rice Hg-resistant line (RHg) selected from a heterozygous mutant of the DNA methyltransferase 1 gene (OsMET1+/-), together with its Hg-sensitive wild-type plants of cv. Nipponbare (Nip) under both normal and Hg stress conditions.Genome-wide locus-specific differential methylation regions (DMRs) were detected between RHg and Nip under normal condition, the predominant DMR patterns were CG hypo-DMRs, CHG hypo-DMRs and CHH hyper-DMRs. In both lines, more hyper- than hypo-DMRs were detected at all three sequence contexts (CG, CHG and CHH) under Hg stress relative to normal condition. Comparison of DNA methylation changes in the two lines under Hg stress indicates that RHg had a more dynamic methylome than the control (Nip). Original DMRs in RHg trended to transform to opposite status (from hyper- to hypo- or vice versa) under Hg stress condition. Gene ontology analysis revealed that Hg-resistance-related DMGs were enriched in diverse biological processes.Our results suggest genome-wide locus-specific DNA methylation repatterning can facilitate rapid acquisition of Hg resistance in rice.© 2021.

Genome-wide DNA methylation was analyzed by reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS). The biological functions of the potential methylation regulated genes were analyzed by Gene Ontology. Gene methylation and expression were confirmed by bisulfite genomic sequencing (BGS) and RT-qPCR.By screening the expression of DNMTs, we identified a marked reduction in DNMT3A at both the mRNA and protein levels in NEC. Genome-wide variation of DNA methylation was detected in NEC lesions. The CG methylation level in almost all unique regions except CpG islands (CGIs) was lower in NEC compared with control. A total of 287 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identified across the whole genome in NEC, 123 of them are located on the CGI in the promoter. The DMR-associated genes were linked to intestinal epithelial permeability, platelet aggregation, and lymphocyte proliferation. Four genes (ZNF335, MPL, RASAL3, and KDM6A) with roles in the regulation of lymphocytes that may predispose the intestine to imbalanced immune processes were further confirmed to be hypermethylated and transcriptionally downregulated.These findings underscore the novel relationship between epigenetic changes and lymphocyte regulation in human NEC, which may have potential diagnostic and therapeutic relevance for NEC.© 2021.

The problem of false-positive sites linked with the responsible site might be bypassed in bacteria with a high homologous recombination rate, such asHelicobacter pylori, which causes gastric cancer. We conducted a small-sample GWAS (125 gastric cancer cases and 115 controls) followed by prediction of gastric cancer and control (duodenal ulcer)H. pyloristrains. We identified 11 single nucleotide polymorphisms (eight amino acid changes) and three DNA motifs that, combined, allowed effective disease discrimination. They were often informative of the underlying molecular mechanisms, such as electric charge alteration at the ligand-binding pocket, alteration in subunit interaction, and mode-switching of DNA methylation.

These results provide both defined targets for further informatic and experimental analyses to gain insights into gastric cancer pathogenesis and a basis for identifying a set of biomarkers for distinguishing theseH. pylori-related diseases."
"34844636","Tracing TET1 expression in prostate cancer: discovery of malignant cells with a distinct oncogenic signature.","Clin Epigenetics","Ten-eleven translocation methylcytosine dioxygenase 1 (TET1) is involved in DNA demethylation and transcriptional regulation, plays a key role in the maintenance of stem cell pluripotency, and is dysregulated in malignant cells. The identification of cancer stem cells (CSCs) driving tumor growth and metastasis is the primary objective of biomarker discovery in aggressive prostate cancer (PCa). In this context, we analyzed TET1 expression in PCa.A large-scale immunohistochemical analysis of TET1 was performed in normal prostate (NOR) and PCa using conventional slides (50 PCa specimens) and tissue microarrays (669 NOR and 1371 PCa tissue cores from 371 PCa specimens). Western blotting, RT-qPCR, and 450 K methylation array analyses were performed on PCa cell lines. Genome-wide correlation, gene regulatory network, and functional genomics studies were performed using publicly available data sources and bioinformatics tools.In NOR, TET1 was exclusively expressed in normal cytokeratin 903 (CK903)-positive basal cells. In PCa, TET1 was frequently detected in alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR)-positive tumor cell clusters and was detectable at all tumor stages and Gleason scores. Pearson's correlation analyses of PCa revealed 626 TET1-coactivated genes (r > 0.5) primarily encoding chromatin remodeling and mitotic factors. Moreover, signaling pathways regulating antiviral processes (62 zinc finger, ZNF, antiviral proteins) and the pluripotency of stem cells were activated. A significant proportion of detected genes exhibited TET1-correlated promoter hypomethylation. There were 161 genes encoding transcription factors (TFs), of which 133 were ZNF-TFs with promoter binding sites in TET1 and in the vast majority of TET1-coactivated genes.TET1-expressing cells are an integral part of PCa and may represent CSCs with oncogenic potential.© 2021.

"34843896","Epitranscriptomic Analysis of N6-methyladenosine in Infant Rhesus Macaques after Multiple Sevoflurane Anesthesia.","Neuroscience","Clinical investigations to date have proposed the possibility that exposure to anesthetics is associated with neurodevelopmental deficits. Sevoflurane is the most commonly used general anesthetic in pediatric patients. Animal studies have demonstrated that multiple exposures to sevoflurane during the postnatal period resulted in neuropathological brain changes and long-term cognitive deficits. However, the underlying mechanisms remain to be clarified. In this study, methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeRIP-Seq) was performed to acquire genome-wide profiling of RNA N6-methyladenosine (m6A) in the prefrontal cortex of infant rhesus macaques. The macaques in the sevoflurane group had more m6A peaks than the macaques in the control group (p ≤ 0.05). After sevoflurane treatment, the mRNA levels of YT521-B homology domain family 1 (YTHDF1) and YT521-B homology domain family 3 (YTHDF3) were decreased, and sevoflurane anesthesia dynamically regulated RNA m6A methylation. Gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed that after sevoflurane exposure, genes with increased methylation of m6A sites were enriched in some physiological processes relevant to neurodevelopment, mainly focused on synaptic plasticity. The female macaques had 18 hypermethylated genes. The males had 35 hypermethylated genes, and some physiological processes related to the regulation of synaptic structure were enriched. Rhesus macaques are genetically closer to human beings. Our findings can help in the study of the mechanism of sevoflurane-relevant neurodevelopmental deficits at the posttranscriptional level and can provide new insights into potential clinical preventions and interventions for the neurotoxicity of neonatal anesthesia exposure.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).

Despite this, few studies have characterised the association of binge PAE with DNA methylation in offspring.Methods:We investigated the association between binge PAE and genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in a sex-specific manner in neonatal buccal and placental samples.Results:We identified no differentially methylated CpGs or differentially methylated regions (DMRs) at false discovery rate <0.05. However, using a sum-of-ranks approach, we identified a DMR in each tissue of female offspring. The DMR identified in buccal samples is located near regions with previously-reported associations to fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) and binge PAE.Conclusion:Our findings warrant further replication and highlight a potential epigenetic link between binge PAE and FASD."

We measured DNA methylation in peripheral blood collected in infancy (9-15 months of age) in 243 children; and in a subset of 50 children, we also measured methylation in childhood (6-9 years of age) to examine persistence, and at birth (in cord blood) to examine temporality. We performed multivariable linear regression of infant diet on the outcome of methylation using epigenome-wide and candidate site approaches. We identified six novel CpG sites associated with breastfeeding duration using an EWAS approach. One differentially methylated site presented directionally consistent associations with breastfeeding (cg00574958,CPT1A) in infancy and childhood but not at birth. Two differentially methylated sites in infancy (cg19693031,TXNIP; cg23307264,KHSRP) were associated with breastfeeding and were not present at birth; however, these associations did not persist into childhood. Associations between infant diet and methylation in infancy at three sites (cg22369607,AP001525.1; cg2409200,TBCD; cg27173510,PGBD5) were also present at birth, suggesting the influence of exposures other than infant diet. Infant diet exposures are associated with persistent methylation differences inCPT1A, which may be one mechanism behind infant diet's long-term health effects."

However, studies on the role of m6A in neuronal development are sparse and not well-documented. The m6A detection remains challenging due to its inconsistent pattern and less sensitivity by the current detection techniques. Therefore, we applied a sliding window technique to identify the consensus site (5'-GGACT-3')n≥ 2 and annotated all m6A hotspots in the human genome. Over 6.78 × 107hotspots were identified and 96.4% were found to be located in the non-coding regions, suggesting that methylation occurs before splicing. Several genes,RPS6K, NRP1, NRXN, EGFR, YTHDF2, have been involved in various stages of neuron development and their functioning. However, the contribution of m6A in these genes needs further validation in the experimental model. Thus, the present study elaborates the location of m6A in the human genome and its function in neuron physiology."

We developed a model of ""epilepsy-in-a-dish"" based on dissociated primary neuronal cells from neonatal rat hippocampus. We demonstrate how a single application of glutamate stimulated neurons to generate spontaneous synchronous spiking activity with further progression into spontaneous seizure-like events after a distinct latency period. By computational analysis, we compared the observed neuronal activity in vitro with intracranial electroencephalography (EEG) data recorded from epilepsy patients and identified strong similarities, including a related sequence of events with defined onset, progression, and termination. Next, a link between the neurophysiological changes with network composition and cellular structure down to molecular changes was established. Temporal development of epileptiform network activity correlated with increased neurite outgrowth and altered branching, increased ratio of glutamatergic over GABAergic synapses, and loss of calbindin-positive interneurons, as well as genome-wide alterations in DNA methylation. Differentially methylated genes were engaged in various cellular activities related to cellular structure, intracellular signaling, and regulation of gene expression. Our data provide evidence that a single short-term excess of glutamate is sufficient to induce a cascade of events covering different scales from molecule- to network-level, all of which jointly contribute to seizure development."
"34831111","DNA Methylation and Schizophrenia: Current Literature and Future Perspective.","Cells","Schizophrenia is a neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by dissociation of thoughts, idea, identity, and emotions. It has no central pathophysiological mechanism and precise diagnostic markers. Despite its high heritability, there are also environmental factors implicated in the development of schizophrenia. Epigenetic factors are thought to mediate the effects of environmental factors in the development of the disorder. Epigenetic modifications like DNA methylation are a risk factor for schizophrenia. Targeted gene approach studies attempted to find candidate gene methylation, but the results are contradictory. Genome-wide methylation studies are insufficient in literature and the available data do not cover different populations like the African populations. The current genome-wide studies have limitations related to the sample and methods used. Studies are required to control for these limitations. Integration of DNA methylation, gene expression, and their effects are important in the understanding of the development of schizophrenia and search for biomarkers. There are currently no precise and functional biomarkers for the disorder. Several epigenetic markers have been reported to be common in functional and peripheral tissue. This makes the peripheral tissue epigenetic changes a surrogate of functional tissue, suggesting common epigenetic alteration can be used as biomarkers of schizophrenia in peripheral tissue."

Although the biological mechanisms underlying these effects are poorly understood, epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation, have the potential to link early-life environments to alterations in physiological systems, with long-term functional implications. We investigated the consequences of two prenatal insults, prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) and food-related stress, on DNA methylation profiles of the rat brain during early development. As these insults can have sex-specific effects on biological outcomes, we analyzed epigenome-wide DNA methylation patterns in prefrontal cortex, a key brain region involved in cognition, executive function, and behavior, of both males and females. We found sex-dependent and sex-concordant influences of these insults on epigenetic patterns. These alterations occurred in genes and pathways related to brain development and immune function, suggesting that PAE and food-related stress may reprogram neurobiological/physiological systems partly through central epigenetic changes, and may do so in a sex-dependent manner. Such epigenetic changes may reflect the sex-specific effects of prenatal insults on long-term functional and health outcomes and have important implications for understanding possible mechanisms underlying fetal alcohol spectrum disorder and other neurodevelopmental disorders."
"34825528","High-Resolution Exposomics and Metabolomics Reveals Specific Associations in Cholestatic Liver Diseases.","Hepatol Commun","Progress in development of prognostic and therapeutic options for the rare cholestatic liver diseases, primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), is hampered by limited knowledge of their pathogeneses. In particular, the potential role of hepatotoxic and/or metabolism-altering environmental chemicals in the pathogenesis of these diseases remains relatively unstudied. Moreover, the extent to which metabolic pathways are altered due to ongoing cholestasis and subsequent liver damage or possibly influenced by hepatotoxic chemicals is poorly understood. In this study, we applied a comprehensive exposomics-metabolomics approach to uncover potential pathogenic contributors to PSC and PBC. We used untargeted high-resolution mass spectrometry to characterize a wide range of exogenous chemicals and endogenous metabolites in plasma and tested them for association with disease. Exposome-wide association studies (EWAS) identified environmental chemicals, including pesticides, additives and persistent pollutants, that were associated with PSC and/or PBC, suggesting potential roles for these compounds in disease pathogenesis. Metabolome-wide association studies (MWAS) found disease-associated alterations to amino acid, eicosanoid, lipid, co-factor, nucleotide, mitochondrial and microbial metabolic pathways, many of which were shared between PSC and PBC. Notably, this analysis implicates a potential role of the 5-lipoxygenase pathway in the pathogenesis of these diseases. Finally, EWAS × MWAS network analysis uncovered linkages between environmental agents and disrupted metabolic pathways that provide insight into potential mechanisms for PSC and PBC. Conclusion: This study establishes combined exposomics-metabolomics as a generalizable approach to identify potentially pathogenic environmental agents and enumerate metabolic alterations that may impact PSC and PBC, providing a foundation for diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.© 2021 The Authors.

Yet, the dynamicity of epigenetic age after exposure to trauma and the factors that influence epigenetic age are not fully understood. This research evaluated longitudinal changes in epigenetic age before and after exposure to work-related trauma among paramedicine students. We further investigated psychological and social risk (psychological distress, posttraumatic stress disorder/PTSD symptom severity, professional quality of life) and protective factors (social support and organisational membership) that drive epigenetic aging at both time points.The study comprised of 80 samples of University paramedicine students including 40 individuals at two time points - t0 (baseline) and t1 (post-trauma exposure). Epigenome-wide analysis was performed from t0 and t1 saliva using the Illumina EPIC arrays that cover >860k probes. Data analysis was performed using R via generalized regression models. The epigenetic age was calculated based on the Horvath algorithm, GrimAge and SkinBloodAge were calculated using the Horvath online calculator, and p-value for significance was corrected using the FDR method for multiple testing corrections.The epigenetic age at t0 and t1 were highly correlated with chronological age and with each other (r = 0.84-0.94). Baseline epigenetic age and follow-up epigenetic age were significantly associated with risk factors of psychological distress and PTSD symptom severity. Among the protective factors, a sense of psychological organisational membership at the start of the paramedicine course as measured at baseline significantly reduced epigenetic age at baseline and post-trauma exposure. On the other hand, receiving social support acted as a protective factor only after exposure to trauma (follow-up), decreasing epigenetic aging at follow-up. GrimAge acceleration at follow-up was significantly associated with increased PTSD symptom severity at baseline and follow-up. Moreover, increased social support at baseline and follow-up was associated with reduced follow-up GrimAge acceleration.These results demonstrate that epigenetic aging is dynamic and changes after exposure to trauma. Additionally, results demonstrate that different risk and protective factors influence epigenetic aging at different times. In conclusion, the research identified risk and protective factors associated with epigenetic aging pre- and post-trauma exposure, with implications for health and well-being among individuals exposed to trauma.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Our data reveal a wide range of termination windows among genes, ranging from ~ 50 nt to over 1000 nt. We also observe efficient termination before downstream tRNA genes, suggesting that chromatin structure around the promoter region of tRNA genes may block pol II elongation. 5' Cleaved readthrough transcription in atxrn3 with delayed termination can run into downstream genes to produce normally spliced and polyadenylated mRNAs in the absence of their own transcription initiation. Consistent with previous reports, we also observe long chimeric transcripts with cryptic splicing in fpa mutant; but loss of CG DNA methylation has no obvious impact on termination in the met1 mutant.Our method is applicable to establish a comprehensive termination landscape in a broad range of species.© 2021.

This systematic review summarized studies of the last decade, using the PubMed database, evaluating blood markers, and the association between blood- or structural neuroimaging markers and cognition across the chemotherapy trajectory for primary breast cancer, following PRISMA guidelines. Forty-four studies were included. Differences were observed in all blood marker categories, from on-therapy until years post-chemotherapy. Associations were found between cognitive functioning and (1) blood markers (mainly inflammation-related) during, shortly-, or years post-chemotherapy and (2) white and gray matter metrics in frontal, temporal and parietal brain regions months up until years post-chemotherapy. Preliminary evidence exists for epigenetic and metabolic changes being associated with cognition, only after chemotherapy. This review demonstrated time-dependent associations between specific blood-based and structural neuroimaging markers with cognitive impairment in patients with breast cancer. Future studies are encouraged to include both neuroimaging- and blood markers (e.g. of neuronal integrity, epigenetics and metabolism) to predict long-term cognitive effects of chemotherapy.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

"34924946","Intersection of Epigenetic and Immune Alterations: Implications for Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder and Mental Health.","Front Neurosci","Prenatal alcohol exposure can impact virtually all body systems, resulting in a host of structural, neurocognitive, and behavioral abnormalities. Among the adverse impacts associated with prenatal alcohol exposure are alterations in immune function, including an increased incidence of infections and alterations in immune/neuroimmune parameters that last throughout the life-course. Epigenetic patterns are also highly sensitive to prenatal alcohol exposure, with widespread alcohol-related alterations to epigenetic profiles, including changes in DNA methylation, histone modifications, and miRNA expression. Importantly, epigenetic programs are crucial for immune system development, impacting key processes such as immune cell fate, differentiation, and activation. In addition to their role in development, epigenetic mechanisms are emerging as attractive candidates for the biological embedding of environmental factors on immune function and as mediators between early-life exposures and long-term health. Here, following an overview of the impact of prenatal alcohol exposure on immune function and epigenetic patterns, we discuss the potential role for epigenetic mechanisms in reprogramming of immune function and the consequences for health and development. We highlight a range of both clinical and animal studies to provide insights into the array of immune genes impacted by alcohol-related epigenetic reprogramming. Finally, we discuss potential consequences of alcohol-related reprogramming of immune/neuroimmune functions and their effects on the increased susceptibility to mental health disorders. Overall, the collective findings from animal models and clinical studies highlight a compelling relationship between the immune system and epigenetic pathways. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying the long-term and multisystem effects of prenatal alcohol exposure, laying the groundwork for possible novel interventions and therapeutic strategies to treat individuals prenatally exposed to alcohol.Copyright © 2021 Lussier, Bodnar and Weinberg."

Tobacco exposure is associated with 80-90% of lung cancer cases. TheSULT1C2sulfotransferase modifies xenobiotic compounds to enhance secretion but can also render these compounds carcinogenic. To determine ifSULT1C2contributes to tobacco-related carcinogenesis in the lung, we analyzed the expression and epigenetic state ofSULT1C2in human lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) samples and in LUAD cell lines exposed to cigarette smoke condensate (CSC).SULT1C2expression was significantly positively correlated to overall LUAD patient survival in smokers, was elevated in LUAD tumors compared to adjacent non-tumor lung, and was significantly correlated with levels of patient exposure to tobacco smoke.SULT1C2promoter DNA methylation was inversely correlated with expression in LUAD, and hypomethylation of theSULT1C2promoter was observed in Asian patients, as compared to Caucasians. In vitro analysis of LUAD cell lines indicates that CSC stimulates expression ofSULT1C2in a dose-dependent and cell-line-specific manner. In vitro methylation of theSULT1C2promoter significantly decreased transcriptional activity of a reporter plasmid, andSULT1C2expression was activated by the DNA demethylating agent 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine in a cell line in which theSULT1C2promoter was hypermethylated. An aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) binding site was detected spanning critical methylation sites upstream ofSULT1C2. CSC exposure significantly increased AHR binding to this predicted binding site in theSULT1C2promoter in multiple lung cell lines. Our data suggest that CSC exposure leads to activation of the AHR transcription factor, increased binding to theSULT1C2promoter, and upregulation ofSULT1C2expression and that this process is inhibited by DNA methylation at theSULT1C2locus. Additionally, our results suggest that the level ofSULT1C2promoter methylation and gene expression in normal lung varies depending on the race of the patient, which could in part reflect the molecular mechanisms of racial disparities seen in lung cellular responses to cigarette smoke exposure."

A major defense mechanism involves the activation of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) transcription factor encoded by the NFE2L2 gene, which can accelerate the detoxification of electrophilic carcinogens and prevent cancer and on the other hand in certain exposure contexts may exacerbate the carcinogenic process. NRF2-target genes activated under these conditions can be used as biomarkers of stress signalling, while activation of NRF2 can also reveal the epigenetic mechanisms that modulate NFE2L2 expression. Epigenetic mechanisms that regulate NFE2L2 and the gene for its adaptor protein KEAP1 include DNA methylation, histone modifications and microRNA.

"34884790","Physical Activity and DNA Methylation in Humans.","Int J Mol Sci","Physical activity is a strong stimulus influencing the overall physiology of the human body. Exercises lead to biochemical changes in various tissues and exert an impact on gene expression. Exercise-induced changes in gene expression may be mediated by epigenetic modifications, which rearrange the chromatin structure and therefore modulate its accessibility for transcription factors. One of such epigenetic mark is DNA methylation that involves an attachment of a methyl group to the fifth carbon of cytosine residue present in CG dinucleotides (CpG). DNA methylation is catalyzed by a family of DNA methyltransferases. This reversible DNA modification results in the recruitment of proteins containing methyl binding domain and further transcriptional co-repressors leading to the silencing of gene expression. The accumulation of CpG dinucleotides, referred as CpG islands, occurs at the promoter regions in a great majority of human genes. Therefore, changes in DNA methylation profile affect the transcription of multiple genes. A growing body of evidence indicates that exercise training modulates DNA methylation in muscles and adipose tissue. Some of these epigenetic markers were associated with a reduced risk of chronic diseases. This review summarizes the current knowledge about the influence of physical activity on the DNA methylation status in humans."

To identify genetic markers modulating ovarian cancer outcome, we performed a genome-wide association study in 2130 Chinese ovarian cancer patients and found a hitherto unrecognized locus at 3p26.1 to be associated with the overall survival (Pcombined = 8.90 × 10-10). Subsequent statistical fine-mapping, functional annotation, and eQTL mapping prioritized a likely casual SNP rs9311399 in the non-coding regulatory region. Mechanistically, rs9311399 altered its enhancer activity through an allele-specific transcription factor binding and a long-range interaction with the promoter of a lncRNA BHLHE40-AS1. Deletion of the rs9311399-associated enhancer resulted in expression changes in several oncogenic signaling pathway genes and a decrease in tumor growth. Thus, we have identified a novel genetic locus that is associated with ovarian cancer survival possibly through a long-range gene regulation of oncogenic pathways.© 2021. The Author(s)."

Therefore, birthdates are typically unknown or inaccurate. Birthdates would be useful for deriving important traits (growth rate; calving interval), breed registrations, and making management decisions. Epigenetic clocks use methylation of DNA to predict an individual's age. An epigenetic clock for cattle could provide a solution to the challenges of industry birthdate recording. Here we derived the first epigenetic clock for tropically adapted cattle using portable sequencing devices from tail hair, a tissue which is widely used in industry for genotyping. Cattle (n= 66) with ages ranging from 0.35 to 15.7 years were sequenced using Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION and methylation was called at CpG sites across the genome. Sites were then filtered and used to calculate a covariance relationship matrix based on methylation state. Best linear unbiased prediction was used with 10-fold cross validation to predict age. A second methylation relationship matrix was also calculated that contained sites associated with genes used in the dog and human epigenetic clocks. The correlation between predicted age and actual age was 0.71 for all sites and 0.60 for dog and human gene epigenetic clock sites. The mean absolute deviation was 1.4 years for animals aged less than 3 years of age, and 1.5 years for animals aged 3-10 years.

Methylation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has been studied using whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS), but recent evidence has uncovered technical issues which introduce a potential bias during methylation quantification. Here, we validate the technical concerns of WGBS, and develop and assess the accuracy of a new protocol for mtDNA nucleotide variant-specific methylation using single-molecule Oxford Nanopore Sequencing (ONS). Our approach circumvents confounders by enriching for full-length molecules over nuclear DNA. Variant calling analysis against showed that 99.5% of homoplasmic mtDNA variants can be reliably identified providing there is adequate sequencing depth. We show that some of the mtDNA methylation signal detected by ONS is due to sequence-specific false positives introduced by the technique. The residual signal was observed across several human primary and cancer cell lines and multiple human tissues, but was always below the error threshold modelled using negative controls. We conclude that there is no evidence for CpG methylation in human mtDNA, thus resolving previous controversies. Additionally, we developed a reliable protocol to study epigenetic modifications of mtDNA at single-molecule and single-base resolution, with potential applications beyond CpG methylation.© The Author(s) 2021.

The lack of R/Bioconductor tools for the effective visualization of nanopore methylation profiles between samples from different experimental groups led us to develop the NanoMethViz R package. Our software can handle methylation output generated from a range of different methylation callers and manages large datasets using a compressed data format. To fully explore the methylation patterns in a dataset, NanoMethViz allows plotting of data at various resolutions. At the sample-level, we use dimensionality reduction to look at the relationships between methylation profiles in an unsupervised way. We visualize methylation profiles of classes of features such as genes or CpG islands by scaling them to relative positions and aggregating their profiles. At the finest resolution, we visualize methylation patterns across individual reads along the genome using the spaghetti plot and heatmaps, allowing users to explore particular genes or genomic regions of interest. In summary, our software makes the handling of methylation signal more convenient, expands upon the visualization options for nanopore data and works seamlessly with existing methylation analysis tools available in the Bioconductor project.

Throughout pregnancy, the placenta plays a central role in fetal programming; it regulates the in utero environment and acts as a gatekeeper for nutrient and waste exchange between the mother and the fetus. Maternal exposure to air pollution, including heavy metals, can reach the placenta, where they alter DNA methylation patterns, leading to changes in placental function and fetal reprogramming. This review explores the current knowledge on placental DNA methylation changes associated with prenatal air pollution (including heavy metals) exposure and highlights its effects on fetal development and disease susceptibility. Prenatal exposure to air pollution and heavy metals was associated with altered placental DNA methylation at the global and promoter regions of genes involved in biological processes such as energy metabolism, circadian rhythm, DNA repair, inflammation, cell differentiation, and organ development. The altered placental methylation of these genes was, in some studies, associated with adverse birth outcomes such as low birth weight, small for gestational age, and decreased head circumference. Moreover, few studies indicate that DNA methylation changes in the placenta were sex-specific, and infants born with altered placental DNA methylation patterns were predisposed to developing neurobehavioral abnormalities, cancer, and atopic dermatitis. These findings highlight the importance of more effective and stricter environmental and public health policies to reduce air pollution and protect human health."

Due to its ubiquitous use, it is detectable in air, water and foodstuffs and can accumulate in human biological fluids and tissues representing a severe human health risk. In plants, glyphosate acts as an inhibitor of the shikimate pathway, which is absent in vertebrates. Due to this, international scientific authorities have long-considered glyphosate as a compound that has no or weak toxicity in humans. However, increasing evidence has highlighted the toxicity of glyphosate and its formulations in animals and human cells and tissues. Thus, despite the extension of the authorization of the use of glyphosate in Europe until 2022, several countries have begun to take precautionary measures to reduce its diffusion. Glyphosate has been detected in urine, blood and maternal milk and has been found to induce the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and several cytotoxic and genotoxic effects in vitro and in animal models directly or indirectly through its metabolite, aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA). This review aims to summarize the more relevant findings on the biological effects and underlying molecular mechanisms of glyphosate, with a particular focus on glyphosate's potential to induce inflammation, DNA damage and alterations in gene expression profiles as well as adverse effects on reproduction and development."
"35008971","Epigenetic Mechanisms in Parenchymal Lung Diseases: Bystanders or Therapeutic Targets?","Int J Mol Sci","Epigenetic responses due to environmental changes alter chromatin structure, which in turn modifies the phenotype, gene expression profile, and activity of each cell type that has a role in the pathophysiology of a disease. Pulmonary diseases are one of the major causes of death in the world, including lung cancer, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pulmonary hypertension (PH), lung tuberculosis, pulmonary embolism, and asthma. Several lines of evidence indicate that epigenetic modifications may be one of the main factors to explain the increasing incidence and prevalence of lung diseases including IPF and COPD. Interestingly, isolated fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells from patients with pulmonary diseases such as IPF and PH that were cultured ex vivo maintained the disease phenotype. The cells often show a hyper-proliferative, apoptosis-resistant phenotype with increased expression of extracellular matrix (ECM) and activated focal adhesions suggesting the presence of an epigenetically imprinted phenotype. Moreover, many abnormalities observed in molecular processes in IPF patients are shown to be epigenetically regulated, such as innate immunity, cellular senescence, and apoptotic cell death. DNA methylation, histone modification, and microRNA regulation constitute the most common epigenetic modification mechanisms."

We aimed to analyse the impact of declining active smoking prevalence and the implementation of smoke-free legislation on the incidence of children born with a cleft lip and/or palate within the United Kingdom.We conducted regression analysis using national administrative data in the United Kingdom between 2000-2018. The main outcome measure was orofacial cleft incidence, reported annually for England, Wales and Northern Ireland and separately for Scotland. First, we conducted an ecological study with longitudinal time-series analysis using smoking prevalence data for females over 16 years of age. Second, we used a natural experiment design with interrupted time-series analysis to assess the impact of smoke-free legislation. Over the study period, the annual incidence of orofacial cleft per 10,000 live births ranged from 14.2-16.2 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland and 13.4-18.8 in Scotland. The proportion of active smokers amongst females in the United Kingdom declined by 37% during the study period. Adjusted regression analysis did not show a correlation between the proportion of active smokers and orofacial cleft incidence in either dataset, although we were unable to exclude a modest effect of the magnitude seen in individual-level observational studies. The data in England, Wales and Northern Ireland suggested an 8% reduction in orofacial cleft incidence (RR 0.92, 95%CI 0.85 to 0.99; P = 0.024) following the implementation of smoke-free legislation. In Scotland, there was weak evidence for an increase in orofacial cleft incidence following smoke-free legislation (RR 1.16, 95%CI 0.94 to 1.44; P = 0.173).These two ecological studies offer a novel insight into the influence of smoking in orofacial cleft aetiology, adding to the evidence base from individual-level studies. Our results suggest that smoke-free legislation may have reduced orofacial cleft incidence in England, Wales and Northern Ireland."
"35013336","Protein interaction networks define the genetic architecture of preterm birth.","Sci Rep","The likely genetic architecture of complex diseases is that subgroups of patients share variants in genes in specific networks sufficient to express a shared phenotype. We combined high throughput sequencing with advanced bioinformatic approaches to identify such subgroups of patients with variants in shared networks. We performed targeted sequencing of patients with 2 or 3 generations of preterm birth on genes, gene sets and haplotype blocks that were highly associated with preterm birth. We analyzed the data using a multi-sample, protein-protein interaction (PPI) tool to identify significant clusters of patients associated with preterm birth. We identified shared protein interaction networks among preterm cases in two statistically significant clusters, p < 0.001. We also found two small control-dominated clusters. We replicated these data on an independent, large birth cohort. Separation testing showed significant similarity scores between the clusters from the two independent cohorts of patients. Canonical pathway analysis of the unique genes defining these clusters demonstrated enrichment in inflammatory signaling pathways, the glucocorticoid receptor, the insulin receptor, EGF and B-cell signaling, These results support a genetic architecture defined by subgroups of patients that share variants in genes in specific networks and pathways which are sufficient to give rise to the disease phenotype.© 2022.

"34906220","Associations between indicators of socioeconomic position and DNA methylation: a scoping review.","Clin Epigenetics","Socioeconomic position (SEP) is a major determinant of health across the life course. Yet, little is known about the biological mechanisms explaining this relationship. One possibility widely pursued in the scientific literature is that SEP becomes biologically embedded through epigenetic processes such as DNA methylation (DNAm), wherein the socioeconomic environment causes no alteration in the DNA sequence but modifies gene activity in ways that shape health.To understand the evidence supporting a potential SEP-DNAm link, we performed a scoping review of published empirical findings on the association between SEP assessed from prenatal development to adulthood and DNAm measured across the life course, with an emphasis on exploring how the developmental timing, duration, and type of SEP exposure influenced DNAm.Across the 37 identified studies, we found that: (1) SEP-related DNAm signatures varied across the timing, duration, and type of SEP indicator; (2) however, longitudinal studies examining repeated SEP and DNAm measures are generally lacking; and (3) prior studies are conceptually and methodologically diverse, limiting the interpretability of findings across studies with respect to these three SEP features.Given the complex relationship between SEP and DNAm across the lifespan, these findings underscore the importance of analyzing SEP features, including timing, duration, and type. To guide future research, we highlight additional research gaps and propose four recommendations to further unravel the relationship between SEP and DNAm.© 2021. The Author(s)."
"34956304","Identifying Gene-Environment Interactions With Robust Marginal Bayesian Variable Selection.","Front Genet","In high-throughput genetics studies, an important aim is to identify gene-environment interactions associated with the clinical outcomes. Recently, multiple marginal penalization methods have been developed and shown to be effective in G×E studies. However, within the Bayesian framework, marginal variable selection has not received much attention. In this study, we propose a novel marginal Bayesian variable selection method for G×E studies. In particular, our marginal Bayesian method is robust to data contamination and outliers in the outcome variables. With the incorporation of spike-and-slab priors, we have implemented the Gibbs sampler based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). The proposed method outperforms a number of alternatives in extensive simulation studies. The utility of the marginal robust Bayesian variable selection method has been further demonstrated in the case studies using data from the Nurse Health Study (NHS).

Epigenetic modification, in particular DNA methylation, represents a mechanism whereby environmental effects impact on the phenotypic expression of human disease. Maternal obesity or overnutrition contributes to the alterations in DNA methylation during early life which, through fetal programming, can predispose the offspring to many metabolic and chronic diseases, such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, obesity, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease. This review aims to summarize findings from human and animal studies, which support the role of maternal obesity in fetal programing and the potential benefit of altering DNA methylation to limit maternal obesity related disease in the offspring."

The present study aimed to measure serum IDO activity in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and to determine its association with glycemic control, oxidative stress, and insulin resistance.Seventy-four patients with T2DM and 74 healthy subjects were selected to participate in this study. Fasting serum biochemical parameters including fasting blood sugar (FBS), HbA1c, insulin, uric acid, albumin, tryptophan, kynurenine, and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) were measured. HOMA-IR, QUICKI, and HOMA-B were calculated using serum FBS and insulin values. IDO activity was estimated using kynurenine/tryptophan ratio (KTR). Data were analyzed using SPSS software (Version 15) andp < 0.05 was considered as a significant difference.The findings showed higher levels of FBS, HbA1c, HOMA-IR, and KTR in the patients compared to the controls.TAC and HOMA-B were significantly lowered in the T2DM patients compared to controls. KTR was significantly correlated with the level of HbA1c, and T2DM patients with poor glycemic control (HbA1c ≤ 8) had significantly higher level of KTR. HOMA-B was significantly correlated with serum tryptophan and inversely correlated with HbA1c.Serum KTR is increased in T2DM patients with poor glycemic control. Potential clinical implications and possible pathogenic roles of IDO in T2DM development should be further elucidated.© Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021."

Here, we presented a cross-sectional study, aiming to evaluate the association of BMI and obesity with long interspersed nuclear elements (LINE-1) methylation, among 488 women from Catania, Italy. LINE-1 methylation was assessed in leukocyte DNA by pyrosequencing. We found a negative association between BMI and LINE-1 methylation level in both the unadjusted and adjusted linear regression models. Accordingly, obese women exhibited lower LINE-1 methylation level than their normal weight counterpart. This association was confirmed after adjusting for the effect of age, educational level, employment status, marital status, parity, menopause, and smoking status. Our findings were in line with previous evidence and encouraged further research to investigate the potential role of DNA methylation markers in the management of obesity.Copyright © 2021 Andrea Maugeri et al."

"35015744","Chronic HIV Infection and Aging: Application of a Geroscience-Guided Approach.","J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr","The ability of virally suppressive antiretroviral therapy use to extend the life span of people with HIV (PWH) implies that the age of PWH will also increase. Among PWH, extended survival comes at a cost of earlier onset and increased rates of aging-associated comorbidities and geriatric syndromes, with persistent inflammation and immune dysregulation consequent to chronic HIV infection and to antiretroviral therapy use contributing to an overall decrease in health span. The geroscience hypothesis proposes that the root causes of most aging-related chronic diseases and conditions is the aging process itself. Hence, therapeutically targeting fundamental aging processes could have a greater impact on alleviating or delaying aging-associated comorbidities than addressing each disease individually. Extending the geroscience hypothesis to PWH, we speculate that targeting basic mechanisms of aging will improve overall health with age. Clinical features and pathophysiologic mechanisms of chronic diseases in PWH qualitatively resemble those seen in older adults without HIV. Therefore, drugs that target any of the pillars of aging, including metformin, rapamycin, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide precursors, may also slow the rate of onset of age-associated comorbidities and geriatric syndromes in PWH. Drugs that selectively induce apoptosis of senescent cells, termed senolytics, may also improve health span among PWH. Preliminary evidence suggests that senescent cell burden is increased in PWH, implying that senescent cells are an excellent therapeutic target for extending health span. Recently initiated clinical trials evaluating senolytics in age-related diseases offer insights into the design and potential implementation of similar trials for PWH.Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

In addition, using blood methylation data from three additional equid species (plains zebra, Grevy's zebras and Somali asses), we develop another clock that applies across all equid species. Castration does not significantly impact the epigenetic aging rate of blood or liver samples from horses.

"34980250","Epigenetic biomarkers of ageing are predictive of mortality risk in a longitudinal clinical cohort of individuals diagnosed with oropharyngeal cancer.","Clin Epigenetics","Epigenetic clocks are biomarkers of ageing derived from DNA methylation levels at a subset of CpG sites. The difference between age predicted by these clocks and chronological age, termed ""epigenetic age acceleration"", has been shown to predict age-related disease and mortality. We aimed to assess the prognostic value of epigenetic age acceleration and a DNA methylation-based mortality risk score with all-cause mortality in a prospective clinical cohort of individuals with head and neck cancer: Head and Neck 5000. We investigated two markers of intrinsic epigenetic age acceleration (IEAAHorvath and IEAAHannum), one marker of extrinsic epigenetic age acceleration (EEAA), one optimised to predict physiological dysregulation (AgeAccelPheno), one optimised to predict lifespan (AgeAccelGrim) and a DNA methylation-based predictor of mortality (ZhangScore). Cox regression models were first used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for associations of epigenetic age acceleration with all-cause mortality in people with oropharyngeal cancer (n = 408; 105 deaths). The added prognostic value of epigenetic markers compared to a clinical model including age, sex, TNM stage and HPV status was then evaluated.IEAAHannum and AgeAccelGrim were associated with mortality risk after adjustment for clinical and lifestyle factors (HRs per standard deviation [SD] increase in age acceleration = 1.30 [95% CI 1.07, 1.57; p = 0.007] and 1.40 [95% CI 1.06, 1.83; p = 0.016], respectively). There was weak evidence that the addition of AgeAccelGrim to the clinical model improved 3-year mortality prediction (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve: 0.80 vs. 0.77; p value for difference = 0.069).In the setting of a large, clinical cohort of individuals with head and neck cancer, our study demonstrates the potential of epigenetic markers of ageing to enhance survival prediction in people with oropharyngeal cancer, beyond established prognostic factors.

Here we aim to leverage metabolomics to impute missing data in clinical variables routinely assessed in large epidemiological and clinical studies.To this end, we have employed ∼26,0001H-NMR metabolomics samples from 28 Dutch cohorts collected within the BBMRI-NL consortium, to create 19 metabolomics-based predictors for clinical variables, including diabetes status (AUC5-Fold CV = 0·94) and lipid medication usage (AUC5-Fold CV = 0·90).Subsequent application in independent cohorts confirmed that our metabolomics-based predictors can indeed be used to impute a wide array of missing clinical variables from a single metabolomics data resource. In addition, application highlighted the potential use of our predictors to explore the effects of totally unobserved confounders in omics association studies. Finally, we show that our predictors can be used to explore risk factor profiles contributing to mortality in older participants.To conclude, we provide1H-NMR metabolomics-based models to impute clinical variables routinely assessed in epidemiological studies and illustrate their merit in scenarios when phenotypic variables are partially incomplete or totally unobserved.BBMRI-NL, X-omics, VOILA, Medical Delta and the Dutch Research Council (NWO-VENI).Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).

Although this work has included early-life exposures, data on maternal exposures and epigenetic aging of their children remain sparse. Using longitudinally collected data from the California, Salinas Valley CHAMACOS study, we examined relationships between maternal Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) reported up to 18 years of life, prior to pregnancy, with eight measures (Horvath, Hannum, SkinBloodClock, Intrinsic, Extrinsic, PhenoAge, GrimAge, and DNAm telomere length) of blood leukocyte epigenetic age acceleration (EAA) in their children at ages 7, 9, and 14 years (N = 238 participants with 483 observations). After adjusting for maternal chronological age at delivery, pregnancy smoking/alcohol use, parity, child gestational age, and estimated leukocyte proportions, higher maternal ACEs were significantly associated with at least a 0.76-year increase in child Horvath and Intrinsic EAA. Higher maternal ACEs were also associated with a 0.04 kb greater DNAm estimate of telomere length of children. Overall, our data suggests that maternal preconception ACEs are associated with biological aging in their offspring in childhood and that preconception ACEs have differential relationships with EAA measures, suggesting different physiologic utilities of EEA measures. Studies are necessary to confirm these findings and to elucidate potential pathways to explain these relationships, which may include intergenerational epigenetic inheritance and persistent physical and social exposomes."

Likewise, integrating information from multiple biological systems, such as the HPA axis and the epigenome, has the potential to identify individuals with enhanced embedding of early life adversity. The current study reports results from the Female Growth and Development Study, a 30-year prospective cohort study of childhood sexual abuse (CSA). Females exposed to substantiated CSA and a demographically-similar comparison condition were enrolled and resting state cortisol concentrations were sampled on seven subsequent occasions across childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. Differences in participants' cortisol trajectories were examined in relation to prior CSA exposure and DNA methylation-derived epigenetic age acceleration at midlife. Bilinear spline growth models revealed a trajectory where cortisol secretion increased until approximately age twenty and then declined into mid-life, consistent with normative trends. However, cortisol concentrations peaked at a lower level and transitioned to the decline phase at an earlier age for females in the CSA condition with increased epigenetic age acceleration. Robustness tests across three independent measures of epigenetic age acceleration demonstrated similar results for lower peak cortisol levels and earlier ages at transition. Results suggest that CSA is associated with significant changes in HPA-axis activity over extended periods of time with these changes most pronounced in females with accelerated epigenetic aging in mid-life. Implications for biological embedding models of early life adversity and adulthood health are discussed.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

"34839356","Psychological and biological resilience modulates the effects of stress on epigenetic aging.","Transl Psychiatry","Our society is experiencing more stress than ever before, leading to both negative psychiatric and physical outcomes. Chronic stress is linked to negative long-term health consequences, raising the possibility that stress is related to accelerated aging. In this study, we examine whether resilience factors affect stress-associated biological age acceleration. Recently developed ""epigenetic clocks"" such as GrimAge have shown utility in predicting biological age and mortality. Here, we assessed the impact of cumulative stress, stress physiology, and resilience on accelerated aging in a community sample (N = 444). Cumulative stress was associated with accelerated GrimAge (P = 0.0388) and stress-related physiologic measures of adrenal sensitivity (Cortisol/ACTH ratio) and insulin resistance (HOMA). After controlling for demographic and behavioral factors, HOMA correlated with accelerated GrimAge (P = 0.0186). Remarkably, psychological resilience factors of emotion regulation and self-control moderated these relationships. Emotion regulation moderated the association between stress and aging (P = 8.82e-4) such that with worse emotion regulation, there was greater stress-related age acceleration, while stronger emotion regulation prevented any significant effect of stress on GrimAge. Self-control moderated the relationship between stress and insulin resistance (P = 0.00732), with high self-control blunting this relationship. In the final model, in those with poor emotion regulation, cumulative stress continued to predict additional GrimAge Acceleration even while accounting for demographic, physiologic, and behavioral covariates. These results demonstrate that cumulative stress is associated with epigenetic aging in a healthy population, and these associations are modified by biobehavioral resilience factors.© 2021.

"34834402","Epigenetic Clock and Circadian Rhythms in Stem Cell Aging and Rejuvenation.","J Pers Med","This review summarizes the current understanding of the interaction between circadian rhythms of gene expression and epigenetic clocks characterized by the specific profile of DNA methylation in CpG-islands which mirror the senescence of all somatic cells and stem cells in particular. Basic mechanisms of regulation for circadian genes CLOCK-BMAL1 as well as downstream clock-controlled genes (ССG) are also discussed here. It has been shown that circadian rhythms operate by the finely tuned regulation of transcription and rely on various epigenetic mechanisms including the activation of enhancers/suppressors, acetylation/deacetylation of histones and other proteins as well as DNA methylation. Overall, up to 20% of all genes expressed by the cell are subject to expression oscillations associated with circadian rhythms. Additionally included in the review is a brief list of genes involved in the regulation of circadian rhythms, along with genes important for cell aging, and oncogenesis. Eliminating some of them (for example,Sirt1) accelerates the aging process, while the overexpression ofSirt1, on the contrary, protects against age-related changes. Circadian regulators control a number of genes that activate the cell cycle (Wee1,c-Myc,p20,p21, andCyclin D1) and regulate histone modification and DNA methylation. Approaches for determining the epigenetic age from methylation profiles across CpG islands in individual cells are described. DNA methylation, which characterizes the function of the epigenetic clock, appears to link together such key biological processes as regeneration and functioning of stem cells, aging and malignant transformation. Finally, the main features of adult stem cell aging in stem cell niches and current possibilities for modulating the epigenetic clock and stem cells rejuvenation as part of antiaging therapy are discussed."

We aimed to compare and validate the predictive ability of these scores and frailty in relation to mortality in a population-based cohort from Germany.DNA methylation in whole blood was measured by the Infinium Methylation EPIC BeadChip kit (EPIC, Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) in two random subsets of the ESTHER cohort study (n = 741 and n = 1030). AgeAccelPheno, AgeAccelGrim, and a revised MRscore to adapt EPIC, the MRscore with 8 CpGs (MRscore-8CpGs), were calculated. Frailty was assessed by a frailty index (FI).During 17 years of follow-up, 458 deaths were observed. All DNAm algorithms and FI were positively correlated with each other. AgeAccelPheno, AgeAccelGrim, MRscore, and FI showed independent associations with all-cause mortality [hazard ratio (95% CI) per SD increase = 1·32 (1·19-1·46), 1·47 (1·32-1·64), 1·73 (1·49-2·01), and 1·31 (1·20-1·43), respectively]. Harrell's C-statistic was 0·710 for a model predicting mortality by age, sex, and leukocyte composition and increased to 0·759 in a model including MRscore-8CpGs and FI. The predictive performance was further improved (Harrell's C-statistic = 0·766) when additionally including AgeAccelPheno and AgeAccelGrim into the model.The combination of a DNA methylation score based on 8 CpGs only and an easy to ascertain frailty index may strongly enhance mortality prediction beyond age and sex.The ESTHER study was funded by grants from the Baden-Württemberg state Ministry of Science, Research and Arts (Stuttgart, Germany), the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Berlin, Germany), the Federal Ministry of Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth (Berlin, Germany), and the Saarland State Ministry of Health, Social Affairs, Women and the Family (Saarbrücken, Germany).

Compared with all others, adolescents conceived with ART had an elevated risk of OCD (hazard ratio [HR], 1.35 [95% CI, 1.20-1.51]), but the association was attenuated and no longer statistically significant after adjustment for parental characteristics (adjusted HR [aHR], 1.10 [95% CI, 0.98-1.24]) and was no longer present when restricted to individuals born to couples with known infertility (aHR, 1.02 [95% CI, 0.89-1.17]). Adolescents conceived with ARTs were not at elevated risk of depression or suicidal behavior compared with other adolescents (irrespective of parental infertility). Type of fertilization (standard in vitro fertilization or intracytoplasmic sperm injection) had no association with outcomes. Compared with non-ART-conceived children of couples with infertility, fresh, but not frozen, embryo transfer was associated with a lower risk of mood disorders (aHR, 0.90 [95% CI, 0.83-0.97]), making frozen embryo transfer appear less advantageous when directly contrasted with fresh embryo transfer.These findings suggest that adolescents conceived with ARTs around the millennium are not at risk of poor psychiatric health compared with the general population, except for an elevated risk of OCD that may be explained by differences in parental characteristics."
"34869387","Vitamin C Rescues <i>in vitro</i> Embryonic Development by Correcting Impaired Active DNA Demethylation.","Front Cell Dev Biol","During preimplantation development, a wave of genome-wide DNA demethylation occurs to acquire a hypomethylated genome of the blastocyst. As an essential epigenomic event, postfertilization DNA demethylation is critical to establish full developmental potential. Despite its importance, this process is prone to be disrupted due to environmental perturbations such as manipulation and culture of embryos duringin vitrofertilization (IVF), and thus leading to epigenetic errors. However, since the first case of aberrant DNA demethylation reported in IVF embryos, its underlying mechanism remains unclear and the strategy for correcting this error remains unavailable in the past decade. Thus, understanding the mechanism responsible for DNA demethylation defects, may provide a potential approach for preventing or correcting IVF-associated complications. Herein, using mouse and bovine IVF embryos as the model, we reported that ten-eleven translocation (TET)-mediated active DNA demethylation, an important contributor to the postfertilization epigenome reprogramming, was impaired throughout preimplantation development. Focusing on modulation of TET dioxygenases, we found vitamin C and α-ketoglutarate, the well-established important co-factors for stimulating TET enzymatic activity, were synthesized in both embryos and the oviduct during preimplantation development. Accordingly, impaired active DNA demethylation can be corrected by incubation of IVF embryos with vitamin C, and thus improving their lineage differentiation and developmental potential. Together, our data not only provides a promising approach for preventing or correcting IVF-associated epigenetic errors, but also highlights the critical role of small molecules or metabolites from maternal paracrine in finetuning embryonic epigenomic reprogramming during early development.Copyright © 2021 Chu, Yao, Xi, Yang, Zhang, Yang, Tian and An."
"34834549","Epigenotype, Genotype, and Phenotype Analysis of Taiwanese Patients with Silver-Russell Syndrome.","J Pers Med","Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorder characterized by severe intrauterine growth retardation, poor postnatal growth, characteristic facial features, and body asymmetry. Hypomethylation of the imprinted genes of the chromosome 11p15.5 imprinting gene cluster and maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 7 (mUPD7) are the major epigenetic disturbances. The aim of this study was to characterize the epigenotype, genotype, and phenotype of these patients in Taiwan.Two hundred and six subjects with clinically suspected SRS were referred for diagnostic testing, which was performed by profiling the methylation ofH19-associated imprinting center (IC) 1 and the imprintedPEG1/MESTregion using methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification and high-resolution melting analysis with a methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction assay. We also applied a whole genome strategy to detect copy number changes and loss of heterozygosity. Clinical manifestations were recorded and analyzed according to the SRS scoring system proposed by Bartholdi et al. Results: Among the 206 referred subjects, 100 were classified as having a clinical diagnosis of SRS (score ≥ 8, maximum = 15) and 106 had an SRS score ≤ 7. Molecular lesions were detected in 45% (45/100) of the subjects with a clinical diagnosis of SRS, compared to 5% (5/106) of those with an SRS score ≤ 7. Thirty-seven subjects had IC1 hypomethylation, ten subjects had mUPD7, and three subjects had microdeletions. Several clinical features were found to be statistically different (p< 0.05) between the ""IC1 hypomethylation"" and ""mUPD7"" groups, including relative macrocephaly at birth (89% vs. 50%), triangular shaped face (89% vs. 50%), clinodactyly of the fifth finger (68% vs. 20%), and SRS score (11.4 ± 2.2 vs. 8.3 ± 2.5).The SRS score was positively correlated with the molecular diagnosis rate (p< 0.001). The SRS subjects with mUPD7 seemed to have fewer typical features and lower SRS scores than those with IC1 hypomethylation. Careful clinical observation and timely molecular confirmation are important to allow for an early diagnosis and multidisciplinary management of these patients."
"34828310","Epigenetic Mechanisms of ART-Related Imprinting Disorders: Lessons From iPSC and Mouse Models.","Genes (Basel)","The rising frequency of ART-conceived births is accompanied by the need for an improved understanding of the implications of ART on gametes and embryos. Increasing evidence from mouse models and human epidemiological data suggests that ART procedures may play a role in the pathophysiology of certain imprinting disorders (IDs), including Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, Silver-Russell syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome, and Angelman syndrome. The underlying molecular basis of this association, however, requires further elucidation. In this review, we discuss the epigenetic and imprinting alterations of in vivo mouse models and human iPSC models of ART. Mouse models have demonstrated aberrant regulation of imprinted genes involved with ART-related IDs. In the past decade, iPSC technology has provided a platform for patient-specific cellular models of culture-associated perturbed imprinting. However, despite ongoing efforts, a deeper understanding of the susceptibility of iPSCs to epigenetic perturbation is required if they are to be reliably used for modelling ART-associated IDs. Comparing the patterns of susceptibility of imprinted genes in mouse models and IPSCs in culture improves the current understanding of the underlying mechanisms of ART-linked IDs with implications for our understanding of the influence of environmental factors such as culture and hormone treatments on epigenetically important regions of the genome such as imprints."

During pregnancy leptin is also secreted by the placenta, as well as being a key regulatory cytokine for the development, homeostatic regulation and nutrient transport within the placenta. South Asians have a high burden of type 2 diabetes, partly attributed to a ""thin-fat-phenotype"".Our aim was to investigate how maternal ethnicity, adiposity and glucose- and lipid/cholesterol levels in pregnancy are related to placental leptin gene (LEP) DNA methylation.We performed DNA methylation analyses of 13 placentalLEPCpG sites in 40 ethnic Europeans and 40 ethnic South Asians participating in the STORK-Groruddalen cohort.South Asian ethnicity and gestational diabetes (GDM) were associated with higher placentalLEPmethylation. The largest ethnic difference was found for CpG11 [5.8% (95% CI: 2.4, 9.2), p<0.001], and the strongest associations with GDM was seen for CpG5 [5.2% (1.4, 9.0), p=0.008]. Higher maternal LDL-cholesterol was associated with lower placentalLEPmethylation, in particular for CpG11 [-3.6% (-5.5, -1.4) per one mmol/L increase in LDL, p<0.001]. After adjustments, including for nutritional factors involved in the one-carbon-metabolism cycle (vitamin D, B12 and folate levels), ethnic differences in placentalLEPmethylation were strongly attenuated, while associations with glucose and LDL-cholesterol persisted.Maternal glucose and lipid metabolism is related to placentalLEPmethylation, whilst metabolic and nutritional factors largely explain a higher methylation level among ethnic South Asians.Copyright © 2021 Sletner, Moen, Yajnik, Lekanova, Sommer, Birkeland, Jenum and Böttcher."

Although alterations in attentional control seem to play a central role in the psychopathology of social anxiety disorder, the neural underpinnings in prefrontal brain regions have not yet been fully clarified.The present study used functional MRI in participants (age 18-50 yr) with social anxiety disorder (n= 42, 31 female) and without (n= 58, 33 female). It investigated the interrelation of the effects of social anxiety disorder and early-life adversity (a main environmental risk factor of social anxiety disorder) on brain activity during an attentional control task. We applied DNA methylation analysis to determine whether epigenetic modulation in the gene encoding the glucocorticoid receptor,NR3C1, might play a mediating role in this process.We identified 2 brain regions in the left and medial prefrontal cortex that exhibited an interaction effect of social anxiety disorder and early-life adversity. In participants with low levels of early-life adversity, neural activity in response to disorder-related stimuli was increased in association with social anxiety disorder. In participants with high levels of early-life adversity, neural activity was increased only in participants without social anxiety disorder.NR3C1DNA methylation partly mediated the effect of social anxiety disorder on brain activity as a function of early-life adversity.The absence of behavioural correlates associated with social anxiety disorder limited functional interpretation of the results.These findings demonstrate that the neurobiological processes that underlie social anxiety disorder might be fundamentally different depending on experiences of early-life adversity. Long-lasting effects of early-life adversity might be encoded inNR3C1DNA methylation and entail alterations in social anxiety disorder-related activity patterns in the neural network of attentional control.© 2021 CMA Joule Inc. or its licensors."

Pre- and post-surgery blood from epilepsy subjects undergoing neurosurgery were collected. DNA methylation (DNAm) levels of the TNF gene, IL1B gene, and IL6 gene by the Illumina EPIC array method, and DNAm levels of the TNF gene by pyrosequencing, were analyzed. Blood from 37 subjects were analyzed by the EPIC array method, and blood from 27 subjects were analyzed by pyrosequencing. Several CpGs in the TNF gene in preoperative blood showed a negative correlation between their DNAm and age both in the POD group and in the non-POD group. However, these negative correlations were observed only in the POD group after neurosurgery. Neurosurgery significantly altered DNAm levels at 17 out of 24 CpG sites on the TNF gene, 8 out of 14 CpG sites on the IL1B gene, and 4 out of 14 CpG sites on the IL6 gene. Furthermore, it was found that the Inflammatory Methylation Index (IMI), which was based on the post-surgery DNAm levels at the selected five CpG sites, can be a potential detection tool for delirium with moderate accuracy; area under the curve (AUC) value was 0.84. The moderate accuracy of this IMI was replicated using another cohort from our previous study, in which the AUC was 0.79. Our findings provide further evidence of the potential role of epigenetics and inflammation in the pathophysiology of delirium.© 2021. The Author(s)."

However, the relationships between proximal family risk factors andSLC6A4methylation remains unexplored. We examined the association among cumulative family risk factors, maltreatment experiences and DNA methylation in theSLC6A4gene in a sample of 33 child victims of maltreatment. We computed a cumulative family risk (CFR) index that included proximal family risk factors, such as drug or alcohol abuse, psychopathology, parents' experiences of maltreatment/abuse in childhood, criminal history, and domestic violence. The majority of children (90.9%) experienced more than one type of maltreatment. Hierarchical regression models suggested that the higher the CFR index score and the number of maltreatment experiences, and the older the children, the higher theSLC6A4DNA methylation levels. Although preliminary, our findings suggest that, along with childhood maltreatment experiences per se, cumulative proximal family risk factors are seemingly critically associated with DNA methylation at theSLC6A4gene."

Methylation of the SLC6A4 gene is associated with decreased transcription of the serotonin transporter, leading to increased serotonin in the synapse. In this study, methylation of the SLC6A4 gene was investigated in the moderation of the subjective effects of cocaine. Non-treatment-seeking cocaine-dependent individuals (N = 53) were intravenously administered cocaine (40 mg) and saline in a randomized order. The subjective effects of cocaine were self-reported using a visual analog scale starting prior to the administration of cocaine (-15 min) or saline and up to 20 min after infusion. Participants were evaluated for methylation of the SLC6A4 promoter region and 5-HTTLPR genotype. A series of ANCOVAs for SLC6A4 methylation (high/low) were run for each of ten subjective and three cardiovascular effects controlling for age, sex [utilizing the sex-determining region Y protein (SRY)], and population structure (determined from ancestry informative markers and STRUCTURE software). Participants with SLC6A4 hypermethylation reported greater subjective response to cocaine for 'depressed' relative to participants with SLC6A4 hypomethylation (experiment-wise p = 0.002). These findings indicate that SLC6A4 methylation moderates the 'depressed' subjective effect of cocaine in non-treatment-seeking cocaine-dependent participants.Published by Elsevier B.V."

Currently, multiplexed sensing in single molecule sensors increases the complexity of the system in terms of reagents and sample read-out. In this letter, we propose a novel approach to multiplex hairpin-based single-DNA molecule sensors, which overcomes the limitations of the present approaches for multiplexing. By target-dependent ssDNA hairpin design, we can create DNA tethers that have distinct tether dynamics upon target binding. Our numerical model shows that by changing the stem length of the ssDNA hairpin, significantly different dynamic tether behavior will be observed. By exploiting the distance-dependent coupling of AuNPs to gold films, we can probe this dynamic behavior along thez-axis using a simple laser equipped microscope."

However, the epigenetic mechanisms involved in the formation of floral scent have rarely been reported within a famous traditional ornamental plantPrunus mumeemitting pleasant fragrance in China. By combining whole-genome bisulfite sequencing and RNA-seq, we determined the global change in DNA methylation and expression levels of genes involved in the biosynthesis of floral scent in four different flowering stages ofP. mume. During flowering, the methylation status in the ""CHH"" sequence context (with H representing A, T, or C) in the promoter regions of genes showed the most significant change. Enrichment analysis showed that the differentially methylated genes (DMGs) were widely involved in eight pathways known to be related to floral scent biosynthesis. As the key biosynthesis pathway of the dominant volatile fragrance ofP. mume, the phenylpropane biosynthesis pathway contained the most differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and DMGs. We detected 97 DMGs participated in the most biosynthetic steps of the phenylpropane biosynthesis pathway. Furthermore, among the previously identified genes encoding key enzymes in the biosynthesis of the floral scent ofP. mume, 47 candidate genes showed an expression pattern matching the release of floral fragrances and 22 of them were differentially methylated during flowering. Some of these DMGs may or have already been proven to play an important role in biosynthesis of the key floral scent components ofP. mume, such asPmCFAT1a/1c,PmBEAT36/37,PmPAL2,PmPAAS3,PmBAR8/9/10, andPmCNL1/3/5/6/14/17/20. In conclusion, our results for the first time revealed that DNA methylation is widely involved in the biosynthesis of floral scent and may play critical roles in regulating the floral scent biosynthesis ofP. mume.

Previous research suggested that ω-3 fatty acids have preventive effects on aging. However, most of previous studies on the anti-aging effects of ω-3 fatty acids are focused on clinical observations, and the anti-aging mechanisms of ω-3 fatty acids have not been fully elucidated. This stimulated our interest to use multi-omics data related to ω-3 fatty acids in order to interpret the anti-aging mechanisms of ω-3 fatty acids. First, we found that ω-3 fatty acids can affect methylation levels and expression levels of genes associated with age-related diseases or pathways in humans. Then, a Mendelian randomization analysis was conducted to determine whether there is a causal relationship between the effect of ω-3 fatty acids on blood lipid levels and variation in the gut microbiome. Our results indicate that the impact of ω-3 fatty acids on aging is partially mediated by the gut microbiome (includingActinobacteria, BifidobacteriaandStreptococcus). In conclusion, this study provides deeper insights into the anti-aging mechanisms of ω-3 fatty acids and supports the dietary supplementation of ω-3 fatty acids in aging prevention."

We collected saliva samples from mothers with extreme disregard for their child's needs (50 in the neglect group, NG) and mothers with non-neglectful caregiving (87 in the control group, CG). Mothers completed an empathy scale, along with questionnaires of their own childhood maltreatment, adverse life events and psychiatric disorders. Sociodemographic variables potentially affecting EAA were also measured. The ANCOVA solution showed a significant increase in EAA in the NG compared to the CG, after adjustment for maternal age, number of pregnancies, financial assistance, adverse events, childhood maltreatment and psychiatric disorder. The group interaction effects showed a reduction in EAA for greater empathic concern and for a higher education level both as positive factors, and an increment in EAA for mothers living in a two-parent family as a risk factor, all in the NG. Our findings open the search for protective factors of EAA associated with caregiver behavior to reduce health vulnerabilities and poor social functioning, especially for mothers at risk of maladaptive caregiving."
"34825761","Phenotype correlations reveal the relationships of physiological systems underlying human ageing.","Aging Cell","Ageing is characterized by degeneration and loss of function across multiple physiological systems. To study the mechanisms and consequences of ageing, several metrics have been proposed in a hierarchical model, including biological, phenotypic and functional ageing. In particular, phenotypic ageing and interconnected changes in multiple physiological systems occur in all ageing individuals over time. Recently, phenotypic age, a new ageing measure, was proposed to capture morbidity and mortality risk across diverse subpopulations in US cohort studies. Although phenotypic age has been widely used, it may overlook the complex relationships among phenotypic biomarkers. Considering the correlation structure of these phenotypic biomarkers, we proposed a composite phenotype analysis (CPA) strategy to analyse 71 biomarkers from 2074 individuals in the Rugao Longitudinal Ageing Study. CPA grouped these biomarkers into 18 composite phenotypes according to their internal correlation, and these composite phenotypes were mostly consistent with prior findings. In addition, compared with prior findings, this strategy exhibited some different yet important implications. For example, the indicators of kidney and cardiovascular functions were tightly connected, implying internal interactions. The composite phenotypes were further verified through associations with functional metrics of ageing, including disability, depression, cognitive function and frailty. Compared to age alone, these composite phenotypes had better predictive performances for functional metrics of ageing. In summary, CPA could reveal the hidden relationships of physiological systems and identify the links between physiological systems and functional ageing metrics, thereby providing novel insights into potential mechanisms underlying human ageing.© 2021 The Authors.

Limited therapeutic options are currently available to slow the rate of cystic growth. Epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation, are known to be altered in neoplasia, and several FDA-approved therapeutics target these disease-specific changes. As there are many similarities between ADPKD and neoplasia, we (and others) have postulated that ADPKD kidneys contain alterations to their epigenetic landscape that could be exploited for future therapeutic discovery.

Fifty-eight RA patients and 67 age- and gender-matched healthy controls, all Caucasian, participated in the study. They were genotyped for the five SNPs using TaqMan allelic discrimination assay, and their C1q levels were estimated by ELISA. Rheumatoid factor and anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies were measured (using latex agglutination and ELISA resp.) in the RA patients' group and relevant clinical information was collected. RA patients and healthy controls had similar frequencies of alleles and genotypes of rs665691, rs682658 and rs294179. Minor G-allele and GG genotype of rs172378 were associated with RA (OR = 2.80; 95% CI 1.62-4.81; p = 0.0002 and OR = 5.01; 95% CI 1.55-16.24; p = 0.007, resp.), as well as AA genotype of rs292001 (OR = 3.23; 95% CI 1.15-9.08; p = 0.026).

Osteosarcoma (OSA) is the most common primary bone tumor in dogs (OMIA 001441-9615), and strongly resembles human forms of OSA. Several large- to giant-sized dog breeds, including the Leonberger, have a greatly increased risk of developing OSA. We performed genome-wide association analysis with high-density imputed SNP genotype data from 273 Leonberger cases with a median age of 8.1 [3.1-13.5] years and 365 controls older than eight years. This analysis revealed significant associations at theCDKN2A/Bgene locus on canine chromosome 11, mirroring previous findings in other dog breeds, such as the greyhound, that also show an elevated risk for OSA. Heritability (h2SNP) was determined to be 20.6% (SE = 0.08;p-value = 5.7 × 10-4) based on a breed prevalence of 20%. The 2563 SNPs across the genome accounted for nearly all the h2SNPof OSA, with 2183 SNPs of small effect, 316 SNPs of moderate effect, and 64 SNPs of large effect. As with many other cancers it is likely that regulatory, non-coding variants underlie the increased risk for cancer development. Our findings confirm a complex genetic basis of OSA, moderate heritability, and the crucial role of theCDKN2A/Blocus leading to strong cancer predisposition in dogs. It will ultimately be interesting to study and compare the known genetic loci associated with canine OSA in human OSA."

The genetic basis of BCC is unknown but is believed to be a complex genetic disorder. Our goal was to estimate the heritability (h2SNP) of BCC, define its underlying genetic architecture, and identify associated genomic loci using dense whole-genome single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping data. Genotype data were obtained for ~440,000 SNPs from 343 border collies (168 BCC cases and 175 controls). h2SNPwas calculated to be 49-61% depending on the estimated BCC prevalence. A total of 2407 SNPs across the genome accounted for nearly all the h2SNPof BCC, with an estimated 2003 SNPs of small effect, 349 SNPs of moderate effect, and 56 SNPs of large effect. Genome-wide association analyses identified significantly associated loci on chromosomes 1, 6, 11, 20, and 28, which accounted for ~5% of the total BCC h2SNP.We conclude that BCC is a moderately- to highly-heritable complex polygenetic disease resulting from contributions from hundreds to thousands of genetic variants with variable effect sizes. Understanding how much the BCC phenotype is determined by genetics and whether major gene mutations are likely to exist inform veterinarians and working/stock dog communities of the true nature of this condition."

Methods: We used Linkage-Disequilibrium Adjusted Kinships (LDAK) and LDAK-Thin models to calculate the relative heritability of each variant and compare the relative heritability for each phenotype. Biological analysis was carried out for the phenotype whose variants made a significant contribution. Potential hub genes were prioritized based on topological parameters of the protein-protein interaction network. We included 16 behavior-related phenotypes and 2607 valid variants. In the LDAK model, we found the variants of alcohol consumption and caffeine intake were identified as contributing higher relative heritability than that of the random variants. Compared with the relative expected heritability contributed by the variants associated with type 2 diabetes, the relative expected heritability contributed by the variants associated with these two phenotypes was higher. In the LDAK-Thin model, the relative heritability of variants of 11 phenotypes was statistically higher than random variants. Biological function analysis showed the same distributions among type 2 diabetes and alcohol consumption. We eventually screened out 31 hub genes interacting intensively, four of which were validated and showed the upregulated expression pattern in blood samples seen in type 2 diabetes cases. Conclusion: We found that alcohol consumption contributed higher relative heritability. Hub genes may influence the onset of type 2 diabetes by a mediating effect or a pleiotropic effect. Our results provide new insight to reveal the role of behavior-related factors in the conundrum of ""missing heritability"" of type 2 diabetes."
"34824382","Rank-invariant estimation of inbreeding coefficients.","Heredity (Edinb)","The two alleles an individual carries at a locus are identical by descent (ibd) if they have descended from a single ancestral allele in a reference population, and the probability of such identity is the inbreeding coefficient of the individual. Inbreeding coefficients can be predicted from pedigrees with founders constituting the reference population, but estimation from genetic data is not possible without data from the reference population. Most inbreeding estimators that make explicit use of sample allele frequencies as estimates of allele probabilities in the reference population are confounded by average kinships with other individuals. This means that the ranking of those estimates depends on the scope of the study sample and we show the variation in rankings for common estimators applied to different subdivisions of 1000 Genomes data. Allele-sharing estimators of within-population inbreeding relative to average kinship in a study sample, however, do have invariant rankings across all studies including those individuals. They are unbiased with a large number of SNPs. We discuss how allele sharing estimates are the relevant quantities for a range of empirical applications.© 2021. The Author(s)."

Here, using 23 phenotypes and genotypes from two independent laboratories, we obtained a sample size of 3,076 commercially available outbred mice and identified 70 loci, more than double the number of loci identified in the component studies. Fine-mapping in the combined sample reduced the number of likely causal variants, with a median reduction in set size of 51%, and indicated novel gene associations, including Pnpo, Ttll6 and GM11545 with bone mineral density, and Psmb9 with weight. However replication at a nominal threshold of 0.05 between the two component studies was low, with less than a third of loci identified in one study replicated in the second. In addition to overestimates in the effect size in the discovery sample (Winner's Curse), we also found that heterogeneity between studies explained the poor replication, but the contribution of these two factors varied among traits. Leveraging these observations we integrated information about replication rates, study-specific heterogeneity, and Winner's Curse corrected estimates of power to assign variants to one of four confidence levels. Our approach addresses concerns about reproducibility, and demonstrates how to obtain robust results from mapping complex traits in any genome-wide association study.© The Author(s) (2021).

Here, we perform bisulfite sequencing of the blood of > 100 NMRs, assessing > 3 million common CpG sites. Unsupervised clustering based on sites whose methylation correlates with age reveals an age-related methylome remodeling, and we also observe a methylome information loss, suggesting that NMRs age. We develop an epigenetic aging clock that accurately predicts the NMR age. We show that these animals age much slower than mice and much faster than humans, consistent with their known maximum lifespans. Interestingly, patterns of age-related changes of clock sites in Tert and Prpf19 differ between NMRs and mice, but there are also sites conserved between the two species. Together, the data indicate that NMRs, like other mammals, epigenetically age even in the absence of demographic aging of this species.© 2022. The Author(s)."

Intensive efforts are ongoing to combat this disease by suppressing viral transmission, understanding its pathogenesis, developing vaccination strategies, and identifying effective therapeutic targets. Individuals with preexisting diabetes also show higher incidence of COVID-19 illness and poorer prognosis upon infection. Likewise, an increased frequency of diabetes onset and diabetes complications has been reported in patients following COVID-19 diagnosis. COVID-19 may elevate the risk of hyperglycemia and other complications in patients with and without prior diabetes history. It is unclear whether the virus induces type 1 or type 2 diabetes or instead causes a novel atypical form of diabetes. Moreover, it remains unknown if recovering COVID-19 patients exhibit a higher risk of developing new-onset diabetes or its complications going forward. The aim of this review is to summarize what is currently known about the epidemiology and mechanisms of this bidirectional relationship between COVID-19 and diabetes. We highlight major challenges that hinder the study of COVID-19-induced new-onset of diabetes and propose a potential framework for overcoming these obstacles. We also review state-of-the-art wearables and microsampling technologies that can further study diabetes management and progression in new-onset diabetes cases.

In this study, mice aged 3, 12 or 17 months (3M, 12M, 17M) were selected as physiological ovarian aging models. The expression of female reproductive function-related genes, the global profiles of PTMs, and the level of histone modifications and related regulatory enzymes were examined during physiological ovarian aging in the mice by quantitative real-time PCR and western blot, respectively. The results showed that the global protein expression of Kbhb (lysineβ-hydroxybutyryllysine), Khib (lysine 2-hydroxyisobutyryllysine), Kglu (lysineglutaryllysine), Kmal (lysinemalonyllysine), Ksucc (lysinesuccinyllysine), Kcr (lysinecrotonyllysine), Kbu (lysinebutyryllysine), Kpr (lysinepropionyllysine), SUMO1 (SUMO1 modification), ub (ubiquitination), P-Typ (phosphorylation), and 3-nitro-Tyr (nitro-tyrosine) increased significantly as mice aged. Moreover, the modification level of Kme2 (lysinedi-methyllysine) and Kac (lysineacetyllysine) was the highest in the 3M mice and the lowest in 12M mice. In addition, only trimethylation of histone lysine was up-regulated progressively and significantly with increasing age (p< 0.001), H4 ubiquitination was obviously higher in the 12M and 17M mice than 3M (p< 0.001), whereas the modification of Kpr (lysinepropionylation) and O-GlcNA in 17M was significantly decreased compared with the level in 3M mice (p< 0.05,p< 0.01). Furthermore, the expression levels of the TIP60, P300, PRDM9, KMT5B, and KMT5C genes encoding PTM regulators were up-regulated in 17M compared to 3M female mice (p< 0.05). These findings indicate that altered related regulatory enzymes and PTMs are associated with physiological ovarian aging in mice, which is expected to provide useful insights for the delay of ovarian aging and the diagnosis and treatment of female infertility."
"34910283","Immune Memory in Aging: a Wide Perspective Covering Microbiota, Brain, Metabolism, and Epigenetics.","Clin Rev Allergy Immunol","Non-specific innate and antigen-specific adaptive immunological memories are vital evolutionary adaptations that confer long-lasting protection against a wide range of pathogens. Adaptive memory is established by memory T and B lymphocytes following the recognition of an antigen. On the other hand, innate immune memory, also called trained immunity, is imprinted in innate cells such as macrophages and natural killer cells through epigenetic and metabolic reprogramming. However, these mechanisms of memory generation and maintenance are compromised as organisms age. Almost all immune cell types, both mature cells and their progenitors, go through age-related changes concerning numbers and functions. The aging immune system renders the elderly highly susceptible to infections and incapable of mounting a proper immune response upon vaccinations. Besides the increased infectious burden, older individuals also have heightened risks of metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases, which have an immunological component. This review discusses how immune function, particularly the establishment and maintenance of innate and adaptive immunological memory, regulates and is regulated by epigenetics, metabolic processes, gut microbiota, and the central nervous system throughout life, with a focus on old age. We explain in-depth how epigenetics and cellular metabolism impact immune cell function and contribute or resist the aging process. Microbiota is intimately linked with the immune system of the human host, and therefore, plays an important role in immunological memory during both homeostasis and aging. The brain, which is not an immune-isolated organ despite former opinion, interacts with the peripheral immune cells, and the aging of both systems influences the health of each other. With all these in mind, we aimed to present a comprehensive view of the aging immune system and its consequences, especially in terms of immunological memory. The review also details the mechanisms of promising anti-aging interventions and highlights a few, namely, caloric restriction, physical exercise, metformin, and resveratrol, that impact multiple facets of the aging process, including the regulation of innate and adaptive immune memory. We propose that understanding aging as a complex phenomenon, with the immune system at the center role interacting with all the other tissues and systems, would allow for more effective anti-aging strategies.© 2021.

"34837796","Aging-associated immune system changes in multiple myeloma: The dark side of the moon.","Cancer Treat Res Commun","Multiple myeloma (MM) is a disease of the elderly. Changes that occur in the immune system with aging, also known as immunosenescence, have been associated with decreased tumor immunosurveillance and are thought to contribute to the development of MM and other cancers in the elderly. Once MM establishes itself in the bone marrow, immunosenescence related changes have been observed in the immune tumor microenvironment (iTME) and are driven by the malignant cells. The efficacy of novel immunotherapies used to treat MM has been blunted by detrimental iTME changes that occur at later disease stages and are, to some extent, driven by prior therapies. In this review, we discuss general changes that occur in the immune system with aging as well as our current knowledge of immunosenescence in MM. We discuss the differences and overlap between T cell senescence and exhaustion as well as potential methods to prevent or reverse immunosenescence. We focus predominantly on T cell immunosenescence which has been better evaluated in this disease and is more pertinent to novel MM immunotherapies. Our lack of understanding of the drivers of immunosenescence at each stage of the disease, from precursor stages to heavily pretreated MM, represents a major barrier to improving the efficacy of novel and existing therapies.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).

A considerable amount of progress has been made in this field with the established 'hallmarks of aging' and continued efforts to investigate the age-related changes observed within the BM. Inflammaging is considered as a low-grade state of inflammation associated with aging, and whilst the possible mechanisms by which aging occurs are now largely understood, the processes leading to the underlying changes within aged BM remain elusive. The ability to identify these changes and detect such alterations at the genetic level are key to broadening the knowledgebase of aging BM. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is an important molecular-level application presenting the ability to not only determine genomic base changes but provide transcriptional profiling (RNA-seq), as well as a high-throughput analysis of DNA-protein interactions (ChIP-seq). Utilising NGS to explore the genetic alterations occurring over the aging process within alterative cell types facilitates the comprehension of the molecular and cellular changes influencing the dynamics of aging BM. Thus, this review prospects the current landscape of BM aging and explores how NGS technology is currently being applied within this ever-expanding field of research."
"35016721","Contribution of 3D genome topological domains to genetic risk of cancers: a genome-wide computational study.","Hum Genomics","Genome-wide association studies have identified statistical associations between various diseases, including cancers, and a large number of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). However, they provide no direct explanation of the mechanisms underlying the association. Based on the recent discovery that changes in three-dimensional genome organization may have functional consequences on gene regulation favoring diseases, we investigated systematically the genome-wide distribution of disease-associated SNPs with respect to a specific feature of 3D genome organization: topologically associating domains (TADs) and their borders.For each of 449 diseases, we tested whether the associated SNPs are present in TAD borders more often than observed by chance, where chance (i.e., the null model in statistical terms) corresponds to the same number of pointwise loci drawn at random either in the entire genome, or in the entire set of disease-associated SNPs listed in the GWAS catalog. Our analysis shows that a fraction of diseases displays such a preferential localization of their risk loci. Moreover, cancers are relatively more frequent among these diseases, and this predominance is generally enhanced when considering only intergenic SNPs. The structure of SNP-based diseasome networks confirms that localization of risk loci in TAD borders differs between cancers and non-cancer diseases. Furthermore, different TAD border enrichments are observed in embryonic stem cells and differentiated cells, consistent with changes in topological domains along embryogenesis and delineating their contribution to disease risk.Our results suggest that, for certain diseases, part of the genetic risk lies in a local genetic variation affecting the genome partitioning in topologically insulated domains. Investigating this possible contribution to genetic risk is particularly relevant in cancers. This study thus opens a way of interpreting genome-wide association studies, by distinguishing two types of disease-associated SNPs: one with an effect on an individual gene, the other acting in interplay with 3D genome organization.© 2022.

Here, we perform complementary bulk nuclei- and single-nucleus transcriptome profiling and map locus-specific chromatin interactions in mouse neocortex to identify the cell type-specific transcriptional changes associated with stress-induced behavioral maladaptation. We find that cortical excitatory neurons, layer 2/3 neurons in particular, are vulnerable to chronic stress and acquire signatures of gene transcription and chromatin structure associated with reduced neuronal activity and expression of Yin Yang 1 (YY1). Selective ablation of YY1 in cortical excitatory neurons enhances stress sensitivity in both male and female mice and alters the expression of stress-associated genes following an abbreviated stress exposure. These findings demonstrate how chronic stress impacts transcription in cortical excitatory neurons and identify YY1 as a regulator of stress-induced maladaptive behavior in mice.© 2022.

Single molecule long-read sequencing and comparative Hi-C chromosomal contact mapping in wild-derived SPRET/EiJ (Mus spretus) and laboratory inbred C57BL/6J (Mus musculus) reveal neuronal reconfigurations tracking recent ERV2 expansions in the murine germline, with significantly higher B2NeuN+contact frequencies at sites with ongoing insertions in Mus musculus. Neuronal ablation of the retrotransposon silencer Kmt1e/Setdb1 triggers B2NeuN+disintegration and rewiring with open chromatin domains enriched for cellular stress response genes, along with severe neuroinflammation and proviral assembly with infiltration of dendrites .

Nevertheless, increasing evidences suggest that epigenetics can also play a role in the pathogenesis of both diseases.

Changes in DNA cytosine methylation, chromatin remodeling and expression of regulatory noncoding RNAs are described, with the intent of depicting an epigenetic signature of DMs. Epigenetic biomarkers have a strong potential for clinical application since they could be used as targets for therapeutic interventions avoiding changes in DNA sequences. Moreover, understanding their clinical significance may serve as a diagnostic indicator in genetic counselling in order to improve genotype-phenotype correlations in DM patients."

However, it has not been possible to define their boundaries at the resolution of boundary-forming proteins.To predict domain boundaries at base-pair resolution, we developed preciseTAD, an optimized transfer learning framework trained on high-resolution genome annotation data.

We use Mendelian randomization to investigate over 3,000 genes that encode druggable proteins and predict their efficacy as drug targets for Parkinson's disease. We use expression and protein quantitative trait loci to mimic exposure to medications, and we examine the causal effect on Parkinson's disease risk (in two large cohorts), age at onset and progression. We propose 23 drug-targeting mechanisms for Parkinson's disease, including four possible drug repurposing opportunities and two drugs which may increase Parkinson's disease risk. Of these, we put forward six drug targets with the strongest Mendelian randomization evidence. There is remarkably little overlap between our drug targets to reduce Parkinson's disease risk versus progression, suggesting different molecular mechanisms. Drugs with genetic support are considerably more likely to succeed in clinical trials, and we provide compelling genetic evidence and an analysis pipeline to prioritise Parkinson's disease drug development.© 2021.

Cross-sectional associations of suPAR with lifestyle and CVD risk factors were assessed, whole-genome sequence data were used to evaluate genetic associations of suPAR, and relationships of suPAR with incident CVD outcomes and overall mortality were estimated over follow-up.In Cox models adjusted for traditional CVD risk factors, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and CRP (C-reactive protein), each 1-SD higher suPAR was associated with a 21% to 31% increased risk of incident coronary heart disease, heart failure, stroke, and mortality.

"35036833","Site-Specific DNA Demethylation as a Potential Target for Cancer Epigenetic Therapy.","Epigenet Insights","Aberrant promoter DNA hypermethylation is a typical characteristic of cancer and it is often seen in malignancies. Recent studies showed that regulatory cis-elements found up-stream of many tumor suppressor gene promoter CpG island (CGI) attract DNA methyltransferases (DNMT) that hypermethylates and silence the genes. As epigenetic alterations are potentially reversible, they make attractive targets for therapeutic intervention. The currently used decitabine (DAC) and azacitidine (AZA) are DNMT inhibitors that follow the passive demethylation pathway. However, they lead to genome-wide demethylation of CpGs in cells, which makes difficult to use it for causal effect analysis and treatment of specific epimutations. Demethylation through specific demethylase enzymes is thus critical for epigenetic resetting of silenced genes and modified chromatins. Yet DNA-binding factors likely play a major role to guide the candidate demethylase enzymes upon its fusion. Before the advent of clustered regulatory interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR), both zinc finger proteins (ZNFs) and transcription activator-like effector protein (TALEs) were used as binding platforms for ten-eleven translocation (TET) enzymes and both systems were able to induce transcription at targeted loci in anin vitroas well asin vivomodel. Consequently, the development of site-specific and active demethylation molecular trackers becomes more than hypothetical to makes a big difference in the treatment of cancer in the future. This review is thus to recap the novel albeit distinct studies on the potential use of site-specific demethylation for the development of epigenetic based cancer therapy.© The Author(s) 2020."

Epigenetic alterations may induce phenotypic changes stable enough for mitotic or meiotic inheritance. Moreover, the reversibility of epigenetic marks makes the manipulation of chromatin and epigenetic signature an attractive strategy for therapeutic and breeding purposes. Targeted epigenetic manipulation, or epigenome editing, at the gene of interest commonly utilizes specific epigenetic modifiers fused with a targeting module of the conventional genome editing system.This review aims to summarize essential epigenetic components and introduce currently available epigenetic mutants and the corresponding epialleles in plants. Furthermore, advances in epigenome editing technology are discussed while proposing its potential application to plant breeding.Epimutations associated with useful traits may provide a valuable resource for crop development. It is important to explore epimutations in a variety of crop species while understanding the fundamental aspects of epigenetic regulation of agronomically important traits such as yield, quality, disease resistance and stress tolerance.

Gene-editing technologies, from large-scale nucleic acid endonucleases to CRISPR, have ignited a global research and development boom with significant implications in regenerative medicine. The development of regenerative medicine technologies, regardless of whether it is PSCs or gene editing, is consistently met with controversy. Are the tools for rewriting the code of life a boon to humanity or a Pandora's box? These technologies raise concerns regarding ethical issues, unexpected mutations, viral infection, etc. These concerns remain even as new treatments emerge. However, the potential negatives cannot obscure the virtues of PSC gene editing, which have, and will continue to, benefit mankind at an unprecedented rate. Here, we briefly introduce current gene-editing technology and its application in PSCs and their derived organoids, while addressing ethical concerns and safety risks and discussing the latest progress in PSC gene editing. Gene editing in PSCs creates visualizedin vitromodels, providing opportunities for examining mechanisms of known and unknown mutations and offering new possibilities for the treatment of cancer, genetic diseases, and other serious or refractory disorders. From model construction to treatment exploration, the important role of PSCs combined with gene editing in basic and clinical medicine studies is illustrated. The applications, characteristics, and existing challenges are summarized in combination with our lab experiences in this field in an effort to help gene-editing technology better serve humans in a regulated manner.

In the brain, many of these epigenetic modifications have been widely implicated in synaptic plasticity and memory formation. Dysregulation of epigenetic mechanisms has been reported in the aged brain and is associated with or contributes to memory decline across the lifespan. Furthermore, alterations in the epigenome have been reported in neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease. Here, we review the diverse types of epigenetic modifications and their role in activity- and learning-dependent synaptic plasticity. We then discuss how these mechanisms become dysregulated across the lifespan and contribute to memory loss with age and in Alzheimer's disease.

The study included accounting the age and biorhythmological aspects. In the experiment, mice were used at the age of 4 and 32 weeks, by the end of the experiment-respectively 20 and 48 weeks. HFD feeding lasted 16 weeks. Treadmill training were carried out for last 4 weeks six times a week, the duration 60 min and the speed from 15 to 18 m/min. Three modes of loading were applied. The first subgroup was subjected to stress in the morning hours (light phase); the second subgroup was subjected to stress in the evening hours (dark phase); the third subgroup was subjected to loads in the shift mode (the first- and third-weeks treadmill training was used in the morning hours, the second and fourth treadmill training was used in the evening hours). In 20-week-old animals, the exercise effect does not depend on the training regime, however, in 48-week-old animals, the decrease in body weight in mice with the shift training regime was more profound. HFD affected muscle myokine levels. The content of all myokines, except for LIF, decreased, while the concentration of CLCX1 decreased only in young animals in response to HFD. The treadmill training caused multidirectional changes in the concentration of myokines in muscle tissue. The IL-6 content changed most profoundly. These changes were observed in all groups of animals. The changes depended to the greatest extent on the training time scheme. The effect of physical activity on the content of IL-15 in the skeletal muscle tissue was observed mostly in 48-week-old mice. In 20-week-old animals, physical activity led to an increase in the concentration of LIF in muscle tissue when applied under the training during the dark phase or shift training scheme. In the HFD group, this effect was significantly more pronounced. The content of CXCL1 did not change with the use of treadmill training in almost all groups of animals.

The aim of the present study was to identify nutrition and microbiome factors related to structural and functional neurological abnormalities to optimize future preventive strategies.Methods:Two hundred thirty-eight patients suffering from (1) structural (neurodegeneration) or (2) functional (epilepsy) neurological abnormalities or (3) chronic pain (migraine) and 612 healthy control subjects were analyzed by validated 12-month food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and 16S rRNA microbiome sequencing (from stool samples). A binomial logistic regression model was applied for risk calculation and functional pathway analysis to show which functional pathway could discriminate cases and healthy controls.Results:Detailed analysis of more than 60 macro- and micronutrients revealed no distinct significant difference between cases and controls, whereas BMI, insulin resistance and metabolic inflammation in addition to alcohol consumption were major drivers of an overall neurological disease risk. The gut microbiome analysis showed decreased alpha diversity (Shannon index:p= 9.1× 10-7) and species richness (p= 1.2 × 10-8) in the case group as well as significant differences in beta diversity between cases and controls (Bray-Curtis:p= 9.99 × 10-4; Jaccard:p= 9.99 × 10-4). The Shannon index showed a beneficial effect (OR = 0.59 (95%-CI (0.40, 0.87);p= 8 × 10-3). Cases were clearly discriminated from healthy controls by environmental information processing, signal transduction, two component system and membrane transport as significantly different functional pathways.Conclusions:In conclusion, our data indicate that an overall healthy lifestyle, in contrast to supplementation of single micro- or macronutrients, is most likely to reduce overall neurological abnormality risk and that the gut microbiome is an interesting target to develop novel preventive strategies."
"35008723","Circulating Nucleic Acid-Based Biomarkers of Type 2 Diabetes.","Int J Mol Sci","Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a deficiency in how the body regulates glucose. Uncontrolled T2D will result in chronic high blood sugar levels, eventually resulting in T2D complications. These complications, such as kidney, eye, and nerve damage, are even harder to treat. Identifying individuals at high risk of developing T2D and its complications is essential for early prevention and treatment. Numerous studies have been done to identify biomarkers for T2D diagnosis and prognosis. This review focuses on recent T2D biomarker studies based on circulating nucleic acids using different omics technologies: genomics, transcriptomics, and epigenomics. Omics studies have profiled biomarker candidates from blood, urine, and other non-invasive samples. Despite methodological differences, several candidate biomarkers were reported for the risk and diagnosis of T2D, the prognosis of T2D complications, and pharmacodynamics of T2D treatments. Future studies should be done to validate the findings in larger samples and blood-based biomarkers in non-invasive samples to support the realization of precision medicine for T2D."

This paper aims to introduce the PaPOE (Parental Pesticides and Offspring Epigenome) prospective study and its goals, to motivate the study rationale and design, and to examine comprehensively whether multi-residue exposure to commonly used pesticides could induce epigenetic alterations through the oxidative stress pathway. The PaPOE project includes a cross-sectional study assessing the occupational exposure among 300 farmworkers in Meknes, and initiates a birth cohort of 1000 pregnant women. Data and biological samples are collected among farmworkers, and throughout pregnancy, and at birth. Oxidative stress biomarkers include Glutathione, Malondialdehyde, and 8-OHdG. Global and gene-specific DNA methylation is assessed. The study began enrollment in 2019 and is ongoing. As of 30 June 2021, 300 farmworkers and 125 pregnant women have enrolled. The results are expected to showcase the importance of biomonitoring for understanding individual risks, and to identify a number of regions where DNA methylation status is altered in the pesticides-exposed population, paving the way for an integrated biomonitoring system in Morocco and Africa to assess environmental exposures and their long-term health consequences."

"35000562","Epigenetic regulation by gut microbiota.","Gut Microbes","The gastrointestinal tract is continuously exposed to trillions of commensal microbes, collectively termed the microbiota, which are environmental stimuli that can direct health and disease within the host. In addition to well-established bacterial sensing pathways, microbial signals are also integrated through epigenetic modifications that calibrate the transcriptional program of host cells without altering the underlying genetic code. Microbiota-sensitive epigenetic changes include modifications to the DNA or histones, as well as regulation of non-coding RNAs. While microbiota-sensitive epigenetic mechanisms have been described in both local intestinal cells and as well in peripheral tissues, further research is required to fully decipher the complex relationship between the host and microbiota. This Review highlights current understandings of epigenetic regulation by gut microbiota and important implications of these findings in guiding therapeutic approaches to prevent or combat diseases driven by impaired microbiota-host interactions."

There are several different mechanisms responsible for the release of cfDNA in blood plasma, and henceforth it can provide information regarding dynamic changes in the human body. Due to the fragmented nature, low concentration of cfDNA, and high background noise, there are several challenges in its analysis for regular use in diagnosis of cancer. Such challenges in the analysis of the methylation profile of cfDNA are further aggravated due to heterogeneity, biomarker sensitivity, platform biases, and batch effects. This review delineates the origin of cfDNA methylation, its profiling, and associated computational problems in analysis for diagnosis. Here we also contemplate upon the multi-marker approach to handle the scenario of cancer heterogeneity and explore the utility of markers for 5hmC based cfDNA methylation pattern. Further, we provide a critical overview of deconvolution and machine learning methods for cfDNA methylation analysis. Our review of current methods reveals the potential for further improvement in analysis strategies for detecting early cancer using cfDNA methylation.© 2021 The Authors."
"35011727","Overview of Polyamines as Nutrients for Human Healthy Long Life and Effect of Increased Polyamine Intake on DNA Methylation.","Cells","Polyamines, spermidine and spermine, are synthesized in every living cell and are therefore contained in foods, especially in those that are thought to contribute to health and longevity. They have many physiological activities similar to those of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory substances such as polyphenols. These include antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, cell and gene protection, and autophagy activation. We have first reported that increased polyamine intake (spermidine much more so than spermine) over a long period increased blood spermine levels and inhibited aging-associated pathologies and pro-inflammatory status in humans and mice and extended life span of mice. However, it is unlikely that the life-extending effect of polyamines is exerted by the same bioactivity as polyphenols because most studies using polyphenols and antioxidants have failed to demonstrate their life-extending effects. Recent investigations revealed that aging-associated pathologies and lifespan are closely associated with DNA methylation, a regulatory mechanism of gene expression. There is a close relationship between polyamine metabolism and DNA methylation. We have shown that the changes in polyamine metabolism affect the concentrations of substances and enzyme activities involved in DNA methylation. I consider that the increased capability of regulation of DNA methylation by spermine is a key of healthy long life of humans."
"34871444","DNA methylation variation along the cancer epigenome and the identification of novel epigenetic driver events.","Nucleic Acids Res","While large-scale studies applying various statistical approaches have identified hundreds of mutated driver genes across various cancer types, the contribution of epigenetic changes to cancer remains more enigmatic. This is partly due to the fact that certain regions of the cancer genome, due to their genomic and epigenomic properties, are more prone to dysregulated DNA methylation than others. Thus, it has been difficult to distinguish which promoter methylation changes are really driving carcinogenesis from those that are mostly just a reflection of their genomic location. By developing a novel method that corrects for epigenetic covariates, we reveal a small, concise set of potential epigenetic driver events. Interestingly, those changes suggest different modes of epigenetic carcinogenesis: first, we observe recurrent inactivation of known cancer genes across tumour types suggesting a higher convergence on common tumour suppressor pathways than previously anticipated. Second, in prostate cancer, a cancer type with few recurrently mutated genes, we demonstrate how the epigenome primes tumours towards higher tolerance of other aberrations.© The Author(s) 2021.

It frequently results in valve disease and aorta dilation and is a major cause of adult cardiac surgery. BAV is genetically linked to rare left-heart obstructions (left ventricular outflow tract obstructions [LVOTOs]), including hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) and coarctation of the aorta (CoA). Mouse and human studies indicate LVOTO is genetically heterogeneous with a complex genetic etiology. Homozygous mutation in thePcdhaprotocadherin gene cluster in mice can cause BAV, and also HLHS and other LVOTO phenotypes when accompanied by a second mutation. Here we show two common deletion copy number variants (delCNVs) within thePCDHAgene cluster are associated with LVOTO. Analysis of 1,218 white individuals with LVOTO versus 463 disease-free local control individuals yielded odds ratios (ORs) at 1.47 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.13-1.92; p = 4.2 × 10-3) for LVOTO, 1.47 (95% CI, 1.10-1.97; p = 0.01) for BAV, 6.13 (95% CI, 2.75-13.7; p = 9.7 × 10-6) for CoA, and 1.49 (95% CI, 1.07-2.08; p = 0.019) for HLHS. Increased OR was observed for all LVOTO phenotypes in homozygous or compound heterozygousPCDHAdelCNV genotype comparison versus wild type. Analysis of an independent white cohort (381 affected individuals, 1,352 control individuals) replicated thePCDHAdelCNV association with LVOTO. Generalizability of these findings is suggested by similar observations in Black and Chinese individuals with LVOTO. Analysis ofPcdhamutant mice showed reducedPCDHAexpression at regions of cell-cell contact in aortic smooth muscle and cushion mesenchyme, suggesting potential mechanisms for BAV pathogenesis and aortopathy. Together, these findings indicate common variants causingPCDHAdeficiency play a significant role in the genetic etiology of common and rare LVOTO-CHD."
"34959895","Epigenetics in Food Allergy and Immunomodulation.","Nutrients","Food allergy (FA) is an increasing problem worldwide and, over recent years, its prevalence is rising in developed countries. Nowadays, the immunological and cellular processes that occur in the allergic reactions are not fully understood, which hampers the development of in vitro diagnostic tools and further treatment options. Moreover, allergic diseases could be reinforced by environmental exposure and genetic modifications. Gene expression can be controlled by different epigenetic mechanisms like DNA methylation, histone modifications, and microRNAs. In addition, several environmental factors such as dietary components (vitamin D, butyrate, folic acid) are able to regulate this epigenetic mechanism. All these factors produce modifications in immune genes that could alter the development and function of immune cells, and therefore the etiology of the disease. Furthermore, these epigenetic mechanisms have also an influence on immunomodulation, which could explain sustained responsiveness or unresponsiveness during immunotherapy due to epigenetic modifications in key genes that induce tolerance in several FA. Thus, in this review we focus on the different epigenetic mechanisms that occur in FA and on the influence of several dietary components in these gene modifications."

Synovial tissues were collected from the knee joint of 50 RA patients and 40 controls without osteoarthritis for the gene expression analysis. Inter-group comparisons were performed with the Chi-square test for genotyping data or with Student's t-test for gene expression analysis.For rs148363003 of SLAMF6, RA patients were observed to have a significantly lower frequency of genotype CC (4.5% vs. 0.9%, p = 0.004) as compared with the controls. The frequency of allele C was remarkably higher in the patients than in the controls (11.5% vs. 8.0%, p = 0.002), with an odds ratio of 1.49 (95% CI = 1.16-1.92). There was no significant difference between the patients and the controls regarding genotype or allele frequency of the other 5 variants. The mRNA expression of SLAMF6 was 1.6 folds higher in the RA patients than in the controls. Moreover, SLAMF6 expression was 1.5 folds higher in patients with genotype CC than in the patients with genotype TT.SLAMF6 was associated with both the susceptibility and severity of RA in the Chinese population. Moreover, rs148363003 could be a functional variant regulating the tissue expression of SLAMF6 in RA patients.

Epidemiological studies have thoroughly investigated the association of several factors with the risk and course of RA. Although a precise etiology remains elusive, the current understanding is that RA is a multifactorial disease, wherein complex interactions between host and environmental factors determine the overall risk of disease susceptibility, persistence and severity. Risk factors related to the host that have been associated with RA development may be divided into genetic; epigenetic; hormonal, reproductive and neuroendocrine; and comorbid host factors. In turn, environmental risk factors include smoking and other airborne exposures; microbiota and infectious agents; diet; and socioeconomic factors.

The etiology of SS is complex with environmental triggers and genetic factors involved. By conducting an integrated multi-omics study, we confirmed a vast coordinated hypomethylation and overexpression effects in IFN-related genes, what is known as the IFN signature. Stratified and conditional analyses suggest a strong interaction between SS-associated HLA genetic variation and the presence of Anti-Ro/SSA autoantibodies in driving the IFN epigenetic signature and determining SS. We report a novel epigenetic signature characterized by increased DNA methylation levels in a large number of genes enriched in pathways such as collagen metabolism and extracellular matrix organization. We identified potential new genetic variants associated with SS that might mediate their risk by altering DNA methylation or gene expression patterns, as well as disease-interacting genetic variants that exhibit regulatory function only in the SS population. Our study sheds new light on the interaction between genetics, autoantibody profiles, DNA methylation and gene expression in SS, and contributes to elucidate the genetic architecture of gene regulation in an autoimmune population.© 2021.

In 2019, the International Diabetes Federation reported that 15.8% of live births were affected by hyperglycemia during pregnancy, of which 83.6% were due to gestational diabetes mellitus, 8.5% were due to diabetes first detected in pregnancy, and 7.9% were due to diabetes detected before pregnancy. GDM increases the susceptibility to developing chronic diseases for both the mother and the baby later in life. Under GDM conditions, the intrauterine environment becomes hyperglycemic, while also showing high concentrations of fatty acids and proinflammatory cytokines, producing morphological, structural, and molecular modifications in the placenta, affecting its function; these alterations may predispose the baby to disease in adult life. Molecular alterations include epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA and RNA methylation, chromatin remodeling, histone modifications, and expression of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs). The placenta is a unique organ that originates only in pregnancy, and its main function is communication between the mother and the fetus, ensuring healthy development. Thus, this review provides up-to-date information regarding two of the best-documented (epigenetic) mechanisms (DNA methylation and miRNA expression) altered in the human placenta under GDM conditions, as well as potential implications for the offspring."

It is well known that an aberrant intrauterine environment caused by elevated maternal glucose levels is related to elevated risks for increased birth weights and metabolic disorders in later life, such as obesity or type 2 diabetes. The complexity of disturbances induced by maternal diabetes, with multiple underlying mechanisms, makes early diagnosis or prevention a challenging task. Omics technologies allowing holistic quantification of several classes of molecules from biological fluids, cells, or tissues are powerful tools to systematically investigate the effects of maternal diabetes on the offspring in an unbiased manner.

The objective of this study was to identify how early pregnancy exposure to ambient nitrogen oxides (NOx) among PE cases and normotensive controls influence DNA methylation (EPIC array) and gene expression (RNA-seq). The study included placentas from 111 women (29 PE cases/82 controls) in Scania, Sweden. First-trimester NOxexposure was assessed at the participants' residence using a dispersion model and categorized via median split into high or low NOx. Placental gestational epigenetic age was derived from the DNA methylation data. We identified six differentially methylated positions (DMPs,q< 0.05) comparing controls with low NOxvs. cases with high NOxand 14 DMPs comparing cases and controls with high NOx. Placentas with female fetuses showed more DMPs (N = 309) than male-derived placentas (N = 1). Placentas from PE cases with high NOxdemonstrated gestational age deceleration compared to controls with low NOx(p= 0.034). No differentially expressed genes (DEGs,q< 0.05) were found.

"34870206","Misregulation of the expression and activity of DNA methyltransferases in cancer.","NAR Cancer","In mammals, DNA methyltransferases DNMT1 and DNMT3's (A, B and L) deposit and maintain DNA methylation in dividing and nondividing cells. Although these enzymes have an unremarkable DNA sequence specificity (CpG), their regional specificity is regulated by interactions with various protein factors, chromatin modifiers, and post-translational modifications of histones. Changes in the DNMT expression or interacting partners affect DNA methylation patterns. Consequently, the acquired gene expression may increase the proliferative potential of cells, often concomitant with loss of cell identity as found in cancer. Aberrant DNA methylation, including hypermethylation and hypomethylation at various genomic regions, therefore, is a hallmark of most cancers. Additionally, somatic mutations in DNMTs that affect catalytic activity were mapped in Acute Myeloid Leukemia cancer cells. Despite being very effective in some cancers, the clinically approved DNMT inhibitors lack specificity, which could result in a wide range of deleterious effects. Elucidating distinct molecular mechanisms of DNMTs will facilitate the discovery of alternative cancer therapeutic targets. This review is focused on: (i) the structure and characteristics of DNMTs, (ii) the prevalence of mutations and abnormal expression of DNMTs in cancer, (iii) factors that mediate their abnormal expression and (iv) the effect of anomalous DNMT-complexes in cancer.© The Author(s) 2021.

The initial important step of analyzing scRNA-seq data is usually to accurately annotate cells. The traditional approach of annotating cell types based on unsupervised clustering and marker genes is time-consuming and laborious. Taking advantage of the numerous existing scRNA-seq databases, many supervised label assignment methods have been developed. One feature that many label assignment methods shares is to label cells with low confidence as ""unassigned."" These unassigned cells can be the result of assignment difficulties due to highly similar cell types or caused by the presence of unknown cell types. However, when unknown cell types are not expected, existing methods still label a considerable number of cells as unassigned, which is not desirable. In this work, we develop a neural network-based cell annotation method called NeuCA (Neural network-based Cell Annotation) for scRNA-seq data obtained from well-studied tissues. NeuCA can utilize the hierarchical structure information of the cell types to improve the annotation accuracy, which is especially helpful when data contain closely correlated cell types. We show that NeuCA can achieve more accurate cell annotation results compared with existing methods. Additionally, the applications on eight real datasets show that NeuCA has stable performance for intra- and inter-study annotation, as well as cross-condition annotation.

Clinical profiles of 22q11.2 CNV carriers indicate that disrupted gene expression causes alterations in neuroanatomy, cognitive function, and psychiatric disease risk. However, interpreting transcriptomic signal in bulk tissue requires careful consideration of potential changes in cell composition. We first characterized transcriptomic dysregulation in peripheral blood from reciprocal 22q11.2 CNV carriers using differential expression analysis and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to identify modules of co-expressed genes. We also assessed for group differences in cell composition and re-characterized transcriptomic differences after accounting for cell type proportions and medication usage. Finally, to explore whether CNV-related transcriptomic changes relate to downstream phenotypes associated with 22q11.2 CNVs, we tested for associations of gene expression with neuroimaging measures and behavioral traits, including IQ and psychosis or ASD diagnosis. 22q11.2 deletion carriers (22qDel) showed widespread expression changes at the individual gene as well as module eigengene level compared to 22q11.2 duplication carriers (22qDup) and controls. 22qDup showed increased expression of 5 genes within the 22q11.2 locus, and CDH6 located outside of the locus. Downregulated modules in 22qDel implicated altered immune and inflammatory processes. Celltype deconvolution analyses revealed significant differences between CNV and control groups in T-cell, mast cell, and macrophage proportions; differential expression of individual genes between groups was substantially attenuated after adjusting for cell composition. Individual gene, module eigengene, and cell proportions were not significantly associated with psychiatric or neuroanatomic traits. Our findings suggest broad immune-related dysfunction in 22qDel and highlight the importance of understanding differences in cell composition when interpreting transcriptomic changes in clinical populations. Results also suggest novel directions for future investigation to test whether 22q11.2 CNV effects on macrophages have implications for brain-related microglial function that may contribute to psychiatric phenotypes in 22q11.2 CNV carriers.© 2021 The Authors."

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified ten risk loci to date, including the TNIP1/GPX3 locus on chromosome five. Given association analysis data alone cannot determine the most plausible risk gene for this locus, we undertook a comprehensive suite of in silico, in vivo and in vitro studies to address this.The Functional Mapping and Annotation (FUMA) pipeline and five tools (conditional and joint analysis (GCTA-COJO), Stratified Linkage Disequilibrium Score Regression (S-LDSC), Polygenic Priority Scoring (PoPS), Summary-based Mendelian Randomisation (SMR-HEIDI) and transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) analyses) were used to perform bioinformatic integration of GWAS data (Ncases= 20,806, Ncontrols= 59,804) with 'omics reference datasets including the blood (eQTLgen consortium N = 31,684) and brain (N = 2581). This was followed up by specific expression studies in ALS case-control cohorts (microarray Ntotal= 942, protein Ntotal= 300) and gene knockdown (KD) studies of human neuronal iPSC cells and zebrafish-morpholinos (MO).SMR analyses implicated both TNIP1 and GPX3 (p < 1.15 × 10-6), but there was no simple SNP/expression relationship. Integrating multiple datasets using PoPS supported GPX3 but not TNIP1. In vivo expression analyses from blood in ALS cases identified that lower GPX3 expression correlated with a more progressed disease (ALS functional rating score, p = 5.5 × 10-3, adjusted R2= 0.042, Beffect= 27.4 ± 13.3 ng/ml/ALSFRS unit) with microarray and protein data suggesting lower expression with risk allele (recessive model p = 0.06, p = 0.02 respectively). Validation in vivo indicated gpx3 KD caused significant motor deficits in zebrafish-MO (mean difference vs. control ± 95% CI, vs. control, swim distance = 112 ± 28 mm, time = 1.29 ± 0.59 s, speed = 32.0 ± 2.53 mm/s, respectively, p for all < 0.0001), which were rescued with gpx3 expression, with no phenotype identified with tnip1 KD or gpx3 overexpression.These results support GPX3 as a lead ALS risk gene in this locus, with more data needed to confirm/reject a role for TNIP1. This has implications for understanding disease mechanisms (GPX3 acts in the same pathway as SOD1, a well-established ALS-associated gene) and identifying new therapeutic approaches. Few previous examples of in-depth investigations of risk loci in ALS exist and a similar approach could be applied to investigate future expected GWAS findings.© 2021. The Author(s)."

We find that genetic variation with concordant effects in both phenotypes shows significant SNP-based heritability enrichment, higher polygenic contribution in females, and positive covariance with mental disorders such as depression, anxiety, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, alcohol dependence, and autism. Conversely, genetic variation with discordant effects only contributes to schizophrenia risk in males and is negatively correlated with those disorders. Mendelian randomization analyses demonstrate a plausible bi-directional causal relationship between LNL-ISO and schizophrenia, with a greater effect of LNL-ISO liability on schizophrenia than vice versa. These results illustrate the genetic footprint of LNL-ISO on schizophrenia.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35004692","Overlapping Genetic Architecture Between Schizophrenia and Neurodegenerative Disorders.","Front Cell Dev Biol","Epidemiological and clinical studies have suggested comorbidity between schizophrenia and several neurodegenerative disorders. However, little is known whether there exists shared genetic architecture. To explore their relationship from a genetic and transcriptomic perspective, we applied polygenic and linkage disequilibrium-informed methods to examine the genetic correlation between schizophrenia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia. We further combined genome-wide association summary statistics with large-scale transcriptomic datasets, to identify putative shared genes and explore related pathological tissues. We identified positive and significant correlation between schizophrenia and ALS at genetic (correlation 0.22; 95% CI: 0.16-0.28;p= 4.00E-04) and transcriptomic (correlation 0.08; 95% CI: 0.04-0.11;p= 0.034) levels. We further demonstrated that schizophrenia- and ALS-inferred gene expression overlap significantly in four tissues including skin, small intestine, brain cortex and lung, and highlighted three genes, namelyGLB1L3,ZNHIT3andTMEM194Aas potential mediators of the correlation between schizophrenia and ALS. Our findings revealed overlapped gene expression profiles in specific tissues between schizophrenia and ALS, and identified novel potential shared genes. These results provided a better understanding for the pleiotropy of schizophrenia, and paved way for future studies to further elucidate the molecular drivers of schizophrenia.Copyright © 2021 Li, Yang, Ou and Shang."

It also serves critical roles that underlie cognitive functioning in adult central neurons. Here we summarize DISC1's general properties and discuss its use as a model system for understanding major mental illnesses (MMIs). We then discuss the cellular actions of DISC1 that involve or regulate Ca2+signaling in adult central neurons. In particular, we focus on the tethering role DISC1 plays in transporting RNA particles containing Ca2+channel subunit RNAs, including IP3R1, CACNA1C and CACNA2D1, and in transporting mitochondria into dendritic and axonal processes. We also review DISC1's role in modulating IP3R1 activity within mitochondria-associated ER membrane (MAM). Finally, we discuss DISC1-glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) signaling that regulates functional expression of voltage-gated Ca2+channels (VGCCs) at central synapses. In each case, DISC1 regulates the movement of molecules that impact Ca2+signaling in neurons.© 2021 The Author(s)."
"34916973","Inflammation and JNK's Role in Niacin-GPR109A Diminished Flushed Effect in Microglial and Neuronal Cells With Relevance to Schizophrenia.","Front Psychiatry","Schizophrenia is a neuropsychiatric illness with no single definitive aetiology, making its treatment difficult. Antipsychotics are not fully effective because they treat psychosis rather than the cognitive or negative symptoms. Antipsychotics fail to alleviate symptoms when patients enter the chronic stage of illness. Topical application of niacin showed diminished skin flush in the majority of patients with schizophrenia compared to the general population who showed flushing. The niacin skin flush test is useful for identifying patients with schizophrenia at their ultra-high-risk stage, and understanding this pathology may introduce an effective treatment. This review aims to understand the pathology behind the diminished skin flush response, while linking it back to neurons and microglia. First, it suggests that there are altered proteins in the GPR109A-COX-prostaglandin pathway, inflammatory imbalance, and kinase signalling pathway, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which are associated with diminished flush. Second, genes from the GPR109A-COX-prostaglandin pathway were matched against the 128-loci genome wide association study (GWAS) for schizophrenia using GeneCards, suggesting that G-coupled receptor-109A (GPR109A) may have a genetic mutation, resulting in diminished flush. This review also suggests that there may be increased pro-inflammatory mediators in the GPR109A-COX-prostaglandin pathway, which contributes to the diminished flush pathology. Increased levels of pro-inflammatory markers may induce microglial-activated neuronal death. Lastly, this review explores the role of JNK on pro-inflammatory mediators, proteins in the GPR109A-COX-prostaglandin pathway, microglial activation, and neuronal death. Inhibiting JNK may reverse the changes observed in the diminished flush response, which might make it a good therapeutic target.Copyright © 2021 Ansarey."

"34831407","Bench Research Informed by GWAS Results.","Cells","Scientifically interesting as well as practically important phenotypes often belong to the realm of complex traits. To the extent that these traits are hereditary, they are usually 'highly polygenic'. The study of such traits presents a challenge for researchers, as the complex genetic architecture of such traits makes it nearly impossible to utilise many of the usual methods of reverse genetics, which often focus on specific genes. In recent years, thousands of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were undertaken to explore the relationships between complex traits and a large number of genetic factors, most of which are characterised by tiny effects. In this review, we aim to familiarise 'wet biologists' with approaches for the interpretation of GWAS results, to clarify some issues that may seem counterintuitive and to assess the possibility of using GWAS results in experiments on various complex traits."
"34822763","H3K27ac HiChIP in prostate cell lines identifies risk genes for prostate cancer susceptibility.","Am J Hum Genet","Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified more than 200 prostate cancer (PrCa) risk regions, which provide potential insights into causal mechanisms. Multiple lines of evidence show that a significant proportion of PrCa risk can be explained by germline causal variants that dysregulate nearby target genes in prostate-relevant tissues, thus altering disease risk. The traditional approach to explore this hypothesis has been correlating GWAS variants with steady-state transcript levels, referred to as expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). In this work, we assess the utility of chromosome conformation capture (3C) coupled with immunoprecipitation (HiChIP) to identify target genes for PrCa GWAS risk loci. We find that interactome data confirm previously reported PrCa target genes identified through GWAS/eQTL overlap (e.g., MLPH). Interestingly, HiChIP identifies links between PrCa GWAS variants and genes well-known to play a role in prostate cancer biology (e.g., AR) that are not detected by eQTL-based methods. HiChIP predicted enhancer elements at the AR and NKX3-1 prostate cancer risk loci, and both were experimentally confirmed to regulate expression of the corresponding genes through CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) perturbation in LNCaP cells. Our results demonstrate that looping data harbor additional information beyond eQTLs and expand the number of PrCa GWAS loci that can be linked to candidate susceptibility genes.Copyright © 2021.

"34887591","The power of genetic diversity in genome-wide association studies of lipids.","Nature","Increased blood lipid levels are heritable risk factors of cardiovascular disease with varied prevalence worldwide owing to different dietary patterns and medication use1. Despite advances in prevention and treatment, in particular through reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels2, heart disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide3. Genome-wideassociation studies (GWAS) of blood lipid levels have led to important biological and clinical insights, as well as new drug targets, for cardiovascular disease. However, most previous GWAS4-23have been conducted in European ancestry populations and may have missed genetic variants that contribute to lipid-level variation in other ancestry groups. These include differences in allele frequencies, effect sizes and linkage-disequilibrium patterns24. Here we conduct a multi-ancestry, genome-wide genetic discovery meta-analysis of lipid levels in approximately 1.65 million individuals, including 350,000 of non-European ancestries. We quantify the gain in studying non-European ancestries and provide evidence to support the expansion of recruitment of additional ancestries, even with relatively small sample sizes. We find that increasing diversity rather than studying additional individuals of European ancestry results in substantial improvements in fine-mapping functional variants and portability of polygenic prediction (evaluated in approximately 295,000 individuals from 7 ancestry groupings). Modest gains in the number of discovered loci and ancestry-specific variants were also achieved. As GWAS expand emphasis beyond the identification of genes and fundamental biology towards the use of genetic variants for preventive and precision medicine25, we anticipate that increased diversity of participants will lead to more accurate and equitable26application of polygenic scores in clinical practice.© 2021.

We conducted a cross-ancestry genome-wide association study (GWAS) including 29,612 patients with ALS and 122,656 controls, which identified 15 risk loci. When combined with 8,953 individuals with whole-genome sequencing (6,538 patients, 2,415 controls) and a large cortex-derived expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) dataset (MetaBrain), analyses revealed locus-specific genetic architectures in which we prioritized genes either through rare variants, short tandem repeats or regulatory effects. ALS-associated risk loci were shared with multiple traits within the neurodegenerative spectrum but with distinct enrichment patterns across brain regions and cell types. Of the environmental and lifestyle risk factors obtained from the literature, Mendelian randomization analyses indicated a causal role for high cholesterol levels. The combination of all ALS-associated signals reveals a role for perturbations in vesicle-mediated transport and autophagy and provides evidence for cell-autonomous disease initiation in glutamatergic neurons.© 2021.

"34868244","Maintenance of Complex Trait Variation: Classic Theory and Modern Data.","Front Genet","Numerous studies have found evidence that GWAS loci experience negative selection, which increases in intensity with the effect size of identified variants. However, there is also accumulating evidence that this selection is not entirely mediated by the focal trait and contains a substantial pleiotropic component. Understanding how selective constraint shapes phenotypic variation requires advancing models capable of balancing these and other components of selection, as well as empirical analyses capable of inferring this balance and how it is generated by the underlying biology. We first review the classic theory connecting phenotypic selection to selection at individual loci as well as approaches and findings from recent analyses of negative selection in GWAS data. We then discuss geometric theories of pleiotropic selection with the potential to guide future modeling efforts. Recent findings revealing the nature of pleiotropic genetic variation provide clues to which genetic relationships are important and should be incorporated into analyses of selection, while findings that effect sizes vary between populations indicate that GWAS measurements could be misleading if effect sizes have also changed throughout human history.Copyright © 2021 Koch and Sunyaev."

CHM has been used worldwide for the prevention and treatment of multiple diseases. Newly developed epigenetic techniques have brought great opportunities for the development of CHM. In this review, we summarize the DNA methylation studies and portray the pleiotropic role of DNA methylation in CHM. DNA methylation serves as a mediator participating in plant responses to environmental factors, and thus affecting CHM medicinal plants growth and bioactive compound biosynthesis which are vital for therapeutic effects. Furthermore, DNA methylation helps to uncover the pharmaceutical mechanisms of CHM formulae, herbs, and herbal-derived compounds. It also provides scientific validation for constitution theory and other essential issues of CHM.

"34881050","Prenatal famine exposure and adult health outcomes: an epigenetic link.","Environ Epigenet","Numerous human chronic pathological conditions depend on epigenetic modifications induced by environmental triggers throughout sensitive stages early in development. Developmental malnutrition is regarded as one of the most important risk factors in these processes. We present an overview of studies that the initiation and progression of many diseases are largely dependent on persisting epigenetic dysregulation caused by environmental insults early in life. For particular disorders, candidate genes were identified that underlie these associations. The current study assessed the most convincing evidence for the epigenetic link between developmental malnutrition and adult-life disease in the human population. These findings were obtained from quasi-experimental studies (so-called 'natural experiments'), i.e. naturally occurring environmental conditions in which certain subsets of the population have differing levels of exposure to a supposed causal factor. Most of this evidence was derived on the DNA methylation level. We discussed DNA methylation as a key player in epigenetic modifications that can be inherited through multiple cell divisions. In this Perspective article, an overview of the quasi-experimental epidemiological evidence for the role of epigenetic mechanisms in the developmental programming by early-life undernutrition is provided.© The Author(s) 2021.

Accordingly, this study aimed to understand first-hand experience of parents of triplets, using thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews participated by eight parents (four couples: Age M = 48.63, SD = 10.61 years). Six themes were identified: (1) Negative and (2) Positive experiences of raising triplets prenatally and postnatally, (3) Social, psychological, and material support, (4) Experiences and challenges specific to mothers and (5) fathers, and (6) Advice for future parents. These themes suggest that being reassured and accepting support from others are particularly essential in reducing stress and anxiety. Self-compassion interventions were recommended to support the wellbeing of parents of triplets.

"35035785","LncRNA functional annotation with improved false discovery rate achieved by disease associations.","Comput Struct Biotechnol J","The long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play critical roles in various biological processes and are associated with many diseases. Functional annotation of lncRNAs in diseases attracts great attention in understanding their etiology. However, the traditional co-expression-based analysis usually produces a significant number of false positive function assignments. It is thus crucial to develop a new approach to obtain lower false discovery rate for functional annotation of lncRNAs. Here, a novel strategy termed DAnet which combining disease associations withcis-regulatory network between lncRNAs and neighboring protein-coding genes was developed, and the performance of DAnet was systematically compared with that of the traditional differential expression-based approach. Based on a gold standard analysis of the experimentally validated lncRNAs, the proposed strategy was found to perform better in identifying the experimentally validated lncRNAs compared with the other method. Moreover, the majority of biological pathways (40%∼100%) identified by DAnet were reported to be associated with the studied diseases. In sum, the DAnet is expected to be used to identify the function of specific lncRNAs in a particular disease or multiple diseases.© 2021 The Author(s)."
"35024695","Androgens and Their Role in Regulating Sex Differences in the Hypothalamic/Pituitary/Adrenal Axis Stress Response and Stress-Related Behaviors.","Androg Clin Res Ther","Androgens play a pivotal role during development. These gonadal hormones and their receptors exert organizational actions that shape brain morphology in regions controlling the stress regulatory systems in a male-specific manner. Specifically, androgens drive sex differences in the hypothalamic/pituitary/adrenal (HPA) axis and corresponding hypothalamic neuropeptides. While studies have examined the role of estradiol and its receptors in sex differences in the HPA axis and associated behaviors, the role of androgens remains far less studied. Androgens are generally thought to modulate the HPA axis through the activation of androgen receptors (ARs). They can also impact the HPA axis through reduction to estrogenic metabolites that can bind estrogen receptors in the brain and periphery. Such regulation of the HPA axis stress response by androgens can often result in sex-biased risk factors for stress-related disorders, such as anxiety and depression. This review focuses on the biosynthesis pathways and molecular actions of androgens and their nuclear receptors. The impact of androgens on hypothalamic neuropeptide systems (corticotropin-releasing hormone, arginine vasopressin, oxytocin, dopamine, and serotonin) that control the stress response and stress-related disorders is discussed. Finally, this review discusses potential therapeutics involving androgens (androgen replacement therapies, selective AR modulator therapies) and ongoing clinical trials.© Julietta A.

"34997033","Evaluation of animal model congruence to human depression based on large-scale gene expression patterns of the CNS.","Sci Rep","Depression is a complex mental health disorder that is difficult to study. A wide range of animal models exist and for many of these data on large-scale gene expression patterns in the CNS are available. The goal of this study was to evaluate how well animal models match human depression by evaluating congruence and discordance of large-scale gene expression patterns in the CNS between almost 300 animal models and a portrait of human depression created from male and female datasets. Multiple approaches were used, including a hypergeometric based scoring system that rewards common gene expression patterns (e.g., up-up or down-down in both model and human depression), but penalizes opposing gene expression patterns. RRHO heat maps, Uniform Manifold Approximation Plot (UMAP), and machine learning were used to evaluate matching of models to depression. The top ranked model was a histone deacetylase (HDAC2) conditional knockout in forebrain neurons. Also highly ranked were various models for Alzheimer's, including APPsa knock-in (2nd overall), APP knockout, and an APP/PS1 humanized double mutant. Other top models were the mitochondrial gene HTRA2 knockout (that is lethal in adulthood), a modified acetylcholinesterase, a Huntington's disease model, and the CRTC1 knockout. Over 30 stress related models were evaluated and while some matched highly with depression, others did not. In most of the top models, a consistent dysregulation of MAP kinase pathway was identified and the genes NR4A1, BDNF, ARC, EGR2, and PDE7B were consistently downregulated as in humans with depression. Separate male and female portraits of depression were also evaluated to identify potential sex specific depression matches with models. Individual human depression datasets were also evaluated to allow for comparisons across the same brain regions. Heatmap, UMAP, and machine learning results supported the hypergeometric ranking findings. Together, this study provides new insights into how large-scale gene expression patterns may be similarly dysregulated in some animals models and humans with depression that may provide new avenues for understanding and treating depression.© 2022.

High resolution T1-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans were obtained from 123 non-comorbid treatment-naïve individuals with MDD and 81 age-, sex-, and handedness-matched healthy controls (HCs). MRI data were preprocessed with FreeSurfer software and four cortical measures were extracted: cortical thickness (CT), surface area (SA), cortical volume (CV), and local gyrification index (LGI). We tested for both sex-specific and sex-nonspecific patterns of cortical anatomic alterations. Regardless of sex, individuals with MDD showed significantly higher LGI in posterior cortex relative to HCs. Significant sex-by-group interactions were observed, and subsequent post-hoc analyses revealed that female individuals with MDD showed significantly lower SA in left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC), lower CV in right rostromedial prefrontal cortex (rmPFC), and higher LGI in left visual cortex compared with sex-matched HCs, whereas the opposite patterns of significant effects were seen in male individuals with MDD relative to their sex-matched HCs. Thus, sex-nonspecific and specific morphometric differences from HCs were found in posterior cortex, while in PFC alterations were highly sex-specific early in the illness course. This may involve sex-specific alterations in brain development or processes related to illness onset.

Current methodologies for diagnosis and treatment rely on the use of cell lines as models for tumor biology. However, due to inherent heterogeneity and differential growing environments between cell lines and tumors, these comparative studies have found little parallels in molecular signatures. As a consequence, the development and discovery of preclinical models and reliable drug targets are delayed. In this study, we established transcriptome parallels between cell lines and tumors from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) with the use of optimized normalization methods. We identified genes and signaling pathways associated with regulating the transformation and progression of EC. Specifically, the LXR/RXR activation, neuroprotective role for THOP1 in Alzheimer's disease, and glutamate receptor signaling pathways were observed to be mostly downregulated in advanced cancer stage. While some of these highlighted markers and signaling pathways are commonly found in the central nervous system (CNS), our results suggest a novel function of these genes in the periphery. Finally, our study underscores the value of implementing appropriate normalization methods in comparative studies to improve the identification of accurate and reliable markers.Copyright: © 2021 Cho-Clark et al."

Here, we explore the genomic variants in 93 females and 196 males regulating the initial transcriptional response to cortisol via glucocorticoid receptor (GR) activation. Gene expression levels in peripheral blood were obtained before and after GR-stimulation with the selective GR agonist dexamethasone to identify differential expression following GR-activation. Sex stratified analyses revealed that while the transcripts responsive to GR-stimulation were mostly overlapping between males and females, the quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) regulation differential transcription to GR-stimulation was distinct. Sex-stratified eQTL SNPs (eSNPs) were located in different functional genomic elements and sex-stratified transcripts were enriched within postmortem brain transcriptional profiles associated with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) specifically in males and females in the cingulate cortex. Female eSNPs were enriched among SNPs linked to MDD in genome-wide association studies. Finally, transcriptional sensitive genetic profile scores derived from sex-stratified eSNPS regulating differential transcription to GR-stimulation were predictive of depression status and depressive symptoms in a sex-concordant manner in a child and adolescent cohort (n = 584). These results suggest the potential of eQTLs regulating differential transcription to GR-stimulation as biomarkers of sex-specific biological risk for stress-related psychiatric disorders.© 2021.

"34893785","The stressed synapse 2.0: pathophysiological mechanisms in stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders.","Nat Rev Neurosci","Stress is a primary risk factor for several neuropsychiatric disorders. Evidence from preclinical models and clinical studies of depression have revealed an array of structural and functional maladaptive changes, whereby adverse environmental factors shape the brain. These changes, observed from the molecular and transcriptional levels through to large-scale brain networks, to the behaviours reveal a complex matrix of interrelated pathophysiological processes that differ between sexes, providing insight into the potential underpinnings of the sex bias of neuropsychiatric disorders. Although many preclinical studies use chronic stress protocols, long-term changes are also induced by acute exposure to traumatic stress, opening a path to identify determinants of resilient versus susceptible responses to both acute and chronic stress. Epigenetic regulation of gene expression has emerged as a key player underlying the persistent impact of stress on the brain. Indeed, histone modification, DNA methylation and microRNAs are closely involved in many aspects of the stress response and reveal the glutamate system as a key player. The success of ketamine has stimulated a whole line of research and development on drugs directly or indirectly targeting glutamate function. However, the challenge of translating the emerging understanding of stress pathophysiology into effective clinical treatments remains a major challenge.© 2021. Springer Nature Limited."

Using RNA-sequencing, we investigated the genomic signatures in the ventral hippocampus common to mouse models of stress. Chronic oral corticosterone (CORT) induced increased anxiety- and depression-like behavior in wild-type male mice and male mice heterozygous for the gene coding for brain-derived neurotrophic factor Val66Met, a variant associated with genetic susceptibility to stress. In a separate set of male mice, chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) led to a susceptible or a resilient population, whose proportion was dependent on housing conditions, namely standard housing or enriched environment. Rank-rank-hypergeometric overlap (RRHO), a threshold-free approach that ranks genes by their p value and effect size direction, was used to identify genes from a continuous gradient of significancy that were concordant across groups. In mice treated with CORT and in standard-housed susceptible mice, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were concordant for gene networks involved in neurotransmission, cytoskeleton function, and vascularization. Weighted gene co-expression analysis generated 54 gene hub modules and revealed two modules in which both CORT and CSDS-induced enrichment in DEGs, whose function was concordant with the RRHO predictions, and correlated with behavioral resilience or susceptibility. These data showed transcriptional concordance across models in which the stress coping depends upon hormonal, environmental, or genetic factors revealing common genomic drivers that embody the multifaceted nature of stress-related disorders.© 2021.

"34820640","Sex and region-specific effects of variable stress on microglia morphology.","Brain Behav Immun Health","Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a common and debilitating mood disorder that is more prevalent in women than men. In humans, PET imaging of microglia activation is currently being explored as a potential biomarker of MDD and suicidal ideation. Stress is a trigger for many mood disorders, including MDD. Microglial changes in morphology and activation state in response to stress has been reported in various brain regions, but most studies only examined male subjects. Here we report changes in microglia morphology in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and subregions of the hippocampus (HPC) in both male and female mice following variable stress of 6 or 28 days in duration. Our data demonstrate that after 6 days of stress, microglia in the female NAc and dentate gyrus have a reduction in homeostatic associated morphology and an increase in primed microglia. After 28 days some of these sex specific stress effects were still present in microglia within the NAc but not the dentate gyrus. There were no effects of stress in either sex at either timepoint in CA1. In female mice, anti-inflammatory activation of microglia using rosiglitazone promoted sociability behavior after 6 days of stress. Furthermore, both drug and stress have impact on microglia morphology and activation state in the NAc. These data suggest that microglia morphology and activation state are altered by 6 days of variable stress in a region-specific manner and may contribute to, or potentially compensate for, the onset of stress susceptibility rather than impacting long term exposure to stress.© 2021 The Authors.

The majority of HNSCC patients can roughly be divided into three subcategories. First, a small group of young patients who present with variants of genomic aberrations and inheritable diseases like Fanconi anaemia. Second, an increasing population of HPV-related HNSCCs that are regarded as genomic stable tumours with a more favourable prognosis. Though HPV-related tumours used to be more common among younger males, a notable rise in the elderly population is observed. The third subcategory, that of HPV-negative tumours, has been shown to be more heterogeneous with involvement of a variety of oncogenic pathways related to lifestyle factors like smoking and alcohol consumption, often seen in middle-aged males. Some of these pathways could be related to age, such as TP53 alterations, EGFR activation, apoptotic pathway alterations and field cancerization.In this narrative review, we provide an overview of established and newly discovered age-specific pathophysiological mechanisms underlying HNSCC. We propose a fourth subcategory of patients with a suspected different pathophysiology: elderly (HPV-negative) HNSCC patients without a history of tobacco and alcohol consumption. In this subcategory, carcinogenesis seems to be a multi-step process based on genomic instability, immunosenescence, cell cycle disruption and telomere shortening. To conclude, we discuss suggestions for future research to fill the knowledge gap about age-dependent HNSCC carcinogenesis.© 2022. Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

"34921240","Epigenetic models developed for plains zebras predict age in domestic horses and endangered equids.","Commun Biol","Effective conservation and management of threatened wildlife populations require an accurate assessment of age structure to estimate demographic trends and population viability. Epigenetic aging models are promising developments because they estimate individual age with high accuracy, accurately predict age in related species, and do not require invasive sampling or intensive long-term studies. Using blood and biopsy samples from known age plains zebras (Equus quagga), we model epigenetic aging using two approaches: the epigenetic clock (EC) and the epigenetic pacemaker (EPM). The plains zebra EC has the potential for broad application within the genus Equus given that five of the seven extant wild species of the genus are threatened. We test the EC's ability to predict age in sister taxa, including two endangered species and the more distantly related domestic horse, demonstrating high accuracy in all cases. By comparing chronological and estimated age in plains zebras, we investigate age acceleration as a proxy of health status. An interaction between chronological age and inbreeding is associated with age acceleration estimated by the EPM, suggesting a cumulative effect of inbreeding on biological aging throughout life.© 2021.

"34981446","Genome-wide analysis of genetic predisposition to common polygenic cancers.","J Appl Genet","Lung, breast, prostate, and colorectal cancers are among the most common and fatal malignancies worldwide. They are mainly caused by multifactorial mechanisms and are genetically heterogeneous. We investigated the genetic architecture of these cancers through genome-wide association, pathway-based, and summary-based transcriptome-/methylome-wide association analyses using three independent cohorts. Our genome-wide association analyses identified the associations of 33 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at P < 5E - 06, of which 32 SNPs were not previously reported and did not have proxy variants within their ± 1 Mb flanking regions. Moreover, other polymorphisms mapped to their closest genes were not previously associated with the same cancers at P < 5E - 06. Our pathway enrichment analyses revealed associations of 32 pathways; mainly related to the immune system, DNA replication/transcription, and chromosomal organization; with the studied cancers. Also, 60 probes were associated with these cancers in our transcriptome-wide and methylome-wide analyses. The ± 1 Mb flanking regions of most probes had not attained P < 5E - 06 in genome-wide association studies. The genes corresponding to the significant probes can be considered as potential targets for further functional studies. Two genes (i.e., CDC14A and PMEL) demonstrated stronger evidence of associations with lung cancer as they had significant probes in both transcriptome-wide and methylome-wide association analyses. The novel cancer-associated SNPs and genes identified here would advance our understanding of the genetic heterogeneity of the common cancers.© 2022.

"34807913","Cascading epigenomic analysis for identifying disease genes from the regulatory landscape of GWAS variants.","PLoS Genet","The majority of genetic variants detected in genome wide association studies (GWAS) exert their effects on phenotypes through gene regulation. Motivated by this observation, we propose a multi-omic integration method that models the cascading effects of genetic variants from epigenome to transcriptome and eventually to the phenome in identifying target genes influenced by risk alleles. This cascading epigenomic analysis for GWAS, which we refer to as CEWAS, comprises two types of models: one for linking cis genetic effects to epigenomic variation and another for linking cis epigenomic variation to gene expression. Applying these models in cascade to GWAS summary statistics generates gene level statistics that reflect genetically-driven epigenomic effects. We show on sixteen brain-related GWAS that CEWAS provides higher gene detection rate than related methods, and finds disease relevant genes and gene sets that point toward less explored biological processes. CEWAS thus presents a novel means for exploring the regulatory landscape of GWAS variants in uncovering disease mechanisms."
"34925466","SNPs in miRNAs and Target Sequences: Role in Cancer and Diabetes.","Front Genet","miRNAs are fascinating molecular players for gene regulation as individual miRNA can control multiple targets and a single target can be regulated by multiple miRNAs. Loss of miRNA regulated gene expression is often reported to be implicated in various human diseases like diabetes and cancer. Recently, geneticists across the world started reporting single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) in seed sequences of miRNAs. Similarly, SNPs are also reported in various target sequences of these miRNAs. Both the scenarios lead to dysregulated gene expression which may result in the progression of diseases. In the present paper, we explore SNPs in various miRNAs and their target sequences reported in various human cancers as well as diabetes. Similarly, we also present evidence of these mutations in various other human diseases.Copyright © 2021 Chhichholiya, Suryan, Suman, Munshi and Singh."
"34884818","miRNAs as Therapeutic Tools in Alzheimer's Disease.","Int J Mol Sci","Alzheimer's disease (AD), an age-dependent, progressive neurodegenerative disorder, is the most common type of dementia, accounting for 50-70% of all dementia cases. Due to the increasing incidence and corresponding socioeconomic burden of dementia, it has rapidly emerged as a challenge to public health worldwide. The characteristics of AD include the development of extracellular amyloid-beta plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles, vascular changes, neuronal inflammation, and progressive brain atrophy. However, the complexity of the biology of AD has hindered progress in elucidating the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of AD, and the development of effective treatments. MicroRNAs (miRNAs, which are endogenous, noncoding RNAs of approximately 22 nucleotides that function as posttranscriptional regulators of various genes) are attracting attention as powerful tools for studying the mechanisms of diseases, as they are involved in several biological processes and diseases, including AD. AD is a multifactorial disease, and several reports have suggested that miRNAs play an important role in the pathological processes of AD. In this review, the basic biology of miRNAs is described, and the function and physiology of miRNAs in the pathological processes of AD are highlighted. In addition, the limitations of current pharmaceutical therapies for the treatment of AD and the development of miRNA-based next-generation therapies are discussed."

We hypothesize that PD susceptibility genes modulate disease risk by influencing gene expression within immune cells. To address this, we have generated transcriptomic profiles of monocytes from 230 individuals with sporadic PD and healthy subjects. We observed a dysregulation of mitochondrial and proteasomal pathways. We also generated transcriptomic profiles of primary microglia from brains of 55 subjects and observed discordant transcriptomic signatures of mitochondrial genes in PD monocytes and microglia. We further identified 17 PD susceptibility genes whose expression, relative to each risk allele, is altered in monocytes. These findings reveal widespread transcriptomic alterations in PD monocytes, with some being distinct from microglia, and facilitate efforts to understand the roles of myeloid cells in PD as well as the development of biomarkers."
"34992268","Genetic analysis of the human microglial transcriptome across brain regions, aging and disease pathologies.","Nat Genet","Microglia have emerged as important players in brain aging and pathology. To understand how genetic risk for neurological and psychiatric disorders is related to microglial function, large transcriptome studies are essential. Here we describe the transcriptome analysis of 255 primary human microglial samples isolated at autopsy from multiple brain regions of 100 individuals. We performed systematic analyses to investigate various aspects of microglial heterogeneities, including brain region and aging. We mapped expression and splicing quantitative trait loci and showed that many neurological disease susceptibility loci are mediated through gene expression or splicing in microglia. Fine-mapping of these loci nominated candidate causal variants that are within microglia-specific enhancers, finding associations with microglial expression of USP6NL for Alzheimer's disease and P2RY12 for Parkinson's disease. We have built the most comprehensive catalog to date of genetic effects on the microglial transcriptome and propose candidate functional variants in neurological and psychiatric disorders.© 2022.

The genome-wide association study (GWAS) datasets offer the opportunity to explore this scientific question using combined genetic data from enormous samples, ultimately allowing a better understanding of the onset and development of these illnesses.Methods:We have herein performed a genome-wide meta-analysis in two GWAS datasets of SZ and BD respectively (24,600 cases and 40,012 controls in total, discovery sample), followed by replication analyses in an independent sample of 4,918 SZ cases and 5,506 controls of Han Chinese origin (replication sample). The risk SNPs were then explored for their correlations with mRNA expression of nearby genes in multiple expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) datasets.Results:The single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs1637749 and rs3800908 at 7p22.3 region were significant in both discovery and replication samples, and exhibited genome-wide significant associations when combining all East Asian SZ and BD samples (29,518 cases and 45,518 controls). The risk SNPs were also significant in GWAS of SZ and BD among Europeans. Both risk SNPs significantly predicted lower expression of MRM2 in the whole blood and brain samples in multiple datasets, which was consistent with its reduced mRNA level in the brains of SZ patients compared with normal controls. The risk SNPs were also associated with MAD1L1 expression in the whole blood sample.Discussion:We have identified a novel genome-wide risk locus associated with SZ and BD in East Asians, adding further support for the putative common genetic risk of the two illnesses. Our study also highlights the necessity and importance of mining public datasets to explore risk genes for complex psychiatric diseases.Copyright © 2021 Li, Zhang, Liu, Guan, Shao, Zhang, Liu, Yang, Su, Zhang, Xiao, Luo, Li and Lv."

Increasing evidence indicates that genetic factors make a significant contribution to NP, but genome-wide association studies (GWASs) are scant in this field and could help to elucidate susceptibility to NP.To identify genetic variants associated with NP susceptibility.This genetic association study included a meta-analysis of GWASs of NP using 3 independent cohorts: ie, Genetics of Diabetes Audit and Research in Tayside Scotland (GoDARTS); Generation Scotland: Scottish Family Health Study (GS:SFHS); and the United Kingdom Biobank (UKBB). Data analysis was conducted from April 2018 to December 2019.Individuals with NP (ie, case participants; those with pain of ≥3 months' duration and a Douleur Neuropathique en 4 Questions score ≥3) and individuals with no pain (ie, control participants) with or without diabetes from GoDARTS and GS:SFHS were identified using validated self-completed questionnaires. In the UKBB, self-reported prescribed medication and hospital records were used as a proxy to identify case participants (patients recorded as receiving specific anti-NP medicines) and control participants.GWAS was performed using linear mixed modeling. GWAS summary statistics were combined using fixed-effect meta-analysis. A total of 51 variants previously shown to be associated with NP were tested for replication.This study included a total of 4512 case participants (2662 [58.9%] women; mean [SD] age, 61.7 [10.8] years) and 428 489 control participants (227 817 [53.2%] women; mean [SD] age, 62.3 [11.5] years) in the meta-analysis of 3 cohorts with European descent. The study found a genome-wide significant locus at chromosome 12q23.1, which mapped to SLC25A3 (rs369920026; odds ratio [OR] for having NP, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.40-2.02; P = 1.30 × 10-8), and a suggestive variant at 13q14.2 near CAB39L (rs7992766; OR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.05-1.14; P = 1.22 × 10-7). These mitochondrial phosphate carriers and calcium binding genes are expressed in brain and dorsal root ganglia. Colocalization analyses using expression quantitative loci data found that the suggestive variant was associated with expression of CAB39L in the brain cerebellum (P = 1.01 × 10-14). None of the previously reported variants were replicated.To our knowledge, this was the largest meta-analyses of GWAS to date. It found novel genetic variants associated with NP susceptibility. These findings provide new insights into the genetic architecture of NP and important information for further studies."
"35013130","Comprehensive exploration of the genetic contribution of the dopaminergic and serotonergic pathways to psychiatric disorders.","Transl Psychiatry","Psychiatric disorders are highly prevalent and display considerable clinical and genetic overlap. Dopaminergic and serotonergic neurotransmission have been shown to play an important role in many psychiatric disorders. Here we aim to assess the genetic contribution of these systems to eight psychiatric disorders (attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anorexia nervosa (ANO), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), bipolar disorder (BIP), major depression (MD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), schizophrenia (SCZ) and Tourette's syndrome (TS)) using publicly available GWAS analyses performed by the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium that include more than 160,000 cases and 275,000 controls. To do so, we elaborated four different gene sets: two 'wide' selections for dopamine (DA) and for serotonin (SERT) using the Gene Ontology and KEGG pathways tools, and two'core' selections for the same systems, manually curated. At the gene level, we found 67 genes from the DA and/or SERT gene sets significantly associated with one of the studied disorders, and 12 of them were associated with two different disorders. Gene-set analysis revealed significant associations for ADHD and ASD with the wide DA gene set, for BIP with the wide SERT gene set, and for MD with the core SERT set. Interestingly, interrogation of a cross-disorder GWAS meta-analysis of the eight psychiatric conditions displayed association with the wide DA gene set. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic examination of genes encoding proteins essential to the function of these two neurotransmitter systems in these disorders. Our results support a pleiotropic contribution of the dopaminergic and serotonergic systems in several psychiatric conditions.© 2021. The Author(s)."
"35012639","Artificial intelligence framework identifies candidate targets for drug repurposing in Alzheimer's disease.","Alzheimers Res Ther","Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous susceptibility loci for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, utilizing GWAS and multi-omics data to identify high-confidence AD risk genes (ARGs) and druggable targets that can guide development of new therapeutics for patients suffering from AD has heretofore not been successful.To address this critical problem in the field, we have developed a network-based artificial intelligence framework that is capable of integrating multi-omics data along with human protein-protein interactome networks to accurately infer accurate drug targets impacted by GWAS-identified variants to identify new therapeutics. When applied to AD, this approach integrates GWAS findings, multi-omics data from brain samples of AD patients and AD transgenic animal models, drug-target networks, and the human protein-protein interactome, along with large-scale patient database validation and in vitro mechanistic observations in human microglia cells.Through this approach, we identified 103 ARGs validated by various levels of pathobiological evidence in AD. Via network-based prediction and population-based validation, we then showed that three drugs (pioglitazone, febuxostat, and atenolol) are significantly associated with decreased risk of AD compared with matched control populations. Pioglitazone usage is significantly associated with decreased risk of AD (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.916, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.861-0.974, P = 0.005) in a retrospective case-control validation. Pioglitazone is a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) agonist used to treat type 2 diabetes, and propensity score matching cohort studies confirmed its association with reduced risk of AD in comparison to glipizide (HR = 0.921, 95% CI 0.862-0.984, P = 0.0159), an insulin secretagogue that is also used to treat type 2 diabetes. In vitro experiments showed that pioglitazone downregulated glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β) and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK5) in human microglia cells, supporting a possible mechanism-of-action for its beneficial effect in AD.In summary, we present an integrated, network-based artificial intelligence methodology to rapidly translate GWAS findings and multi-omics data to genotype-informed therapeutic discovery in AD.© 2022.

Networks were constructed between the fangjis and arrhythmia and used to define arrhythmia modules. Common and differential gene targets were identified within the arrhythmia network modules and the cover rate (CR) matrix was applied to compare the contributions of the fangjis to the network and modules. Comparative pharmacogenetics analyses were then conducted to define the arrhythmia-related signaling pathways regulated by the fangjis prescriptions. Finally, the divergence and convergence points of the arrhythmia pathways were deciphered based on databases and the published literature.Results:A total of 187, 105, and 68 active ingredients and 1,139, 1,195, and 811 corresponding gene targets of the three fangjis were obtained and 102 arrhythmia-related genes were acquired. An arrhythmia network was constructed and subdivided into 4 modules. For the target distribution analysis, 65.4% of genes were regulated by the three fangjis within the arrhythmia network. ZT and GLT were more similar to each other, mainly regulated by module two, whereas HET was divided among all the modules. From the perspective of signal transduction, calcium-related pathways [calcium, cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cGMP)-PKG, and cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP)] and endocrine system-related pathways (oxytocin signaling pathway and renin secretion pathways) were associated with all the three fangjis prescriptions. Nevertheless, heterogeneity existed between the biological processes and pathway distribution among the three prescriptions. GLT and HET were particularly inclined toward the conditions involving abnormal hormone secretion, whereas ZT tended toward renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) disorders. However, calcium signaling-related pathways prominently feature in the pharmacological activities of the decoctions. Experimental validation indicated that ZT, GLT, and HET significantly shortened the duration of ventricular arrhythmia (VA) and downregulated the expression of CALM2 and interleukin-6 (IL-6) messenger RNAs (mRNAs); GLT and HET downregulated the expression of CALM1 and NOS3 mRNAs; HET downregulated the expression of CRP mRNA.Conclusion:Comparing the various distributions of the three fangjis, pathways provide evidence with respect to precise applications toward individualized arrhythmia treatments.Copyright © 2021 Wei, Long, Tan, Xing, Li, Yang and Liu."

Further characterisation of associated cell type-specific regulation can broaden our understanding of how GWAS signals may contribute to disease risk.To gain insight into potential functional mechanisms underlying GWAS associations, we developed FORGE2 ( https://forge2.altiusinstitute.org/ ), which is an updated version of the FORGE web tool. FORGE2 uses an expanded atlas of cell type-specific regulatory element annotations, including DNase I hotspots, five histone mark categories and 15 hidden Markov model (HMM) chromatin states, to identify tissue- and cell type-specific signals. An analysis of 3,604 GWAS from the NHGRI-EBI GWAS catalogue yielded at least one significant disease/trait-tissue association for 2,057 GWAS, including > 400 associations specific to epigenomic marks in immune tissues and cell types, > 30 associations specific to heart tissue, and > 60 associations specific to brain tissue, highlighting the key potential of tissue- and cell type-specific regulatory elements. Importantly, we demonstrate that FORGE2 analysis can separate previously observed accessible chromatin enrichments into different chromatin states, such as enhancers or active transcription start sites, providing a greater understanding of underlying regulatory mechanisms. Interestingly, tissue-specific enrichments for repressive chromatin states and histone marks were also detected, suggesting a role for tissue-specific repressed regions in GWAS-mediated disease aetiology.In summary, we demonstrate that FORGE2 has the potential to uncover previously unreported disease-tissue associations and identify new candidate mechanisms. FORGE2 is a transparent, user-friendly web tool for the integrative analysis of loci discovered from GWAS.© 2021. The Author(s)."
"34945759","From DNA Copy Number Gains and Tumor Dependencies to Novel Therapeutic Targets for High-Risk Neuroblastoma.","J Pers Med","Neuroblastoma is a pediatric tumor arising from the sympatho-adrenal lineage and a worldwide leading cause of childhood cancer-related deaths. About half of high-risk patients die from the disease while survivors suffer from multiple therapy-related side-effects. While neuroblastomas present with a low mutational burden, focal and large segmental DNA copy number aberrations are highly recurrent and associated with poor survival. It can be assumed that the affected chromosomal regions contain critical genes implicated in neuroblastoma biology and behavior. More specifically, evidence has emerged that several of these genes are implicated in tumor dependencies thus potentially providing novel therapeutic entry points. In this review, we briefly review the current status of recurrent DNA copy number aberrations in neuroblastoma and provide an overview of the genes affected by these genomic variants for which a direct role in neuroblastoma has been established. Several of these genes are implicated in networks that positively regulateMYCNexpression or stability as well as cell cycle control and apoptosis. Finally, we summarize alternative approaches to identify and prioritize candidate copy-number driven dependency genes for neuroblastoma offering novel therapeutic opportunities."

We identify several genes as candidates for targets of recent selection, including some relating to cell regulation, catabolic processes, neural-cell adhesion and immunity. We do not find strong evidence that three traits that are important to humans-milk protein content, milk fat content, and stature-have been subject to directional selection. Simulations demonstrate that becauseB. taurusrecently experienced a population bottleneck, singletons are depleted so the power of SDS methods is reduced.

"34906088","Identification and validation of a regulatory mutation upstream of the BMP2 gene associated with carcass length in pigs.","Genet Sel Evol","Carcass length is very important for body size and meat production for swine, thus understanding the genetic mechanisms that underly this trait is of great significance in genetic improvement programs for pigs. Although many quantitative trait loci (QTL) have been detected in pigs, very few have been fine-mapped to the level of the causal mutations. The aim of this study was to identify potential causal single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for carcass length by integrating a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and functional assays.Here, we present a GWAS in a commercial Duroc × (Landrace × Yorkshire) (DLY) population that reveals a prominent association signal (P = 4.49E-07) on pig chromosome 17 for carcass length, which was further validated in two other DLY populations. Within the detected 1 Mb region, the BMP2 gene stood out as the most likely causal candidate because of its functions in bone growth and development. Whole-genome gene expression studies showed that the BMP2 gene was differentially expressed in the cartilage tissues of pigs with extreme carcass length. Then, we genotyped an additional 267 SNPs in 500 selected DLY pigs, followed by further whole-genome SNP imputation, combined with deep genome resequencing data on multiple pig breeds. Reassociation analyses using genotyped and imputed SNP data revealed that the rs320706814 SNP, located approximately 123 kb upstream of the BMP2 gene, was the strongest candidate causal mutation, with a large association with carcass length, with a ~ 4.2 cm difference in length across all three DLY populations (N = 1501; P = 3.66E-29). This SNP segregated in all parental lines of the DLY (Duroc, Large White and Landrace) and was also associated with a significant effect on body length in 299 pure Yorkshire pigs (P = 9.2E-4), which indicates that it has a major value for commercial breeding. Functional assays showed that this SNP is likely located within an enhancer and may affect the binding affinity of transcription factors, thereby regulating BMP2 gene expression.Taken together, these results suggest that the rs320706814 SNP on pig chromosome 17 is a putative causal mutation for carcass length in the widely used DLY pigs and has great value in breeding for body size in pigs.© 2021.

"34903281","Estimating prevalence of human traits among populations from polygenic risk scores.","Hum Genomics","The genetic basis of phenotypic variation across populations has not been well explained for most traits. Several factors may cause disparities, from variation in environments to divergent population genetic structure. We hypothesized that a population-level polygenic risk score (PRS) can explain phenotypic variation among geographic populations based solely on risk allele frequencies. We applied a population-specific PRS (psPRS) to 26 populations from the 1000 Genomes to four phenotypes: lactase persistence (LP), melanoma, multiple sclerosis (MS) and height. Our models assumed additive genetic architecture among the polymorphisms in the psPRSs, as is convention. Linear psPRSs explained a significant proportion of trait variance ranging from 0.32 for height in men to 0.88 for melanoma. The best models for LP and height were linear, while those for melanoma and MS were nonlinear. As not all variants in a PRS may confer similar, or even any, risk among diverse populations, we also filtered out SNPs to assess whether variance explained was improved using psPRSs with fewer SNPs. Variance explained usually improved with fewer SNPs in the psPRS and was as high as 0.99 for height in men using only 548 of the initial 4208 SNPs. That reducing SNPs improves psPRSs performance may indicate that missing heritability is partially due to complex architecture that does not mandate additivity, undiscovered variants or spurious associations in the databases. We demonstrated that PRS-based analyses can be used across diverse populations and phenotypes for population prediction and that these comparisons can identify the universal risk variants.© 2021.

Genetic predisposition among individuals may give rise to variant degree of phenotypic changes but there has yet been a documented unified pathway to explain the idiosyncrasy. In this study, we argue that the susceptibility to epigenetic changes governing molecular cross talks along the BMP and PI3K/Akt pathway may underline how genetic background dictate GC-induced bone loss. Concordantly, osteoblasts from BALB/c or C57BL/6 neonatal mice were treated with dexamethasone for transcriptome profiling. Furthermore, we also confirmed that GC-pre-conditioned mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) would give rise to defective osteogenesis by instigating epigenetic changes which affected the accessibility of enhancer marks. In line with these epigenetic changes, we propose that GC modulates a key regulatory network involving the scavenger receptor Cd36 in osteoblasts pre-conditioning pharmacological idiosyncrasy in GIO.Copyright © 2021 Lu, Cai, Luo, Wang, Fung, Jia, Yu, Chan, Miu and Xiao."
"34894236","Populations, Traits, and Their Spatial Structure in Humans.","Genome Biol Evol","The spatial distribution of genetic variants is jointly determined by geography, past demographic processes, natural selection, and its interplay with environmental variation. A fraction of these genetic variants are ""causal alleles"" that affect the manifestation of a complex trait. The effect exerted by these causal alleles on complex traits can be independent or dependent on the environment. Understanding the evolutionary processes that shape the spatial structure of causal alleles is key to comprehend the spatial distribution of complex traits. Natural selection, past population size changes, range expansions, consanguinity, assortative mating, archaic introgression, admixture, and the environment can alter the frequencies, effect sizes, and heterozygosities of causal alleles. This provides a genetic axis along which complex traits can vary. However, complex traits also vary along biogeographical and sociocultural axes which are often correlated with genetic axes in complex ways. The purpose of this review is to consider these genetic and environmental axes in concert and examine the ways they can help us decipher the variation in complex traits that is visible in humans today. This initiative necessarily implies a discussion of populations, traits, the ability to infer and interpret ""genetic"" components of complex traits, and how these have been impacted by adaptive events. In this review, we provide a history-aware discussion on these topics using both the recent and more distant past of our academic discipline and its relevant contexts.© The Author(s) 2021.

Translating the growing list of genetic loci significantly associated with disease into medically actionable information remains an important challenge. Thus, establishing platforms with which to validate the impact of risk variants in cell-type-specific and donor-dependent contexts is critical. Towards this, we selected and characterized a collection of 12 human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) lines derived from control donors with extremely low and high SZ polygenic risk scores (PRS). These hiPSC lines are publicly available at the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM). The suitability of these extreme PRS hiPSCs for CRISPR-based isogenic comparisons of neurons and glia was evaluated across 3 independent laboratories, identifying 9 out of 12 meeting our criteria.

Based on evolutionary game theory and developmental modularity theory, we constructed multilayer, omnigenic networks of bidirectional, weighted, and positive or negative epistatic interactions using a forest poplar tree mapping population, which were organized into metagalactic, intergalactic, and local interstellar networks that describe layers of structure between modules, submodules, and individual single nucleotide polymorphisms, respectively. These multilayer interactomes enable the exploration of complex interactions between genes, and the analysis of not only differential expression of quantitative trait loci but also previously uncharacterized determinant SNPs, which are negatively regulated by other SNPs, based on the deconstruction of genetic effects to their component parts. Our research framework provides a tool to comprehend the pleiotropic control of complex traits and explores the inherent directional connections between genes in the structure of omnigenic networks.Copyright © 2021 Gong, Zhu, Zhu, Fang, Zhang and Wu."
"34868232","Regulatory SNP of <i>RREB1</i> is Associated With Bone Mineral Density in Chinese Postmenopausal Osteoporosis Patients.","Front Genet","Postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMO) is the most common bone disorder in elderly Chinese women. Although genetic factors have been shown to have a pivotal role in PMO, studies on genetic loci associated with PMO in Chinese individuals are still lacking. We aimed to identify SNPs that contribute to PMO in Chinese individuals by conducting a genome-wide association study (GWAS). Bone mineral density (BMD) of postmenopausal Chinese women was assessed. Participants with T-score < -2.5 standard deviations (n= 341) were recruited and divided into a discovery group (n= 150) and a replication group (n= 191). GWAS was performed, with T-score as the quantitative trait, using linear regression. Our results revealed that an SNP cluster upstream ofRREB1showed a trend of association with BMD in Chinese PMO patients. The leading SNP of the cluster was rs475011 (pcombined= 1.15 × 10-6, beta = 0.51), which is a splicing quantitative trait locus (sQTL) ofRREB1. This association was further supported by data from the UK Biobank (UKBB;p= 9.56 × 10-12). The high BMD-associated allele G of rs475011 is related to a high intron excision ratio. This SNP may increase BMD by upregulating matureRREB1mRNA, based on data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) database. We identified BMD-associated SNPs that regulateRREB1in Chinese PMO patients. Future functional experiments are needed to further link rs475011,RREB1, and PMO in Chinese individuals.Copyright © 2021 Feng, Wang, Yan, Su, Ao and Chen."
"34867553","A Unifying Theory for Autism: The Pathogenetic Triad as a Theoretical Framework.","Front Psychiatry","This paper presents a unifying theory for autism by applying the framework of a pathogenetic triad to the scientific literature. It proposes a deconstruction of autism into three contributing features (an autistic personality dimension, cognitive compensation, and neuropathological risk factors), and delineates how they interact to cause a maladaptive behavioral phenotype that may require a clinical diagnosis. The autistic personality represents a common core condition, which induces a set of behavioral issues when pronounced. These issues are compensated for by cognitive mechanisms, allowing the individual to remain adaptive and functional. Risk factors, both exogenous and endogenous ones, show pathophysiological convergence through their negative effects on neurodevelopment. This secondarily affects cognitive compensation, which disinhibits a maladaptive behavioral phenotype. The triad is operationalized and methods for quantification are presented. With respect to the breadth of findings in the literature that it can incorporate, it is the most comprehensive model yet for autism. Its main implications are that (1) it presents the broader autism phenotype as a non-pathological core personality domain, which is shared across the population and uncoupled from associated features such as low cognitive ability and immune dysfunction, (2) it proposes that common genetic variants underly the personality domain, and that rare variants act as risk factors through negative effects on neurodevelopment, (3) it outlines a common pathophysiological mechanism, through inhibition of neurodevelopment and cognitive dysfunction, by which a wide range of endogenous and exogenous risk factors lead to autism, and (4) it suggests that contributing risk factors, and findings of immune and autonomic dysfunction are clinically ascertained rather than part of the core autism construct.Copyright © 2021 Sarovic."

We study the relevance of rare protein-truncating variants (PTVs) that may result in loss-of-function in breast cancer susceptibility genes on tumor characteristics and survival in 8852 breast cancer patients of Asian descent.Gene panel sequencing was performed for 34 known or suspected breast cancer predisposition genes, of which nine genes (ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, CHEK2, PALB2, BARD1, RAD51C, RAD51D, and TP53) were associated with breast cancer risk. Associations between PTV carriership in one or more genes and tumor characteristics were examined using multinomial logistic regression. Ten-year overall survival was estimated using Cox regression models in 6477 breast cancer patients after excluding older patients (≥75years) and stage 0 and IV disease.PTV9genescarriership (n = 690) was significantly associated (p < 0.001) with more aggressive tumor characteristics including high grade (poorly vs well-differentiated, odds ratio [95% confidence interval] 3.48 [2.35-5.17], moderately vs well-differentiated 2.33 [1.56-3.49]), as well as luminal B [HER-] and triple-negative subtypes (vs luminal A 2.15 [1.58-2.92] and 2.85 [2.17-3.73], respectively), adjusted for age at diagnosis, study, and ethnicity. Associations with grade and luminal B [HER2-] subtype remained significant after excluding BRCA1/2 carriers. PTV25genescarriership (n = 289, excluding carriers of the nine genes associated with breast cancer) was not associated with tumor characteristics. However, PTV25genescarriership, but not PTV9genescarriership, was suggested to be associated with worse 10-year overall survival (hazard ratio [CI] 1.63 [1.16-2.28]).PTV9genescarriership is associated with more aggressive tumors. Variants in other genes might be associated with the survival of breast cancer patients. The finding that PTV carriership is not just associated with higher breast cancer risk, but also more severe and fatal forms of the disease, suggests that genetic testing has the potential to provide additional health information and help healthy individuals make screening decisions.© 2021.

Their relative contributions to the genetic correlation of quantitative traits and detection by multitrait GWA studies.","Genetics","Genetic correlations between traits may cause correlated responses to selection. Previous models described the conditions under which genetic correlations are expected to be maintained. Selection, mutation, and migration are all proposed to affect genetic correlations, regardless of whether the underlying genetic architecture consists of pleiotropic or tightly linked loci affecting the traits. Here, we investigate the conditions under which pleiotropy and linkage have different effects on the genetic correlations between traits by explicitly modeling multiple genetic architectures to look at the effects of selection strength, degree of correlational selection, mutation rate, mutational variance, recombination rate, and migration rate. We show that at mutation-selection(-migration) balance, mutation rates differentially affect the equilibrium levels of genetic correlation when architectures are composed of pairs of physically linked loci compared to architectures of pleiotropic loci. Even when there is perfect linkage (no recombination within pairs of linked loci), a lower genetic correlation is maintained than with pleiotropy, with a lower mutation rate leading to a larger decrease. These results imply that the detection of causal loci in multitrait association studies will be affected by the type of underlying architectures, whereby pleiotropic variants are more likely to be underlying multiple detected associations. We also confirm that tighter linkage between nonpleiotropic causal loci maintains higher genetic correlations at the traits and leads to a greater proportion of false positives in association analyses.© The Author(s) 2021.

Its pathogenesis is unknown. In this disease, symptoms resolve spontaneously in approximately 50% of patients when maturity is reached, prompting to a maturation problem. The purpose of this study was to understand the molecular bases of this disease by generating and analyzing induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons from a family with 7 siblings, among whom 4 suffer from this disease.Two affected siblings and, as controls, a healthy sister and the unaffected mother of the family were studied. Using exome sequencing, a homozygous variant in the FYVE, RhoGEF and PH Domain Containing 6 gene was identified in the patients as a putative genetic factor that could contribute to the development of this familial disorder. After informed consent was signed, skin biopsies from the 4 individuals were collected, fibroblasts were derived and reprogrammed and neurons were generated and characterized by markers and electrophysiology. Morphological, electrophysiological and gene expression analyses were performed on these neurons.Bona fide induced pluripotent stem cells and derived neurons could be generated in all cases. Overall, there were no major shifts in neuronal marker expression among patient and control-derived neurons. Compared to two familial controls, neurons from patients showed shorter axonal length, a dramatic reduction in synapsin-1 levels and cytoskeleton disorganization. In addition, neurons from patients developed a lower action potential threshold with time of in vitro differentiation and the amount of current needed to elicit an action potential (rheobase) was smaller in cells recorded from NE derived from patients at 12 weeks of differentiation when compared with shorter times in culture. These results indicate an increased excitability in patient cells that emerges with the time in culture. Finally, functional genomic analysis showed a biased towards immaturity in patient-derived neurons.We are reporting the first in vitro model of self-limited childhood epilepsy, providing the cellular bases for future in-depth studies to understand its pathogenesis. Our results show patient-specific neuronal features reflecting immaturity, in resonance with the course of the disease and previous imaging studies.© 2021. The Author(s)."

"34791209","Multiple epistatic DNA variants in a single gene affect gene expression in trans.","Genetics","DNA variants that alter gene expression in trans are important sources of phenotypic variation. Nevertheless, the identity of trans-acting variants remains poorly understood. Single causal variants in several genes have been reported to affect the expression of numerous distant genes in trans. Whether these simple molecular architectures are representative of trans-acting variation is unknown. Here, we studied the large RAS signaling regulator gene IRA2, which contains variants with extensive trans-acting effects on gene expression in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We used systematic CRISPR-based genome engineering and a sensitive phenotyping strategy to dissect causal variants to the nucleotide level. In contrast to the simple molecular architectures known so far, IRA2 contained at least seven causal nonsynonymous variants. The effects of these variants were modulated by non-additive, epistatic interactions. Two variants at the 5'-end affected gene expression and growth only when combined with a third variant that also had no effect in isolation. Our findings indicate that the molecular basis of trans-acting genetic variation may be considerably more complex than previously appreciated.© The Author(s) 2021.

Thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are implicated as transcription regulators, but there is a striking difference in the Allele Frequency Spectrum (AFS) of cis-acting and trans-acting mutations. Cis-SNPs have intermediate frequencies (consistent with balancing selection) while trans-SNPs exhibit a rare-alleles model (consistent with purifying selection). This pattern only becomes clear when transcript variation is normalized on a gene-to-gene basis. If a global normalization is applied, as is typically in RNAseq experiments, asymmetric transcript distributions combined with ""rarity disequilibrium"" produce a super-abundance of false positives for trans-acting SNPs. To explore the cause of purifying selection on trans-acting mutations, we identified gene expression modules as sets of co-expressed genes. The extent to which trans-acting mutations influence modules is a strong predictor of allele frequency. Mutations altering expression of genes with high ""connectedness"" (those that are highly predictive of the representative module expression value) have the lowest allele frequency. The expression modules can also predict whole-plant traits such as flower size. We find that a substantial portion of the genetic (co)variance among traits can be described as an emergent property of genetic effects on expression modules.© The Author(s) 2021.

"34772759","The crucial role of genome-wide genetic variation in conservation.","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","The unprecedented rate of extinction calls for efficient use of genetics to help conserve biodiversity. Several recent genomic and simulation-based studies have argued that the field of conservation biology has placed too much focus on conserving genome-wide genetic variation, and that the field should instead focus on managing the subset of functional genetic variation that is thought to affect fitness. Here, we critically evaluate the feasibility and likely benefits of this approach in conservation. We find that population genetics theory and empirical results show that conserving genome-wide genetic variation is generally the best approach to prevent inbreeding depression and loss of adaptive potential from driving populations toward extinction. Focusing conservation efforts on presumably functional genetic variation will only be feasible occasionally, often misleading, and counterproductive when prioritized over genome-wide genetic variation. Given the increasing rate of habitat loss and other environmental changes, failure to recognize the detrimental effects of lost genome-wide genetic variation on long-term population viability will only worsen the biodiversity crisis."

Understanding the information needs on AD of the global public can contribute to the prevention and control of AD. The purpose of this study was to explore global public interest and seasonal variations in AD using Google Trends (GT).Methods:GT was used to obtain relative search volume (RSV) of the keyword ""Alzheimer's disease"" in six English-speaking countries (Australia, New Zealand, the USA, the UK, Canada, and Ireland) and the world from January 2004 to December 2020. Cosinor analysis was applied to detect the seasonality of AD-related RSV. Time series plot was used to observe the trend of annual mean AD-related RSV. Globally, hot topics and top rising topics related to AD were also analyzed. In addition, we also explored the geographical distribution characteristics of AD-related RSV.Results:AD-related RSV declined steadily from January 2004 to December 2013 and rose steadily from January 2014 to December 2020. Search popularity of AD is low in the southern hemisphere, compared to the northern hemisphere. Cosinor analysis showed that there were significant seasonal variations in AD-related RSV in six English-speaking countries (allP< 0.05). Interestingly, regardless of the hemisphere, peaks were observed in the winter months and trough in the summer months. Topics related to the characteristics and etiology of AD, early onset AD, AD-related associations, care of AD patients, and diseases that can easily be confused with AD had received special attention.Conclusions:There is increasing global public interest for AD and a significant seasonal variation in AD.

Potential etiological factors have been identified, including genetic causes, environmental elements and epigenetic components. Nutrition is currently considered an influencing factor, and several studies have explored the contribution of restriction and dietary supplements in ADHD treatments. Iron is an essential cofactor required for a number of functions, such as transport of oxygen, immune function, cellular respiration, neurotransmitter metabolism (dopamine production), and DNA synthesis. Zinc is also an essential trace element, required for cellular functions related to the metabolism of neurotransmitters, melatonin, and prostaglandins. Epidemiological studies have found that iron and zinc deficiencies are common nutritional deficits worldwide, with important roles on neurologic functions (poor memory, inattentiveness, and impulsiveness), finicky appetite, and mood changes (sadness and irritability). Altered levels of iron and zinc have been related with the aggravation and progression of ADHD.This is a systematic review focused on the contribution of iron and zinc in the progression of ADHD among children and adolescents, and how therapies including these elements are tolerated along with its effectiveness (according to PRISMA guidelines).The scientific literature was screened for randomized controlled trials published between January 2000 to July 2021. The databases consulted were Medline, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. Two independent reviewers screened studies, extracted data, and assessed quality and risk of bias (CONSORT, NICE, and Cochrane checklists used).Nine studies met the eligibility criteria and were selected. Evidence was obtained regarding the contribution of iron-zinc supplementation in the treatment of ADHD among young individuals. The discussion was focused on how the deficits of these elements contribute to affectation on multiple ADHD correlates, and potential mechanisms explaining the mediational pathways. Evidence also suggested that treating ADHD with diet interventions might be particularly useful for specific subgroups of children and adolescents, but further investigations of the effects of these diet interventions are needed."

We suggest integrating psychiatry and medical biotechnology and using biotechnological products in psychiatric aspects help psychiatry become more precise, strengthen its position among other sciences, and increase its scientific credibility by giving examples. For this matter, we need different inputs to choose between the vast outputs. The most common inputs are clinical symptoms, cognitive function, individual and environmental risk factors, molecular markers, genetic markers, neuroimaging signs, and big data. Some molecular markers have been shown to have a relationship with psychiatric disorders such as Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and Tumor Necrosis Factor-α (TNF-α). Genetic studies might evolve the most accurate part of precision psychiatry. Currently, and through the developments in technology, genome-wide association studies have become available. In neuroimaging signs, psychiatric disorders are associated with generalized rather than focal brain network dysfunction, and functional magnetic resonance imaging could be performed to study them. It would exhibit different aberrancies in various psychiatric disorders.

A new network curvature-based method is introduced to provide an integrated measure of variability within cancer gene networks. The method is applied to high-grade serous ovarian cancers (HGSOCs) to predict response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and to rank key genes associated with prognosis. Copy number alterations (CNAs) from targeted and whole-exome sequencing data were extracted for HGSOC patients (n = 45) treated with ICIs. CNAs at a gene level were represented on a protein-protein interaction network to define patient-specific networks with a fixed topology. A version of Ollivier-Ricci curvature was used to identify genes that play a potentially key role in response to immunotherapy and further to stratify patients at high risk of mortality. Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time from the start of ICI treatment to either death or last follow-up. Kaplan-Meier analysis with log-rank test was performed to assess OS between the high and low curvature classified groups. The network curvature analysis stratified patients at high risk of mortality with p = 0.00047 in Kaplan-Meier analysis in HGSOC patients receiving ICI. Genes with high curvature were in accordance with CNAs relevant to ovarian cancer. Network curvature using CNAs has the potential to be a novel predictor for OS in HGSOC patients treated with immunotherapy.© 2021. The Author(s)."

To assess the effects of Ahr on intestinal epithelial cell heterogeneity and functional phenotypes, we utilized single-cell transcriptomics and advanced analytic strategies to generate a high-quality atlas for colonic intestinal crypts from wild-type and intestinal-specific Ahr knockout mice. Here we observed the promotive effects of Ahr deletion onFoxm1-regulated genes in crypt-associated canonical epithelial cell types and subtypes of goblet cells and deep crypt-secretory cells. We also show that intestinal Ahr deletion elevated single-cell entropy (a measure of differentiation potency or cell stemness) and RNA velocity length (a measure of the rate of cell differentiation) in noncycling and cyclingLgr5+stem cells. In general, intercellular signaling cross-talk via soluble and membrane-bound factors was perturbed in Ahr-null colonocytes. Taken together, our single-cell RNA sequencing analyses provide new evidence of the molecular function of Ahr in modulating putative stem cell driver genes, cell potency lineage decisions, and cell-cell communicationin vivo. PREVENTION RELEVANCE: Our mouse single-cell RNA sequencing analyses provide new evidence of the molecular function of Ahr in modulating colonic stemness and cell-cell communicationin vivo.

"34966911","Racism May Interrupt Age-related Brain Growth of African American Children in the United States.","J Pediatr Child Health Care","Considerable research has documented age-related growth in brain size as a marker of normal brain development. This is particularly important because brain volume has a significant role in overall cognitive performance. However, less research is done on whether age-related changes in the global brain volume differ across diverse racial and ethnic groups. We hypothesized that age-related growth in brain size would be disrupted in African American children who are historically affected by racism.Considering race as a proxy of racism rather than genetics, this study tested racial and ethnic differences in the effects of age on global brain volume using structural brain imaging data. Built on a sociological, rather than a biological theory, we built our study on Marginalization-related Diminished Returns (MDRs) framework, which argues that under racism, resources and assets are less effective for social groups that are historically racialized, discriminated against, marginalized, and segregated. Considering age as an asset/resource that increases the global brain volume, we expected weaker effects of age on overall brain size of African American and Hispanic children, than White and non-Hispanic children, again as a result of racism.We borrowed the structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (sMRI) data from the Children Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study, which included 9,311 9-10 year old children. The independent variable was the child's age treated as a continuous measure (in months). The primary outcome was global brain volume. Sex, parental employment, parental education, household income, and parental marital status were the covariates. Race and ethnicity, as proxies of racism, were the moderators. To analyze the data, we used linear regression models.Age was positively associated with the global brain size in children. In line with the MDRs, the positive association between age and global brain volume was weaker for African American than White children, while family structure, sex, and family socioeconomic status was controlled.Under racism, age has unequal effects on global brain size of diverse racial groups. In line with the MDRs, we observe diminished age-related growth of the brain for African American children, which documents detrimental effects of racism. For White children who are not affected by racism, age makes a large difference regarding global brain volume. Age-related growth of global brain size is diminished in African American children, whose daily lives are shaped by racism. School and residential segregation may have a role in reducing the effect of age on children's brain growth in African American families. The results should not be interpreted as inferiority of one group but social processes that hinder normal development of a historically oppressed group."

Many genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have reported that numerous genetic loci were significantly associated with PBC susceptibility. However, the effects of genetic determinants on liver cells and its immune microenvironment for PBC remain unclear.We constructed a powerful computational framework to integrate GWAS summary statistics with scRNA-seq data to uncover genetics-modulated liver cell subpopulations for PBC. Based on our multi-omics integrative analysis, 29 risk genes including ORMDL3, GSNK2B, and DDAH2 were significantly associated with PBC susceptibility. By combining GWAS summary statistics with scRNA-seq data, we found that cholangiocytes exhibited a notable enrichment by PBC-related genetic association signals (Permuted P < 0.05). The risk gene of ORMDL3 showed the highest expression proportion in cholangiocytes than other liver cells (22.38%). The ORMDL3+cholangiocytes have prominently higher metabolism activity score than ORMDL3-cholangiocytes (P = 1.38 × 10-15). Compared with ORMDL3-cholangiocytes, there were 77 significantly differentially expressed genes among ORMDL3+cholangiocytes (FDR < 0.05), and these significant genes were associated with autoimmune diseases-related functional terms or pathways. The ORMDL3+cholangiocytes exhibited relatively high communications with macrophage and monocyte. Compared with ORMDL3-cholangiocytes, the VEGF signaling pathway is specific for ORMDL3+cholangiocytes to interact with other cell populations.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to integrate genetic information with single cell sequencing data for parsing genetics-influenced liver cells for PBC risk. We identified that ORMDL3+cholangiocytes with higher metabolism activity play important immune-modulatory roles in the etiology of PBC.© 2021. The Author(s)."
"34983971","Molecular mechanisms of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance.","Nat Rev Genet","Increasing evidence indicates that non-DNA sequence-based epigenetic information can be inherited across several generations in organisms ranging from yeast to plants to humans. This raises the possibility of heritable 'epimutations' contributing to heritable phenotypic variation and thus to evolution. Recent work has shed light on both the signals that underpin these epimutations, including DNA methylation, histone modifications and non-coding RNAs, and the mechanisms by which they are transmitted across generations at the molecular level. These mechanisms can vary greatly among species and have a more limited effect in mammals than in plants and other animal species. Nevertheless, common principles are emerging, with transmission occurring either via direct replicative mechanisms or indirect reconstruction of the signal in subsequent generations. As these processes become clearer we continue to improve our understanding of the distinctive features and relative contribution of DNA sequence and epigenetic variation to heritable differences in phenotype.© 2022.

"34938605","Deciphering a TB-related DNA methylation biomarker and constructing a TB diagnostic classifier.","Mol Ther Nucleic Acids","We systemically identified tuberculosis (TB)-related DNA methylation biomarkers and further constructed classifiers for TB diagnosis. TB-related DNA methylation datasets were searched through October 3, 2020. Limma and DMRcate were employed to identify differentially methylated probes (DMPs) and regions (DMRs). Machine learning methods were used to construct classifiers. The performance of the classifiers was evaluated in discovery datasets and a prospective independent cohort. Eighty-nine DMPs and 24 DMRs were identified based on 67 TB patients and 45 healthy controls from 4 datasets. Nine and three DMRs were selected by elastic net regression and logistic regression, respectively. Among the selected DMRs, two regions (chr3: 195635643-195636243 and chr6: 29691631-29692475) were differentially methylated in the independent cohort (p = 4.19 × 10-5and 0.024, respectively). Among the ten classifiers, the 3-DMR logistic regression classifier exhibited the strongest performance. The sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve were, respectively, 79.1%, 84.4%, and 0.888 in the discovery datasets and 64.5%, 90.3%, and 0.838 in the independent cohort. The differential diagnostic ability of this classifier was also assessed. Collectively, these data showed that DNA methylation might be a promising TB diagnostic biomarker. The 3-DMR logistic regression classifier is a potential clinical tool for TB diagnosis, and further validation is needed.© 2021 The Authors."
"34893887","Structural basis of DNA methylation-dependent site selectivity of the Epstein-Barr virus lytic switch protein ZEBRA/Zta/BZLF1.","Nucleic Acids Res","In infected cells, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) alternates between latency and lytic replication. The viral bZIP transcription factor ZEBRA (Zta, BZLF1) regulates this cycle by binding to two classes of ZEBRA response elements (ZREs): CpG-free motifs resembling the consensus AP-1 site recognized by cellular bZIP proteins and CpG-containing motifs that are selectively bound by ZEBRA upon cytosine methylation. We report structural and mutational analysis of ZEBRA bound to a CpG-methylated ZRE (meZRE) from a viral lytic promoter. ZEBRA recognizes the CpG methylation marks through a ZEBRA-specific serine and a methylcytosine-arginine-guanine triad resembling that found in canonical methyl-CpG binding proteins. ZEBRA preferentially binds the meZRE over the AP-1 site but mutating the ZEBRA-specific serine to alanine inverts this selectivity and abrogates viral replication. Our findings elucidate a DNA methylation-dependent switch in ZEBRA's transactivation function that enables ZEBRA to bind AP-1 sites and promote viral latency early during infection and subsequently, under appropriate conditions, to trigger EBV lytic replication by binding meZREs.© The Author(s) 2021.

Using the largest ChIP-seq data and chromatin loops in the human K562 cell line, we initially interrogated TR cooperation in 3D chromatin via a graphical model and revealed many known and novel TRs manipulating context-specific pathways. To explore TR cooperation across broad tissue/cell types, we systematically leveraged large-scale open chromatin profiles, computational footprinting, and high-resolution chromatin interactions to investigate tissue/cell type-specific TR cooperation. We first delineated a landscape of TR cooperation across 40 human tissue/cell types. Network modularity analyses uncovered the commonality and specificity of TR cooperation in different conditions. We also demonstrated that TR cooperation information can better interpret the disease-causal variants identified by genome-wide association studies and recapitulate cell states during neural development. Our study characterizes shared and unique patterns of TR cooperation associated with the cell type specificity of gene regulation in 3D chromatin.© 2021 The Author(s)."

Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) was conducted for comparison of DNA methylation in tumor and adjacent tissues from 33 HCC patients, accompanying RNA-seq to determine differentially methylated region-associated, differentially expressed genes (DMR-DEGs), which were independently replicated in the TCGA-LIHC cohort and experimentally validatedvia5-aza-2-deoxycytidine (5-azadC) demethylation. A total of 9,867,700 CpG sites showed significantly differential methylation in HCC. Integrations of mRNA-seq, histone ChIP-seq, and WGBS data identified 611 high-confidence DMR-DEGs. Enrichment analysis demonstrated activation of multiple molecular pathways related to cell cycle and DNA repair, accompanying repression of several critical metabolism pathways such as tyrosine and monocarboxylic acid metabolism. In TCGA-LIHC, we replicated about 53% of identified DMR-DEGs and highlighted the prognostic significance of combinations of methylation and expression of nine DMR-DEGs, which were more efficient prognostic biomarkers than considering either type of data alone. Finally, we validated 22/23 (95.7%) DMR-DEGs in 5-azadC-treated LO2 and/or HepG2 cells. In conclusion, integration of epigenome and transcriptome data depicted activation of multiple pivotal cell cycle-related pathways and repression of several metabolic pathways triggered by aberrant DNA methylation of promoters and enhancers in HCC.Copyright © 2021 Huang, Xu, Han, Zhao, Li and Yang."

In the present work, we attempted to review the literature, on the relation between MYCN and neuroblastoma from all possible mechanistic sites. We have searched the literature for the role of MYCN in neuroblastoma based on the following topics: the references of MYCN in the literature, the gene's anatomy, along with its transcripts, the protein's anatomy, the epigenetic mechanisms regulating MYCN expression and function, as well as MYCN amplification.MYCNplays a significant role in neuroblastoma biology. Its functions and properties range from the forming of G-quadraplexes, to the interaction with miRNAs, as well as the regulation of gene methylation and histone acetylation and deacetylation. AlthoughMYCNis one of the most primary genes studied in neuroblastoma, there is still a lot to be learned.

"34831166","DNA Methylation and Immune Memory Response.","Cells","The generation of memory is a cardinal feature of the adaptive immune response, involving different factors in a complex process of cellular differentiation. This process is essential for protecting the second encounter with pathogens and is the mechanism by which vaccines work. Epigenetic changes play important roles in the regulation of cell differentiation events. There are three types of epigenetic regulation: DNA methylation, histone modification, and microRNA expression. One of these epigenetic changes, DNA methylation, occurs in cytosine residues, mainly in CpG dinucleotides. This brief review aimed to analyse the literature to verify the involvement of DNA methylation during memory T and B cell development. Several studies have highlighted the importance of the DNA methyltransferases, enzymes that catalyse the methylation of DNA, during memory differentiation, maintenance, and function. The methylation profile within different subsets of naïve activated and memory cells could be an interesting tool to help monitor immune memory response."

Although MD has been associated with several genes, no epigenetic studies have been performed on MD. Here we performed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing in 14 MD patients and six healthy controls, with the aim of identifying an MD methylation signature and potential disease mechanisms. We observed a high number of differentially methylated CpGs (DMC) when comparing MD patients to controls (n= 9545), several of them in hearing loss genes, such asPCDH15,&nbsp;ADGRV1andCDH23. Bioinformatic analyses of DMCs and cis-regulatory regions predicted phenotypes related to abnormal excitatory postsynaptic currents, abnormal NMDA-mediated receptor currents and abnormal glutamate-mediated receptor currents when comparing MD to controls. Moreover, we identified various DMCs in genes previously associated with cochleovestibular phenotypes in mice. We have also found 12 undermethylated regions (UMR) that were exclusive to MD, including two UMR in an inter CpG island in thePHBgene. We suggest that the DNA methylation signature allows distinguishing between MD patients and controls. The enrichment analysis confirms previous findings of a chronic inflammatory process underlying MD."
"34827720","Novel Methylation Biomarkers for Colorectal Cancer Prognosis.","Biomolecules","Colorectal cancer (CRC) comprises the third most common cancer worldwide and the second regarding number of deaths. In order to make a correct and early diagnosis to predict metastasis formation, biomarkers are an important tool. Although there are multiple signaling pathways associated with cancer progression, the most recognized are the MAPK pathway, p53 pathway, and TGF-β pathway. These pathways regulate many important functions in the cell, such as cell cycle regulation, proliferation, differentiation, and metastasis formation, among others. Changes in expression in genes belonging to these pathways are drivers of carcinogenesis. Often these expression changes are caused by mutations; however, epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation, are increasingly acknowledged to play a role in the deregulation of oncogenic genes. This makes DNA methylation changes an interesting biomarkers in cancer. Among the newly identified biomarkers for CRC metastasisINHBB,SMOC2,BDNF, andTBRG4are included, all of which are highly deregulated by methylation and closely associated with metastasis. The identification of such biomarkers in metastasis of CRC may allow a better treatment and early identification of cancer formation in order to perform better diagnostics and improve the life expectancy."

Previously, we uncovered that impaired integrity and stability of the elongator complex leads to GBC chemotherapy resistance, but whether its restoration can be an efficient therapeutic strategy for GBC remains unknown.RT-qPCR, MS-qPCR and ChIP-qPCR were used to evaluate the direct association between ELP5 transcription and DNA methylation in tumour and non-tumour tissues of GBC. EMSA, chromatin accessibility assays, and luciferase assays were utilized to analysis the DNA methylation in interfering PAX5-DNA interactions. The functional experiments in vitro and in vivo were performed to investigate the effects of DNA demethylating agent decitabine (DAC) on the transcription activation of elongator complex and the enhanced sensitivity of gemcitabine in GBC cells. Tissue microarray contains GBC tumour tissues was used to evaluate the association between the expression of ELP5, DNMT3A and PAX5.We demonstrated that transcriptional repression of ELP5 in GBC was highly correlated with hypermethylation of the promoter. Mechanistically, epigenetic analysis revealed that DNA methyltransferase DNMT3A-catalysed hypermethylation blocked transcription factor PAX5 activation of ELP5 by disrupting PAX5-DNA interaction, resulting in repressed ELP5 transcription. Pharmacologically, the DNA demethylating agent DAC eliminated the hypermethylated CpG dinucleotides in the ELP5 promoter and then facilitated PAX5 binding and reactivated ELP5 transcription, leading to the enhanced function of the elongator complex. To target this mechanism, we employed a sequential combination therapy of DAC and gemcitabine to sensitize GBC cells to gemcitabine-therapy through epigenetic activation of the elongator complex.Our findings suggest that ELP5 expression in GBC is controlled by DNA methylation-sensitive induction of PAX5. The sequential combination therapy of DAC and gemcitabine could be an efficient therapeutic strategy to overcome chemotherapy resistance in GBC.© 2021. The Author(s)."

The transcription factor (TF) C/EBPβ binds specifically to an essential half-CRE•C/EBP motif in the Il36a promoter to induce Il36a expression upon LPS stimulation. C/EBPs regulate gene expression by binding to recognition sequences that can contain 5'-cytosine-phosphate-guanine-3' dinucleotides (CpG), whose methylation can influence TF binding and gene expression. Herein we show that the half-CRE•C/EBP element in the Il36a promoter is differentially methylated in the murine RAW264.7 macrophage cell line and in primary murine macrophages. We demonstrate that C/EBPβ binding to the half-CRE•C/EBP element in the Il36a promoter following LPS stimulation is insensitive to CpG methylation and that methylation of the CpG in the half-CRE•C/EBP element does not alter LPS-induced Il36a promoter activity which correlated with similar Il36a mRNA copy numbers and pro-IL-36α protein amount in both cell types. Taken together, our data indicate that C/EBPβ binding to the half-CRE•C/EBP element and subsequent gene activation occurs independently of the CpG methylation status of the half-CRE•C/EBP motif and underlines the potential of C/EBPs to recognize methylated as well as unmethylated motifs.© 2021.

"34970134","Cell-Type-Specific Adaptions in Striatal Medium-Sized Spiny Neurons and Their Roles in Behavioral Responses to Drugs of Abuse.","Front Synaptic Neurosci","Drug addiction is defined as a compulsive pattern of drug-seeking- and taking- behavior, with recurrent episodes of abstinence and relapse, and a loss of control despite negative consequences. Addictive drugs promote reinforcement by increasing dopamine in the mesocorticolimbic system, which alters excitatory glutamate transmission within the reward circuitry, thereby hijacking reward processing. Within the reward circuitry, the striatum is a key target structure of drugs of abuse since it is at the crossroad of converging glutamate inputs from limbic, thalamic and cortical regions, encoding components of drug-associated stimuli and environment, and dopamine that mediates reward prediction error and incentive values. These signals are integrated by medium-sized spiny neurons (MSN), which receive glutamate and dopamine axons converging onto their dendritic spines. MSN primarily form two mostly distinct populations based on the expression of either DA-D1 (D1R) or DA-D2 (D2R) receptors. While a classical view is that the two MSN populations act in parallel, playing antagonistic functional roles, the picture seems much more complex. Herein, we review recent studies, based on the use of cell-type-specific manipulations, demonstrating that dopamine differentially modulates dendritic spine density and synapse formation, as well as glutamate transmission, at specific inputs projecting onto D1R-MSN and D2R-MSN to shape persistent pathological behavioral in response to drugs of abuse. We also discuss the identification of distinct molecular events underlying the detrimental interplay between dopamine and glutamate signaling in D1R-MSN and D2R-MSN and highlight the relevance of such cell-type-specific molecular studies for the development of innovative strategies with potential therapeutic value for addiction. Because drug addiction is highly prevalent in patients with other psychiatric disorders when compared to the general population, we last discuss the hypothesis that shared cellular and molecular adaptations within common circuits could explain the co-occurrence of addiction and depression. We will therefore conclude this review by examining how the nucleus accumbens (NAc) could constitute a key interface between addiction and depression.Copyright © 2021 Allichon, Ortiz, Pousinha, Andrianarivelo, Petitbon, Heck, Trifilieff, Barik and Vanhoutte."

Antipsychotic drugs have proven to lower the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and a growing number of studies indicate a similar effect on NLR values.We identified inpatients with schizophrenia and collected data of NLR at the beginning (NLR1) and end (NLR2) of hospitalization, the status of antipsychotic medication on admission and potential confounding factors. In the statistical analysis, we applied a linear mixed model.After the inclusion and exclusion process the records of 40 patients (np= 40) and 71 hospitalizations (nh= 71) were analyzed. We found that in the group of antipsychotics-naive patients, the NLR1were significantly higher than the NLR2values. Such a difference did not occur in the case of non-antipsychotics-naïve patients. Age and the diagnosis of hypothyroidism influenced the value of change in NLR from the beginning to the end of hospitalization in a given patient (ΔNLR).The study confirmed the lowering effect of antipsychotics on NLR values in psychosis. The NLR may potentially be a tool for assessing response to treatment with antipsychotics."

It has been proven to play a role in various states of inflammation or hypoxia of fetal gastrointestinal and pulmonary diseases. Discrimination of pathogenesis in necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) based on cardiac status improves the understanding of NEC in different patient subgroups. We aimed at examining DMBT1 expressions regarding their association with cardiac status leading to impaired intestinal perfusion, intraoperative bacteria proof, and a fulminant course of NEC.Twenty-eight patients with NEC were treated surgically between 2010 and 2019 at our institution. DMBT1 expression was examined in intestinal sections using immunohistochemistry to detect DMBT1 protein. Associations of clinical parameters and DMBT1 expression were analyzed.We examined DMBT1 levels in 10 patients without cardiac defects and 18 patients with persisting ductus arteriosus (PDA) and congenital heart defects (CHD). Compared to patients without cardiac malformations, DMBT1 levels tended to score higher in patients with PDA/CHD (p = 0.2113) and were negatively correlated with C-reactive protein in these infants (p = 0.0172; r = - 0.5533). The number of DMBT1-expressing macrophages was elevated in the PDA/CHD-subgroup (p = 0.0399). Ratios of neutrophils and monocytes to lymphocytes were significantly higher in infants with PDA/CHD (p = 0.0319 and 0.0493). DMBT1 expression was significantly associated with positive bacterial culture of intraoperative swabs (p = 0.0252) and DMBT1 expression of the serosa was associated with a fulminant course of NEC (p = 0.0239).This study demonstrates that DMBT1 expression may be influenced by cardiac anomalies with an impaired intestinal perfusion in the neonatal intestine. NEC in PDA/CHD infants is associated with more DMBT1-positive macrophages and a significantly elevated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio.© 2022. The Author(s)."

In a nested, matched case-control study, we estimated methylation-derived NLR (mdNLR) and quantified DNA methylation levels at loci previously linked with circulating concentrations of C-reactive protein (CRP). We examined associations between these measures and lung cancer risk and survival.Using conditional logistic regression and further adjusting for BMI, batch effects, and a smoking-based methylation score, we observed a 47% increased risk of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) for one standard deviation (SD) increase in mdNLR (n = 150 pairs; OR: 1.47, 95% CI 1.08, 2.02). Using a similar model, the estimated CRP Scores were inversely associated with risk of NSCLC (e.g., Score 1 OR: 0.57, 95% CI: 0.40, 0.81). Using Cox proportional hazards models adjusting for age, sex, smoking status, methylation-predicted pack-years, BMI, batch effect, and stage, we observed a 28% increased risk of dying from lung cancer (n = 145 deaths in 205 cases; HR: 1.28, 95% CI: 1.09, 1.50) for one SD increase in mdNLR.Our study demonstrates that immunity status measured with DNA methylation markers is associated with lung cancer a decade or more prior to cancer diagnosis.

In the present research, we investigated the relative telomere length in umbilical cord blood of newborns born to opioid consuming mothers compared to normal controls. Telomere length shortening is a known biomarker of aging and aging related diseases. Its measure at birth or early in life is considered as a predictor of individual health in adulthood. Here, we performed a case-control study to investigate whether maternal opioid use affects newborns relative telomere length (RTL). 57 mother-newborn dyads were included in this study, 30 neonates with opioid using mothers (OM), and 27 with not-opioid using mothers (NOM)). RTL was measured in leukocyte cells genomic DNA using real-time PCR. The correlation of maternal opioid use with neonates telomer length was assessed using logistic regression analysis. The results displayed a significant association between odds ratio of long RTL and maternal opioid use when sensitivity analysis was performed by neonate sex; where the data indicates significantly increased odds ratio of long leukocyte RTL in association with maternal opioid use in male neonates only. Further work is necessary to assess this association in larger samples and test the potential underlying mechanisms for this observation."

In this study, we analyzed DNA methylation variation in marbled crayfish, a clonal and invasive freshwater crayfish that is characterized by a largely tissue-invariant methylome and negligible genetic variation. Using a capture-based subgenome bisulfite sequencing approach that covers a small, variably methylated portion of the marbled crayfish genome, we identified specific and highly localized DNA methylation signatures for specimens from geographically and ecologically distinct wild populations. These results were replicated both biologically and technically by re-sampling at different time points and by using independent methodology. Finally, we show specific methylation signatures for laboratory animals and for laboratory animals that were reared at a lower temperature.

We plotted the landscape of DNA damage repair (DDR)-related genes and identified SMC4 as an independent prognostic marker with integrated bioinformatics analysis, which is overexpressed in different histologic subtypes of glioma. We observed that SMC4 expression is elevated in recurrent LGG patients or those with advanced histologic staging. SMC4 depletion inhibits proliferation and induces increased replication damage in LGG cells. Lastly, we predicted and validated the transcription modulation of SMC4 by a transcription factor, MYB, at the -976bp~ -837bp of the SMC4 promoter region in LGG cells. Together, our study identified SMC4 as a potential prognostic biomarker for LGG patients, which functions to promote cell proliferation by repairing replication damage and the expression of SMC4 could be transcriptionally regulated by MYB.Copyright © 2021 Wang and Wu."
"34845331","Trans-tail regulation-mediated suppression of cryptic transcription.","Exp Mol Med","Crosstalk between post-translational modifications of histone proteins influences the regulation of chromatin structure and gene expression. Among such crosstalk pathways, the best-characterized example is H2B monoubiquitination-mediated H3K4 and H3K79 methylation, which is referred to as trans-tail regulation. Although many studies have investigated the fragmentary effects of this pathway on silencing and transcription, its ultimate contribution to transcriptional control has remained unclear. Recent advances in molecular techniques and genomics have, however, revealed that the trans-tail crosstalk is linked to a more diverse cascade of histone modifications and has various functions in cotranscriptional processes. Furthermore, H2B monoubiquitination sequentially facilitates H3K4 dimethylation and histone sumoylation, thereby providing a binding platform for recruiting Set3 complex proteins, including two histone deacetylases, to restrict cryptic transcription from gene bodies. The removal of both ubiquitin and SUMO, small ubiquitin-like modifier, modifications from histones also facilitates a change in the phosphorylation pattern of the RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain that is required for subsequent transcriptional elongation. Therefore, this review describes recent findings regarding trans-tail regulation-driven processes to elaborate on their contribution to maintaining transcriptional fidelity.© 2021. The Author(s)."
"34830785","Head and Neck Cancers Are Not Alike When Tarred with the Same Brush: An Epigenetic Perspective from the Cancerization Field to Prognosis.","Cancers (Basel)","Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) are among the ten most frequent types of cancer worldwide and, despite all efforts, are still diagnosed at late stages and show poor overall survival. Furthermore, HNSCC patients often experience relapses and the development of second primary tumors, as a consequence of the field cancerization process. Therefore, a better comprehension of the molecular mechanisms involved in HNSCC development and progression may enable diagnosis anticipation and provide valuable tools for prediction of prognosis and response to therapy. However, the different biological behavior of these tumors depending on the affected anatomical site and risk factor exposure, as well as the high genetic heterogeneity observed in HNSCC are major obstacles in this pursue. In this context, epigenetic alterations have been shown to be common in HNSCC, to discriminate the tumor anatomical subsites, to be responsive to risk factor exposure, and show promising results in biomarker development. Based on this, this review brings together the current knowledge on alterations of DNA methylation and microRNA expression in HNSCC natural history, focusing on how they contribute to each step of the process and on their applicability as biomarkers of exposure, HNSCC development, progression, and response to therapy."
"35024304","Environmental toxicant-induced maladaptive mitochondrial changes: A potential unifying mechanism in fatty liver disease?","Acta Pharm Sin B","Occupational and environmental exposures to industrial chemicals are well known to cause hepatotoxicity and liver injury. However, despite extensive evidence showing that exposure can lead to disease, current research approaches and regulatory policies fail to address the possibility that subtle changes caused by low level exposure to chemicals may also enhance preexisting conditions. In recent years, the conceptual understanding of the contribution of environmental chemicals to liver disease has progressed significantly. Mitochondria are often target of toxicity of environmental toxicants resulting in multisystem disorders involving different cells, tissues, and organs. Here, we review persistent maladaptive changes to mitochondria in response to environmental toxicant exposure as a mechanism of hepatotoxicity. With better understanding of the mechanism(s) and risk factors that mediate the initiation and progression of toxicant-induced liver disease, rational targeted therapy can be developed to better predict risk, as well as to treat or prevent this disease.© 2021 Chinese Pharmaceutical Association and Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.

This study sought to advance our understanding on the association of plasma PLP with risk of CHD, with particular attention paid to sex differences and effect modifiers.Methods:We conducted a hospital-based, case-control study on suspected CHD patients undergoing diagnostic coronary angiography. A total of 429 CHD cases and 429 controls matched by age, sex, and operation time were included in the final analysis. Plasma PLP was assessed using LC-MS. Logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate the association between plasma PLP and a first CHD event.Results:The mean (SD) plasma PLP levels were 8.4 (6.3) in male cases and 9.0 (11.0) in female cases, and 9.5 (8.5) in male controls and 12.5 (12.9) in female controls. Each 1 ng/mL increment in log2PLP was associated with a 28% lower risk of CHD in overall population. When stratified by sex, plasma PLP was significantly and independently associated with CHD in women (OR = 0.63, 95% CI: 0.50-0.80), but not in men (OR = 0.86, 95% CI: 0.67-1.09). The association of plasma PLP with CHD risk was modified by sex (adjustedPinteraction= 0.022).Conclusions:We found a significant, inverse linear association between plasma PLP and CHD in Chinese women, but not in men.

"34948498","Direct and Indirect Effects of Indoor Particulate Matter on Blood Indicators Related to Anemia.","Int J Environ Res Public Health","Exposure to indoor particulate matter (PM) is a potential risk factor that increases systemic inflammation and affects erythropoiesis. This study investigated the association between exposure to indoor PM and blood indicators related to anemia (BIRA) in housewives. Indoor PM and blood folate status are important factors in the risk of anemia. This was a housewife cohort study; we recruited 284 housewives in Seoul and Ulsan, Republic of Korea. Indoor exposure to PM2.5 and PM10 was measured by gravimetric analysis and sensors. We investigated the BIRA, such as hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular Hb (MCH), and mean corpuscular Hb concentration (MCHC). Statistical analysis was performed by multiple linear regression model and mediation analysis. The association between BIRA and PM was assessed by multiple linear regression models fitted by mediation analyses. The increase in the level of indoor PM2.5 was associated with a decrease in MCV (Beta coefficient (B): -0.069, Standard error (SE): 0.022) and MCH (B: -0.019, SE: 0.009) in gravimetric measurements. The increase in the level of indoor PM2.5 was associated with a decrease in Hb (B: -0.024, SE: 0.011), hematocrit (B: -0.059, SE: 0.033), and MCV (B: -0.081, SE: 0.037) and MCH (B: -0.037, SE: 0.012) in sensor measurements (PM2.5-Lag10). Further, we identified a serum folate-mediated PM effect. The indoor PM exposure was significantly associated with decreased Hb, MCV, and MCH in housewives. Taken together, our data show that exposure to indoor PM is a risk factor for anemia in housewives. Blood folate concentration can be a mediating factor in the effect of indoor PM on BIRA. Therefore, folate intake should be recommended to prevent anemia in housewives. Moreover, indoor PM exposure should be managed."
"34855899","Association of air pollution and homocysteine with global DNA methylation: A population-based study from North India.","PLoS One","Anthropogenic air pollution has been implicated in aberrant changes of DNA methylation and homocysteine increase (>15μM/L). Folate (<3 ng/mL) and vitamin B12 (<220 pg/mL) deficiencies also reduce global DNA methylation via homocysteine increase. Although B-vitamin supplements can attenuate epigenetic effects of air pollution but such understanding in population-specific studies are lacking. Hence, the present study aims to understand the role of air pollution, homocysteine, and nutritional deficiencies on methylation.We examined cross-sectionally, homocysteine, folate, vitamin B12 (chemiluminescence) and global DNA methylation (colorimetric ELISA Assay) among 274 and 270 individuals from low- and high- polluted areas, respectively, from a single Mendelian population. Global DNA methylation results were obtained on 254 and 258 samples from low- and high- polluted areas, respectively.Significant decline in median global DNA methylation was seen as a result of air pollution [high-0.84 (0.37-1.97) vs. low-0.96 (0.45-2.75), p = 0.01]. High homocysteine in combination with air pollution significantly reduced global DNA methylation [high-0.71 (0.34-1.90) vs. low-0.93 (0.45-3.00), p = 0.003]. Folate deficient individuals in high polluted areas [high-0.70 (0.37-1.29) vs. low-1.21 (0.45-3.65)] showed significantly reduced global methylation levels (p = 0.007). In low polluted areas, despite folate deficiency, if normal vitamin B12 levels were maintained, global DNA methylation levels improved significantly [2.03 (0.60-5.24), p = 0.007]. Conversely, in high polluted areas despite vitamin B12 deficiency, if normal folate status was maintained, global DNA methylation status improved significantly [0.91 (0.36-1.63)] compared to vitamin B12 normal individuals [0.54 (0.26-1.13), p = 0.04].High homocysteine may aggravate the effects of air pollution on DNA methylation. Vitamin B12 in low-polluted and folate in high-polluted areas may be strong determinants for changes in DNA methylation levels. The effect of air pollution on methylation levels may be reduced through inclusion of dietary or supplemented B-vitamins. This may serve as public level approach in natural settings to prevent metabolic adversities at community level."
"35004665","DNA Methylation Data-Based Classification and Identification of Prognostic Signature of Children With Wilms Tumor.","Front Cell Dev Biol","Background:As an epigenetic alteration, DNA methylation plays an important role in early Wilms tumorigenesis and is possibly used as marker to improve the diagnosis and classification of tumor heterogeneity.Methods:Methylation data, RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data, and corresponding clinical information were downloaded from the Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET) database. The prognostic values of DNA methylation subtypes in Wilms tumor were identified.Results:Four prognostic subtypes of Wilms tumor patients were identified by consensus cluster analysis performed on 312 independent prognostic CpG sites. Cluster one showed the best prognosis, whereas Cluster two represented the worst prognosis. Unique CpG sites identified in Cluster one that were not identified in other subtypes were assessed to construct a prognostic signature. The prognostic methylation risk score was closely related to prognosis, and the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.802. Furthermore, the risk score based on prognostic signature was identified as an independent prognostic factor for Wilms tumor in univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. Finally, the abundance of B cell infiltration was higher in the low-risk group than in the high-risk group, based on the methylation data.Conclusion:Collectively, we divided Wilms tumor cases into four prognostic subtypes, which could efficiently identify high-risk Wilms tumor patients. Prognostic methylation risk scores that were significantly associated with the adverse clinical outcomes were established, and this prognostic signature was able to predict the prognosis of Wilms tumor in children, which may be useful in guiding clinicians in therapeutic decision-making. Further independent studies are needed to validate and advance this hypothesis.Copyright © 2021 Tang, Lu, Lei, Lai, Lu, Li, Tang, Zhang and He."

Gene expression profiling in blood represents a powerful means to explore disease pathogenesis, but the potential impact of inter-individual differences in a cell-type profile is not always taken into account. The objective of this project was to investigate the whole blood transcriptome profile of insulin-resistant as compared to insulin-sensitive individuals independent of inter-individual differences in white blood cell profile.We report a 3% higher relative amount of monocytes in the insulin-resistant individuals. Furthermore, independent of their white blood cell profile, insulin-resistant participants had (i) higher expression of interferon-stimulated genes and (ii) lower expression of genes involved in cellular differentiation and remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton.We present an approach to investigate the whole blood transcriptome of insulin-resistant individuals, independent of their DNA methylation-derived white blood cell profile. An interferon-related signature characterizes the whole blood transcriptome profile of the insulin-resistant individuals, independent of their white blood cell profile. The observed signature indicates increased systemic inflammation possibly due to an innate immune response and whole-body insulin resistance, which can be a cause or a consequence of insulin resistance. Altered gene expression in specific organs may be reflected in whole blood; hence, our results may reflect obesity and/or insulin resistance-related organ dysfunction in the insulin-resistant individuals.© 2021.

"34880407","Inference of tissue relative proportions of the breast epithelial cell types luminal progenitor, basal, and luminal mature.","Sci Rep","Single-cell analysis has revolutionised genomic science in recent years. However, due to cost and other practical considerations, single-cell analyses are impossible for studies based on medium or large patient cohorts. For example, a single-cell analysis usually costs thousands of euros for one tissue sample from one volunteer, meaning that typical studies using single-cell analyses are based on very few individuals. While single-cell genomic data can be used to examine the phenotype of individual cells, cell-type deconvolution methods are required to track the quantities of these cells in bulk-tissue genomic data. Hormone receptor negative breast cancers are highly aggressive, and are thought to originate from a subtype of epithelial cells called the luminal progenitor. In this paper, we show how to quantify the number of luminal progenitor cells as well as other epithelial subtypes in breast tissue samples using DNA and RNA based measurements. We find elevated levels of cells which resemble these hormone receptor negative luminal progenitor cells in breast tumour biopsies of hormone receptor negative cancers, as well as in healthy breast tissue samples from BRCA1 (FANCS) mutation carriers. We also find that breast tumours from carriers of heterozygous mutations in non-BRCA Fanconi Anaemia pathway genes are much more likely to be hormone receptor negative. These findings have implications for understanding hormone receptor negative breast cancers, and for breast cancer screening in carriers of heterozygous mutations of Fanconi Anaemia pathway genes.© 2021.

This study describes the DNA methylation profile of HIV-infected individuals with distinct characteristics related to natural and artificial viremia control. Sheared DNA from circulating mononuclear cells was subjected to target enrichment bisulfite sequencing designed to cover CpG-rich genomic regions. Gene expression was assessed through RNA-seq. Hypermethylation in virologic responders was highly distributed closer to Transcription Start Sites (p-value = 0.03). Hyper and hypomethylation levels within TSS adjacencies varied according to disease progression status (Kruskal-Wallis, p < 0.001), and specific differentially methylated regions associated genes were identified for each group. The lower the promoter methylation, the higher the gene expression in subjects undergoing virologic failure (R = - 0.82, p = 0.00068). Among the inversely correlated genes, those supporting glycolysis and its related pathways were hypomethylated and up-regulated in virologic failures. Disease progression heterogeneity was associated with distinct DNA methylation patterns in terms of rates and distribution. Methylation was associated with the expression of genes sustaining intracellular glucose metabolism in subjects undergoing antiretroviral virologic failure. Our findings highlight that DNA methylation is associated with latency, disease progression, and fundamental cellular processes.© 2021. The Author(s)."

We identify 11,165,559 SNP-CpG associations (methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTL), P < 10-14), including 467,915 meQTL that operate in trans. The meQTL are enriched for functionally relevant characteristics, including shared chromatin state, High-throuhgput chromosome conformation interaction, and association with gene expression, metabolic variation and clinical traits. We use molecular interaction and colocalization analyses to identify multiple nuclear regulatory pathways linking meQTL loci to phenotypic variation, including UBASH3B (body mass index), NFKBIE (rheumatoid arthritis), MGA (blood pressure) and COMMD7 (white cell counts). For rs6511961 , chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) validates zinc finger protein (ZNF)333 as the likely trans acting effector protein. Finally, we used interaction analyses to identify population- and lineage-specific meQTL, including rs174548 in FADS1, with the strongest effect in CD8+T cells, thus linking fatty acid metabolism with immune dysregulation and asthma.

"34880450","Methylome-wide association study of antidepressant use in Generation Scotland and the Netherlands Twin Register implicates the innate immune system.","Mol Psychiatry","Antidepressants are an effective treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD), although individual response is unpredictable and highly variable. Whilst the mode of action of antidepressants is incompletely understood, many medications are associated with changes in DNA methylation in genes that are plausibly linked to their mechanisms. Studies of DNA methylation may therefore reveal the biological processes underpinning the efficacy and side effects of antidepressants. We performed a methylome-wide association study (MWAS) of self-reported antidepressant use accounting for lifestyle factors and MDD in Generation Scotland (GS:SFHS, N = 6428, EPIC array) and the Netherlands Twin Register (NTR, N = 2449, 450 K array) and ran a meta-analysis of antidepressant use across these two cohorts. We found ten CpG sites significantly associated with self-reported antidepressant use in GS:SFHS, with the top CpG located within a gene previously associated with mental health disorders, ATP6V1B2 (β = -0.055, pcorrected = 0.005). Other top loci were annotated to genes including CASP10, TMBIM1, MAPKAPK3, and HEBP2, which have previously been implicated in the innate immune response. Next, using penalised regression, we trained a methylation-based score of self-reported antidepressant use in a subset of 3799 GS:SFHS individuals that predicted antidepressant use in a second subset of GS:SFHS (N = 3360, β = 0.377, p = 3.12 × 10-11, R2 = 2.12%). In an MWAS analysis of prescribed selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, we showed convergent findings with those based on self-report. In NTR, we did not find any CpGs significantly associated with antidepressant use. The meta-analysis identified the two CpGs of the ten above that were common to the two arrays used as being significantly associated with antidepressant use, although the effect was in the opposite direction for one of them. Antidepressants were associated with epigenetic alterations in loci previously associated with mental health disorders and the innate immune system. These changes predicted self-reported antidepressant use in a subset of GS:SFHS and identified processes that may be relevant to our mechanistic understanding of clinically relevant antidepressant drug actions and side effects.© 2021.

Few studies have investigated epigenetic associations with CMD risk factors in children from low- and middle-income countries. We sought to identify associations between DNA methylation (DNAm) and CMD risk factors in children from India and The Gambia.Using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation 850 K Beadchip array, we interrogated DNAm in 293 Gambian (7-9 years) and 698 Indian (5-7 years) children. We identified differentially methylated CpGs (dmCpGs) associated with systolic blood pressure, fasting insulin, triglycerides and LDL-Cholesterol in the Gambian children; and with insulin sensitivity, insulinogenic index and HDL-Cholesterol in the Indian children. There was no overlap of the dmCpGs between the cohorts. Meta-analysis identified dmCpGs associated with insulin secretion and pulse pressure that were different from cohort-specific dmCpGs. Several differentially methylated regions were associated with diastolic blood pressure, insulin sensitivity and fasting glucose, but these did not overlap with the dmCpGs. We identified significant cis-methQTLs at three LDL-Cholesterol-associated dmCpGs in Gambians; however, methylation did not mediate genotype effects on the CMD outcomes.This study identified cardiometabolic biomarkers associated with differential DNAm in Indian and Gambian children.

"34937574","Associations between DNA methylation and BMI vary by metabolic health status: a potential link to disparate cardiovascular outcomes.","Clin Epigenetics","Body mass index (BMI), a well-known risk factor for poor cardiovascular outcomes, is associated with differential DNA methylation (DNAm). Similarly, metabolic health has also been associated with changes in DNAm. It is unclear how overall metabolic health outside of BMI may modify the relationship between BMI and methylation profiles, and what consequences this may have on downstream cardiovascular disease. The purpose of this study was to identify cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites at which the association between BMI and DNAm could be modified by overall metabolic health.The discovery study population was derived from three Women's Health Initiative (WHI) ancillary studies (n = 3977) and two Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) ancillary studies (n = 3520). Findings were validated in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) cohort (n = 1200). Generalized linear models regressed methylation β values on the interaction between BMI and metabolic health Z score (BMI × MHZ) adjusted for BMI, MHZ, cell composition, chip number and location, study characteristics, top three ancestry principal components, smoking, age, ethnicity (WHI), and sex (ARIC). Among the 429,566 sites examined, differential associations between BMI × MHZ and DNAm were identified at 22 CpG sites (FDR q < 0.05), with one site replicated in MESA (cg18989722, in the TRAPPC9 gene). Three of the 22 sites were associated with incident coronary heart disease (CHD) in WHI. For each 0.01 unit increase in DNAm β value, the risk of incident CHD increased by 9% in one site and decreased by 6-10% in two sites over 25 years.Differential associations between DNAm and BMI by MHZ were identified at 22 sites, one of which was validated (cg18989722) and three of which were predictive of incident CHD. These sites are located in several genes related to NF-kappa-B signaling, suggesting a potential role for inflammation between DNA methylation and BMI-associated metabolic health.© 2021.

"34935119","Genomics and Functional Genomics of Alzheimer's Disease.","Neurotherapeutics","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex and multifactorial neurodegenerative disease. Due to its long clinical course and lack of an effective treatment, AD has become a major public health problem in the USA and worldwide. Due to variation in age-at-onset, AD is classified into early-onset (< 60 years) and late-onset (≥ 60 years) forms with early-onset accounting for only 5-10% of all cases. With the exception of a small number of early-onset cases that are afflicted because of high penetrant single gene mutations in APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 genes, AD is genetically heterogeneous, especially the late-onset form having a polygenic or oligogenic risk inheritance. Since the identification of APOE as the most significant risk factor for late-onset AD in 1993, the path to the discovery of additional AD risk genes had been arduous until 2009 when the use of large genome-wide association studies opened up the discovery gateways that led the identification of ~ 95 additional risk loci from 2009 to early 2022. This article reviews the history of AD genetics followed by the potential molecular pathways and recent application of functional genomics methods to identify the causal AD gene(s) among the many genes that reside within a single locus. The ultimate goal of integrating genomics and functional genomics is to discover novel pathways underlying the AD pathobiology in order to identify drug targets for the therapeutic treatment of this heterogeneous disorder.© 2021.

"34831437","The NOTCH3 Downstream Target HEYL Is Required for Efficient Human Airway Basal Cell Differentiation.","Cells","Basal cells (BCs) are stem/progenitor cells of the mucociliary airway epithelium, and their differentiation is orchestrated by the NOTCH signaling pathway. NOTCH3 receptor signaling regulates BC to club cell differentiation; however, the downstream responses that regulate this process are unknown. Overexpression of the active NOTCH3 intracellular domain (NICD3) in primary human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) on in vitro air-liquid interface culture promoted club cell differentiation. Bulk RNA-seq analysis identified 692 NICD3-responsive genes, including the classical NOTCH target HEYL, which increased in response to NICD3 and positively correlated with SCGB1A1 (club cell marker) expression. siRNA knockdown of HEYL decreased tight junction formation and cell proliferation. Further, HEYL knockdown reduced club, goblet and ciliated cell differentiation. In addition, we observed decreased expression of HEYL in HBECs from donors with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) vs. normal donors which correlates with the impaired differentiation capacity of COPD cells. Finally, overexpression of HEYL in COPD HBECs promoted differentiation into club, goblet and ciliated cells, suggesting the impaired capacity of COPD cells to generate a normal airway epithelium is a reversible phenotype that can be regulated by HEYL. Overall, our data identify the NOTCH3 downstream target HEYL as a key regulator of airway epithelial differentiation."

The differentially expressed lncRNAs were detected by RNA-seq technology (Gene Expression Omnibus, GEO GSE186450) and the aberrantly expressed lncRNAs were further verified by RT-qPCR. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses were conducted to predicate the related candidate genes and potential pathological pathways. Cells from a human corneal epithelial cell line (HCECs) were cultured under hyperosmolarity. The regulation of inflammatory factors by silencing potential targeted lncRNAs was verifiedin vitroin HCECs.Results:In our study, a significant increase in corneal fluorescence staining and a reduction in tear production were observed in DED mice at all follow-ups compared with the controls, and the differences were increasing over time. In total, 2,649 upregulated and 704 downregulated lncRNAs were identified in DED mice. We selected six aberrantly expressed and most abundant lncRNAs and performed RT-qPCR using the samples for RNA-seq. Chrnb2, Gabarapl2, and Usp31 were thereby confirmed as the most significantly altered lncRNAs. Pathway analysis revealed that the neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction signaling pathway was the most enriched, followed by the calcium signaling pathway and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction. Following treatment of Gabarapl2 siRNA and Chrnb2 siRNA, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-6 were significantly downregulated in the HCECs.Conclusion:Our study suggests that Chrnb2 and Gabarapl2 may be involved in the inflammation response by regulating TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 in DED. These candidate lncRNAs may be both potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for DED.Copyright © 2021 Yang, Chen, Zhai, Dai, Gu, Zhou and Hong."
"35035976","Early life, life course and gender influences on levels of C-reactive protein among migrant Bangladeshis in the UK.","Evol Med Public Health","Humans co-evolved with pathogens, especially helminths, that educate the immune system during development and lower inflammatory responses. The absence of such stimuli in industrialized countries is associated with higher baseline levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) among adults who appear at greater risk for inflammatory disorders. This cross-sectional study examined effects of early life development on salivary CRP levels in 452 British-Bangladeshis who spent varying periods growing up in Bangladesh or UK. We also analyzed how gender and central obesity modulate effects on CRP. We hypothesized that: (i) first-generation Bangladeshis with higher childhood exposure to pathogens would have chronically lower CRP levels than second-generation British-Bangladeshis; (ii) effects would be greater with early childhoods in Bangladesh; (iii) effects by gender would differ; and (iv) increasing obesity would mitigate early life effects.Saliva samples were assayed for CRP using ELISAs, and anthropometric data collected. Participants completed questionnaires about demographic, socioeconomic, lifestyle and health histories. Data were analyzed using multiple linear regression.First-generation migrants who spent early childhoods in mostly rural, unhygienic areas, and moved to UK after age 8, had lower salivary CRP compared to the second-generation. Effects differed by gender, while waist circumference predicted higher CRP levels. CRP increased with years in UK, alongside growing obesity.Our study supports the hypothesis that pathogen exposure in early life lowers inflammatory responses in adults. However, protective effects differed by gender and can be eroded by growing obesity across the life course which elevates risks for other inflammatory disorders.Lay Summary:Migrants to the UK who spent early childhoods in less hygienic environments in Bangladesh that help to educate their immune systems had lower levels of the inflammatory marker, C-reactive protein (CRP) compared to migrants who grew up in UK. Both gender and increasing obesity were associated with increased levels of CRP.© The Author(s) 2021.

"34906209","Quantitative assessment of the immune microenvironment in African American Triple Negative Breast Cancer: a case-control study.","Breast Cancer Res","Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is more common in African American (AA) than Non-AA (NAA) population. We hypothesize that tumor microenvironment (TME) contributes to this disparity. Here, we use multiplex quantitative immunofluorescence to characterize the expression of immunologic biomarkers in the TME in both populations.TNBC tumor resection specimen tissues from a 100-patient case: control cohort including 49 AA and 51 NAA were collected. TME markers including CD45, CD14, CD68, CD206, CD4, CD8, CD20, CD3, Ki67, GzB, Thy1, FAP, aSMA, CD34, Col4, VWF and PD-L1 we quantitatively assessed in every field of view. Mean expression levels were compared between cases and controls.Although no significant differences were detected in individual lymphoid and myeloid markers, we found that infiltration with CD45+immune cells (p = 0.0102) was higher in TNBC in AA population. AA TNBC tumors also had significantly higher level of lymphocytic infiltration defined as CD45+CD14-cells (p = 0.0081). CD3+T-cells in AA tumors expressed significantly higher levels of Ki67 (0.0066) compared to NAAs, indicating that a higher percentage of AA tumors contained activated T-cells. All other biomarkers showed no significant differences between the AA and NAA group.While the TME in TNBC is rich in immune cells in both racial groups, there is a numerical increase in lymphoid infiltration in AA compared to NAA TNBC. Significantly, higher activated T cells seen in AA patients raises the possibility that there may be a subset of AA patients with improved response to immunotherapy.© 2021. The Author(s)."
"34869683","Adiponectin Related Vascular and Cardiac Benefits in Obesity: Is There a Role for an Epigenetically Regulated Mechanism?","Front Cardiovasc Med","In obesity, several epigenetic modifications, including histones remodeling, DNA methylation, and microRNAs, could accumulate and determine increased expression of inflammatory molecules, the adipokines, that in turn might induce or accelerate the onset and development of cardiovascular and metabolic disorders. In order to better clarify the potential epigenetic mechanisms underlying the modulation of the inflammatory response by adipokines, the DNA methylation profile in peripheral leukocytes of the promoter region of IL-6 and NF-kB genes and plasma miRNA-21 levels were evaluated in 356 healthy subjects, using quantitative pyrosequencing-based analysis, and correlated with plasma adiponectin levels, body fat content and the primary pro-inflammatory markers. In addition, correlation analysis of DNA methylation profiles and miRNA-21 plasma levels with intima-media thickness (IMT), a surrogate marker for early atherosclerosis, left ventricular mass (LVM), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and cardiac performance index (MPI) was also performed to evaluate any potential clinical implication in terms of cardiovascular outcome. Results achieved confirmed the role of epigenetics in the obesity-related cardiovascular complications and firstly supported the potential role of plasma miRNA-21 and IL-6 and NF-kB DNA methylation changes in nucleated blood cells as potential biomarkers for predicting cardiovascular risk in obesity. Furthermore, our results, showing a role of adiponectin in preventing epigenetic modification induced by increased adipose tissue content in obese subjects, provide new evidence of an additional mechanism underlying the anti-inflammatory properties and the cardiovascular benefits of adiponectin. The exact mechanisms underlying the obesity-related epigenetic modifications found in the blood cells and whether similar epigenetic changes reflect adipose and myocardial tissue modifications need to be further investigated in future experiments.Copyright © 2021 Fontanella, Scisciola, Rizzo, Surina, Sardu, Marfella, Paolisso and Barbieri."
"34789543","DNA Methylation and Protein Markers of Chronic Inflammation and Their Associations With Brain and Cognitive Aging.","Neurology","To investigate chronic inflammation in relation to cognitive aging by comparison of an epigenetic and serum biomarker of C-reactive protein and their associations with neuroimaging and cognitive outcomes.At baseline, participants (n = 521) were cognitively normal, around 73 years of age (mean 72.4, SD 0.716), and had inflammation, vascular risk (cardiovascular disease history, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, alcohol consumption, body mass index), and neuroimaging (structural and diffusion MRI) data available. Baseline inflammatory status was quantified by a traditional measure of peripheral inflammation-serum C-reactive protein (CRP)-and an epigenetic measure (DNA methylation [DNAm] signature of CRP). Linear models were used to examine the inflammation-brain health associations; mediation analyses were performed to interrogate the relationship between chronic inflammation, brain structure, and cognitive functioning.We demonstrate that DNAm CRP shows significantly (on average 6.4-fold) stronger associations with brain health outcomes than serum CRP. DNAm CRP is associated with total brain volume (β = -0.197, 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.28 to -0.12,pFDR= 8.42 × 10-6), gray matter volume (β = -0.200, 95% CI -0.28 to -0.12,pFDR= 1.66 × 10-5), and white matter volume (β = -0.150, 95% CI -0.23 to -0.07,pFDR= 0.001) and regional brain atrophy. We also find that DNAm CRP has an inverse association with global and domain-specific (speed, visuospatial, and memory) cognitive functioning and that brain structure partially mediates this CRP-cognitive association (up to 29.7%), dependent on lifestyle and health factors.These results support the hypothesis that chronic inflammation may contribute to neurodegenerative brain changes that underlie differences in cognitive ability in later life and highlight the potential of DNAm proxies for indexing chronic inflammatory status.This study provides Class II evidence that a DNAm signature of CRP levels is more strongly associated with brain health outcomes than serum CRP levels.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).

"34885162","Pathogen-Induced Epigenetic Modifications in Cancers: Implications for Prevention, Detection and Treatment of Cancers in Africa.","Cancers (Basel)","Cancer is a major public health burden worldwide. Tumor formation is caused by multiple intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Many reports have demonstrated a positive correlation between the burden of infectious pathogens and the occurrence of cancers. However, the mechanistic link between pathogens and cancer development remains largely unclear and is subject to active investigations. Apart from somatic mutations that have been widely linked with various cancers, an appreciable body of knowledge points to alterations of host epigenetic patterns as key triggers for cancer development. Several studies have associated various infectious pathogens with epigenetic modifications. It is therefore plausible to assume that pathogens induce carcinogenesis via alteration of normal host epigenetic patterns. Thus, Africa with its disproportionate burden of infectious pathogens is threatened by a dramatic increase in pathogen-mediated cancers. To curb the potential upsurge of such cancers, a better understanding of the role of tropical pathogens in cancer epigenetics could substantially provide resources to improve cancer management among Africans. Therefore, this review discusses cancer epigenetic studies in Africa and the link between tropical pathogens and cancer burden. In addition, we discuss the potential mechanisms by which pathogens induce cancers and the opportunities and challenges of tropical pathogen-induced epigenetic changes for cancer prevention, detection and management."

A great amount of information is collected in organ-specific multidisciplinary tumor boards (MDTBs). By considering the patient's tumor properties, molecular pathological test results, and comorbidities, the MDTB has to consent an evidence-based treatment decision. Immunotherapies are increasingly important in today's cancer treatment, resulting in detailed information that influences the decision-making process. Clinical decision support systems can facilitate a better understanding via processing of multiple datasets of oncological cases and molecular genetic information, potentially fostering transparency and comprehensibility of available information, eventually leading to an optimum treatment decision for the individual patient. We constructed a digital patient model based on Bayesian networks to combine the relevant patient-specific and molecular data with depended probabilities derived from pertinent studies and clinical guidelines to calculate treatment decisions in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). In a validation analysis, the model can provide guidance within the growing subject of immunotherapy in HNSCC and, based on its ability to calculate reliable probabilities, facilitates estimation of suitable therapy options. We compared actual treatment decisions of 25 patients with the calculated recommendations of our model and found significant concordance (Cohen'sκ= 0.505,p= 0.009) and 84% accuracy."

XCI is essential for female embryos to survive through development and requires the accurate spatiotemporal regulation of many different factors to achieve remarkable chromosome-wide gene silencing. As a result of XCI, the active and inactive X chromosomes are functionally and structurally different, with the inactive X chromosome undergoing a major conformational reorganization within the nucleus. In this Review, we discuss the multiple layers of genetic and epigenetic regulation that underlie initiation of XCI during development and then maintain it throughout life, in light of the most recent findings in this rapidly advancing field. We discuss exciting new insights into the regulation of X inactive-specific transcript (XIST), the trigger and master regulator of XCI, and into the mechanisms and dynamics that underlie the silencing of nearly all X-linked genes. Finally, given the increasing interest in understanding the impact of chromosome organization on gene regulation, we provide an overview of the factors that are thought to reshape the 3D structure of the inactive X chromosome and of the relevance of such structural changes for XCI establishment and maintenance.© 2022.

While behavioural differences may account for some of the risk, another possibility is that X chromosome susceptibility genes may have an effect. Little is known about genetic variants on the X chromosome that contribute to sex-specific lung-cancer risk, so we investigated this in a previously characterized cohort.We conducted a genetic association reanalysis of 518 lung cancer patients and 844 controls to test for lung cancer susceptibility variants on the X chromosome. Annotated gene expression, co-expression analysis, pathway, and immune infiltration analyses were also performed.24 SNPs were identified as significantly associated with male, but not female, lung cancer cases. These resided in blocks near the annotated genesDMD,PTCHD1-AS, andAL008633.1. Of these,DMDwas differentially expressed in lung cancer cases curated in The Cancer Genome Atlas. A functional enrichment and a KEGG pathway analysis of co-expressed genes revealed that differences in immune function could play a role in sex-specific susceptibility.Our analyses identified potential genetic variants associated with sex-specific lung cancer risk.

"34873032","A polygenic score for educational attainment partially predicts voter turnout.","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","Twin and adoption studies have shown that individual differences in political participation can be explained, in part, by genetic variation. However, these research designs cannot identify which genes are related to voting or the pathways through which they exert influence, and their conclusions rely on possibly restrictive assumptions. In this study, we use three different US samples and a Swedish sample to test whether genes that have been identified as associated with educational attainment, one of the strongest correlates of political participation, predict self-reported and validated voter turnout. We find that a polygenic score capturing individuals' genetic propensity to acquire education is significantly related to turnout. The strongest associations we observe are in second-order midterm elections in the United States and European Parliament elections in Sweden, which tend to be viewed as less important by voters, parties, and the media and thus present a more information-poor electoral environment for citizens to navigate. A within-family analysis suggests that individuals' education-linked genes directly affect their voting behavior, but, for second-order elections, it also reveals evidence of genetic nurture. Finally, a mediation analysis suggests that educational attainment and cognitive ability combine to account for between 41% and 63% of the relationship between the genetic propensity to acquire education and voter turnout.Copyright © 2021 the Author(s).

Based on the combination of m6A-impeded replication and AgI-mediated mismatch replication, this mode could effectively stop the extension of the strand once DNA polymerase encountered m6A site, which specifically distinguish the m6A site from natural A site in DNA. Also, Zr-MOF with high porosity and negative surface potential features was carefully chose to load cationic MB, resulting a stable and robust MB@Zr-MOF electrochemical tag. As a result, the developed biosensor exhibited a wide linear range from 1 fM to 1 nM with detection limit down to 0.89 fM. Profiting from the high sensitivity and selectivity, the biosensing strategy revealed good applicability, which had been demonstrated by quantitating m6A DNA at specific site in biological matrix. Thus, the biosensor provides a promising platform for locus-specific m6A DNA analysis.© 2021. The Author(s)."
"34950417","Directly Reprogrammed Human Neurons to Understand Age-Related Energy Metabolism Impairment and Mitochondrial Dysfunction in Healthy Aging and Neurodegeneration.","Oxid Med Cell Longev","Brain aging is characterized by several molecular and cellular changes grouped as the hallmarks or pillars of aging, including organelle dysfunction, metabolic and nutrition-sensor changes, stem cell attrition, and macromolecular damages. Separately and collectively, these features degrade the most critical neuronal function: transmission of information in the brain. It is widely accepted that aging is the leading risk factor contributing to the onset of the most prevalent pathological conditions that affect brain functions, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's disease. One of the limitations in understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in those diseases is the lack of an appropriate cellular model that recapitulates the ""aged"" context in human neurons. The advent of the cellular reprogramming of somatic cells, i.e., dermal fibroblasts, to obtain directly induced neurons (iNs) and induced pluripotent stem cell- (iPSC-) derived neurons is technical sound advances that could open the avenues to understand better the contribution of aging toward neurodegeneration. In this review, we will summarize the commonalities and singularities of these two approaches for the study of brain aging, with an emphasis on the role of mitochondrial dysfunction and redox biology. We will address the evidence showing that iNs retain age-related features in contrast to iPSC-derived neurons that lose the aging signatures during the reprogramming to pluripotency, rendering iNs a powerful strategy to deepen our knowledge of the processes driving normal cellular function decline and neurodegeneration in a human adult model. We will finally discuss the potential utilization of these novel technologies to understand the differential contribution of genetic and epigenetic factors toward neuronal aging, to identify and develop new drugs and therapeutic strategies.Copyright © 2021 Camila Gudenschwager et al."

Animal models have long been the most versatile tools available to dissect brain form and function; however, the human brain is highly distinct from that of standard model organisms. In addition to existing models, access to human brain cells and tissues is essential to reach new frontiers in our understanding of the human brain and how to intervene therapeutically in the face of disease or injury. In this review, we discuss current and developing culture models of human neural tissue, outlining advantages over animal models and key challenges that remain to be overcome. Our principal focus is on advances in engineering neural cells and tissue constructs from human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), though primary human cell and slice culture are also discussed. By highlighting studies that combine animal models and human neural cell culture techniques, we endeavor to demonstrate that clever use of these orthogonal model systems produces more reproducible, physiological, and clinically relevant data than either approach alone. We provide examples across a range of topics in neuroscience research including brain development, injury, and cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and psychiatric conditions. Finally, as testing of PSC-derived neurons for cell replacement therapy progresses, we touch on the advancements that are needed to make this a clinical mainstay.Copyright © 2021 Knock and Julian."

Using linear mixed models, we examined the association between previously identified CpGs for coronary artery calcification (CAC) and carotid plaque, both individually and aggregated into methylation risk scores (MRSCACand MRScarotid), and four measures of atherosclerosis (CAC, abdominal aorta calcification (AAC), ankle-brachial index (ABI), and multi-site atherosclerosis based on gender-specific quartiles of the single-site measures). We also examined the association between four epigenetic age acceleration measures (IEAA, EEAA, PhenoAge acceleration, and GrimAge acceleration) and the four atherosclerosis measures. Finally, we characterized the temporal stability of the epigenetic measures using repeated DNA methylation measured 5 years after baseline (N = 193).After adjusting for CVD risk factors, four CpGs (cg05575921(AHRR), cg09935388 (GFI1), cg21161138 (AHRR), and cg18168448 (LRRC52)) were associated with multi-site atherosclerosis (FDR < 0.1). cg05575921 was also associated with AAC and cg09935388 with ABI. MRSCACwas associated with ABI (Beta = 0.016, P = 0.006), and MRScarotidwas associated with both AAC (Beta = 0.605, equivalent to approximately 1.8-fold increase in the Agatston score of AAC, P = 0.004) and multi-site atherosclerosis (Beta = 0.691, P = 0.002). A 5-year increase in GrimAge acceleration (~ 1 SD) was associated with a 1.6-fold (P = 0.012) increase in the Agatston score of AAC and 0.7 units (P = 0.0003) increase in multi-site atherosclerosis, all after adjusting for CVD risk factors. All epigenetic measures were relatively stable over 5 years, with the highest intraclass correlation coefficients observed for MRScarotidand GrimAge acceleration (0.87 and 0.89, respectively).We found evidence of an association between DNA methylation and atherosclerosis at multiple vascular sites in a sample of African-Americans. Further evaluation of these potential biomarkers is warranted to deepen our understanding of the relationship between epigenetics and atherosclerosis.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"34980912","Fluctuating methylation clocks for cell lineage tracing at high temporal resolution in human tissues.","Nat Biotechnol","Molecular clocks that record cell ancestry mutate too slowly to measure the short-timescale dynamics of cell renewal in adult tissues. Here, we show that fluctuating DNA methylation marks can be used as clocks in cells where ongoing methylation and demethylation cause repeated 'flip-flops' between methylated and unmethylated states. We identify endogenous fluctuating CpG (fCpG) sites using standard methylation arrays and develop a mathematical model to quantitatively measure human adult stem cell dynamics from these data. Small intestinal crypts were inferred to contain slightly more stem cells than the colon, with slower stem cell replacement in the small intestine. Germline APC mutation increased the number of replacements per crypt. In blood, we measured rapid expansion of acute leukemia and slower growth of chronic disease. Thus, the patterns of human somatic cell birth and death are measurable with fluctuating methylation clocks (FMCs).© 2022. The Author(s)."

Interventions delaying aging in animal models are well established; however, most lack validation in humans. The length of human lifespan makes it impractical to perform survival analysis. Instead, aging biomarkers, such as DNA methylation (DNAm) clocks, have been developed to monitor biological age. Herein we report a retrospective analysis of DNA methylation age in 42 individuals taking Rejuvant®, an alpha-ketoglutarate based formulation, for an average period of 7 months. DNAm testing was performed at baseline and by the end of treatment with Rejuvant® supplementation. Remarkably, individuals showed an average decrease in biological aging of 8 years (p-value=6.538x10-12). Furthermore, the supplementation with Rejuvant® is robust to individual differences, as indicated by the fact that a large majority of participants decreased their biological age. Moreover, we found that Rejuvant® is of additional benefit to chronologically and biologically older individuals. While continued testing, particularly in a placebo-controlled design, is required, the nearly 8-year reversal in the biological age of individuals taking Rejuvant® for 4 to 10 months is noteworthy, making the natural product cocktail an intriguing candidate to affect human aging."

Among those with diabetes and hypertension, only 20.5% (95% CI: 13.9%-28.4%) and 11.8% (95% CI: 7.8%-16.9%) of participants were aware of their condition, respectively. Only 0.8% (95% CI: 0.0%-4.2%) of all participants with diabetes had achieved glycemic control; only 2.8% (95% CI: 1.1%-6.1%) of those with hypertension achieved control.We found a significant burden of diabetes and hypertension in Samoa, exceeding the recent prevalence estimates of other low- to middle-income countries by nearly two-fold. A severe unmet need in both detection and subsequent control and monitoring of these chronic conditions exists.

This study aimed to test the series mediation model triggered by childhood trauma, in which perceived psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic and sleep quality mediated the path sequentially and led to adverse mental health outcomes.Methods:A cross-sectional design involving 817 participants were enrolledviaWeChat online survey. Participants completed questionnaires, including demographic features, the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) questionnaire, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire, and Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21). Pearson correlations and hierarchical multiple linear regression were employed to examine the association of childhood trauma and psychological stress of COVID-19, sleep quality, and mental health status. In addition, a series mediate analysis was carried out to examine sequence mediating effects of psychological impact of COVID-19 and sleep quality between childhood trauma and mental health status.Results:The results showed that childhood trauma is positively and significantly related to psychological distress of COVID-19 pandemic, sleep quality, and mental health status (p< 0.05). Hierarchical multiple linear regression analysis shown that demographic features explained 4.4, 2.1, and 4.0% of the total variance in DASS-21, IES-R, and PSQI total scale scores, respectively. Adding childhood trauma significantly increased the model variance of DASS-21 (ΔR2= 0.129,F= 126.092,p= 0.000), IES-R (ΔR2= 0.062,F= 54.771,p= 0.000), and PSQI total scale scores (ΔR2= 0.055,F= 48.733,p= 0.000), respectively. Moreover, the series mediation model showed that the perceived impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and sleep quality were sequential mediators between childhood trauma and mental health status (proportion explained: 49.17%,p< 0.05).Conclusion:Amid the ravages of COVID-19, childhood trauma predicts poor mental health status, in part because of greater psychological impact related to COVID-19 and poorer global sleep quality. In order to improve mental health, future researchers should pay more attention to individuals with childhood trauma, for its association with greater stress related to life events and poorer sleep quality.Copyright © 2021 Xie, Tang, Zhu, Dai, Wu, Huang, Liu, Xiao, Li and Wang."

Spastic CP, which is the most common type, involves high muscle tone and is associated with altered muscle function including poor muscle growth and contracture, increased extracellular matrix deposition, microanatomic disruption, musculoskeletal deformities, weakness, and difficult movement control. These muscle-related manifestations of CP are major causes of progressive debilitation and frequently require intensive surgical and therapeutic intervention to control. Current clinical approaches involve sophisticated consideration of biomechanics, radiologic assessments, and movement analyses, but outcomes remain difficult to predict. There is a need for more precise and personalized approaches involving omics technologies, data science, and advanced analytics. An improved understanding of muscle involvement in spastic CP is needed. Unfortunately, the fundamental mechanisms and molecular pathways contributing to altered muscle function in spastic CP are only partially understood. In this review, we outline evidence supporting the emerging hypothesis that epigenetic phenomena play significant roles in musculoskeletal manifestations of CP."

To investigate which methods can best meet this challenge, we assessed 18 computational methods for inferring mutational signatures on 20 synthetic data sets that incorporated varying degrees of correlated activity of two common mutational signatures. Performance varied widely, and four methods noticeably outperformed the others: hdp (based on hierarchical Dirichlet processes), SigProExtractor (based on multiple non-negative matrix factorizations over resampled data), TCSM (based on an approach used in document topic analysis), and mutSpec.NMF (also based on non-negative matrix factorization). The results underscored the complexities of mutational signature extraction, including the importance and difficulty of determining the correct number of signatures and the importance of hyperparameters. Our findings indicate directions for improvement of the software and show a need for care when interpreting results from any of these methods, including the need for assessing sensitivity of the results to input parameters.© 2022.

"34944895","Arginine Depletion in Human Cancers.","Cancers (Basel)","Arginine is encoded by six different codons. Base pair changes in any of these codons can have a broad spectrum of effects including substitutions to twelve different amino acids, eighteen synonymous changes, and two stop codons. Four amino acids (histidine, cysteine, glutamine, and tryptophan) account for over 75% of amino acid substitutions of arginine. This suggests that a mutational bias, or ""purifying selection"", mechanism is at work. This bias appears to be driven by C > T and G > A transitions in four of the six arginine codons, a signature that is universal and independent of cancer tissue of origin or histology. Here, we provide a review of the available literature and reanalyze publicly available data from the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC). Our analysis identifies several genes with an arginine substitution bias. These include known factors such as IDH1, as well as previously unreported genes, including four cancer driver genes (FGFR3, PPP6C, MAX, GNAQ). We propose that base pair substitution bias and amino acid physiology both play a role in purifying selection. This model may explain the documented arginine substitution bias in cancers."
"34943407","Can Circulating Tumor DNA Support a Successful Screening Test for Early Cancer Detection? The Grail Paradigm.","Diagnostics (Basel)","Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is a new pan-cancer tumor marker with important applications for patient prognosis, monitoring progression, and assessing the success of the therapeutic response. Another important goal is an early cancer diagnosis. There is currently a debate if ctDNA can be used for early cancer detection due to the small tumor burden and low mutant allele fraction (MAF). We compare our previous calculations on the size of detectable cancers by ctDNA analysis with the latest experimental data from Grail's clinical trial. Current ctDNA-based diagnostic methods could predictably detect tumors of sizes greater than 10-15 mm in diameter. When tumors are of this size or smaller, their MAF is about 0.01% (one tumor DNA molecule admixed with 10,000 normal DNA molecules). The use of 10 mL of blood (4 mL of plasma) will likely contain less than a complete cancer genome, thus rendering the diagnosis of cancer impossible. Grail's new data confirm the low sensitivity for early cancer detection (<30% for Stage I-II tumors, <20% for Stage I tumors), but specificity was high at 99.5%. According to these latest data, the sensitivity of the Grail test is less than 20% in Stage I disease, casting doubt if this test could become a viable pan-cancer clinical screening tool."
"34930241","Clinical feature-related single-base substitution sequence signatures identified with an unsupervised machine learning approach.","BMC Med Genomics","Mutation processes leave different signatures in genes. For single-base substitutions, previous studies have suggested that mutation signatures are not only reflected in mutation bases but also in neighboring bases. However, because of the lack of a method to identify features of long sequences next to mutation bases, the understanding of how flanking sequences influence mutation signatures is limited.We constructed a long short-term memory-self organizing map (LSTM-SOM) unsupervised neural network. By extracting mutated sequence features via LSTM and clustering similar features with the SOM, single-base substitutions in The Cancer Genome Atlas database were clustered according to both their mutation site and flanking sequences. The relationship between mutation sequence signatures and clinical features was then analyzed. Finally, we clustered patients into different classes according to the composition of the mutation sequence signatures by the K-means method and then studied the differences in clinical features and survival between classes.Ten classes of mutant sequence signatures (mutation blots, MBs) were obtained from 2,141,527 single-base substitutions via LSTM-SOM machine learning approach. Different features in mutation bases and flanking sequences were revealed among MBs. MBs reflect both the site and pathological features of cancers. MBs were related to clinical features, including age, sex, and cancer stage. The class of an MB in a given gene was associated with survival. Finally, patients were clustered into 7 classes according to the MB composition. Significant differences in survival and clinical features were observed among different patient classes.We provided a method for analyzing the characteristics of mutant sequences. Result of this study showed that flanking sequences, together with mutation bases, shape the signatures of SBSs. MBs were shown related to clinical features and survival of cancer patients. Composition of MBs is a feasible predictive factor of clinical prognosis. Further study of the mechanism of MBs related to cancer characteristics is suggested.© 2021. The Author(s)."
"34901014","Analysis of Mutations and Dysregulated Pathways Unravels Carcinogenic Effect and Clinical Actionability of Mutational Processes.","Front Cell Dev Biol","Somatic mutations accumulate over time in cancer cells as a consequence of mutational processes. However, the role of mutational processes in carcinogenesis remains poorly understood. Here, we infer the causal relationship between mutational processes and somatic mutations in 5,828 samples spanning 34 cancer subtypes. We found most mutational processes cause abundant recurrent mutations in cancer genes, while exceptionally ultraviolet exposure and altered activity of the error-prone polymerase bring a large number of recurrent non-driver mutations. Furthermore, some mutations are specifically induced by a certain mutational process, such as IDH1 p.R132H which is mainly caused by spontaneous deamination of 5-methylcytosine. At the pathway level, clock-like mutational processes extensively trigger mutations to dysregulate cancer signal transduction pathways. In addition, APOBEC mutational process destroys DNA double-strand break repair pathway, and bladder cancer patients with high APOBEC activity, though with homologous recombination proficient, show a significantly longer overall survival with platinum regimens. These findings help to understand how mutational processes act on the genome to promote carcinogenesis, and further, presents novel insights for cancer prevention and treatment, as our results showing, APOBEC mutagenesis and HRD synergistically contributed to the clinical benefits of platinum-based treatment.Copyright © 2021 Jiang, Liao, Yang, Lan, Xu, Yan, Zhou, Zhu, Liu, Bai, Xiao and Li."

Any short RNA that enters the RNA induced silencing complex (RISC) can kill cells through miRNA-like RNA interference when its 6mer seed sequence (pos. 2-7 of the guide strand) has a G-rich nucleotide composition. G-rich seeds mediate 6mer Seed Toxicity by targeting C-rich seed matches in the 3' UTR of genes critical for cell survival. The resulting Death Induced by Survival gene Elimination (DISE) predominantly affects cancer cells but may contribute to cell death in other disease contexts. This review summarizes recent findings on the role of DISE/6mer Seed Tox in cancer; its therapeutic potential; its contribution to therapy resistance; its selectivity, and why normal cells are protected.

Follicular lymphoma (FL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the most frequent types of indolent B-cell tumors, are exposed to AID activity during lymphomagenesis. We designed a workflow integrating de novo mutational signatures extraction and fitting of COSMIC (Catalogue Of Somatic Mutations In Cancer) signatures, with tridimensional chromatin conformation data (Hi-C). We applied the workflow to exome sequencing data from lymphoma samples. In 33 FL and 30 CLL samples, 42% and 34% of the contextual mutations could be traced to a known AID motif. We demonstrate that both CLL and FL share mutational processes dominated by spontaneous deamination, failures in DNA repair, and AID activity. The processes had equiproportional distribution across active and nonactive chromatin compartments in CLL. In contrast, canonical AID activity and failures in DNA repair pathways in FL were significantly higher within the active chromatin compartment. Analysis of DNA repair genes revealed a higher prevalence of base excision repair gene mutations (p= 0.02) in FL than CLL. These data indicate that AID activity drives the genetic landscapes of FL and CLL. However, the final result of AID-induced mutagenesis differs between these lymphomas depending on chromatin compartmentalization and mutations in DNA repair pathways."
"34824211","Aberrant integration of Hepatitis B virus DNA promotes major restructuring of human hepatocellular carcinoma genome architecture.","Nat Commun","Most cancers are characterized by the somatic acquisition of genomic rearrangements during tumour evolution that eventually drive the oncogenesis. Here, using multiplatform sequencing technologies, we identify and characterize a remarkable mutational mechanism in human hepatocellular carcinoma caused by Hepatitis B virus, by which DNA molecules from the virus are inserted into the tumour genome causing dramatic changes in its configuration, including non-homologous chromosomal fusions, dicentric chromosomes and megabase-size telomeric deletions. This aberrant mutational mechanism, present in at least 8% of all HCC tumours, can provide the driver rearrangements that a cancer clone requires to survive and grow, including loss of relevant tumour suppressor genes. Most of these events are clonal and occur early during liver cancer evolution. Real-time timing estimation reveals some HBV-mediated rearrangements occur as early as two decades before cancer diagnosis. Overall, these data underscore the importance of characterising liver cancer genomes for patterns of HBV integration.© 2021. The Author(s)."
"35024421","Body shape and stable employment opportunity analysis of China's nonagricultural labor market.","SSM Popul Health","Based on the integrated data of the China General Social Survey (CGSS) from 2010 to 2017, this study observes that body shape - being overweight or underweight - is important for labor market outcomes. Body shape significantly affects the employment opportunities of Chinese individuals, and this effect differs by gender and across the occupational hierarchy. Women face both slim premium and obesity penalty effects. Slim women, those with normal and lower but not excessively lower body weight, are more likely to gain long-term employment contracts in the labor market, while the opposite is observed for overweight individuals. The relationship between women's body shape and employment opportunities also varies by occupation. The obesity penalty is more pronounced in occupations with a higher International Socio-Economic Index (ISEI), while the slim premium is more evident in occupations with a low ISEI. The results suggest that the Chinese labor market is highly demanding regarding women's figures, while it is relatively tolerant of men's figures. By mechanism analysis, health capital is found to be the leading cause of the body shape effect. In addition, socialization is also a possible pathway of action. This paper has extended implications for the study of stature and employment stability, enriching the empirical research on labor market discrimination.© 2021 The Authors."
"34907193","Simultaneous estimation of bi-directional causal effects and heritable confounding from GWAS summary statistics.","Nat Commun","Mendelian Randomisation (MR) is an increasingly popular approach that estimates the causal effect of risk factors on complex human traits. While it has seen several extensions that relax its basic assumptions, most suffer from two major limitations; their under-exploitation of genome-wide markers, and sensitivity to the presence of a heritable confounder of the exposure-outcome relationship. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Latent Heritable Confounder MR (LHC-MR) method applicable to association summary statistics, which estimates bi-directional causal effects, direct heritabilities, and confounder effects while accounting for sample overlap. We demonstrate that LHC-MR outperforms several existing MR methods in a wide range of simulation settings and apply it to summary statistics of 13 complex traits. Besides several concordant results with other MR methods, LHC-MR unravels new mechanisms (how disease diagnosis might lead to improved lifestyle) and reveals new causal effects (e.g. HDL cholesterol being protective against high systolic blood pressure), hidden from standard MR methods due to a heritable confounder of opposite effect direction.© 2021.

"34943960","Human rDNA and Cancer.","Cells","In human cells, each rDNA unit consists of the ~13 kb long ribosomal part and ~30 kb long intergenic spacer (IGS). The ribosomal part, transcribed by RNA polymerase I (pol I), includes genes coding for 18S, 5.8S, and 28S RNAs of the ribosomal particles, as well as their four transcribed spacers. Being highly repetitive, intensively transcribed, and abundantly methylated, rDNA is a very fragile site of the genome, with high risk of instability leading to cancer. Multiple small mutations, considerable expansion or contraction of the rDNA locus, and abnormally enhanced pol I transcription are usual symptoms of transformation. Recently it was found that both IGS and the ribosomal part of the locus contain many functional/potentially functional regions producing non-coding RNAs, which participate in the pol I activity regulation, stress reactions, and development of the malignant phenotype. Thus, there are solid reasons to believe that rDNA locus plays crucial role in carcinogenesis. In this review we discuss the data concerning the human rDNA and its closely associated factors as both targets and drivers of the pathways essential for carcinogenesis. We also examine whether variability in the structure of the locus may be blamed for the malignant transformation. Additionally, we consider the prospects of therapy focused on the activity of rDNA."
"34919934","Temporal signaling, population control, and information processing through chromatin-mediated gene regulation.","J Theor Biol","Chromatin regulation is a key pathway cells use to regulate gene expression in response to temporal stimuli, and is becoming widely used as a platform for synthetic biology applications. Here, we build a mathematical framework for analyzing the response of genetic circuits containing chromatin regulators to temporal signals in mammalian cell populations. Chromatin regulators can silence genes in an all-or-none fashion at the single-cell level, with individual cells stochastically transitioning between active, reversibly silent, and irreversibly silent gene states at constant rates over time. We integrate this mode of regulation with classical gene regulatory motifs, such as autoregulatory and incoherent feedforward loops, to determine the types of responses achievable with duration-dependent signaling. We demonstrate that repressive regulators without long-term epigenetic memory can filter out high frequency noise, and as part of an autoregulatory loop can precisely tune the fraction of cells in a population that expresses a gene of interest. Additionally, we find that repressive regulators with epigenetic memory can sum up and encode the total duration of their recruitment in the fraction of cells irreversibly silenced and, when included in a feed forward loop, enable perfect adaptation. Last, we use an information theoretic approach to show that all-or-none stochastic silencing can be used by populations to transmit information reliably and with high fidelity even in very simple genetic circuits. Altogether, we show that chromatin-mediated gene control enables a repertoire of complex cell population responses to temporal signals and can transmit higher information levels than previously measured in gene regulation.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Transcriptome-wide association study of ALS was conducted by integrating the genome-wide association study summary data (including 1234 ALS patients and 2850 controls) and pre-computed gene expression weights of different tissues. The ALS-associated genes identified by TWAS were further compared with the differentially expressed genes detected by the mRNA expression profiles of the sporadic ALS. Functional enrichment and annotation analysis of identified genes were performed by an R package and the functional mapping and annotation software. TWAS identified 761 significant genes (PTWAS < 0.05), 627 Gene ontology terms, and 8 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways for ALS, such as C9orf72, with three expression quantitative trait loci were found significantly: rs2453554 (PTWAS CBRS = 4.68 × 10-10, PTWAS CBRS = 2.54 × 10-9), rs10967976 (PTWAS CBRS = 7.85 × 10-10, PTWAS CBRS = 8.91 × 10-9, PTWAS CBRS = 1.49 × 10-7, PTWAS CBRS = 5.59 × 10-7), rs3849946 (PTWAS CBRS = 7.69 × 10-4, PTWAS YBL = 4.02 × 10-2), Mitochondrion (Padj = 4.22 × 10-16), and Cell cycle (Padj = 2.04 × 10-3).

In this study, we develop a novel strategy to identify the causal loci using a pan-cancer and fine-mapping assumption, constructing the CAusal Pan-cancER gene (CAPER) score and validating its performance using internal and external validation on 1,287 individuals and 985 cell lines. Summary statistics of 15 cancer types were used to define 54 causal loci in 15 potential genes. Using the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) training set, we constructed the CAPER score and divided cancer patients into two groups. Using the three validation sets, we found that 19 cancer-related variables were statistically significant between the two CAPER score groups and that 81 drugs had significantly different drug sensitivity between the two CAPER score groups. We hope that our strategies for selecting causal genes and for constructing CAPER score would provide valuable clues for guiding the management of different types of cancers.Copyright © 2021 Tao, Ye, Pan, Fu, Huang, Peng and Yang."

Euro-pigeons and Silver King pigeons are commercial varieties that exhibit good meat production performance. In contrast to the domestication direction of meat pigeons, the traditional Chinese ornamental pigeon breed, High flyers, has a small and light body. Here, we investigate the molecular mechanism of the pectoral muscle development and function of pigeons using whole-genome and RNA sequencing data. The selective sweep analysis (FSTand log2 (θπ ratio)) revealed 293 and 403 positive selection genes in Euro-pigeons and Silver King, respectively, of which 65 genes were shared. With the Silver King and Euro-pigeon as the control group, the High flyers were selected for 427 and 566 genes respectively.

Of 485 250 individuals, data for 483 054 passed data quality control and were used.Genotypes of common variants associated with risk of ET.Of the 483 054 individuals included, there were 7177 with ET (3693 [51.46%] female; mean [SD] age, 62.66 [15.12] years), and 475 877 control individuals (253 785 [53.33%] female; mean [SD] age, 56.40 [17.6] years). Five independent genome-wide significant loci and were identified and were associated with approximately 18% of ET heritability. Functional analyses found significant enrichment in the cerebellar hemisphere, cerebellum, and axonogenesis pathways. Genetic correlation (r), which measures the degree of genetic overlap, revealed significant common variant overlap with Parkinson disease (r, 0.28; P = 2.38 × 10-8) and depression (r, 0.12; P = 9.78 × 10-4). A separate fine-mapping of transcriptome-wide association hits identified genes such as BACE2, LRRN2, DHRS13, and LINC00323 in disease-relevant brain regions, such as the cerebellum.The results of this genome-wide association study suggest that a portion of ET heritability can be explained by common genetic variation and can help identify new common genetic risk factors for ET."

More often, genotype data are available for all individuals under study but gene expression and/or methylation information are missing for different subsets of those individuals. Here, we develop a statistical model TiMEG, for the identification of disease-associated biomarkers in a case-control paradigm by integrating the above-mentioned data types, especially, in presence of missing omics data.

Using whole blood-derived estimates for regulatory variants from the eQTLGen consortium (n = 31,684), we constructed genetic risk scores for 10,104 genes. Applying the inverse-variance-weighted MR method transcriptome wide while accounting for linkage disequilibrium structure identified 664 unique genes with evidence of a genetically predicted effect on at least one disease outcome (p < 4.81 × 10-5). We next undertook genetic colocalization to investigate cell-type-specific effects at these loci by using gene expression data derived from 18 types of immune cells. This highlighted many cell-type-dependent effects, such as PRKCQ expression and asthma risk (posterior probability = 0.998), which was T cell specific. Phenome-wide analyses on 311 complex traits and endpoints allowed us to explore shared genetic architecture and prioritize key drivers of disease risk, such as CASP10, which provided evidence of an effect on seven cancer-related outcomes. Our atlas of results can be used to characterize known and novel loci in immune-associated disease and cancer susceptibility, both in terms of elucidating cell-type-dependent effects as well as dissecting shared disease pathways and pervasive pleiotropy. As an exemplar, we have highlighted several key findings in this study, although similar evaluations can be conducted via our interactive web platform.Copyright © 2021. Published by Elsevier Inc."
"34711612","Gene-Level Germline Contributions to Clinical Risk of Recurrence Scores in Black and White Patients with Breast Cancer.","Cancer Res","Continuous risk of recurrence scores (CRS) based on tumor gene expression are vital prognostic tools for breast cancer. Studies have shown that Black women (BW) have higher CRS than White women (WW). Although systemic injustices contribute substantially to breast cancer disparities, evidence of biological and germline contributions is emerging. In this study, we investigated germline genetic associations with CRS and CRS disparity using approaches modeled after transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS). In the Carolina Breast Cancer Study, using race-specific predictive models of tumor expression from germline genetics, we performed race-stratified (N= 1,043 WW, 1,083 BW) linear regressions of three CRS (ROR-S: PAM50 subtype score; proliferation score; ROR-P: ROR-S plus proliferation score) on imputed tumor genetically regulated tumor expression (GReX). Bayesian multivariate regression and adaptive shrinkage tested GReX-prioritized genes for associations with tumor PAM50 expression and subtype to elucidate patterns of germline regulation underlying GReX-CRS associations. At FDR-adjustedP< 0.10, 7 and 1 GReX prioritized genes among WW and BW, respectively. Among WW, CRS were positively associated withMCM10,FAM64A,CCNB2, andMMP1GReX and negatively associated withVAV3,PCSK6, andGNG11GReX. Among BW, higherMMP1GReX predicted lower proliferation score and ROR-P. GReX-prioritized gene and PAM50 tumor expression associations highlighted potential mechanisms for GReX-prioritized gene to CRS associations. Among patients with breast cancer, differential germline associations with CRS were found by race, underscoring the need for larger, diverse datasets in molecular studies of breast cancer. These findings also suggest possible germlinetrans-regulation of PAM50 tumor expression, with potential implications for CRS interpretation in clinical settings. SIGNIFICANCE: This study identifies race-specific genetic associations with breast cancer risk of recurrence scores and suggests mediation of these associations by PAM50 subtype and expression, with implications for clinical interpretation of these scores.©2021 The Authors; Published by the American Association for Cancer Research."

In pregnancy, folate demand is increased due to the requirement for one-carbon transfer reactions. The present study was proposed to investigate the effect of folic acid supplementation throughout pregnancy on a battery of behavior tests (olfactory preference, motor activity, exploratory capacity, habituation, memory, anxiety- and depression-like behavior). Redox homeostasis and neuroinflammatory status in cerebral cortex were also investigated. After pregnancy confirmation, the pregnant rats were randomly divided into two groups, according to the diet: group 1, (control) standard diet (2 mg/kg diet of folic acid) and group 2, supplemented diet with 4 mg/kg diet of folic acid. Throughout the gestational period, the pregnant rats received experimental diets. Results show that the supplemented diet with 4 mg/kg diet of folic acid throughout pregnancy impaired memory and motricity of the offspring when compared with control (standard diet). It was also observed an increase in anxiety- and depression-like behavior in this group. Nitrite levels increased in cerebral cortex of the offspring, when compared to control group. In contrast, iNOS expression and immunocontent were not altered. Moreover, we identify an increase in TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, and MCP-1 gene expression in the cerebral cortex.

"34968246","Role of Enhancers in Development and Diseases.","Epigenomes","Enhancers are cis-regulatory elements containing short DNA sequences that serve as binding sites for pioneer/regulatory transcription factors, thus orchestrating the regulation of genes critical for lineage determination. The activity of enhancer elements is believed to be determined by transcription factor binding, thus determining the cell state identity during development. Precise spatio-temporal control of the transcriptome during lineage specification requires the coordinated binding of lineage-specific transcription factors to enhancers. Thus, enhancers are the primary determinants of cell identity. Numerous studies have explored the role and mechanism of enhancers during development and disease, and various basic questions related to the functions and mechanisms of enhancers have not yet been fully answered. In this review, we discuss the recently published literature regarding the roles of enhancers, which are critical for various biological processes governing development. Furthermore, we also highlight that altered enhancer landscapes provide an essential context to understand the etiologies and mechanisms behind numerous complex human diseases, providing new avenues for effective enhancer-based therapeutic interventions."

There is an urgent need to develop approaches for the prevention of T2D in South Asians that are cost-effective, generalisable and scalable across settings.Compared to usual care, the risk of T2D can be reduced amongst South Asians with central obesity or raised HbA1c, through a 12-month lifestyle modification programme delivered by community health workers.Cluster randomised clinical trial (1:1 allocation to intervention or usual care), carried out in India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and the UK, with 30 sites per country (120 sites total). Target recruitment 3600 (30 participants per site) with annual follow-up for 3 years.South Asian, men or women, age 40-70 years with (i) central obesity (waist circumference ≥ 100 cm in India and Pakistan; ≥90 cm in Sri Lanka) and/or (ii) prediabetes (HbA1c 6.0-6.4% inclusive).known type 1 or 2 diabetes, normal or underweight (body mass index < 22 kg/m2); pregnant or planning pregnancy; unstable residence or planning to leave the area; and serious illness.The primary endpoint is new-onset T2D at 3 years, defined as (i) HbA1c ≥ 6.5% or (ii) physician diagnosis and on treatment for T2D. Secondary endpoints at 1 and 3 years are the following: (i) physical measures: waist circumference, weight and blood pressure; (ii) lifestyle measures: smoking status, alcohol intake, physical activity and dietary intake; (iii) biochemical measures: fasting glucose, insulin and lipids (total and HDL cholesterol, triglycerides); and (iv) treatment compliance.Lifestyle intervention (60 sites) or usual care (60 sites). Lifestyle intervention was delivered by a trained community health worker over 12 months (5 one-one sessions, 4 group sessions, 13 telephone sessions) with the goal of the participants achieving a 7% reduction in body mass index and a 10-cm reduction in waist circumference through (i) improved diet and (ii) increased physical activity. Usual care comprised a single 30-min session of lifestyle modification advice from the community health worker.We screened 33,212 people for inclusion into the study. We identified 10,930 people who met study entry criteria, amongst whom 3682 agreed to take part in the intervention. Study participants are 49.2% female and aged 52.8 (SD 8.2) years. Clinical characteristics are well balanced between intervention and usual care sites. More than 90% of follow-up visits are scheduled to be complete in December 2020. Based on the follow-up to end 2019, the observed incidence of T2D in the study population is in line with expectations (6.1% per annum).The iHealth-T2D study will advance understanding of strategies for the prevention of diabetes amongst South Asians, use approaches for screening and intervention that are adapted for low-resource settings.

"34906243","Identification of Gm15441, a Txnip antisense lncRNA, as a critical regulator in liver metabolic homeostasis.","Cell Biosci","The majority of mammalian genome is composed of non-coding regions, where numerous long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are transcribed. Although lncRNAs have been identified to regulate fundamental biological processes, most of their functions remain unknown, especially in metabolic homeostasis. Analysis of our recent genome-wide screen reveals that Gm15441, a thioredoxin-interacting protein (Txnip) antisense lncRNA, is the most robustly induced lncRNA in the fasting mouse liver. Antisense lncRNAs are known to regulate their sense gene expression. Given that Txnip is a critical metabolic regulator of the liver, we aimed to investigate the role of Gm15441 in the regulation of Txnip and liver metabolism.We examined the response of Gm15441 and Txnip under in vivo metabolic signals such as fasting and refeeding, and in vitro signals such as insulin and key metabolic transcription factors. We investigated the regulation of Txnip expression by Gm15441 and the underlying mechanism in mouse hepatocytes. Using adenovirus-mediated liver-specific overexpression, we determined whether Gm15441 regulates Txnip in the mouse liver and modulates key aspects of liver metabolism.We found that the expression levels of Gm15441 and Txnip showed a similar response pattern to metabolic signals in vivo and in vitro, but that their functions were predicted to be opposite. Furthermore, we found that Gm15441 robustly reduced Txnip protein expression in vitro through sequence-specific regulation and translational inhibition. Lastly, we confirmed the Txnip inhibition by Gm15441 in vivo (mice) and found that Gm15441 liver-specific overexpression lowered plasma triglyceride and blood glucose levels and elevated plasma ketone body levels.Our data demonstrate that Gm15441 is a potent Txnip inhibitor and a critical metabolic regulator in the liver.

Statistical fine-mapping is a method aiming to refine GWAS signals by evaluating which variant(s) are truly causal to the phenotype. Here, we review the types of statistical fine-mapping methods that have been widely used to date, with a focus on recently developed functionally informed fine-mapping (FIFM) methods that utilize functional annotations.

"35017556","DeepNull models non-linear covariate effects to improve phenotypic prediction and association power.","Nat Commun","Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) examine the association between genotype and phenotype while adjusting for a set of covariates. Although the covariates may have non-linear or interactive effects, due to the challenge of specifying the model, GWAS often neglect such terms. Here we introduce DeepNull, a method that identifies and adjusts for non-linear and interactive covariate effects using a deep neural network. In analyses of simulated and real data, we demonstrate that DeepNull maintains tight control of the type I error while increasing statistical power by up to 20% in the presence of non-linear and interactive effects. Moreover, in the absence of such effects, DeepNull incurs no loss of power. When applied to 10 phenotypes from the UK Biobank (n = 370K), DeepNull discovered more hits (+6%) and loci (+7%), on average, than conventional association analyses, many of which are biologically plausible or have previously been reported. Finally, DeepNull improves upon linear modeling for phenotypic prediction (+23% on average).© 2022. The Author(s)."
"34938269","Perspective of the GEMSTONE Consortium on Current and Future Approaches to Functional Validation for Skeletal Genetic Disease Using Cellular, Molecular and Animal-Modeling Techniques.","Front Endocrinol (Lausanne)","The availability of large human datasets for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and the advancement of sequencing technologies have boosted the identification of genetic variants in complex and rare diseases in the skeletal field. Yet, interpreting results from human association studies remains a challenge. To bridge the gap between genetic association and causality, a systematic functional investigation is necessary. Multiple unknowns exist for putative causal genes, including cellular localization of the molecular function. Intermediate traits (""endophenotypes""), e.g. molecular quantitative trait loci (molQTLs), are needed to identify mechanisms of underlying associations. Furthermore, index variants often reside in non-coding regions of the genome, therefore challenging for interpretation. Knowledge of non-coding variance (e.g. ncRNAs), repetitive sequences, and regulatory interactions between enhancers and their target genes is central for understanding causal genes in skeletal conditions. Animal models with deep skeletal phenotyping and cell culture models have already facilitated fine mapping of some association signals, elucidated gene mechanisms, and revealed disease-relevant biology. However, to accelerate research towards bridging the current gap between association and causality in skeletal diseases, alternativein vivoplatforms need to be used and developed in parallel with the current -omics and traditionalin vivoresources. Therefore, we argue that as a field we need to establish resource-sharing standards to collectively address complex research questions. These standards will promote data integration from various -omics technologies and functional dissection of human complex traits. In this mission statement, we review the current available resources and as a group propose a consensus to facilitate resource sharing using existing and future resources. Such coordination efforts will maximize the acquisition of knowledge from different approaches and thus reduce redundancy and duplication of resources. These measures will help to understand the pathogenesis of osteoporosis and other skeletal diseases towards defining new and more efficient therapeutic targets.Copyright © 2021 Rauner, Foessl, Formosa, Kague, Prijatelj, Lopez, Banerjee, Bergen, Busse, Calado, Douni, Gabet, Giralt, Grinberg, Lovsin, Solan, Ostanek, Pavlos, Rivadeneira, Soldatovic, van de Peppel, van der Eerden, van Hul, Balcells, Marc, Reppe, Søe and Karasik."
"34924553","Reciprocal interaction between depression and pain: results from a comprehensive bidirectional Mendelian randomization study and functional annotation analysis.","Pain","To understand a putative causal link for depression and pain, we retrieved summary statistics from genome-wide association studies conducted for pain at 7 different body sites (N = 151,922-226,683) and major depression disorder (MDD, Ncase/control = 246,363/561,190). We conducted a bidirectional Mendelian randomization analysis using distinct genome-wide association studies-identified single nucleotide polymorphisms for each trait as instrumental variables and performed several sensitivity analyses to verify Mendelian randomization assumptions. We also conducted functional annotation analysis using 396 tissue-specific annotations from the roadmap project. Across 7 different body sites, genetic predisposition to depression was associated with pain at the neck/shoulder (odds ratio [OR] = 1.08 per one log-unit increase in depression risk, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.06-1.10), back (OR = 1.05, 95% CI: 1.04-1.07), abdominal/stomach (OR = 1.03, 95% CI: 1.02-1.04), as well as headache (OR = 1.10, 95% CI: 1.07-1.12), but not with pain on the face, hip, and knee. In the reverse direction, genetically instrumented multisite chronic pain (OR = 1.78 per one increment in the number of pain site, 95% CI: 1.51-2.11) and headache (OR = 1.55 per one log-unit increase in headache risk, 95% CI = 1.13-2.10) were associated with MDD. Functional annotation analysis showed differential clustering patterns where depression clustered closely with headache and neck/shoulder pain, exhibiting substantial brain tissue enrichment. Our study indicates that depression is a causal risk factor for headache and pain localized at neck/shoulder, back, and abdominal/stomach, rather than pain at face, hip, and knee, and suggests common neurological pathologies underlying the development of depression, headache, and neck/shoulder pain.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).

Due to its increased power and interpretability, genetically regulated expression (GReX) analysis is an emerging approach to investigate the genetic mechanisms of complex diseases. Here, we conducted GReX analysis within and across 51 tissues on 39 LOAD GWAS data sets comprising 58,713 cases and controls from the Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium (ADGC) and the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP). Meta-analysis across studies identified 216 unique significant genes, including 72 with no previously reported LOAD GWAS associations. Cross-brain-tissue and cross-GTEx models revealed eight additional genes significantly associated with LOAD. Conditional analysis of previously reported loci using established LOAD-risk variants identified eight genes reaching genome-wide significance independent of known signals. Moreover, the proportion of SNP-based heritability is highly enriched in genes identified by GReX analysis. In summary, GReX-based meta-analysis in LOAD identifies 216 genes (including 72 novel genes), illuminating the role of gene regulatory models in LOAD.© 2021. The Author(s)."

It is composed of several different cell and muscle fiber types. Here, we optimize single-nucleus ATAC-seq (snATAC-seq) to map skeletal muscle cell-specific chromatin accessibility landscapes in frozen human and rat samples, and single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) to map cell-specific transcriptomes in human. We additionally perform multi-omics profiling (gene expression and chromatin accessibility) on human and rat muscle samples. We capture type I and type II muscle fiber signatures, which are generally missed by existing single-cell RNA-seq methods. We perform cross-modality and cross-species integrative analyses on 33,862 nuclei and identify seven cell types ranging in abundance from 59.6% to 1.0% of all nuclei. We introduce a regression-based approach to infer cell types by comparing transcription start site-distal ATAC-seq peaks to reference enhancer maps and show consistency with RNA-based marker gene cell type assignments. We find heterogeneity in enrichment of genetic variants linked to complex phenotypes from the UK Biobank and diabetes genome-wide association studies in cell-specific ATAC-seq peaks, with the most striking enrichment patterns in muscle mesenchymal stem cells (∼3.5% of nuclei). Finally, we overlay these chromatin accessibility maps on GWAS data to nominate causal cell types, SNPs, transcription factor motifs, and target genes for type 2 diabetes signals.

The retinal fundus is a window for human in vivo noninvasive assessment of the microvasculature. Large-scale complementary machine learning-based assessment of the retinal vasculature with phenome-wide and genome-wide analyses may yield new insights into human health and disease.We used 97 895 retinal fundus images from 54 813 UK Biobank participants. Using convolutional neural networks to segment the retinal microvasculature, we calculated vascular density and fractal dimension as a measure of vascular branching complexity. We associated these indices with 1866 incidentInternational Classification of Diseases-based conditions (median 10-year follow-up) and 88 quantitative traits, adjusting for age, sex, smoking status, and ethnicity.Low retinal vascular fractal dimension and density were significantly associated with higher risks for incident mortality, hypertension, congestive heart failure, renal failure, type 2 diabetes, sleep apnea, anemia, and multiple ocular conditions, as well as corresponding quantitative traits. Genome-wide association of vascular fractal dimension and density identified 7 and 13 novel loci, respectively, that were enriched for pathways linked to angiogenesis (eg, vascular endothelial growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor receptor, angiopoietin, and WNT signaling pathways) and inflammation (eg, interleukin, cytokine signaling).Our results indicate that the retinal vasculature may serve as a biomarker for future cardiometabolic and ocular disease and provide insights into genes and biological pathways influencing microvascular indices.

For all treatment approaches, behaviour change techniques, reduction in energy intake, and increasing energy expenditure are required. Self-monitoring of diet and physical activity provides an effective behaviour change technique for weight management. Digital tools increase engagement rates for self-monitoring and have the potential to improve weight management.

"34991667","Universal annotation of the human genome through integration of over a thousand epigenomic datasets.","Genome Biol","Genome-wide maps of chromatin marks such as histone modifications and open chromatin sites provide valuable information for annotating the non-coding genome, including identifying regulatory elements. Computational approaches such as ChromHMM have been applied to discover and annotate chromatin states defined by combinatorial and spatial patterns of chromatin marks within the same cell type. An alternative ""stacked modeling"" approach was previously suggested, where chromatin states are defined jointly from datasets of multiple cell types to produce a single universal genome annotation based on all datasets. Despite its potential benefits for applications that are not specific to one cell type, such an approach was previously applied only for small-scale specialized purposes. Large-scale applications of stacked modeling have previously posed scalability challenges.Using a version of ChromHMM enhanced for large-scale applications, we apply the stacked modeling approach to produce a universal chromatin state annotation of the human genome using over 1000 datasets from more than 100 cell types, with the learned model denoted as the full-stack model. The full-stack model states show distinct enrichments for external genomic annotations, which we use in characterizing each state. Compared to per-cell-type annotations, the full-stack annotations directly differentiate constitutive from cell type-specific activity and is more predictive of locations of external genomic annotations.The full-stack ChromHMM model provides a universal chromatin state annotation of the genome and a unified global view of over 1000 datasets.

Coding variants in the FTO gene, on the other hand, have been little explored, although data from complete sequencing of the exomes of various populations are available in public databases and provide an excellent opportunity to investigate potential functional variants in FTO. In this context, this study aimed to track nonsynonymous variants in the exons of the FTO gene in different population groups employing the gnomAD database and analyze the potential functional impact of these variants on the FTO protein using five publicly available pathogenicity prediction programs. The findings revealed 345 rare mutations, of which 321 are missense (93%), 19 are stop gained (5.6%) and five mutations are located in the splice region (1.4%). Of these, 134 (38.8%) were classified as pathogenic, 144 (41.7%) as benign and 67 (19.5%) as unknown. The available data, however, suggest that these variants are probably not associated with BMI and obesity, but instead, with other diseases. Functional studies are, therefore, required to identify the role of these variants in disease genesis."
"34895148","Regulatory modules of human thermogenic adipocytes: functional genomics of large cohort and Meta-analysis derived marker-genes.","BMC Genomics","Recently, ProFAT and BATLAS studies identified brown and white adipocytes marker genes based on analysis of large databases. They offered scores to determine the thermogenic status of adipocytes using the gene-expression data of these markers. In this work, we investigated the functional context of these genes.Gene Set Enrichment Analyses (KEGG, Reactome) of the BATLAS and ProFAT marker-genes identified pathways deterministic in the formation of brown and white adipocytes. The collection of the annotated proteins of the defined pathways resulted in expanded white and brown characteristic protein-sets, which theoretically contain all functional proteins that could be involved in the formation of adipocytes. Based on our previously obtained RNA-seq data, we visualized the expression profile of these proteins coding genes and found patterns consistent with the two adipocyte phenotypes. The trajectory of the regulatory processes could be outlined by the transcriptional profile of progenitor and differentiated adipocytes, highlighting the importance of suppression processes in browning. Protein interaction network-based functional genomics by STRING, Cytoscape and R-Igraph platforms revealed that different biological processes shape the brown and white adipocytes and highlighted key regulatory elements and modules including GAPDH-CS, DECR1, SOD2, IL6, HRAS, MTOR, INS-AKT, ERBB2 and 4-NFKB, and SLIT-ROBO-MAPK. To assess the potential role of a particular protein in shaping adipocytes, we assigned interaction network location-based scores (betweenness centrality, number of bridges) to them and created a freely accessible platform, the AdipoNET ( https//adiponet.com ), to conveniently use these data. The Eukaryote Promoter Database predicted the response elements in the UCP1 promoter for the identified, potentially important transcription factors (HIF1A, MYC, REL, PPARG, TP53, AR, RUNX, and FoxO1).Our integrative approach-based results allowed us to investigate potential regulatory elements of thermogenesis in adipose tissue. The analyses revealed that some unique biological processes form the brown and white adipocyte phenotypes, which presumes the existence of the transitional states. The data also suggests that the two phenotypes are not mutually exclusive, and differentiation of thermogenic adipocyte requires induction of browning as well as repressions of whitening. The recognition of these simultaneous actions and the identified regulatory modules can open new direction in obesity research.© 2021. The Author(s)."

Therapeutic advantages of SmartExo@Bmp7 were proved by targeted delivering Bmp7 mRNA to omental adipose tissue (OAT) of obese C57BL/6 mice for browning induction. SmartExo platform was successfully constructed without changing the basic characteristics of exosomes. The engineered exosomes effectively escaped from the phagocytosis by RAW264.7 and non-target organs. In addition, the SmartExo could be uptaken locally on-demand by ultrasound mediated removal of the stealth coat. Compared with control exosomes, SmartExo@Bmp7 effectively delivered Bmp7 mRNA into OAT upon ultrasound irradiation, and induced OAT browning, as evidenced by the histology of OAT and increased expression of uncoupling protein 1 (Ucp1).The proposed SmartExo-based delivery platform, which minimizes side effects and maximizing drug efficacy, offers a novel safe and efficient approach for targeted drug delivery. As a proof, the SmartExo@Bmp7 induced local white adipose tissue browning, and it would be a promising strategy for anti-obesity therapy.© 2021. The Author(s)."
"34821371","Molecular modelling of novel ADCY3 variant predicts a molecular target for tackling obesity.","Int J Mol Med","Severe early‑onset obesity is mainly attributed to single gene variations of the hypothalamic leptin‑melanocortin system, which is critical for controlling the balance between appetite and energy expenditure. Adenylate cyclase 3 (ADCY3), a transmembrane enzyme localized in primary neuronal cilia, is a key genetic candidate, which appears to have an essential role in regulating body weight. The present study aimed to identify ADCY3 genetic variants in severely obese young patients of Greek‑Cypriot origin by genomic sequencing. Apart from previously reported variants, the novel and probably pathogenic variant c.349T>A, causing a p.Leu117Met substitution within one of the two pseudo‑symmetric halves of the transmembrane part of the protein, was reported. Molecular modelling analysis used to delineate bonding interactions within the mutated protein structure strongly suggested a change in interactive forces and energy levels affecting the pseudo‑twofold symmetry of the transmembrane domain of the protein and probably its catalytic function. These results support the involvement of ADCY3 in the pathology of the disease and point towards the requirement of defining protein function and evaluating the clinical significance of the detected variants."

Independent single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with the metabolic and lifestyle factors at the p < 5 × 10-8were selected as instrument variables. Summary-level data for senile cataract were obtained from the FinnGen consortium (20,157 cases and 154,905 non-cases) and UK Biobank study (6332 cases and 354,862 non-cases). Higher genetically predicted BMI and SBP and genetic predisposition to T2D and smoking initiation were associated with an increased risk of senile cataract. The combined odds ratios were 1.19 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.09-1.29; p < 0.001) per one standard deviation increase in BMI (~ 4.8 kg/m2), 1.13 (95% CI 1.04-1.23; p = 0.004) per 10 mmHg increase in SBP, 1.06 (95% CI 1.03-1.09; p < 0.001) per one unit increase in log-transformed odds ratio of T2D, and 1.19 (95% CI 1.10-1.29; p < 0.001) per one standard deviation increase in prevalence of smoking initiation. Genetically predicted coffee consumption showed a suggestive association with senile cataract (odds ratio per 50% increase, 1.18, 95% CI 1.00-1.40; p = 0.050). This study suggests causal roles of obesity, T2D, SBP and smoking in senile cataract.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"34999873","Is genetic liability to ADHD and ASD causally linked to educational attainment?","Int J Epidemiol","The association patterns of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) with educational attainment (EA) are complex; children with ADHD and ASD are at risk of poor academic outcomes, and parental EA has been associated with risk of ADHD/ASD in the offspring. Little is known on the causal links between ADHD, ASD, EA and the potential contribution of cognitive ability.Using the latest genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary data on ADHD, ASD and EA, we applied two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) to assess the effects of genetic liability to ADHD and ASD on EA. Reverse direction analyses were additionally performed. Multivariable MR was performed to estimate any effects independent of cognitive ability.Genetic liability to ADHD had a negative effect on EA, independently of cognitive ability (MVMRIVW: -1.7 months of education per doubling of genetic liability to ADHD; 95% CI: -2.8 to -0.7), whereas genetic liability to ASD a positive effect (MVMRIVW: 30 days per doubling of the genetic liability to ASD; 95% CI: 2 to 53). Reverse direction analyses suggested that genetic liability to higher EA had an effect on lower risk of ADHD, independently of cognitive ability (MVMRIVWOR: 0.33 per SD increase; 95% CI: 0.26 to 0.43) and increased risk of ASD (MRIVWOR: 1.51 per SD increase; 95% CI: 1.29 to 1.77), which was partly explained by cognitive ability (MVMRIVWOR per SD increase: 1.24; 95%CI: 0.96 to 1.60).Genetic liability to ADHD and ASD is likely to affect educational attainment, independently of underlying cognitive ability.© The Author(s) 2021.

"34997191","Genetic heterogeneity and subtypes of major depression.","Mol Psychiatry","Major depression (MD) is a heterogeneous disorder; however, the extent to which genetic factors distinguish MD patient subgroups (genetic heterogeneity) remains uncertain. This study sought evidence for genetic heterogeneity in MD. Using UK Biobank cohort, the authors defined 16 MD subtypes within eight comparison groups (vegetative symptoms, symptom severity, comorbid anxiety disorder, age at onset, recurrence, suicidality, impairment, and postpartum depression; N ~ 3000-47000). To compare genetic component of these subtypes, subtype-specific genome-wide association studies were performed to estimate SNP-heritability, and genetic correlations within subtype comparison and with other related disorders/traits. The findings indicated that MD subtypes were divergent in their SNP-heritability, and genetic correlations both within subtype comparisons and with other related disorders/traits. Three subtype comparisons (vegetative symptoms, age at onset, and impairment) showed significant differences in SNP-heritability; while genetic correlations within subtype comparisons ranged from 0.55 to 0.86, suggesting genetic profiles are only partially shared among MD subtypes. Furthermore, subtypes that are more clinically challenging, e.g., early-onset, recurrent, suicidal, more severely impaired, had stronger genetic correlations with other psychiatric disorders. MD with atypical-like features showed a positive genetic correlation (+0.40) with BMI while a negative correlation (-0.09) was found in those without atypical-like features. Novel genomic loci with subtype-specific effects were identified. These results provide the most comprehensive evidence to date for genetic heterogeneity within MD, and suggest that the phenotypic complexity of MD can be effectively reduced by studying the subtypes which share partially distinct etiologies.© 2021.

"34975738","Genome-Wide Association Study of 2,093 Cases With Idiopathic Polyneuropathy and 445,256 Controls Identifies First Susceptibility Loci.","Front Neurol","Background:About one third of patients with chronic polyneuropathy have no obvious underlying etiology and are classified as having idiopathic polyneuropathy. The lack of knowledge about pathomechanisms and predisposing factors limits the development of effective prevention and treatment for these patients. We report the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) of idiopathic polyneuropathy.Methods:Cases with idiopathic polyneuropathy and healthy controls were identified by linkage to hospital records. We performed genome-wide association studies using genetic data from two large population-based health studies, the Trøndelag Health Study (HUNT, 1,147 cases and 62,204 controls) and UK Biobank (UKB, 946 cases and 383,052 controls). In a two-stage analysis design, we first treated HUNT as a discovery cohort and UK Biobank as a replication cohort. Secondly, we combined the two studies in a meta-analysis. Downstream analyses included genetic correlation to other traits and diseases. We specifically examined previously reported risk loci, and genes known to cause hereditary polyneuropathy.Results:No replicable risk loci were identified in the discovery-replication stage, in line with the limited predicted power of this approach. When combined in a meta-analysis, two independent loci reached statistical significance (rs7294354 inB4GALNT3, P-value 4.51 × 10-8) and (rs147738081 nearNR5A2, P-value 4.75 × 10-8). Idiopathic polyneuropathy genetically correlated with several anthropometric measures, most pronounced for height, and with several pain-related traits.Conclusions:In this first GWAS of idiopathic polyneuropathy we identify two risk-loci that indicate possible pathogenetic mechanisms.

We then performed genome-wide association studies of AAo maximum area, AAo minimum area and AAo distensibility in up to 37,910 individuals from the UK Biobank. Variants that were significantly associated with AAo phenotypes were used as instrumental variables in Mendelian randomization analyses to investigate potential causal relationships with coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, stroke and aneurysms.Genome-wide association studies revealed a total of 107 SNPs in 78 loci. We annotated 101 candidate genes involved in various biological processes, including connective tissue development (THSD4 and COL6A3). Mendelian randomization analyses showed a causal association with aneurysm development, but not with other vascular diseases.We identified 78 loci that provide insights into mechanisms underlying AAo size and function in the general population and provide genetic evidence for their role in aortic aneurysm development.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).

Our present aim was to investigate the genomic background of these two aspects of perseverative negative thinking within separate groups of individuals with suboptimal versus optimal folate intake. We conducted a genome-wide association study in the UK Biobank database (n= 72,621) on the ""rumination"" and ""worry"" items of the Eysenck Personality Inventory Neuroticism scale in these separate groups. Optimal folate intake was related to lower worry, but unrelated to rumination. In contrast, genetic associations for worry did not implicate specific biological processes, while past-oriented rumination had a more specific genetic background, emphasizing its endophenotypic nature. Furthermore, biological pathways leading to rumination appeared to differ according to folate intake: purinergic signaling and circadian regulator geneARNTLemerged in the whole sample, blastocyst development, DNA replication, and C-C chemokines in the suboptimal folate group, and prostaglandin response and K+channel subunit geneKCNH3in the optimal folate group. Our results point to possible benefits of folate in anxiety disorders, and to the importance of simultaneously taking into account genetic and environmental factors to determine personalized intervention in polygenic and multifactorial disorders."

We studied stool frequency (defined by the number of bowel movements per day, based on questionnaire data) as a proxy for gut motility in a GWAS meta-analysis including 167,875 individuals from UK Biobank and four smaller population-based cohorts. We identify 14 loci associated with stool frequency (p ≤ 5.0 × 10-8). Gene set and pathway analyses detected enrichment for genes involved in neurotransmitter/neuropeptide signaling and preferentially expressed in enteric motor neurons controlling peristalsis. PheWAS identified pleiotropic associations with dysmotility syndromes and the response to their pharmacological treatment. The genetic architecture of stool frequency correlates with that of IBS, and UK Biobank participants from the top 1% of stool frequency polygenic score distribution were associated with 5× higher risk of IBS with diarrhea. These findings pave the way for the identification of actionable pathological mechanisms in IBS and the dysmotility syndromes.© 2021 The Author(s)."
"34957434","Machine learning enables new insights into genetic contributions to liver fat accumulation.","Cell Genom","Excess liver fat, called hepatic steatosis, is a leading risk factor for end-stage liver disease and cardiometabolic diseases but often remains undiagnosed in clinical practice because of the need for direct imaging assessments. We developed an abdominal MRI-based machine-learning algorithm to accurately estimate liver fat (correlation coefficients, 0.97-0.99) from a truth dataset of 4,511 middle-aged UK Biobank participants, enabling quantification in 32,192 additional individuals. 17% of participants had predicted liver fat levels indicative of steatosis, and liver fat could not have been reliably estimated based on clinical factors such as BMI. A genome-wide association study of common genetic variants and liver fat replicated three known associations and identified five newly associated variants in or near theMTARC1,ADH1B,TRIB1,GPAM, andMAST3genes (p < 3 × 10-8). A polygenic score integrating these eight genetic variants was strongly associated with future risk of chronic liver disease (hazard ratio > 1.32 per SD score, p < 9 × 10-17). Rare inactivating variants in theAPOBorMTTPgenes were identified in 0.8% of individuals with steatosis and conferred more than 6-fold risk (p < 2 × 10-5), highlighting a molecular subtype of hepatic steatosis characterized by defective secretion of apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins. We demonstrate that our imaging-based machine-learning model accurately estimates liver fat and may be useful in epidemiological and genetic studies of hepatic steatosis."
"34931067","Large uncertainty in individual polygenic risk score estimation impacts PRS-based risk stratification.","Nat Genet","Although the cohort-level accuracy of polygenic risk scores (PRSs)-estimates of genetic value at the individual level-has been widely assessed, uncertainty in PRSs remains underexplored. In the present study, we show that Bayesian PRS methods can estimate the variance of an individual's PRS and can yield well-calibrated credible intervals via posterior sampling. For 13 real traits in the UK Biobank (n = 291,273 unrelated 'white British'), we observe large variances in individual PRS estimates which impact interpretation of PRS-based stratification; averaging across traits, only 0.8% (s.d. = 1.6%) of individuals with PRS point estimates in the top decile have corresponding 95% credible intervals fully contained in the top decile. We provide an analytical estimator for the expectation of individual PRS variance as a function of SNP heritability, number of causal SNPs and sample size.

Mendelian randomisation, provided evidence for a causal effect between 9496 pairs of metabolic measures, mainly between lipoprotein traits. The results provide insights on the organisation of lipoproteins in three distinct classes, the heterogeneity between HDL particles, and the association, or lack of, between CLA, glycolysis markers, such as glucose and citrate, and glycoproteins with lipids subfractions. Two examples for the use of the approach in systems biology of lipoproteins are presented.Genetic variation can be used to infer the underlying mechanisms for the associations between lipoproteins for hypothesis generation and confirmation, and, together with biological information, to map complex biological processes.© 2021.

We aimed to examine the causal effect of different sleep traits on the pathogenesis of IBD.Methods:Genetic instruments for sleep traits were selected from the largest GWAS studies available in the UK Biobank (n= 449,734) and the 23andMe Research (n= 541,333). A two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study was conducted to examine the association of the genetic instruments with IBD (12,882 cases and 21,770 controls), ulcerative colitis (6,968 cases, 20,464 controls), and Crohn's disease (5,956 cases and 14,927 controls). We applied the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method to estimate causal effects, and we used the weighted median and MR-Egger method for sensitivity analyses.Results:We found that sleep duration (OR, 1.00, 95% CI 1.00-1.01), short sleep duration (OR, 1.07, 95% CI 0.41-2.83), morningness (OR, 1.05, 95% CI 0.87-1.27), daytime napping (OR, 1.64, 95% CI 0.62-4.4), frequent insomnia (OR, 1.17, 95% CI 0.8-1.72), any insomnia (OR, 1.17, 95% CI 0.69-1.97), and snoring (OR, 0.31, 95% CI 0.06-1.54) had no causal effect on IBD, and these sleep traits had no causal effect on ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease either. Most of the sensitivity analyses showed consistent results with those of the IVW method.Conclusion:Our MR study did not support the causal effect of sleep traits on IBD.

We used inverse-variance weighting with multiplicative random effects as the main analysis, and sensitivity analyses including the weighted median, MR-Egger and multivariable MR adjusted for body mass index and for smoking. For validation, we included breast (Breast Cancer Association Consortium: 133384 cases, 113789 non-cases), prostate (Prostate Cancer Association Group to Investigate Cancer Associated Alterations in the Genome Consortium: 79194 cases, 61112 non-cases) and lung (International Lung and Cancer Consortium: 10246 cases, 38295 non-cases) cancer from large consortia. We used asthma as a negative control outcome.Systolic and diastolic BP were unrelated to total cancer (OR 0.98 per standard deviation higher [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.89, 1.07] and OR 1.00 [95% CI 0.92, 1.08]) and to site-specific cancers after accounting for multiple testing, with consistent findings from consortia. BP was nominally associated with melanoma and possibly kidney cancer, and as expected, not associated with asthma. Sensitivity analyses using other MR methods gave similar results.In contrast to previous observational evidence, BP does not appear to be a risk factor for cancer, although an effect on melanoma and kidney cancer cannot be excluded.

In recent years, there has been significant progress in plant phenomics and genomics approaches for generating reliable large datasets. However, selecting an appropriate data integration and analysis method to improve the efficiency of phenome-phenome and phenome-genome association studies is still a bottleneck. This study proposes a hyperspectral wide association study (HypWAS) approach as a phenome-phenome association analysis through a hierarchical data integration strategy to estimate the prediction power of hyperspectral reflectance bands in predicting soybean seed yield. Using HypWAS, five important hyperspectral reflectance bands in visible, red-edge, and near-infrared regions were identified significantly associated with seed yield. The phenome-genome association analysis of each tested hyperspectral reflectance band was performed using two conventional genome-wide association studies (GWAS) methods and a machine learning mediated GWAS based on the support vector regression (SVR) method. Using SVR-mediated GWAS, more relevant QTL with the physiological background of the tested hyperspectral reflectance bands were detected, supported by the functional annotation of candidate gene analyses. The results of this study have indicated the advantages of using hierarchical data integration strategy and advanced mathematical methods coupled with phenome-phenome and phenome-genome association analyses for a better understanding of the biology and genetic backgrounds of hyperspectral reflectance bands affecting soybean yield formation. The identified yield-related hyperspectral reflectance bands using HypWAS can be used as indirect selection criteria for selecting superior genotypes with improved yield genetic gains in large breeding populations.Copyright © 2021 Yoosefzadeh-Najafabadi, Torabi, Tulpan, Rajcan and Eskandari."

However, the result may be affected by confounders or reverse causality.Methods:We performed univariable MR (uvMR), multivariable MR (mvMR) and bidirectional two-sample MR to jointly estimate the causality of lung function with AF. Apart from the inverse variance weighted (IVW) approach as the main MR analysis, three complementary sensitive analyses approaches including MR-Egger regression, weighted median (WM) MR and Pleiotropy Residual Sum and Outlier (MR-PRESSO) in uvMR as well as mvMR-Egger and mvMR-PRESSO in mvMR were applied to control for pleiotropy. Linkage disequilibrium score (LDSC) regression was applied to estimate genetic correlation between lung function and AF.Results:All forward and reverse uvMR analyses consistently suggested absent causal relations between lung function and AF risk [forward IVW: odds ratio (OR)FEV1= 1.031, 95% CI = 0.909-1.169,P= 0.630; ORFVC= 1.002, 95% CI = 0.834-1.204,P= 0.982; ORFEV1/FVC= 1.076, 95% CI = 0.966-1.199,P= 0.182; reverse IVW: ORFEV1= 0.986, 95% CI = 0.966-1.007,P= 0.187; ORFVC= 0.985, 95% CI = 0.965-1.006,P= 0.158; ORFEV1/FVC= 0.994, 95% CI = 0.973-1.015,P= 0.545]. The forward MR-Egger showed that each standard deviation (SD) increase in FEV1/FVC was related to a higher AF risk (OR = 1.502, 95% CI = 1.178-1.915,P= 0.006) without heterogeneity (Q_pval = 0.064), but pleiotropy effect exist (intercept = -0.017,P= 0.012). However, this significant effect disappeared after adjustment of FEV1 and FVC (OR = 1.523, 95% CI = 0.445-5.217,P= 0.503) in mvMR. No evidence was found for independent causal effects of FEV1 and FVC on AF in mvMR analysis by using mvIVW method (ORFEV1= 0.501, 95% CI = 0.056-4.457,P= 0.496; ORFVC= 1.969, 95% CI = 0.288-13.474,P= 0.490). Notably, the association between lung function and AF were replicated using the FinnGen cohort data.Conclusions:Our findings reported no coheritability between lung function and AF, and failed to find substantial causal relation between decreased lung function and risk of AF.

We explore methods for performing association studies applicable to such genetic data and investigate how using different priors when estimating genotype probabilities affects the association results.Our proposed method, ANGSD-asso's latent model, models the unobserved genotype as a latent variable in a generalised linear model framework. The software is implemented in C/C ++ and can be run multi-threaded. ANGSD-asso is based on genotype probabilities, which can be estimated using either the sample allele frequency or the individual allele frequencies as a prior. We explore through simulations how genotype probability-based methods compare to using genetic dosages.Our simulations show that in a structured population using the individual allele frequency prior has better power than the sample allele frequency. In scenarios with sequencing depth and phenotype correlation ANGSD-asso's latent model has higher statistical power and less bias than using dosages. Adding additional covariates to the linear model of ANGSD-asso's latent model has higher statistical power and less bias than other methods that accommodate genotype uncertainty, while also being much faster.

"34859065","Shared Genetic Liability and Causal Associations Between Major Depressive Disorder and Cardiovascular Diseases.","Front Cardiovasc Med","Major depressive disorder (MDD) is phenotypically associated with cardiovascular diseases (CVD). We aim to investigate mechanisms underlying relationships between MDD and CVD in the context of shared genetic variations. Polygenic overlap analysis was used to test genetic correlation and to analyze shared genetic variations between MDD and seven cardiovascular outcomes (coronary artery disease (CAD), heart failure, atrial fibrillation, stroke, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and pulse pressure measurement). Mendelian randomization analysis was used to uncover causal relationships between MDD and cardiovascular traits. By cross-trait meta-analysis, we identified a set of genomic loci shared between the traits of MDD and stroke. Putative causal genes for MDD and stroke were prioritized by fine-mapping of transcriptome-wide associations. Polygenic overlap analysis pointed toward substantial genetic variation overlap between MDD and CVD. Mendelian randomization analysis indicated that genetic liability to MDD has a causal effect on CAD and stroke. Comparison of genome-wide genes shared by MDD and CVD suggests 20q12 as a pleiotropic region conferring risk for both MDD and CVD. Cross-trait meta-analyses and fine-mapping of transcriptome-wide association signals identified novel risk genes for MDD and stroke, includingRPL31P12, BORSC7, PNPT11, andPGF. Many genetic variations associated with MDD and CVD outcomes are shared, thus, pointing that genetic liability to MDD may also confer risk for stroke and CAD.

"34855049","Genetic Risk for Smoking: Disentangling Interplay Between Genes and Socioeconomic Status.","Behav Genet","This study aims to disentangle the contribution of genetic liability, educational attainment (EA), and their overlap and interaction in lifetime smoking. We conducted genome-wide association studies (GWASs) in UK Biobank (N = 394,718) to (i) capture variants for lifetime smoking, (ii) variants for EA, and (iii) variants that contribute to lifetime smoking independently from EA ('smoking-without-EA'). Based on the GWASs, three polygenic scores (PGSs) were created for individuals from the Netherlands Twin Register (NTR, N = 17,805) and the Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study-2 (NEMESIS-2, N = 3090). We tested gene-environment (G × E) interactions between each PGS, neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES) and EA on lifetime smoking. To assess if the PGS effects were specific to smoking or had broader implications, we repeated the analyses with measures of mental health. After subtracting EA effects from the smoking GWAS, the SNP-based heritability decreased from 9.2 to 7.2%. The genetic correlation between smoking and SES characteristics was reduced, whereas overlap with smoking traits was less affected by subtracting EA. The PGSs for smoking, EA, and smoking-without-EA all predicted smoking. For mental health, only the PGS for EA was a reliable predictor. There were suggestions for G × E for some relationships, but there were no clear patterns per PGS type. This study showed that the genetic architecture of smoking has an EA component in addition to other, possibly more direct components. PGSs based on EA and smoking-without-EA had distinct predictive profiles. This study shows how disentangling different models of genetic liability and interplay can contribute to our understanding of the etiology of smoking.© 2021. The Author(s)."
"34849862","Sporadic occurrence of recent selective sweeps from standing variation in humans as revealed by an approximate Bayesian computation approach.","Genetics","During their dispersals over the last 100,000 years, modern humans have been exposed to a large variety of environments, resulting in genetic adaptation. While genome-wide scans for the footprints of positive Darwinian selection have increased knowledge of genes and functions potentially involved in human local adaptation, they have globally produced evidence of a limited contribution of selective sweeps in humans. Conversely, studies based on machine learning algorithms suggest that recent sweeps from standing variation are widespread in humans, an observation that has been recently questioned. Here, we sought to formally quantify the number of recent selective sweeps in humans, by leveraging approximate Bayesian computation and whole-genome sequence data. Our computer simulations revealed suitable ABC estimations, regardless of the frequency of the selected alleles at the onset of selection and the completion of sweeps. Under a model of recent selection from standing variation, we inferred that an average of 68 (from 56 to 79) and 140 (from 94 to 198) sweeps occurred over the last 100,000 years of human history, in African and Eurasian populations, respectively. The former estimation is compatible with human adaptation rates estimated since divergence with chimps, and reveals numbers of sweeps per generation per site in the range of values estimated in Drosophila. Our results confirm the rarity of selective sweeps in humans and show a low contribution of sweeps from standing variation to recent human adaptation.© The Author(s) 2021.

However, the molecular contribution to age-related hearing loss is not fully elucidated.We performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for hearing loss-related traits in the UK Biobank (N = 362,396) and selected a high confidence set of ten hearing-associated gene products for staining in human cochlear samples: EYA4, LMX1A, PTK2/FAK, UBE3B, MMP2, SYNJ2, GRM5, TRIOBP, LMO-7, and NOX4.All proteins were found to be expressed in human cochlear structures. Our findings illustrate cochlear structures that mediate mechano-electric transduction of auditory stimuli, neuronal conductance, and neuronal plasticity to be involved in age-related hearing loss.Our results suggest common genetic variation to influence structural resilience to damage as well as cochlear recovery after trauma, which protect against accumulated damage to cochlear structures and the development of hearing loss over time.© 2021.

"34784738","Investigating a Potential Causal Relationship Between Maternal Blood Pressure During Pregnancy and Future Offspring Cardiometabolic Health.","Hypertension","Observational epidemiological studies have reported that higher maternal blood pressure (BP) during pregnancy is associated with increased future risk of offspring cardiometabolic disease. However, it is unclear whether this association represents a causal relationship through intrauterine mechanisms. We used a Mendelian randomization (MR) framework to examine the relationship between unweighted maternal genetic scores for systolic BP and diastolic BP and a range of cardiometabolic risk factors in the offspring of up to 29 708 genotyped mother-offspring pairs from the UKB study (UK Biobank) and the HUNT study (Trøndelag Health). We conducted similar analyses in up to 21 423 father-offspring pairs from the same cohorts. We confirmed that the BP-associated genetic variants from the general population sample also had similar effects on maternal BP during pregnancy in independent cohorts. We did not detect any association between maternal (or paternal) unweighted genetic scores and cardiometabolic offspring outcomes in the meta-analysis of UKB and HUNT after adjusting for offspring genotypes at the same loci. We find little evidence to support the notion that maternal BP is a major causal risk factor for adverse offspring cardiometabolic outcomes in later life."
"34867434","Fetal Undernutrition Programming, Sympathetic Nerve Activity, and Arterial Hypertension Development.","Front Physiol","A wealth of evidence showed that low birth weight is associated with environmental disruption during gestation, triggering embryotic or fetal adaptations and increasing the susceptibility of progeny to non-communicable diseases, including metabolic and cardiovascular diseases, obesity, and arterial hypertension. In addition, dietary disturbance during pregnancy in animal models has highlighted mechanisms that involve the genesis of arterial hypertension, particularly severe maternal low-protein intake (LP). Functional studies demonstrated that maternal low-protein intake leads to the renal decrease of sodium excretion and the dysfunction of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system signaling of LP offspring. The antinatriuretic effect is accentuated by a reduced number of nephron units and glomerulosclerosis, which are critical in establishing arterial hypertension phenotype. Also, in this way, studies have shown that the overactivity of the central and peripheral sympathetic nervous system occurs due to reduced sensory (afferent) renal nerve activity. As a result of this reciprocal and abnormal renorenal reflex, there is an enhanced tubule sodium proximal sodium reabsorption, which, at least in part, contributes directly to arterial hypertension development in some of the programmed models. A recent study has observed that significant changes in adrenal medulla secretion could be involved in the pathophysiological process of increasing blood pressure. Thus, this review aims to compile studies that link the central and peripheral sympathetic system activity mechanisms on water and salt handle and blood pressure control in the maternal protein-restricted offspring. Besides, these pathophysiological mechanisms mainly may involve the modulation of neurokinins and catecholamines pathways.Copyright © 2021 Mariano, Boer and Gontijo."
"34828409","A Genome-Wide Association Study of a Korean Population Identifies Genetic Susceptibility to Hypertension Based on Sex-Specific Differences.","Genes (Basel)","Genome-wide association studies have expanded our understanding of the genetic variation of hypertension. Hypertension and blood pressure are influenced by sex-specific differences; therefore, genetic variants may have sex-specific effects on phenotype. To identify the genetic factors influencing the sex-specific differences concerning hypertension, we conducted a heterogeneity analysis of a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on 13,926 samples from a Korean population. Using the Illumina exome chip data of the population, we performed GWASs of the male and female population independently and applied a statistical test that identified heterogeneous effects of the variants between the two groups. To gain information about the biological implication of the genetic heterogeneity, we used gene set enrichment analysis with GWAS catalog and pathway gene sets. The heterogeneity analysis revealed that the rs11066015 of ACAD10 was a significant locus that had sex-specific genetic effects on the development of hypertension. The rs2074356 of HECTD4 also showed significant genetic heterogeneity in systolic blood pressure. The enrichment analysis showed significant results that are consistent with the pathophysiology of hypertension. These results indicate a sex-specific genetic susceptibility to hypertension that should be considered in future genetic studies of hypertension."

The Kulubnarti Nubians had ~43% Nilotic-related ancestry (individual variation between ~36-54%) with the remaining ancestry consistent with being  introduced through Egypt and ultimately deriving from an ancestry pool like that found in the Bronze and Iron Age Levant. The Kulubnarti gene pool - shaped over a millennium - harbors disproportionately female-associated West Eurasian-related ancestry. Genetic similarity among individuals from the two cemeteries supports a hypothesis of social division without genetic distinction. Seven pairs of inter-cemetery relatives suggest fluidity between cemetery groups. Present-day Nubians are not directly descended from the Kulubnarti Nubians, attesting to additional genetic input since the Christian Period.© 2021. The Author(s)."

We wanted to confirm these findings inGpr75KO mice and determine whether decreased energy intake and/or increased energy expenditure contributed to the thin phenotype.Gpr75KO mice were generated by homologous recombination. All studies compared female and maleGpr75KO mice to their wild type (WT) littermates. Body composition was measured by DXA and QMR technologies. Glucose homeostasis was evaluated by measuring glucose and insulin levels during oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs). Food intake was measured in group-housed mice. In singly housed mice, energy expenditure was measured in Oxymax indirect calorimetry chambers, and locomotor activity was measured in Oxymax and Photobeam Activity System chambers.In all 12 cohorts of adult female or male mice,Gpr75KO mice had less body fat; pooled data showed that, compared to WT littermates (n = 103),Gpr75KO mice (n = 118) had 49% less body fat and 4% less LBM (P< 0.001 for each). KO mice also had 8% less body fat at weaning (P < 0.05), and during the month after weaning as the thin phenotype became more exaggerated,Gpr75KO mice ate significantly less than, but had energy expenditure and activity levels comparable to, their WT littermates. During OGTTs,Gpr75KO mice showed improved glucose tolerance (glucose AUC 23% lower in females,P< 0.05, and 26% lower in males, P < 0.001), accompanied by significantly decreased insulin levels and significantly increased insulin sensitivity indices.Gpr75KO mice are thin at weaning, are hypophagic as the thin phenotype becomes more exaggerated, and exhibit improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity as healthy-appearing adults. These results suggest that inhibiting GPR75 in obese humans may safely decrease energy intake and body fat while improving glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity.© 2022 Powell et al."
"34993570","Do gene-environment interactions have implications for the precision prevention of type 2 diabetes?","Diabetologia","The past decades have seen a rapid global rise in the incidence of type 2 diabetes. This surge has been driven by diabetogenic environmental changes that may act together with a genetic predisposition to type 2 diabetes. It is possible that there is a synergistic gene-environment interaction, where the effects of the diabetogenic environment depend on the genetic predisposition to type 2 diabetes. Randomised trials have shown that it is possible to delay, or even prevent the development of type 2 diabetes in individuals at elevated risk through behavioural modification, focusing on weight loss, physical activity and diet. There is wide heterogeneity between individuals regarding the effectiveness of these interventions, which could, in part, be due to genetic differences. However, the studies of gene-environment interactions performed thus far suggest that behavioural modifications appear equally effective in reducing the incidence of type 2 diabetes from the stage of impaired glucose tolerance, regardless of the known underlying genetic predisposition. Recent studies suggest that there may be several subtypes of type 2 diabetes, which give new opportunities for gaining insight into gene-environment interactions. At present, the role of gene-environment interactions in the development of type 2 diabetes remains unclear. With many puzzle pieces missing in the general picture of type 2 diabetes development, the available evidence of gene-environment interactions is not ready for translation to individualised type 2 diabetes prevention based on genetic profiling.© 2022.

"34917125","A Genetic Map of the Modern Urban Society of Amsterdam.","Front Genet","Genetic differences between individuals underlie susceptibility to many diseases. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have discovered many susceptibility genes but were often limited to cohorts of predominantly European ancestry. Genetic diversity between individuals due to different ancestries and evolutionary histories shows that this approach has limitations. In order to gain a better understanding of the associated genetic variation, we need a more global genomics approach including a greater diversity. Here, we introduce the Healthy Life in an Urban Setting (HELIUS) cohort. The HELIUS cohort consists of participants living in Amsterdam, with a level of diversity that reflects the Dutch colonial and recent migration past. The current study includes 10,283 participants with genetic data available from seven groups of inhabitants, namely, Dutch, African Surinamese, South-Asian Surinamese, Turkish, Moroccan, Ghanaian, and Javanese Surinamese. First, we describe the genetic variation and admixture within the HELIUS cohort. Second, we show the challenges during imputation when having a genetically diverse cohort. Third, we conduct a body mass index (BMI) and height GWAS where we investigate the effects of a joint analysis of the entire cohort and a meta-analysis approach for the different subgroups. Finally, we construct polygenic scores for BMI and height and compare their predictive power across the different ethnic groups. Overall, we give a comprehensive overview of a genetically diverse cohort from Amsterdam. Our study emphasizes the importance of a less biased and more realistic representation of urban populations for mapping genetic associations with complex traits and disease risk for all.Copyright © 2021 Ferwerda, Abdellaoui, Nieuwdorp and Zwinderman."

We aim to characterize the contribution of this system to gene regulation in early human development and germ cells.Here, after studying genes driven by the long terminal repeat (LTR) of endogenous retroviruses, we identify the ape-restricted ZNF676 as the sequence-specific repressor of a subset of contemporary LTR12 integrants responsible for a large fraction of transpochimeric gene transcripts (TcGTs) generated during human early embryogenesis. We go on to reveal that the binding of this KZFP correlates with the epigenetic marking of these TEeRS in the germline, and is crucial to the control of genes involved in ciliogenesis/flagellogenesis, a biological process that dates back to the last common ancestor of eukaryotes.These results illustrate how KZFPs and their TE targets contribute to the evolutionary turnover of transcription networks and participate in the transgenerational inheritance of epigenetic traits.© 2022.

"35025913","GC content of plant genes is linked to past gene duplications.","PLoS One","The frequency of G and C nucleotides in genomes varies from species to species, and sometimes even between different genes in the same genome. The monocot grasses have a bimodal distribution of genic GC content absent in dicots. We categorized plant genes from 5 dicots and 4 monocot grasses by synteny to related species and determined that syntenic genes have significantly higher GC content than non-syntenic genes at their 5`-end in the third position within codons for all 9 species. Lower GC content is correlated with gene duplication, as lack of synteny to distantly related genomes is associated with past interspersed gene duplications. Two mutation types can account for biased GC content, mutation of methylated C to T and gene conversion from A to G. Gene conversion involves non-reciprocal exchanges between homologous alleles and is not detectable when the alleles are identical or heterozygous for presence-absence variation, both likely situations for genes duplicated to new loci. Gene duplication can cause production of siRNA which can induce targeted methylation, elevating mC→T mutations. Recently duplicated plant genes are more frequently methylated and less likely to undergo gene conversion, each of these factors synergistically creating a mutational environment favoring AT nucleotides. The syntenic genes with high GC content in the grasses compose a subset that have undergone few duplications, or for which duplicate copies were purged by selection. We propose a ""biased gene duplication / biased mutation"" (BDBM) model that may explain the origin and trajectory of the observed link between duplication and genic GC bias. The BDBM model is supported by empirical data based on joint analyses of 9 angiosperm species with their genes categorized by duplication status, GC content, methylation levels and functional classes."

Ten SNPs in vitamin D metabolic pathway genes (CYP2R1,CYP24A1,VDR,CYP27B1) were genotyped in 477 RA patients and 496 controls by improved multiple ligase detection reaction (iMLDR). The methylation levels of the promoter regions of these genes were detected in 122 RA patients and 123 controls using Illumina Hiseq platform. We found that theCYP2R1rs1993116 GA genotype,CYP27B1rs4646536 GA genotype, rs4646536 A allele frequencies were significantly increased in RA patients when compared to controls. The decreased risk of rs1993116, rs4646536 was found under the dominant mode in RA patients. However, no significant association was found betweenCYP2R1rs7936142, rs12794714,CYP24A1rs2762934, rs6068816, rs2296239, rs2296241,VDRrs11574129, rs3847987 polymorphism, and RA susceptibility. TheVDR,CYP27B1methylation levels in RA patients were significantly lower than those in controls, whileCYP2R1,CYP24A1methylation levels were not associated with RA. There were no statistical associations betweenCYP2R1,CYP24A1,VDR,CYP27B1methylation levels and their respective genotype in RA patients. In addition, plasma 25OHD level in RA patients was significantly lower than that in healthy controls.

We report high-resolution mapping of DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation, chromatin accessibility, and histone marks in developing postmitotic Purkinje cells (PCs) inMus musculus. Our data reveal new relationships between PC transcriptional and epigenetic programs, and identify a class of genes that lose both 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and 5hmC during terminal differentiation. Deletion of the 5hmC writers Tet1, Tet2, and Tet3 from postmitotic PCs prevents loss of 5mC and 5hmC in regulatory domains and gene bodies, and hinders transcriptional and epigenetic developmental transitions. Our data demonstrate that Tet-mediated active DNA demethylation occurs in vivo, and that acquisition of the precise molecular properties of adult PCs require continued oxidation of 5mC to 5hmC during the final phases of differentiation.© 2021, Stoyanova et al."
"34845222","Heterochromatin is a quantitative trait associated with spontaneous epiallele formation.","Nat Commun","Epialleles are meiotically heritable variations in expression states that are independent from changes in DNA sequence. Although they are common in plant genomes, their molecular origins are unknown. Here we show, using mutant and experimental populations, that epialleles in Arabidopsis thaliana that result from ectopic hypermethylation are due to feedback regulation of pathways that primarily function to maintain DNA methylation at heterochromatin. Perturbations to maintenance of heterochromatin methylation leads to feedback regulation of DNA methylation in genes. Using single base resolution methylomes from epigenetic recombinant inbred lines (epiRIL), we show that epiallelic variation is abundant in euchromatin, yet, associates with QTL primarily in heterochromatin regions. Mapping three-dimensional chromatin contacts shows that genes that are hotspots for ectopic hypermethylation have increases in contact frequencies with regions possessing H3K9me2. Altogether, these data show that feedback regulation of pathways that have evolved to maintain heterochromatin silencing leads to the origins of spontaneous hypermethylated epialleles.© 2021.

LINCS L1000 expression signatures provide unbiased systems/omics experimental evidence. IDG provides compiled and curated knowledge for illumination and prioritization of novel drug target hypotheses. Together, these resources can support a powerful new approach to identifying novel drug targets for complex diseases, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), which continues to inflict severe harm on human health, and resist traditional research approaches.Integrating LINCS and IDG, we built the Knowledge Graph Analytics Platform (KGAP) to support an important use case: identification and prioritization of drug target hypotheses for associated diseases. The KGAP approach includes strong semantics interpretable by domain scientists and a robust, high performance implementation of a graph database and related analytical methods. Illustrating the value of our approach, we investigated results from queries relevant to PD. Approved PD drug indications from IDG's resource DrugCentral were used as starting points for evidence paths exploring chemogenomic space via LINCS expression signatures for associated genes, evaluated as target hypotheses by integration with IDG. The KG-analytic scoring function was validated against a gold standard dataset of genes associated with PD as elucidated, published mechanism-of-action drug targets, also from DrugCentral. IDG's resource TIN-X was used to rank and filter KGAP results for novel PD targets, and one, SYNGR3 (Synaptogyrin-3), was manually investigated further as a case study and plausible new drug target for PD.The synergy of LINCS and IDG, via KG methods, empowers graph analytics methods for the investigation of the molecular basis of complex diseases, and specifically for identification and prioritization of novel drug targets. The KGAP approach enables downstream applications via integration with resources similarly aligned with modern KG methodology. The generality of the approach indicates that KGAP is applicable to many disease areas, in addition to PD, the focus of this paper.© 2022. The Author(s)."

Treatment with surgery, irradiation, and chemotherapy has improved survival in recent years, but patients are frequently left with devastating neurocognitive and other sequelae. Patients in molecular subgroups 3 and 4 still experience a high mortality rate. To identify new pathways contributing to medulloblastoma development and create new routes for therapy, we have been studying oncogenic RNA-binding proteins. We defined Musashi1 (Msi1) as one of the main drivers of medulloblastoma development. The high expression of Msi1 is prevalent in Group 4 and correlates with poor prognosis while its knockdown disrupted cancer-relevant phenotypes. Genomic analyses (RNA-seq and RIP-seq) indicated that cell cycle and division are the main biological categories regulated by Msi1 in Group 4 medulloblastoma. The most prominent Msi1 targets include CDK2, CDK6, CCND1, CDKN2A, and CCNA1. The inhibition of Msi1 with luteolin affected the growth of CHLA-01 and CHLA-01R Group 4 medulloblastoma cells and a synergistic effect was observed when luteolin and the mitosis inhibitor, vincristine, were combined. These findings indicate that a combined therapeutic strategy (Msi1 + cell cycle/division inhibitors) could work as an alternative to treat Group 4 medulloblastoma."

While optimal workflows for constructing coexpression networks, including good choices for data pre-processing, normalization, and network transformation, have been developed for microarray-based expression data, such well-tested choices do not exist for RNA-seq data. Almost all studies that compare data processing and normalization methods for RNA-seq focus on the end goal of determining differential gene expression.Here, we present a comprehensive benchmarking and analysis of 36 different workflows, each with a unique set of normalization and network transformation methods, for constructing coexpression networks from RNA-seq datasets.

We analyze the workflows in terms of aggregate performance, individual method choices, and the impact of multiple dataset experimental factors. Our results demonstrate that between-sample normalization has the biggest impact, with counts adjusted by size factors producing networks that most accurately recapitulate known tissue-naive and tissue-aware gene functional relationships.Based on this work, we provide concrete recommendations on robust procedures for building an accurate coexpression network from an RNA-seq dataset.

"34887443","Constructing gene regulatory networks using epigenetic data.","NPJ Syst Biol Appl","The biological processes that drive cellular function can be represented by a complex network of interactions between regulators (transcription factors) and their targets (genes). A cell's epigenetic state plays an important role in mediating these interactions, primarily by influencing chromatin accessibility. However, how to effectively use epigenetic data when constructing a gene regulatory network remains an open question. Almost all existing network reconstruction approaches focus on estimating transcription factor to gene connections using transcriptomic data. In contrast, computational approaches for analyzing epigenetic data generally focus on improving transcription factor binding site predictions rather than deducing regulatory network relationships. We bridged this gap by developing SPIDER, a network reconstruction approach that incorporates epigenetic data into a message-passing framework to estimate gene regulatory networks. We validated SPIDER's predictions using ChIP-seq data from ENCODE and found that SPIDER networks are both highly accurate and include cell-line-specific regulatory interactions. Notably, SPIDER can recover ChIP-seq verified transcription factor binding events in the regulatory regions of genes that do not have a corresponding sequence motif. The networks estimated by SPIDER have the potential to identify novel hypotheses that will allow us to better characterize cell-type and phenotype specific regulatory mechanisms.© 2021.

The progression of CRC is also promoted by molecular alterations and heterogeneous-yet interconnected-gene mutations, chromosomal instability, transcriptomic subtypes, and immune signatures. Genomic alterations of CRC progression lead to changes in RNA expression, which support CRC metastasis. An RNA-based classification system used for CRC, known as consensus molecular subtyping (CMS), has four classes. CMS1 has the lowest survival after relapse of the four CRC CMS phenotypes. Here, we identify gene signatures and associated coding mRNAs that are co-expressed during CMS1 CRC progression. Using RNA-seq data from CRC primary tumor samples, acquired from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we identified co-expression gene networks significantly correlated with CMS1 CRC progression. CXCL13, CXCR5, IL10, PIK3R5, PIK3AP1, CCL19, and other co-expressed genes were identified to be positively correlated with CMS1. The co-expressed eigengene networks for CMS1 were significantly and positively correlated with the TNF, WNT, and ERK1 and ERK2 signaling pathways, which together promote cell proliferation and survival. This network was also aligned with biological characteristics of CMS1 CRC, being positively correlated to right-sided tumors, microsatellite instability, chemokine-mediated signaling pathways, and immune responses. CMS1 also differentially expressed genes involved in PI3K-Akt signaling. Our findings reveal CRC gene networks related to oncogenic signaling cascades, cell activation, and positive regulation of immune responses distinguishing CMS1 from other CRC subtypes."

"34820418","Prediction of Non-canonical Routes for SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Human Placenta Cells.","Front Mol Biosci","The SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. The data available about COVID-19 during pregnancy have demonstrated placental infection; however, the mechanisms associated with intrauterine transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is still debated. Intriguingly, while canonical SARS-CoV-2 cell entry mediators are expressed at low levels in placental cells, the receptors for viruses that cause congenital infections such as the cytomegalovirus and Zika virus are highly expressed in these cells. Here we analyzed the transcriptional profile (microarray and single-cell RNA-Seq) of proteins potentially interacting with coronaviruses to identify non- canonical mediators of SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication in the placenta. Despite low levels of the canonical cell entry mediatorsACE2andTMPRSS2, we show that cells of the syncytiotrophoblast, villous cytotrophoblast, and extravillous trophoblast co-express high levels of the potential non-canonical cell-entry mediatorsDPP4andCTSL. We also found changes in the expression ofDAAM1andPAICSgenes during pregnancy, which are translated into proteins also predicted to interact with coronaviruses proteins. These results provide new insight into the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and host proteins that may act as non-canonical routes for SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication in the placenta cells.Copyright © 2021 Constantino, Cury, Nogueira, Carvalho and Justulin."
"34755877","IID 2021: towards context-specific protein interaction analyses by increased coverage, enhanced annotation and enrichment analysis.","Nucleic Acids Res","Improved bioassays have significantly increased the rate of identifying new protein-protein interactions (PPIs), and the number of detected human PPIs has greatly exceeded early estimates of human interactome size. These new PPIs provide a more complete view of disease mechanisms but precise understanding of how PPIs affect phenotype remains a challenge. It requires knowledge of PPI context (e.g. tissues, subcellular localizations), and functional roles, especially within pathways and protein complexes. The previous IID release focused on PPI context, providing networks with comprehensive tissue, disease, cellular localization, and druggability annotations. The current update adds developmental stages to the available contexts, and provides a way of assigning context to PPIs that could not be previously annotated due to insufficient data or incompatibility with available context categories (e.g. interactions between membrane and cytoplasmic proteins). This update also annotates PPIs with conservation across species, directionality in pathways, membership in large complexes, interaction stability (i.e. stable or transient), and mutation effects. Enrichment analysis is now available for all annotations, and includes multiple options; for example, context annotations can be analyzed with respect to PPIs or network proteins.

Since the release of the last version of HumanNet, many large-scale protein-protein interaction datasets have accumulated in public depositories. Additionally, the numbers of research papers and functional annotations for gene-phenotype associations have increased significantly. Therefore, updating HumanNet is a timely task for further improvement of network-based research into diseases. Here, we present HumanNet v3 (https://www.inetbio.org/humannet/, covering 99.8% of human protein coding genes) constructed by means of the expanded data with improved network inference algorithms. HumanNet v3 supports a three-tier model: HumanNet-PI (a protein-protein physical interaction network), HumanNet-FN (a functional gene network), and HumanNet-XC (a functional network extended by co-citation). Users can select a suitable tier of HumanNet for their study purpose. We showed that on disease gene predictions, HumanNet v3 outperforms both the previous HumanNet version and other integrated human gene networks.

"34718410","Importance-Penalized Joint Graphical Lasso (IPJGL): differential network inference via GGMs.","Bioinformatics","Differential network inference is a fundamental and challenging problem to reveal gene interactions and regulation relationships under different conditions. Many algorithms have been developed for this problem; however, they do not consider the differences between the importance of genes, which may not fit the real-world situation. Different genes have different mutation probabilities, and the vital genes associated with basic life activities have less fault tolerance to mutation. Equally treating all genes may bias the results of differential network inference. Thus, it is necessary to consider the importance of genes in the models of differential network inference.Based on the Gaussian graphical model with adaptive gene importance regularization, we develop a novel importance-penalized joint graphical Lasso method, IPJGL, for differential network inference. The presented method is validated by the simulation experiments as well as the real datasets. Furthermore, to precisely evaluate the results of differential network inference, we propose a new metric named APC2 for the differential levels of gene pairs. We apply IPJGL to analyze the TCGA colorectal and breast cancer datasets and find some candidate cancer genes with significant survival analysis results, including SOST for colorectal cancer and RBBP8 for breast cancer. We also conduct further analysis based on the interactions in the Reactome database and confirm the utility of our method.R source code of importance-penalized joint graphical lasso is freely available at https://github.com/Wu-Lab/IPJGL.Supplementary materials are available at Bioinformatics online.© The Author(s) 2021.

Here, we developed an efficient, low-input, and low-cost method for the simultaneous profiling of genomic localization of histone modification and methylation status of the underlying DNA at single-base resolution from the same cells in a single experiment by integrating cleavage under targets and tagmentation (CUT&Tag) with tagmentation-based bisulfite sequencing (CUT&Tag-BS). We demonstrated the validity of our method using representative histone modifications of euchromatin and constitutive and facultative heterochromatin (H3K4me1, H3K9me3, and H3K27me3, respectively). Similar histone modification enrichment patterns were observed in CUT&Tag-BS compared with non-bisulfite-treated control, and H3K4me1-marked regions were found to mostly be CpG poor, lack methylation concordance, and exhibit prevalent DNA methylation heterogeneity among mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). We anticipate that CUT&Tag-BS will be widely applied to directly address the genomic relationship between DNA methylation and histone modification, especially in low-input scenarios with precious biological samples."

Consequential alterations in histone modifications contribute to disease-specific changes in the transcriptional program. Affected genes commonly play important roles in cell cycle regulation, apoptosis-inducing signal transduction, and DNA damage response, thus facilitating the emergence of malignant traits that impair immune surveillance and favor the emergence of different B-cell lymphoma subtypes. In the last two decades, the field has made a major effort to develop therapies that target these epigenetic alterations. In this review, we discuss which epigenetic alterations occur in B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Furthermore, we aim to present in a close to comprehensive manner the current state-of-the-art in the preclinical and clinical development of epigenetic drugs. We focus on therapeutic strategies interfering with histone methylation and acetylation as these are most advanced in being deployed from the bench-to-bedside and have the greatest potential to improve the prognosis of lymphoma patients."

Comparison with our existing European-origin (EUR) GWAS showed that effect sizes of known psoriasis signals were highly correlated in SAS and EUR (Spearman ρ = 0.78;p< 2 × 10-14). Transethnic meta-analysis identified two non-MHC psoriasis loci (1p36.22 and 1q24.2) not previously identified in EUR, which may have regulatory roles. For these two loci, the transethnic GWAS provided higher genetic resolution and reduced the number of potential causal variants compared to using the EUR sample alone. We then explored multiple strategies to develop reference panels for accurately imputing MHC genotypes in both SAS and EUR populations and conducted a fine-mapping of MHC psoriasis associations in SAS and the largest such effort for EUR.HLA-C*06was the top-ranking MHC locus in both populations but was even more prominent in SAS based on odds ratio, disease liability, model fit and predictive power. Transethnic modeling also substantially boosted the probability that theHLA-C*06protein variant is causal. Secondary MHC signals included coding variants ofHLA-CandHLA-B, but also potential regulatory variants of these two genes as well asHLA-Aand several HLA class II genes, with effects on both chromatin accessibility and gene expression. This study highlights the shared genetic basis of psoriasis in SAS and EUR populations and the value of transethnic meta-analysis for discovery and fine-mapping of susceptibility loci."
"34922464","Comprehensive epigenomic profiling of human alveolar epithelial differentiation identifies key epigenetic states and transcription factor co-regulatory networks for maintenance of distal lung identity.","BMC Genomics","Disruption of alveolar epithelial cell (AEC) differentiation is implicated in distal lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and lung adenocarcinoma that impact morbidity and mortality worldwide. Elucidating underlying disease pathogenesis requires a mechanistic molecular understanding of AEC differentiation. Previous studies have focused on changes of individual transcription factors, and to date no study has comprehensively characterized the dynamic, global epigenomic alterations that facilitate this critical differentiation process in humans.We comprehensively profiled the epigenomic states of human AECs during type 2 to type 1-like cell differentiation, including the methylome and chromatin functional domains, and integrated this with transcriptome-wide RNA expression data. Enhancer regions were drastically altered during AEC differentiation. Transcription factor binding analysis within enhancer regions revealed diverse interactive networks with enrichment for many transcription factors, including NKX2-1 and FOXA family members, as well as transcription factors with less well characterized roles in AEC differentiation, such as members of the MEF2, TEAD, and AP1 families. Additionally, associations among transcription factors changed during differentiation, implicating a complex network of heterotrimeric complex switching in driving differentiation. Integration of AEC enhancer states with the catalog of enhancer elements in the Roadmap Epigenomics Mapping Consortium and Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) revealed that AECs have similar epigenomic structures to other profiled epithelial cell types, including human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs), with NKX2-1 serving as a distinguishing feature of distal lung differentiation.Enhancer regions are hotspots of epigenomic alteration that regulate AEC differentiation. Furthermore, the differentiation process is regulated by dynamic networks of transcription factors acting in concert, rather than individually. These findings provide a roadmap for understanding the relationship between disruption of the epigenetic state during AEC differentiation and development of lung diseases that may be therapeutically amenable.© 2021.

However, their features in pig remain largely unknown. In this study, by integrative computational analyses of epigenomic and transcriptomic data, we have characterized SEs and BDs in six pig tissues and analyzed their conservation in comparison with human and mouse tissues. Similar to human and mouse, pig SEs and BDs display higher tissue specificity than their typical counterparts. Genes proximal to SEs and BDs are associated with tissue identity in most tissues. About 55-182 SEs (5-17% in total) and 99-309 BDs (8-16% in total) across pig tissues are considered as functionally conserved elements because they have orthologous SEs and BDs in human and mouse. However, these elements do not necessarily exhibit sequence conservation. The functionally conserved SEs are correlated to tissue identity in majority of pig tissues, while those conserved BDs are linked to tissue identity in a few tissues. Our study provides resources for future gene regulatory studies in pig. It highlights that SEs are more effective in defining tissue identity than BDs, which is contrasting to a previous study. It also provides novel insights on understanding the sequence features of functionally conserved elements.Copyright © 2021 Peng, Kang, Luo and Zhang."

ATAC-seq technology effectively identifies active cis-REs in a given cell type (including from single cells) by mapping accessible chromatin at base-pair resolution. However, these maps are not immediately useful for inferring specific functions of cis-REs. For this purpose, we developed a deep learning framework (CoRE-ATAC) with novel data encoders that integrate DNA sequence (reference or personal genotypes) with ATAC-seq cut sites and read pileups. CoRE-ATAC was trained on 4 cell types (n = 6 samples/replicates) and accurately predicted known cis-RE functions from 7 cell types (n = 40 samples) that were not used in model training (mean average precision = 0.80, mean F1 score = 0.70). CoRE-ATAC enhancer predictions from 19 human islet samples coincided with genetically modulated gain/loss of enhancer activity, which was confirmed by massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs). Finally, CoRE-ATAC effectively inferred cis-RE function from aggregate single nucleus ATAC-seq (snATAC) data from human blood-derived immune cells that overlapped with known functional annotations in sorted immune cells, which established the efficacy of these models to study cis-RE functions of rare cells without the need for cell sorting. ATAC-seq maps from primary human cells reveal individual- and cell-specific variation in cis-RE activity. CoRE-ATAC increases the functional resolution of these maps, a critical step for studying regulatory disruptions behind diseases."
"34880227","A predominant enhancer co-amplified with the SOX2 oncogene is necessary and sufficient for its expression in squamous cancer.","Nat Commun","Amplification and overexpression of the SOX2 oncogene represent a hallmark of squamous cancers originating from diverse tissue types. Here, we find that squamous cancers selectively amplify a 3' noncoding region together with SOX2, which harbors squamous cancer-specific chromatin accessible regions. We identify a single enhancer e1 that predominantly drives SOX2 expression. Repression of e1 in SOX2-high cells causes collapse of the surrounding enhancers, remarkable reduction in SOX2 expression, and a global transcriptional change reminiscent of SOX2 knockout. The e1 enhancer is driven by a combination of transcription factors including SOX2 itself and the AP-1 complex, which facilitates recruitment of the co-activator BRD4. CRISPR-mediated activation of e1 in SOX2-low cells is sufficient to rebuild the e1-SOX2 loop and activate SOX2 expression. Our study shows that squamous cancers selectively amplify a predominant enhancer to drive SOX2 overexpression, uncovering functional links among enhancer activation, chromatin looping, and lineage-specific copy number amplifications of oncogenes.© 2021.

"34873180","Medium levels of transcription and replication related chromosomal instability are associated with poor clinical outcome.","Sci Rep","Genomic instability (GI) influences treatment efficacy and resistance, and an accurate measure of it is lacking. Current measures of GI are based on counts of specific structural variation (SV) and mutational signatures. Here, we present a holistic approach to measuring GI based on the quantification of the steady-state equilibrium between DNA damage and repair as assessed by the residual breakpoints (BP) remaining after repair, irrespective of SV type. We use the notion of Hscore, a BP ""hotspotness"" magnitude scale, to measure the propensity of genomic structural or functional DNA elements to break more than expected by chance. We then derived new measures of transcription- and replication-associated GI that we call iTRAC (transcription-associated chromosomal instability index) and iRACIN (replication-associated chromosomal instability index). We show that iTRAC and iRACIN are predictive of metastatic relapse in Leiomyosarcoma (LMS) and that they may be combined to form a new classifier called MAGIC (mixed transcription- and replication-associated genomic instability classifier). MAGIC outperforms the gold standards FNCLCC and CINSARC in stratifying metastatic risk in LMS. Furthermore, iTRAC stratifies chemotherapeutic response in LMS. We finally show that this approach is applicable to other cancers.© 2021. The Author(s)."

However, much about the underlying biological functions are yet to be discovered. Here, we systematically predicted plausible candidate genes and pathways from functional analysis of severe malaria resistance GWAS summary statistics (N= 17,000) meta-analysed across 11 populations in malaria endemic regions. We applied positional mapping, expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL), chromatin interaction mapping, and gene-based association analyses to identify candidate severe malaria resistance genes. We further applied rare variant analysis to raw GWAS datasets (N= 11,000) of three malaria endemic populations including Kenya, Malawi, and Gambia and performed various population genetic structures of the identified genes in the three populations and global populations. We performed network and pathway analyses to investigate their shared biological functions. Our functional mapping analysis identified 57 genes located in the known malaria genomic loci, while our gene-based GWAS analysis identified additional 125 genes across the genome. The identified genes were significantly enriched in malaria pathogenic pathways including multiple overlapping pathways in erythrocyte-related functions, blood coagulations, ion channels, adhesion molecules, membrane signalling elements, and neuronal systems. Our population genetic analysis revealed that the minor allele frequencies (MAF) of the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) residing in the identified genes are generally higher in the three malaria endemic populations compared to global populations. Overall, our results suggest that severe malaria resistance trait is attributed to multiple genes, highlighting the possibility of harnessing new malaria therapeutics that can simultaneously target multiple malaria protective host molecular pathways.Copyright © 2021 Damena, Agamah, Kimathi, Kabongo, Girma, Choga, Golassa and Chimusa."

We report 86,154 polymorphic retrotransposon insertions-including > 60% not previously reported-and 158 de novo retrotransposition events. The overall burden of de novo events was similar between ASD individuals and unaffected siblings, with 1 de novo insertion per 29, 117, and 206 births for Alu, L1, and SVA respectively, and 1 de novo insertion per 21 births total. However, ASD cases showed more de novo L1 insertions than expected in ASD genes. Additionally, we observed exonic insertions in loss-of-function intolerant genes, including a likely pathogenic exonic insertion in CSDE1, only in ASD individuals.These findings suggest a modest, but important, impact of intronic and exonic retrotransposon insertions in ASD, show the importance of WGS for their analysis, and highlight the utility of specific bioinformatic tools for high-throughput detection of retrotransposon insertions.© 2021.

In this study, we aimed to analyze aging-associated transcriptional patterns in publicly available bulk mRNA-seq and single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) datasets for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), colorectal cancer (CRC), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), lung cancer (LC), and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Indeed, we detected that various aging/senescence-induced genes (ASIGs) were upregulated in malignant diseases compared to healthy control samples. To elucidate the importance of ASIGs during cell development, pseudotime analyses were performed, which revealed a late enrichment of distinct cancer-specific ASIG signatures. Notably, we were able to demonstrate that all cancer entities analyzed in this study comprised cell populations expressing ASIGs. While only minor correlations were detected between ASIGs and transcriptome-wide changes in PDAC, a high proportion of ASIGs was induced in CML, CRC, HCC, and LC samples.

Enrichment-based cfDNA methylation profiling methods such as cfMeDIP-seq have shown high accuracy in the classification of multiple cancer types. We have previously optimized another enrichment-based approach for ultra-low input cfDNA methylome profiling, termed cfMBD-seq. We reported that cfMBD-seq outperforms cfMeDIP-seq in the enrichment of high-CpG-density regions, such as CpG islands. However, the clinical feasibility of cfMBD-seq is unknown. In this study, we applied cfMBD-seq to profiling the cfDNA methylome using plasma samples from cancer patients and non-cancer controls. We identified 1759, 1783, and 1548 differentially hypermethylated CpG islands (DMCGIs) in lung, colorectal, and pancreatic cancer patients, respectively. Interestingly, the vast majority of DMCGIs were overlapped with aberrant methylation changes in corresponding tumor tissues, indicating that DMCGIs detected by cfMBD-seq were mainly driven by tumor-specific DNA methylation patterns. From the overlapping DMCGIs, we carried out machine learning analyses and identified a set of discriminating methylation signatures that had robust performance in cancer detection and classification.

We report that Kbhb on histone H3 (H3K9bhb) is enriched at proximal promoters of critical gene subsets associated with lipolytic and ketogenic metabolic pathways in small intestine (SI) crypts during fasting. Similar Kbhb enrichment is observed in Lgr5+stem cell-enriched epithelial spheroids treated with β-OHB in vitro. Combinatorial chromatin state analysis reveals that H3K9bhb is associated with active chromatin states and that fasting enriches for an H3K9bhb-H3K27ac signature at active metabolic gene promoters and distal enhancer elements. Intestinal knockout of Hmgcs2 results in marked loss of H3K9bhb-associated loci, suggesting that local production of β-OHB is responsible for chromatin reprogramming within the SI crypt. We conclude that modulation of H3K9bhb in SI crypts is a key gene regulatory event in response to fasting.Copyright © 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

We hypothesized that diploidization results from aberrant DNA replication. To test this, we profiled DNA replication timing in isogenic haploid and diploid ESCs. The greatest difference was the earlier replication of the X Chromosome in haploids, consistent with the lack of X-Chromosome inactivation. We also identified 21 autosomal regions that had delayed replication in haploids, extending beyond the normal S phase and into G2/M. Haploid-delays comprised a unique set of quiescent genomic regions that are also underreplicated in polyploid placental cells. The same delays were observed in female ESCs with two active X Chromosomes, suggesting that increased X-Chromosome dosage may cause delayed autosomal replication.

"34739872","A multi-omic single-cell landscape of human gynecologic malignancies.","Mol Cell","Deconvolution of regulatory mechanisms that drive transcriptional programs in cancer cells is key to understanding tumor biology. Herein, we present matched transcriptome (scRNA-seq) and chromatin accessibility (scATAC-seq) profiles at single-cell resolution from human ovarian and endometrial tumors processed immediately following surgical resection. This dataset reveals the complex cellular heterogeneity of these tumors and enabled us to quantitatively link variation in chromatin accessibility to gene expression. We show that malignant cells acquire previously unannotated regulatory elements to drive hallmark cancer pathways. Moreover, malignant cells from within the same patients show substantial variation in chromatin accessibility linked to transcriptional output, highlighting the importance of intratumoral heterogeneity. Finally, we infer the malignant cell type-specific activity of transcription factors. By defining the regulatory logic of cancer cells, this work reveals an important reliance on oncogenic regulatory elements and highlights the ability of matched scRNA-seq/scATAC-seq to uncover clinically relevant mechanisms of tumorigenesis in gynecologic cancers.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

"34908915","The Vista of Application of Specific Anaphylaxis Accurate Diagnosis Based on DNA Single-Nucleotide Methylation Sites.","Contrast Media Mol Imaging","Anaphylaxis has rapidly spread around the world in the last several decades. Environmental factors seem to play a major role, and epigenetic marks, especially DNA methylation, get more attention. We discussed several GEO opening data classifications with TOP 100 specific methylation region values (normalized M-values on line) by machine learning, which are remarkable to classify specific anaphylaxis after monoallergen exposure. Then, we sequenced the whole-genome DNA methylation of six people (3 wormwood monoallergen atopic rhinitis patients and 3 normal-immune people) during the pollen season and analyzed the difference of the single nucleotide and DNA region. The results' divergences were obvious (the differential single nucleotides were mostly distributed in nongene regions but the differential DNA regions of GWAS, on the other hand), which may have caused most single nucleotides to be concealed in the regions' sequences. Therefore, we suggest that we should conduct more ""pragmatic"" and directly find special single-nucleotide changes after exposure to atopic allergens instead of complex correlativity. It is possible to try to use DNA methylation marks to accurately diagnose anaphylaxis and form a machine learning classification based on the single methylated CpGs.Copyright © 2021 Xiangjie Guo et al."
"34836408","Dietary Fibers: Effects, Underlying Mechanisms and Possible Role in Allergic Asthma Management.","Nutrients","The prevalence of asthma is increasing, but the cause remains under debate. Research currently focuses on environmental and dietary factors that may impact the gut-lung axis. Dietary fibers are considered to play a crucial role in supporting diversity and activity of the microbiome, as well as immune homeostasis in the gut and lung. This review discusses the current state of knowledge on how dietary fibers and their bacterial fermentation products may affect the pathophysiology of allergic asthma. Moreover, the impact of dietary fibers on early type 2 asthma management, as shown in both pre-clinical and clinical studies, is described. Short-chain fatty acids, fiber metabolites, modulate host immunity and might reduce the risk of allergic asthma development. Underlying mechanisms include G protein-coupled receptor activation and histone deacetylase inhibition. These results are supported by studies in mice, children and adults with allergic asthma. Fibers might also exert direct effects on the immune system via yet to be elucidated mechanisms. However, the effects of specific types of fiber, dosages, duration of treatment, and combination with probiotics, need to be explored. There is an urgent need to further valorize the potential of specific dietary fibers in prevention and treatment of allergic asthma by conducting more large-scale dietary intervention trials."

Obesity is a significant global health problem that involves cellular, environmental, behavioral, and genetic elements. The fundamental cause of obesity throughout all life stages is an energy imbalance, and its consequences are countless and, foremost, very common. Obesity has been comprehensively studied in the literature given its association with low serum vitamin D, with many proposed mechanisms linking the two conditions. Moreover, markers of exaggerated cellular senescence have been proven to accumulate in obese individuals. Subclinical atherosclerosis initiates an early stage that ends in serious cardiac events, and obesity, low vitamin D, and senescent cells largely contribute to its associated chronic low-grade inflammation. Furthermore, NAFLD signifies the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome, and studies have highlighted the important role of obesity, vitamin D deficiency, and cellular senescence in its development. Therefore, we outlined the most important mechanisms tying these conditions to one another."
"34831288","DNA Methylation in Genetic and Sporadic Forms of Neurodegeneration: Lessons from Alzheimer's, Related Tauopathies and Genetic Tauopathies.","Cells","Genetic and sporadic forms of tauopathies, the most prevalent of which is Alzheimer's Disease, are a scourge of the aging society, and in the case of genetic forms, can also affect children and young adults. All tauopathies share ectopic expression, mislocalization, or aggregation of the microtubule associated protein TAU, encoded by theMAPTgene. As TAU is a neuronal protein widely expressed in the CNS, the overwhelming majority of tauopathies are neurological disorders. They are characterized by cognitive dysfunction often leading to dementia, and are frequently accompanied by movement abnormalities such as parkinsonism. Tauopathies can lead to severe neurological deficits and premature death. For some tauopathies there is a clear genetic cause and/or an epigenetic contribution. However, for several others the disease etiology is unclear, with few tauopathies being environmentally triggered. Here, we review current knowledge of tauopathies listing known genetic and important sporadic forms of these disease. Further, we discuss how DNA methylation as a major epigenetic mechanism emerges to be involved in the disease pathophysiology of Alzheimer's, and related genetic and non-genetic tauopathies. Finally, we debate the application of epigenetic signatures in peripheral blood samples as diagnostic tools and usages of epigenetic therapy strategies for these diseases."

The drug is composed of bionic TB powder, in which peptides and proteins are primarily enriched from other bone extracts. However, as a precious material of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), TB has been mainly understood and used in TCM to relieve osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis and bone injury. Inspired by those, the purpose of this study was to investigate whether JTG also had an effect on relieving rheumatoid arthritis in collagen-induced arthritic (CIA) rats and explore potential mechanism from the perspective of serum metabolic profile changes.JTG was analyzed using Nano LC-MS/MS and orally administered in CIA rats for 6 weeks. After administration, intervention effects of JTG on synovial inflammation, bone micro-architecture and bone metabolism were studied, and the impact of JTG on serum metabolic profiles in CIA rats was investigated by metabolomics.Nine bioactive peptides were identified in JTG. In animal treatments, JTG alleviated paw swelling (P< 0.01), arthritic severity (P< 0.01) and synovial tissue proliferation, as well as inflammatory cell infiltration of ankle joint, decreased bone loss, improved microstructure of bone in CIA rats by regulating bone absorption and formation, specifically increasing bone mineral density (BMD) (P< 0.05), bone volume fraction (BVF) (P< 0.05), trabecular number (Tb.N) (P< 0.05) and decreasing trabecular separation (Tb.Sp) (P< 0.05). Besides, serum IL-6 was down-regulated remarkably in CIA rats (P< 0.05). Furthermore, metabolomics analysis revealed that 32 metabolites were regulated significantly (P< 0.05) by comparison between CIA model and JTG in 360 mg/kg dose. The pathway analysis implied that JTG was involved in regulation of biosynthesis of phenylalanine.JTG alleviates rheumatoid arthritis and reverses changes in serum metabolic profile in CIA rats.© 2021 Wang et al."

Early genetic studies focused on tracking variations in genome-wide DNA sequences discovered several polymorphisms and novel susceptibility genes associated with AD. However, despite the numerous risk factors already identified, there is still no fully satisfactory explanation for the mechanisms underlying the onset of the disease. Also, as with other complex human diseases, the causes of low heritability are unclear. Epigenetic mechanisms, in which changes in gene expression do not depend on changes in genotype, have attracted considerable attention in recent years and are key to understanding the processes that influence age-related changes and various neurological diseases. With the recent use of massive sequencing techniques, methods for studying epigenome variations in AD have also evolved tremendously, allowing the discovery of differentially expressed disease traits under different conditions and experimental settings. This is important for understanding disease development and for unlocking new potential AD therapies. In this work, we outline the genomic and epigenomic components involved in the initiation and development of AD and identify potentially effective therapeutic targets for disease control."

Therefore, we conducted Mendelian Randomization approaches to investigate the causal relationship between classical risk factors and primary CAD in different age groups. A Mendelian Randomization study was conducted in European-ethnicity individuals from the UK Biobank population. Analyses were performed using data of 22,313 CAD cases (71.6% men) and 407,920 controls (44.5% men). Using logistic regression analyses, we investigated the associations between standardized genetic risk score and primary CAD stratified by age of diagnosis. In addition, feature importance and model accuracy were assessed in different age groups to evaluate predictive power of the genetic risk scores with increasing age. We found age-dependent associations for all classical CAD risk factors. Notably, body mass index (OR 1.22 diagnosis < 50 years; OR 1.02 diagnosis > 70 years), blood pressure (OR 1.12 < 50 years; OR 1.04 > 70 years), LDL cholesterol (OR 1.16 < 50 years; OR 1.02 > 70 years), and triglyceride levels (OR 1.11 < 50 years; 1.04 > 70 years). In line with the Mendelian Randomization analyses, model accuracy and feature importance of the classical risk factors decreased with increasing age of diagnosis. Causal determinants for primary CAD are age dependent with classical CAD risk factors attenuating in relation with primary CAD with increasing age. These results question the need for (some) currently applied cardiovascular disease risk reducing interventions at older age.© 2021.

In this study, using the public gene expression omnibus (GEO) repository, we aimed to identify urinary mRNA biomarkers that can predict histological severity and disease progression in patients with DKD in whom the diagnosis and histologic grade has been confirmed by kidney biopsy. We identified 30 DKD-specific mRNA candidates based on the analysis of the GEO datasets. Among these, there were significant alterations in the urinary levels of 17 mRNAs in patients with DKD, compared with healthy controls. Four urinary mRNAs-LYZ, C3, FKBP5, andG6PC-reflected tubulointerstitial inflammation and fibrosis in kidney biopsy and could predict rapid progression to end-stage kidney disease independently of the baseline eGFR (tertile 1vs. tertile 3; adjusted hazard ratio of 9.68 and 95% confidence interval of 2.85-32.87,p< 0.001). In conclusion, we demonstrated that urinary mRNA signatures have a potential to indicate the pathologic status and predict adverse renal outcomes in patients with DKD.Copyright © 2021 Lee, Seo, Kim, Tae, Seok, Kim, Lee, Kim, Hwang, Jeong and Moon."

Despite the advances in the field, the need for an earlier detection and effective therapies is paramount. PCA high heterogeneity suggests that epigenetic alterations play a key role in tumour development. However, only few epigenetic biomarkers or therapeutic targets have been identified so far. Here we explored the potential of distinct DNA methylation signatures as biomarkers for early detection and prognosis of PCA. PI3K/AKT-related genes differentially expressed in PCA were identified using the Pancreatic Expression Database (n= 153). Methylation data from PCA patients was obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (n= 183), crossed with clinical data to evaluate the biomarker potential of the epigenetic signatures identified and validated in independent cohorts. The majority of selected genes presented higher expression and hypomethylation in tumour tissue. The methylation signatures of specific genes in the PI3K/AKT pathway could distinguish normal from malignant tissue at initial disease stages with AUC > 0.8, revealing their potential as PCA diagnostic tools.ITGA4,SFN,ITGA2, andPIK3R1methylation levels could be independent prognostic indicators of patients' survival. Methylation status ofSFNandPIK3R1were also associated with disease recurrence. Our study reveals that the methylation levels of PIK3/AKT genes involved in PCA could be used to diagnose and predict patients' clinical outcome with high sensitivity and specificity. These results provide new evidence of the potential of epigenetic alterations as biomarkers for disease screening and management and highlight possible therapeutic targets."
"34828418","Zoo: Selecting Transcriptomic and Methylomic Biomarkers by Ensembling Animal-Inspired Swarm Intelligence Feature Selection Algorithms.","Genes (Basel)","Biological omics data such as transcriptomes and methylomes have the inherent ""large p small n"" paradigm, i.e., the number of features is much larger than that of the samples. A feature selection (FS) algorithm selects a subset of the transcriptomic or methylomic biomarkers in order to build a better prediction model. The hidden patterns in the FS solution space make it challenging to achieve a feature subset with satisfying prediction performances. Swarm intelligence (SI) algorithms mimic the target searching behaviors of various animals and have demonstrated promising capabilities in selecting features with good machine learning performances. Our study revealed that different SI-based feature selection algorithms contributed complementary searching capabilities in the FS solution space, and their collaboration generated a better feature subset than the individual SI feature selection algorithms. Nine SI-based feature selection algorithms were integrated to vote for the selected features, which were further refined by the dynamic recursive feature elimination framework. In most cases, the proposed Zoo algorithm outperformed the existing feature selection algorithms on transcriptomics and methylomics datasets."

The interplay between pericytes (PCs) and endothelial cells (ECs) culminates as a key ingredient that coordinates the development, maturation, and integrity of vessel building blocks. PCs, as a variety of mesenchymal stem cells, enthrall in the field of regenerative medicine, supporting the notion of regeneration and repair. PC-EC interconnections are pivotal in the kinetic and intricate process of angiogenesis during both embryological and post-natal development. The disruption of this complex interlinkage corresponds to SG pathogenesis, including inflammation, autoimmune disorders (Sjögren's syndrome), and tumorigenesis. Here, we provided a global portrayal of major signaling pathways between PCs and ECs that cooperate to enhance vascular steadiness through the synergistic interchange. Additionally, we delineated how the crosstalk among molecular networks affiliate to contribute to a malignant context. Additionally, within SG microarchitecture, telocytes and myoepithelial cells assemble a labyrinthine companionship, which together with PCs appear to synchronize the regenerative potential of parenchymal constituents. By underscoring the intricacy of signaling cascades within cellular latticework, this review sketched a perceptive basis for target-selective drugs to safeguard SG function."
"34836252","Genomics of Postprandial Lipidomics in the Genetics of Lipid-Lowering Drugs and Diet Network Study.","Nutrients","Postprandial lipemia (PPL) is an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Inter-individual variation in the dietary response to a meal is known to be influenced by genetic factors, yet genes that dictate variation in postprandial lipids are not completely characterized. Genetic studies of the plasma lipidome can help to better understand postprandial metabolism by isolating lipid molecular species which are more closely related to the genome. We measured the plasma lipidome at fasting and 6 h after a standardized high-fat meal in 668 participants from the Genetics of Lipid-Lowering Drugs and Diet Network study (GOLDN) using ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to (quadrupole) time-of-flight mass spectrometry. A total of 413 unique lipids were identified. Heritable and responsive lipid species were examined for association with single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) genotyped on the Affymetrix 6.0 array. The most statistically significant SNP findings were replicated in the Amish Heredity and Phenotype Intervention (HAPI) Heart Study. We further followed up findings from GOLDN with a regional analysis of cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpGs) sites measured on the Illumina HumanMethylation450 array. A total of 132 lipids were both responsive to the meal challenge and heritable in the GOLDN study. After correction for multiple testing of 132 lipids (α = 5 × 10-8/132 = 4 × 10-10), no SNP was statistically significantly associated with any lipid response. Four SNPs in the region of a known lipid locus (fatty acid desaturase 1 and 2/FADS1andFADS2) on chromosome 11 hadp< 8.0 × 10-7for arachidonic acid FA(20:4). Those SNPs replicated in HAPI Heart withp< 3.3 × 10-3. CpGs around theFADS1/2region were associated with arachidonic acid and the relationship of one SNP was partially mediated by a CpG (p= 0.005). Both SNPs and CpGs from the fatty acid desaturase region on chromosome 11 contribute jointly and independently to the diet response to a high-fat meal."

To leverage the wealth of information in multi-omics data, a number of integrative analysis strategies have been proposed recently. However, effectively extracting biological insights from these large, complex datasets remains challenging. In particular, matched samples with multiple types of omics data measured on each sample are often required for multi-omics analysis tools, which can significantly reduce the sample size. Another challenge is that analysis techniques such as dimension reductions, which extract association signals in high dimensional datasets by estimating a few variables that explain most of the variations in the samples, are typically applied to whole-genome data, which can be computationally demanding. Here we present pathwayMultiomics, a pathway-based approach for integrative analysis of multi-omics data with categorical, continuous, or survival outcome variables. The input of pathwayMultiomics is pathwayp-values for individual omics data types, which are then integrated using a novel statistic, the MiniMax statistic, to prioritize pathways dysregulated in multiple types of omics datasets. Importantly, pathwayMultiomics is computationally efficient and does not require matched samples in multi-omics data. We performed a comprehensive simulation study to show that pathwayMultiomics significantly outperformed currently available multi-omics tools with improved power and well-controlled false-positive rates. In addition, we also analyzed real multi-omics datasets to show that pathwayMultiomics was able to recover known biology by nominating biologically meaningful pathways in complex diseases such as Alzheimer's disease.Copyright © 2021 Odom, Colaprico, Silva, Chen and Wang."
"34813500","Alzheimer's disease and progressive supranuclear palsy share similar transcriptomic changes in distinct brain regions.","J Clin Invest","Vast numbers of differentially expressed genes and perturbed networks have been identified in Alzheimer's disease (AD), however, neither disease nor brain region specificity of these transcriptome alterations has been explored. Using RNA-Seq data from 231 temporal cortex and 224 cerebellum samples from patients with AD and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), a tauopathy, we identified a striking correlation in the directionality and magnitude of gene expression changes between these 2 neurodegenerative proteinopathies. Further, the transcriptomic changes in AD and PSP brains ware highly conserved between the temporal and cerebellar cortices, indicating that highly similar transcriptional changes occur in pathologically affected and grossly less affected, albeit functionally connected, areas of the brain. Shared up- or downregulated genes in AD and PSP are enriched in biological pathways. Many of these genes also have concordant protein changes and evidence of epigenetic control. These conserved transcriptomic alterations of 2 distinct proteinopathies in brain regions with and without significant gross neuropathology have broad implications. AD and other neurodegenerative diseases are likely characterized by common disease or compensatory pathways with widespread perturbations in the whole brain. These findings can be leveraged to develop multifaceted therapies and biomarkers that address these common, complex, and ubiquitous molecular alterations in neurodegenerative diseases."

Four factors, 'lifetime smoking status' and 'predicted mRNA expression levels' of TET2, SIRT1 and KDM1A, were found to significantly modify the POE on the three CpGs in both discovery and replication datasets.

While cigarette smoking is associated with the development of chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) and lung cancer,in uteroexposures to CS and second-hand smoke (SHS) are associated with asthma development in the offspring. SHS is an indoor air pollutant that causes known adverse health effects; however, the mechanisms by whichin uteroSHS exposures predispose to adult lung diseases, including COPD, asthma, and lung cancer, are poorly understood. In this study, we tested the hypothesis thatin uteroSHS exposure aggravates adult-induced emphysema, asthma, and lung cancer.Methods:Pregnant BALB/c mice were exposed from gestational days 6-19 to either 3 or 10mg/m3of SHS or filtered air. At 10, 11, 16, or 17weeks of age, female offspring were treated with either saline for controls, elastase to induce emphysema, house-dust mite (HDM) to initiate asthma, or urethane to promote lung cancer. At sacrifice, specific disease-related lung responses including lung function, inflammation, gene, and protein expression were assessed.Results:In the elastase-induced emphysema model,in uteroSHS-exposed mice had significantly enlarged airspaces and up-regulated expression ofMmp12(10.3-fold compared to air-elastase controls). In the HDM-induced asthma model,in uteroexposures to SHS produced eosinophilic lung inflammation and potentiatedMmp12gene expression (5.7-fold compared to air-HDM controls). In the lung cancer model,in uteroexposures to SHS significantly increased the number of intrapulmonary metastases at 58weeks of age and up-regulatedMmp12(9.3-fold compared to air-urethane controls). In all lung disease models,Mmp12upregulation was supported at the protein level.Conclusion:Our findings revealed thatin uteroSHS exposures exacerbate lung responses to adult-induced emphysema, asthma, and lung cancer. Our data show that MMP12 is up-regulated at the gene and protein levels in three distinct adult lung disease models followingin uteroSHS exposures, suggesting that MMP12 is central toin uteroSHS-aggravated lung responses.Copyright © 2021 Noël, Perveen, Xiao, Hammond, Le Donne, Legendre, Gartia, Sahu, Paulsen and Penn."
"34912078","Environmental factors in declining human fertility.","Nat Rev Endocrinol","A severe decline in child births has occurred over the past half century, which will lead to considerable population declines, particularly in industrialized regions. A crucial question is whether this decline can be explained by economic and behavioural factors alone, as suggested by demographic reports, or to what degree biological factors are also involved. Here, we discuss data suggesting that human reproductive health is deteriorating in industrialized regions. Widespread infertility and the need for assisted reproduction due to poor semen quality and/or oocyte failure are now major health issues. Other indicators of declining reproductive health include a worldwide increasing incidence in testicular cancer among young men and alterations in twinning frequency. There is also evidence of a parallel decline in rates of legal abortions, revealing a deterioration in total conception rates. Subtle alterations in fertility rates were already visible around 1900, and most industrialized regions now have rates below levels required to sustain their populations. We hypothesize that these reproductive health problems are partially linked to increasing human exposures to chemicals originating directly or indirectly from fossil fuels. If the current infertility epidemic is indeed linked to such exposures, decisive regulatory action underpinned by unconventional, interdisciplinary research collaborations will be needed to reverse the trends.© 2021.

Molecular determinants of RCT efficiency that may possess diagnostic and therapeutic meaning remain largely unknown. This review summarizes the progress in studying the genomic variants ofABCA1,ABCG1, andSCARB1, and the regulation of their function at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels in atherosclerosis. Defects in the structure and function ofABCA1,ABCG1, and SR-BI are caused by changes in the gene sequence, such as single nucleotide polymorphism or various mutations. In the transcription initiation of transporter genes, in addition to transcription factors, long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), transcription activators, and repressors are also involved. Furthermore, transcription is substantially influenced by the methylation of gene promoter regions. Post-transcriptional regulation involves microRNAs and lncRNAs, including circular RNAs. The potential biomarkers and targets for atheroprotection, based on molecular mechanisms of expression regulation for three transporter genes, are also discussed in this review."

ABCA1 protein levels in EAT samples tended to be lower in CAD patients than in the NCAD group (p = 0.053). DNA methylation levels at the ABCG1 cg27243685 site positively correlated with plasma triglyceride concentration (r = 0.510, p = 0.008), body mass index (r = 0.556, p = 0.013) and waist-to-hip ratio (r = 0.504, p = 0.012) in SAT samples.CAD is associated with ABCA1 and ABCG1 DNA hypermethylation in EAT. CAD with concomitant carotid artery disease or peripheral artery disease is accompanied by decreased ABCA1 gene expression in EAT. DNA methylation levels at the ABCG1 cg27243685 locus in SAT are associated with hypertriglyceridemia and obesity.© 2021. The Author(s)."
"34829488","Borderline Personality Disorder: Risk Factors and Early Detection.","Diagnostics (Basel)","Personality disorders (PDs) exert a great toll on health resources, and this is especially true for borderline personality disorder (BPD). As all PDs, BPD arises during adolescence or young adulthood. It is therefore important to detect the presence of this PD in its earlier stages in order to initiate appropriate treatment, thus ameliorating the prognosis of this condition. This review aims to highlight the issues associated with BPD diagnosis in order to promote its early detection and treatment. To do so, we conducted a search on PubMed database of current evidence regarding BPD early diagnosis, focusing on risk factors, which represent important conditions to assess during young patient evaluation, and on diagnostic tools that can help the clinician in the assessment process. Our findings show how several risk factors, both environmental and genetic/neurobiological, can contribute to the onset of BPD and help identify at-risk patients who need careful monitoring. They also highlight the importance of a careful clinical evaluation aided by psychometric tests. Overall, the evidence gathered confirms the complexity of BDP early detection and its crucial importance for the outcome of this condition."

In this study, we aim to identify more effective diagnostic and prognostic markers for lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD).We obtained differentially expressed lncRNAs (DElncRNAs), miRNAs (DEmiRNAs), and mRNAs (DEmRNAs) for LUAD by using The Cancer Genomes Atlas (TCGA) portal. Weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) was performed to unveil core gene modules associated with LUAD. The Cox proportional hazards model was performed to determine the prognostic significance of DElncRNAs. The diagnostic and prognostic significance of DElncRNAs was further verified based on the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC). Cytoscape was used to construct the ceRNA networks comprising the lncRNAs-miRNAs-mRNAs axis based on the correlation obtained from the miRcode, miRDB, and TargetScan.Compared with normal lung tissues, 2355 DElncRNAs, 820 DEmiRNAs, and 17289 DEmRNAs were identified in LUAD tissues. We generated 8 WGCNA core modules in the lncRNAs coexpression network, 5 modules in the miRNAs, and 12 modules in the mRNAs coexpression network, respectively. One lncRNA module (blue) consisting of 441 lncRNAs, two miRNA modules (blue and turquoise) containing 563 miRNAs, and one mRNA module (turquoise), which consisted of 15162 mRNAs, were mostly significantly related to LUAD status. Furthermore, 67 DEmRNAs were found to be tumor-associated as well as the target genes of the DElncRNAs-DEmiRNAs axis. Survival analyses showed that 6 lncRNAs (LINC01447, WWC2-AS2, OGFRP1, LINC00942, LINC01168, and AC005863.1) were significantly correlated with the prognosis of LUAD patients. Ultimately, the potential ceRNA networks including 6 DElncRNAs, 4 DEmiRNAs, and 22 DEmRNAs were constructed.Our study indicated that 6 DElncRNAs had the possibilities as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for LUAD. The lncRNA-mediated ceRNA networks might provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of LUAD progression.Copyright © 2021 Yimeng Cui et al."
"34885894","Effects of Prenatal Exposure to Aflatoxin B1: A Review.","Molecules","Aflatoxins are mycotoxins produced as secondary fungal metabolites. Among them, aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) stands out due to its genotoxic and mutagenic potential, being a potent initiator of carcinogenesis. In this review, the outcomes from the published literature in the past 10 years on the effects of AFB1 pathophysiological mechanisms on embryological and fetal development are discussed. In several animal species, including humans, AFB1 has a teratogenic effect,resulting in bone malformations, visceral anomalies, lesions in several organs, and behavioral and reproductive changes, in addition to low birth weight. The mutagenic capacity of AFB1 in prenatal life is greater than in adults, indicating that when exposure occurs in the womb, the risk of the development of neoplasms is higher. Studies conducted in humans indicate that the exposure to this mycotoxin during pregnancy is associated with low birth weight, decreased head circumference, and DNA hypermethylation. However, as the actual impacts on humans are still unclear, the importance of this issue cannot be overemphasized and studies on the matter are essential."

Genetic variants are involved in the pathogenesis of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). The objective of this study was to investigate the association of rs2230806 (R219K), a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the lipid-related gene, with the risk of GDM and related traits.The SNP, rs2230806, was genotyped, and clinical and metabolic parameters were determined in 660 GDM patients and 1,097 control subjects. Genetic associations with related traits were also analyzed.The genotype distributions were similar in GDM patients and normal controls. However, significant differences in the variables examined in the study subjects were noted across the three genotypes. The genotype at the rs2230806 polymorphism was significantly associated with HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) levels and atherogenic index (AI) values in GDM patients and total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels in control subjects. Subgroup analysis showed that the polymorphism was associated with diastolic blood pressure, in addition to HDL-C levels and AI, in overweight/obese GDM patients, while it was associated with TC levels, AI, pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), and BMI at delivery in non-obese GDM patients. In addition, this polymorphism was associated with TC, LDL-C, and apoB levels in overweight/obese control subjects.The rs2230806 polymorphism in theABCA1gene was associated with variations in atherometabolic traits in GDM patients, with characteristics of BMI dependency, but not with GDM.

The aim of this study was to compare the impact of the prenatal vs. postnatal environment on the gut microbiota in dams during the preconception, gestation and lactation periods and their consequences on metabolic outcomes in offspring. Here we used the cross-fostering technique, e.g. the exchange of pups following birth to a foster dam, to decipher the metabolic effects of the intrauterine versus postnatal environmental exposures to a polyphenol-rich cranberry extract (CE). CE administration to high-fat high-sucrose (HFHS)-fed dams improved glucose homeostasis and reduced liver steatosis in association with a shift in the maternal gut microbiota composition. Unexpectedly, we observed that the postnatal environment contributed to metabolic outcomes in female offspring, as revealed by adverse effects on adiposity and glucose metabolism, while no effect was observed in male offspring. In addition to the strong sexual dimorphism, we found a significant influence of the nursing mother on the community structure of the gut microbiota based on α-diversity and β-diversity indices in offspring. Gut microbiota transplantation (GMT) experiments partly reproduced the observed phenotype in female offspring. Our data support the concept that the postnatal environment represents a critical window to influence future sex-dependent metabolic outcomes in offspring that are causally but partly linked with gut microbiome alterations."
"34829943","Epigenetic Mechanisms of Endocrine-Disrupting Chemicals in Obesity.","Biomedicines","The incidence of obesity has dramatically increased over the last decades. Recently, there has been a growing interest in the possible association between the pandemics of obesity and some endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), termed ""obesogens"". These are a heterogeneous group of exogenous compounds that can interfere in the endocrine regulation of energy metabolism and adipose tissue structure. Oral intake, inhalation, and dermal absorption represent the major sources of human exposure to these EDCs. Recently, epigenetic changes such as the methylation of cytosine residues on DNA, post-translational modification of histones, and microRNA expression have been considered to act as an intermediary between deleterious effects of EDCs and obesity development in susceptible individuals. Specifically, EDCs exposure during early-life development can detrimentally affect individuals via inducing epigenetic modifications that can permanently change the epigenome in the germline, enabling changes to be transmitted to the next generations and predisposing them to a multitude of diseases. The purpose of this review is to analyze the epigenetic alterations putatively induced by chemical exposures and their ability to interfere with the control of energy metabolism and adipose tissue regulation, resulting in imbalances in the control of body weight, which can lead to obesity."
"34836318","Early-Life Exposure to Famine and Risk of Metabolic Associated Fatty Liver Disease in Chinese Adults.","Nutrients","Early-life exposure to the Chinese famine has been related to the risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease later in life. Nevertheless, the long-term impact of famine exposure on metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), a recently proposed term to describe liver disease associated with known metabolic dysfunction, remains unknown. The aim of our study was to explore the relationship between early famine exposure and MAFLD in adulthood.A total of 26,821 participants (10,994 men, 15,827 women) were recruited from a cohort study of Chinese adults in Shanghai. We categorized participants into four famine exposure subgroups based on the birth year as nonexposed (1963-1967), fetal-exposed (1959-1962), childhood-exposed (1949-1958), and adolescence-exposed (1941-1948). MAFLD was defined as liver steatosis detected by ultrasound plus one of the following three criteria: overweight/obesity, type 2 diabetes, or evidence of metabolic dysregulation. Multivariable logistic regression models were performed to examine the association between famine exposure and MAFLD.The mean ± standard deviation age of the participants was 60.8 ± 6.8 years. The age-adjusted prevalence of MAFLD was 38.3, 40.8, 40.1, and 36.5% for the nonexposed, fetal-exposed, childhood-exposed, and adolescence-exposed subgroups, respectively. Compared with nonexposed participants, fetal-exposed participants showed an increased risk of adulthood MAFLD (OR = 1.10, 95% CI 1.00-1.21). The significant association between fetal famine exposure and MAFLD was observed in women (OR = 1.22, 95% CI 1.08-1.37), but not in men (OR = 0.88, 95% CI 0.75-1.03). In age-balanced analyses combining pre-famine and post-famine births as the reference, women exposed to famine in the fetal stage still had an increased risk of MAFLD (OR = 1.15, 95% CI 1.05-1.26).Prenatal exposure to famine showed a sex-specific association with the risk of MAFLD in adulthood."
"34895312","Risk-focused differences in molecular processes implicated in SARS-CoV-2 infection: corollaries in DNA methylation and gene expression.","Epigenetics Chromatin","Understanding the molecular basis of susceptibility factors to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is a global health imperative. It is well-established that males are more likely to acquire SARS-CoV-2 infection and exhibit more severe outcomes. Similarly, exposure to air pollutants and pre-existing respiratory chronic conditions, such as asthma and chronic obstructive respiratory disease (COPD) confer an increased risk to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).We investigated molecular patterns associated with risk factors in 398 candidate genes relevant to COVID-19 biology. To accomplish this, we downloaded DNA methylation and gene expression data sets from publicly available repositories (GEO and GTEx Portal) and utilized data from an empirical controlled human exposure study conducted by our team.First, we observed sex-biased DNA methylation patterns in autosomal immune genes, such as NLRP2, TLE1, GPX1, and ARRB2 (FDR < 0.05, magnitude of DNA methylation difference Δβ > 0.05). Second, our analysis on the X-linked genes identified sex associated DNA methylation profiles in genes, such as ACE2, CA5B, and HS6ST2 (FDR < 0.05, Δβ > 0.05). These associations were observed across multiple respiratory tissues (lung, nasal epithelia, airway epithelia, and bronchoalveolar lavage) and in whole blood. Some of these genes, such as NLRP2 and CA5B, also exhibited sex-biased gene expression patterns. In addition, we found differential DNA methylation patterns by COVID-19 status for genes, such as NLRP2 and ACE2 in an exploratory analysis of an empirical data set reporting on human COVID-9 infections. Third, we identified modest DNA methylation changes in CpGs associated with PRIM2 and TATDN1 (FDR < 0.1, Δβ > 0.05) in response to particle-depleted diesel exhaust in bronchoalveolar lavage. Finally, we captured a DNA methylation signature associated with COPD diagnosis in a gene involved in nicotine dependence (COMT) (FDR < 0.1, Δβ > 0.05).Our findings on sex differences might be of clinical relevance given that they revealed molecular associations of sex-biased differences in COVID-19. Specifically, our results hinted at a potentially exaggerated immune response in males linked to autosomal genes, such as NLRP2. In contrast, our findings at X-linked loci such as ACE2 suggested a potentially distinct DNA methylation pattern in females that may interact with its mRNA expression and inactivation status. We also found tissue-specific DNA methylation differences in response to particulate exposure potentially capturing a nitrogen dioxide (NO2) effect-a contributor to COVID-19 susceptibility. While we identified a molecular signature associated with COPD, all COPD-affected individuals were smokers, which may either reflect an association with the disease, smoking, or may highlight a compounded effect of these two risk factors in COVID-19. Overall, our findings point towards a molecular basis of variation in susceptibility factors that may partly explain disparities in the risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection.© 2021. The Author(s)."
"34968254","Epigenetic Regulation of Epidermal Differentiation.","Epigenomes","The epidermis is the outer part of the skin that protects the organism from dehydration and shields from external insults. Epidermal cells, called keratinocytes, undergo a series of morphological and metabolic changes that allow them to establish the biochemical and structural elements of an effective epidermal barrier. This process, known as epidermal differentiation, is critical for the maintenance of the epidermis under physiological conditions and also under stress or in various skin pathologies. Epidermal differentiation relies on a highly coordinated program of gene expression. Epigenetic mechanisms, which commonly include DNA methylation, covalent histone modifications, and microRNA (miRNA) activity, modulate various stages of gene expression by altering chromatin accessibility and mRNA stability. Their involvement in epidermal differentiation is a matter of intensive studies, and the results obtained thus far show a complex network of epigenetic factors, acting together with transcriptional regulators, to maintain epidermal homeostasis and counteract adverse effects of environmental stressors."
"34968367","Epigenetic Analyses of Alcohol Consumption in Combustible and Non-Combustible Nicotine Product Users.","Epigenomes","Alcohol and tobacco use are highly comorbid and exacerbate the associated morbidity and mortality of either substance alone. However, the relationship of alcohol consumption to the various forms of nicotine-containing products is not well understood. To improve this understanding, we examined the relationship of alcohol consumption to nicotine product use using self-report, cotinine, and two epigenetic biomarkers specific for smoking (cg05575921) and drinking (Alcohol T Scores (ATS)) inn= 424 subjects. Cigarette users had significantly higher ATS values than the other groups (p< 2.2 × 10-16). Using the objective biomarkers, the intensity of nicotine and alcohol consumption was correlated in both the cigarette and smokeless users (R= -0.66,p= 3.1 × 10-14;R2= 0.61,p= 1.97 × 10-4). Building upon this idea, we used the objective nicotine biomarkers and age to build and test a Balanced Random Forest classification model for heavy alcohol consumption (ATS > 2.35). The model performed well with an AUC of 0.962, 89.3% sensitivity, and 85% specificity. We conclude that those who use non-combustible nicotine products drink significantly less than smokers, and cigarette and smokeless users drink more with heavier nicotine use. These findings further highlight the lack of informativeness of self-reported alcohol consumption and suggest given the public and private health burden of alcoholism, further research into whether using non-combustible nicotine products as a mode of treatment for dual users should be considered."

After genotype imputation and quality control, 682 patients and 4 966 157 genetic markers were available. Association analysis in each cohort using linear regression with fatigue as a continuous variable and meta-analyses between the cohorts were performed.Meta-analysis of the Norwegian and Swedish cohorts identified five polymorphisms within the same linkage disequilibrium block at the receptor transporter protein 4 (RTP4)/MASP1locus associated with fatigue with genome-wide significance (GWS) (p<5×10-8). Patients homozygous for the major allele scored 25 mm higher on the fatigue Visual Analogue Scale than patients homozygous for the minor allele. There were no variants associated with fatigue with GWS in meta-analyses of the US/UK cohorts, or all four cohorts.RTP4expression in pSS B cells was upregulated and positively correlated with the type I interferon score. Expression quantitative trait loci effects in whole blood for fatigue-associated variants atRTP4/MASP1and levels ofRTP4andMASP1expression were identified.Genetic variations atRTP4/MASP1are associated with fatigue in Scandinavian pSS patients.RTP4encodes a Golgi chaperone that influences opioid pain receptor function andMASP1is involved in complement activation.

"34988107","Infant Iodine and Selenium Status in Relation to Maternal Status and Diet During Pregnancy and Lactation.","Front Nutr","Iodine and selenium are essential trace elements. Recent studies indicate that pregnant and lactating women often have insufficient intake of iodine and selenium, but the impact on fetal and infant status is unclear. Here, we assessed iodine and selenium status of infants in relation to maternal intake and status of these trace elements in the birth cohort NICE, conducted in northern Sweden (n= 604). Iodine was measured in urine (UIC) in gestational week 29, and in breast milk and infant urine 4 months postpartum, while selenium was measured in maternal plasma and erythrocytes in gestational week 29, and in breast milk and infant erythrocytes 4 months postpartum, in both cases using ICP-MS. Maternal intake was assessed with semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaires in gestational week 34 and at 4 months postpartum. The median intake of iodine and selenium during pregnancy (98 and 40 μg/d, respectively) and lactation (108 and 39 μg/d, respectively) was below recommended intakes, reflected in insufficient status (median UIC of 113 μg/L, median plasma selenium of 65 μg/L). Also, breast milk concentrations (median iodine 77 μg/L, median selenium 9 μg/L) were unlikely to meet infant requirements. Median UIC of the infants was 114 μg/L and median erythrocyte selenium 96 μg/kg, both similar to the maternal concentrations. Infant UIC correlated strongly with breast milk levels (rho = 0.64,p< 0.001). Their erythrocyte selenium correlated with maternal erythrocyte selenium in pregnancy (rho = 0.38,p< 0.001), but not with breast milk selenium, suggesting formation of prenatal reserves. Our results indicate that the transport of iodine and selenium to the fetus and infant is prioritized. Still, it is uncertain whether most infants had sufficient intakes. Further, the results might indicate an involvement of iodine in asthma development during the first year of life, which is essential to follow up. The low maternal and infant dietary intake of both iodine and selenium, especially when the mothers did not use supplements or iodized table salt, suggest a need for a general screening of women and young children.Copyright © 2021 Stråvik, Gustin, Barman, Skröder, Sandin, Wold, Sandberg, Kippler and Vahter."

But in spite of several efforts in a variety of scientific fields, the causes of the disease and the interplay of possible risk factors are still poorly understood. To push forward the research on the causes of CL, the German Federal Office for Radiation Protection has been organizing recurring international workshops since 2008 every two to three years. In November 2019 the 6th International Workshop on the Causes of CL was held in Freising and brought together experts from diverse disciplines. The workshop was divided into two main parts focusing on genetic and environmental risk factors, respectively. Two additional special sessions addressed the influence of natural background radiation on the risk of CL and the progress in the development of mouse models used for experimental studies on acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the most common form of leukemia worldwide. The workshop presentations highlighted the role of infections as environmental risk factor for CL, specifically for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Major support comes from two mouse models, thePax5+/-and Sca1-ETV6-RUNX1mouse model, one of the major achievements made in the last years. Mice of both predisposed models only develop leukemia when exposed to common infections. These results emphasize the impact of gene-environment-interactions on the development of CL and warrant further investigation of such interactions - especially because genetic predisposition is detected with increasing frequency in CL.

It is generally established that human microbiota plays an essential role in shaping a healthy immune response, while its perturbation can cause chronic inflammation related to a wide range of diseases, including asthma. Systems biology approaches encompassing microbiome analysis can offer valuable platforms towards a global understanding of asthma complexity and improving patients' classification, status monitoring and therapeutic choices. In the present review, we summarize recent studies exploring the contribution of microbiota dysbiosis to asthma pathogenesis and heterogeneity in the context of asthma phenotypes-endotypes and administered medication. We subsequently focus on emerging efforts to gain deeper insights into microbiota-host interactions driving asthma complexity by integrating microbiome and host multi-omics data. One of the most prominent achievements of these research efforts is the association of refractory neutrophilic asthma with certain microbial signatures, including predominant pathogenic bacterial taxa (such asProteobacteriaphyla,Gammaproteobacteriaclass, especially species fromHaemophilusandMoraxellagenera). Overall, despite existing challenges, large-scale multi-omics endeavors may provide promising biomarkers and therapeutic targets for future development of novel microbe-based personalized strategies for diagnosis, prevention and/or treatment of uncontrollable asthma."

However, they manifest symptoms of premature immune aging such as suboptimal responses to vaccination at a younger age. Mechanisms underlying premature immune aging are unclear.The study site was University of Miami Miller School of Medicine.In this study, we aimed to identify molecular signatures of aging in HIV-infected (HIV) individuals compared with age-matched healthy control (HC) participants. Transcriptomic profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected cross-sectionally from study participants were evaluated using RNA sequencing, and genes and pathways associated with age and HIV status were identified and compared between study groups. Generalized linear modeling was used to identify transcriptional signatures associated with age.Despite that fewer differentially expressed genes between young (<40 yrs) and old (>59 yrs) were observed in the HIV group, metabolic and innate immune activation pathways were associated with increasing age in both HIV and HC. Age was also associated with pathways involved with T-cell immune activation in HC and with interferon signaling pathways in HIV. We observed signs of precocious immune aging at the transcriptional level in HIV and defined a transcriptional perturbation associated with innate immunity and glucose metabolism induced by aging in both HC and HIV.In this study, we identified distinct molecular signatures predictive of age in HIV versus HC, which suggest precocious immune aging in HIV. Overall, our results highlight the molecular pathways of immune aging in both HC and HIV that may be targeted for additional mechanistic insights or in a therapeutic setting.Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

"34876109","P-gp expression inhibition mediates placental glucocorticoid barrier opening and fetal weight loss.","BMC Med","Prenatal adverse environments can cause fetal intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) and higher susceptibility to multiple diseases after birth, related to multi-organ development programming changes mediated by intrauterine overexposure to maternal glucocorticoids. As a glucocorticoid barrier, P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is highly expressed in placental syncytiotrophoblasts; however, the effect of P-gp on the occurrence of IUGR remains unclear.Human placenta and fetal cord blood samples of IUGR fetuses were collected, and the related indexes were detected. Pregnant Wistar rats were administered with 30 mg/kg·d (low dose) and 120 mg/kg·d (high dose) caffeine from gestational day (GD) 9 to 20 to construct the rat IUGR model. Pregnant mice were administered with caffeine (120 mg/kg·d) separately or combined with sodium ferulate (50 mg/kg·d) from gestational day GD 9 to 18 to confirm the intervention target on fetal weight loss caused by prenatal caffeine exposure (PCE). The fetal serum/placental corticosterone level, placental P-gp expression, and related indicator changes were analyzed. In vitro, primary human trophoblasts and BeWo cells were used to confirm the effect of caffeine on P-gp and its mechanism.The placental P-gp expression was significantly reduced, but the umbilical cord blood cortisol level was increased in clinical samples of the IUGR neonates, which were positively and negatively correlated with the neonatal birth weight, respectively. Meanwhile, in the PCE-induced IUGR rat model, the placental P-gp expression of IUGR rats was decreased while the corticosterone levels of the placentas/fetal blood were increased, which were positively and negatively correlated with the decreased placental/fetal weights, respectively. Combined with the PCE-induced IUGR rat model, in vitro caffeine-treated placental trophoblasts, we confirmed that caffeine decreased the histone acetylation and expression of P-gp via RYR/JNK/YB-1/P300 pathway, which inhibited placental and fetal development. We further demonstrated that P-gp inducer sodium ferulate could reverse the inhibitory effect of caffeine on the fetal body/placental weight. Finally, clinical specimens and other animal models of IUGR also confirmed that the JNK/YB-1 pathway is a co-regulatory mechanism of P-gp expression inhibition, among which the expression of YB-1 is the most stable. Therefore, we proposed that YB-1 could be used as the potential early warning target for the opening of the placental glucocorticoid barrier, the occurrence of IUGR, and the susceptibility of a variety of diseases.This study, for the first time, clarified the critical role and epigenetic regulation mechanism of P-gp in mediating the opening mechanism of the placental glucocorticoid barrier, providing a novel idea for exploring the early warning, prevention, and treatment strategies of IUGR.© 2021.

"34831092","Cortactin Modulates Lung Endothelial Apoptosis Induced by Cigarette Smoke.","Cells","Cigarette smoke (CS) is the primary cause of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), and an important pathophysiologic event in COPD is CS-induced apoptosis in lung endothelial cells (EC). Cortactin (CTTN) is a cytoskeletal actin-binding regulatory protein with modulation by Src-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation. Based upon data demonstrating reducedCTTNmRNA levels in the lungs of smokers compared to non-smokers, we hypothesized a functional role for CTTN in CS-induced mitochondrial ROS generation and apoptosis in lung EC. Exposure of cultured human lung EC to CS condensate (CSC) led to the rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton and increased CTTN tyrosine phosphorylation (within hours). Exposure to CS significantly increased EC mitochondrial ROS generation and EC apoptosis. The functional role of CTTN in these CSC-induced EC responses was explored using cortactin siRNA to reduce its expression, and by using a blocking peptide for the CTTN SH3 domain, which is critical to cytoskeletal interactions. CTTN siRNA or blockade of its SH3 domain resulted in significantly increased EC mitochondrial ROS and apoptosis and augmented CSC-induced effects. Exposure of lung EC to e-cigarette condensate demonstrated similar results, with CTTN siRNA or SH3 domain blocking peptide increasing lung EC apoptosis. These data demonstrate a novel role for CTTN in modulating lung EC apoptosis induced by CS or e-cigarettes potentially providing new insights into COPD pathogenesis."

It is widely believed that reactive oxygen species (ROS) play an important role in ageing and in age-related disease, and approaches of antioxidant supplementation have been touted as useful strategies to mitigate age-related disease progression, although success of such strategies has been very limited to date. Involvement of ROS in ageing is largely attributed to mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired adaptive antioxidant responses. NADPH oxidase (NOX) enzymes represent an important enzyme family that generates ROS in a regulated fashion for purposes of oxidative host defense and redox-based signalling, however, the associations of NOX enzymes with lung ageing or age-related lung disease have to date only been minimally addressed. The present review will focus on our current understanding of the impact of ageing on NOX biology and its consequences for age-related lung disease, particularly COPD, and will also discuss the implications of altered NOX biology for current and future antioxidant-based strategies aimed at treating these diseases."
"34842712","The Association of Pain Levels and Low Physical Activity among Older Women.","Geriatrics (Basel)","There is an integral research gap regarding whether there is a relationship between pain levels and low physical activity among older women. This is a secondary analysis of a longitudinal cohort study, the Women's Health and Aging Study (WHAS) II. Our analyses included 436 community-dwelling women between the ages of 70 and 79, who were followed for 10.5 years. We employed marginal structural modeling, which controls for time-dependent confounding, with the aim of assessing the potential direct association between pain levels and low physical activity and assess a graded relationship. Compared to women with no pain, those with widespread pain were nearly half as likely to be moderately active versus low active (aOR: 0.46, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.22, 0.96). A graded association was observed across the four pain levels (no pain or mild pain, other pain, moderate or severe lower extremity pain, and widespread pain) on low physical activity.

Here, we sought to understand the mechanisms of early-life programming of reproductive function, by integrating analysis of reproductive tissues in an appropriate mouse model with methylation analysis of proxy tissue DNA in a well-characterized population of Bangladeshi migrants in the UK. Bangladeshi women whose childhood was in Bangladesh were found to have later pubertal onset and lower age-matched ovarian reserve than Bangladeshi women who grew-up in England. Subsequently, we aimed to explore the potential relevance to the altered reproductive phenotype of one of the genes that emerged from the screens.Of the genes associated with differential methylation in the Bangladeshi women whose childhood was in Bangladesh as compared to Bangladeshi women who grew up in the UK, 13 correlated with altered expression of the orthologous gene in the mouse model ovaries. These mice had delayed pubertal onset and a smaller ovarian reserve compared to controls. The most relevant of these genes for reproductive function appeared to be SRD5A1, which encodes the steroidogenic enzyme 5α reductase-1. SRD5A1 was more methylated at the same transcriptional enhancer in mice ovaries as in the women's buccal DNA, and its expression was lower in the hypothalamus of the mice as well, suggesting a possible role in the central control of reproduction. The expression of Kiss1 and Gnrh was also lower in these mice compared to controls, and inhibition of 5α reductase-1 reduced Kiss1 and Gnrh mRNA levels and blocked GnRH release in GnRH neuronal cell cultures. Crucially, we show that inhibition of this enzyme in female mice in vivo delayed pubertal onset.SRD5A1/5α reductase-1 responds epigenetically to the environment and its downregulation appears to alter the reproductive phenotype. These findings help to explain diversity in reproductive characteristics and how they are shaped by early-life environment and reveal novel pathways that might be targeted to mitigate health issues caused by life-history trade-offs.© 2021.

"34829957","Genetic Determinants of Plasma Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Levels: Monogenicity, Polygenicity, and ""Missing"" Heritability.","Biomedicines","Changes in plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) levels relate to a high risk of developing some common and complex diseases. LDL-c, as a quantitative trait, is multifactorial and depends on both genetic and environmental factors. In the pregenomic age, targeted genes were used to detect genetic factors in both hyper- and hypolipidemias, but this approach only explained extreme cases in the population distribution. Subsequently, the genetic basis of the less severe and most common dyslipidemias remained unknown. In the genomic age, performing whole-exome sequencing in families with extreme plasma LDL-c values identified some new candidate genes, but it is unlikely that such genes can explain the majority of inexplicable cases. Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified several single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) associated with plasma LDL-c, introducing the idea of a polygenic origin. Polygenic risk scores (PRSs), including LDL-c-raising alleles, were developed to measure the contribution of the accumulation of small-effect variants to plasma LDL-c. This paper discusses other possibilities for unexplained dyslipidemias associated with LDL-c, such as mosaicism, maternal effect, and induced epigenetic changes. Future studies should consider gene-gene and gene-environment interactions and the development of integrated information about disease-driving networks, including phenotypes, genotypes, transcription, proteins, metabolites, and epigenetics."

However, the physiopathological mechanisms involved in its development are unclear. In this sense, a multi-omics approach could provide some progress.Epigenomic and lipidomic analysis were carried out in plasma samples from patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD (n= 22), and healthy controls (n= 5). Then, omics integration between microRNAs (miRNAs) and lipids was performed by Sparse Partial Least Squares (s-PLS) regression and target genes for the selected miRNAs were identified.25 miRNAs and 25 lipids with higher loadings in the sPLS regression were selected. Lipids from phosphatidylethanolamines (PE), lysophosphatidylcholines (LPC), ceramides, phosphatidylcholines (PC), triglycerides (TG) and several long chain fatty acids families were identified as differentially expressed in AD. Among them, several fatty acids showed strong positive correlations with miRNAs studied. In fact, these miRNAs regulated genes implied in fatty acids metabolism, as elongation of very long-chain fatty acids (ELOVL), and fatty acid desaturases (FADs).The lipidomic-epigenomic integration showed that several lipids and miRNAs were differentially expressed in AD, being the fatty acids mechanisms potentially involved in the disease development. However, further work about targeted analysis should be carried out in a larger cohort, in order to validate these preliminary results and study the proposed pathways in detail."

Maternal environmental exposure not only affects mothers but also their fetuses in utero, which may interrupt their early development. Preterm birth, one of the outcomes of prenatal exposure, is a significant factor in lifelong health risks. To understand the effects of prenatal exposome on preterm birth, we studied the association between maternal and prenatal heavy metal exposure and gestational age, using resources from the MOthers' and Children's Environmental Health (MOCEH) study in South Korea. Additionally, a methylation assay was performed to analyze epigenetic mediation using genomic DNA derived from the cord blood of 384 participants in the MOCEH study. The results suggest that maternal cadmium exposure is associated with a decrease in gestational age through an alteration in DNA methylation at a specific CpG site, cg21010642. The CpG site was annotated to a gene involved in early embryonic development. Therefore, irregular methylation patterns at this site may contribute to premature birth by mediating irregular biological mechanisms."

Therefore, the understanding the molecular mechanisms of obesity has been a significant approach in medicine. Computational methods allow rapid and comprehensive pathway analysis, which is important for generation of diagnosis and treatment of obesity.Aims of our study are to comprehensively investigate genetic characteristics of obesity in children with non-syndromic, early-onset (< 7 years), and severe obesity (BMI-SDS > 3) through computational approaches. First, the mutational analyses of 41 of obesity-related genes in 126 children with non-syndromic early-onset severe obesity and 76 healthy non-obese controls were performed using the next generation sequencing (NGS) technique, and the NGS data analyzed by using bioinformatics methods. Then, the relationship between pathogenic variants and anthropometric/biochemical parameters was further evaluated. Obtained results demonstrated that the 15 genes (ADIPOQ, ADRB2, ADRB3, IRS1, LEPR, NPY, POMC, PPARG, PPARGC1A, PPARGC1B, PTPN1, SLC22A1, SLC2A4, SREBF1 and UCP1) which directly related to obesity found linked together via biological pathways and/or functions. Among these genes, IRS1, PPARGC1A, and SLC2A4 stand out as the most central ones. Furthermore, 12 of non-synonymous pathogenic variants, including six novels, were detected on ADIPOQ (G90S and D242G), ADRB2 (V87M), PPARGC1A (E680G, A477T, and R656H), UCP1 (Q44R), and IRS1 (R302Q, R301H, R301C, H250P, and H250N) genes.We propose that 12 of non-synonymous pathogenic variations detected on ADIPOQ, ADRB2, PPARGC1A, UCP1, and IRS1 genes might have a cumulative effect on the development and progression of obesity.© 2021.

Young and aged mice have been documented to show distinct gene expression and distinct macrophage-specific adipose tissue regulation. However, more biological understanding is required to know the processes associated with these conditions in relation to the aging process. Transcriptional profiling with RNA-seq analysis was used to determine differentially expressed genes in young (2 months old) and aged (20 months old) mice macrophage-enriched phagocytic stromal vascular fractions of pooled epididymal white adipose tissue using data obtained from gene expression omnibus. Results showed distinct differentially expressed genes in young and aged mice with a p value cutoff of 0.05 and dissimilarities in the young and aged epididymal white adipose tissue phagocytic cells. Functional enrichment showed activation of cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathways, phosphorus metabolic processes and inflammatory pathways such as IL-17, TNF, NF-kappa B, and TGF-β, while AMPK, PPAR and oxidative phosphorylation were suppressed. The analysis showed that aging is linked with phagocytic cell decline, accumulated cellular damages, inflammation, immunosenescence and increased phosphorus metabolism. Interventions that reduce phosphate-containing compound could improve phosphorus metabolism in old age to prolong lifespan and better health.© 2022.

The sparsity and noise of scRNA-seq data, combined with the fact that immune cell types often occur on a continuum, make cell typing of TME scRNA-seq data a significant challenge. Several single-label cell typing methods have been put forth to address the limitations of noise and sparsity, but accounting for the often overlapped spectrum of cell types in the immune TME remains an obstacle. To address this, we developed a new scRNA-seq cell-typing method, Cell-typing using variance Adjusted Mahalanobis distances with Multi-Labeling (CAMML). CAMML leverages cell type-specific weighted gene sets to score every cell in a dataset for every potential cell type. This allows cells to be labelled either by their highest scoring cell type as a single label classification or based on a score cut-off to give multi-label classification. For single-label cell typing, CAMML performance is comparable to existing cell typing methods, SingleR and Garnett. For scenarios where cells may exhibit features of multiple cell types (e.g., undifferentiated cells), the multi-label classification supported by CAMML offers important benefits relative to the current state-of-the-art methods. By integrating data across studies, omics platforms, and species, CAMML serves as a robust and adaptable method for overcoming the challenges of scRNA-seq analysis."

"34858399","Aging of the Hematopoietic Stem Cell Niche: New Tools to Answer an Old Question.","Front Immunol","The hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) niche is a specialized microenvironment, where a complex and dynamic network of interactions across multiple cell types regulates HSC function. During the last years, it became progressively clearer that changes in the HSC niche are responsible for specific alterations of HSC behavior. The aging of the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment has been shown to critically contribute to the decline in HSC function over time. Interestingly, while upon aging some niche structures within the BM are degenerated and negatively affect HSC functionality, other niche cells and specific signals are preserved and essential to retaining HSC function and regenerative capacity. These new findings on the role of the aging BM niche critically depend on the implementation of new technical tools, developed thanks to transdisciplinary approaches, which bring together different scientific fields. For example, the development of specific mouse models in addition to coculture systems, new 3D-imaging tools, ossicles, andex-vivoBM mimicking systems is highlighting the importance of new technologies to unravel the complexity of the BM niche on aging. Of note, an exponential impact in the understanding of this biological system has been recently brought by single-cell sequencing techniques, spatial transcriptomics, and implementation of artificial intelligence and deep learning approaches to data analysis and integration. This review focuses on how the aging of the BM niche affects HSCs and on the new tools to investigate the specific alterations occurring in the BM upon aging. All these new advances in the understanding of the BM niche and its regulatory function on HSCs have the potential to lead to novel therapeutical approaches to preserve HSC function upon aging and disease.Copyright © 2021 Matteini, Mulaw and Florian."

The Computational Analysis of Novel Drug Opportunities (CANDO) platform for shotgun multitarget therapeutic discovery, repurposing, and design aims to improve their efficacy and safety by employing a holistic approach that computes interaction signatures between every drug/compound and a large library of non-redundant protein structures corresponding to the human proteome fold space. These signatures are compared and analyzed to determine if a given drug/compound is efficacious and safe for a given indication/disease. In this study, we used a deep learning-based autoencoder to first reduce the dimensionality of CANDO-computed drug-proteome interaction signatures. We then employed a reduced conditional variational autoencoder to generate novel drug-like compounds when given a target encoded ""objective"" signature. Using this approach, we designed compounds to recreate the interaction signatures for twenty approved and experimental drugs and showed that 16/20 designed compounds were predicted to be significantly (p-value ≤ 0.05) more behaviorally similar relative to all corresponding controls, and 20/20 were predicted to be more behaviorally similar relative to a random control. We further observed that redesigns of objectives developed via rational drug design performed significantly better than those derived from natural sources (p-value ≤ 0.05), suggesting that the model learned an abstraction of rational drug design. We also show that the designed compounds are structurally diverse and synthetically feasible when compared to their respective objective drugs despite consistently high predicted behavioral similarity. Finally, we generated new designs that enhanced thirteen drugs/compounds associated with non-small cell lung cancer and anti-aging properties using their predicted proteomic interaction signatures. his study represents a significant step forward in automating holistic therapeutic design with machine learning, enabling the rapid generation of novel, effective, and safe drug leads for any indication."

They have been identified predominantly in the ovary and testis, where they serve essential roles in transposon silencing in order to protect the integrity of the genome in the germline. The potential expression of piRNAs in somatic cells has been controversial. In the present study we demonstrate the expression of piRNAs derived from both genic and transposon RNAs in the intersegmental muscles (ISMs) from the tobacco hawkmothManduca sexta. These piRNAs are abundantly expressed, ∼27 nt long, map antisense to transposons, are oxidation resistant, exhibit a 5' uridine bias, and amplifyviathe canonical ping-pong pathway. An RNA-seq analysis demonstrated that 19 piRNA pathway genes are expressed in the ISMs and are developmentally regulated. The abundance of piRNAs does not change when the muscles initiate developmentally-regulated atrophy, but are repressed coincident with the commitment of the muscles undergo programmed cell death at the end of metamorphosis. This change in piRNA expression is correlated with the repression of several retrotransposons and the induction of specific DNA transposons. The developmentally-regulated changes in the expression of piRNAs, piRNA pathway genes, and transposons are all regulated by 20-hydroxyecdysone, the steroid hormone that controls the timing of ISM death. Taken together, these data provide compelling evidence for the existence of piRNA in somatic tissues and suggest that they may play roles in developmental processes such as programmed cell death.Copyright © 2021 Tsuji, Thomson, Brown, Ghosh, Theurkauf, Weng and Schwartz."

Technological advances in sequencing, improved knowledge of omics, integration with bioinformatics and newin vitrotesting formats, have enabled personalized medicine to become a reality. Individual variation in response to environmental factors can affect susceptibility to disease and response to treatments. Space travel exposes humans to environmental stressors that lead to physiological adaptations, from altered cell behavior to abnormal tissue responses, including immune system impairment. In the context of human space flight research, human health studies have shown a significant inter-individual variability in response to space analogue conditions. A substantial degree of variability has been noticed in response to medications (from both an efficacy and toxicity perspective) as well as in susceptibility to damage from radiation exposure and in physiological changes such as loss of bone mineral density and muscle mass in response to deconditioning. At present, personalized medicine for astronauts is limited. With the advent of longer duration missions beyond low Earth orbit, it is imperative that space agencies adopt a personalized strategy for each astronaut, starting from pre-emptive personalized pre-clinical approaches through to individualized countermeasures to minimize harmful physiological changes and find targeted treatment for disease. Advances in space medicine can also be translated to terrestrial applications, and vice versa.

Thus, systems such as the musculoskeletal and cardiovascular systems appear to require constant reinforcement or conditioning to maintain integrity. Loss of conditioning or development of chronic deconditioning can have multiple consequences. The study of different types of deconditioning and their prevention or reversal can offer a number of clues to the regulation of these systems and point to how deconditioning poses risk for disease development and progression. From the study of deconditioning associated with spaceflight, a condition not predicted by evolution, prolonged bedrest, protracted sedentary behavior, as well as menopause and obesity and their consequences, provide a background to better understand human heterogeneity and how physical fitness may impact the risks for chronic conditions subsequent to the deconditioning. The effectiveness of optimized physical activity and exercise protocols likely depend on the nature of the deconditioning, the sex and genetics of the individual, whether one is addressing prevention of deconditioning-associated disease or disease-associated progression, and whether it is focused on acute or chronic deconditioning associated with different forms of deconditioning. While considerable research effort has gone into preventing deconditioning, the study of the process of deconditioning and its endpoints can provide clues to the regulation of the affected systems and their contributions to human heterogeneity that have been framed by the boundary conditions of Earth during evolution and the ""use it or lose it"" principle of regulation. Such information regarding heterogeneity that is elaborated by the study of deconditioning environments could enhance the effectiveness of individualized interventions to prevent deconditions or rescue those who have become deconditioned.Copyright © 2021 Hart."

In this work, we investigate the effects of microgravity simulation on early lineage commitment of hiPSCs from healthy and Marfan Syndrome (MFS; OMIM #154700) donors, using the embryoid bodies model of tissue differentiation and evaluating their ultra-structural conformation. MFS model involves an anomalous organization of the extracellular matrix for a deficit of fibrillin-1, an essential protein of connective tissue.In vitromodels require the use of embryoid bodies derived from hiPSCs. A DRPM was used to simulate microgravity conditions.Our data suggest an increase of the stemness of those EBs maintained in SMG condition. EBs are still capable of external migration, but are less likely to distinguish, providing a measure of the remaining progenitor or stem cell populations in the earlier stage. The microgravity response appears to vary between WT and Marfan EBs, presumably as a result of a cell structural component deficiency due to fibrillin-1 protein lack. In fact, MFS EBs show a reduced adaptive capacity to the environment of microgravity that prevented them from reacting and making rapid adjustments, while healthy EBs show stem retention, without any structural changes due to microgravity conditions.EBs formation specifically mimics stem cell differentiation into embryonic tissues, this process has also significant similarities with adult stem cell-based tissue regeneration. The use of SMG devices for the maintenance of stem cells on regenerative medicine applications is becoming increasingly more feasible.The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s12195-021-00680-1.© The Author(s) 2021."
"34887485","Nrf2 plays a critical role in the metabolic response during and after spaceflight.","Commun Biol","Space travel induces stresses that contribute to health problems, as well as inducing the expression of Nrf2 (NF-E2-related factor-2) target genes that mediate adaptive responses to oxidative and other stress responses. The volume of epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT) in mice increases during spaceflight, a change that is attenuated by Nrf2 knockout. We conducted metabolome analyses of plasma from wild-type and Nrf2 knockout mice collected at pre-flight, in-flight and post-flight time points, as well as tissues collected post-flight to clarify the metabolic responses during and after spaceflight and the contribution of Nrf2 to these responses. Plasma glycerophospholipid and sphingolipid levels were elevated during spaceflight, whereas triacylglycerol levels were lower after spaceflight. In wild-type mouse eWAT, triacylglycerol levels were increased, but phosphatidylcholine levels were decreased, and these changes were attenuated in Nrf2 knockout mice. Transcriptome analyses revealed marked changes in the expression of lipid-related genes in the liver and eWAT after spaceflight and the effects of Nrf2 knockout on these changes. Based on these results, we concluded that space stress provokes significant responses in lipid metabolism during and after spaceflight; Nrf2 plays critical roles in these responses.© 2021.

"34884646","Changes in Exosomal miRNA Composition in Thyroid Cancer Cells after Prolonged Exposure to Real Microgravity in Space.","Int J Mol Sci","As much as space travel and exploration have been a goal since humankind looked up to the stars, the challenges coming with it are manifold and difficult to overcome. Therefore, researching the changes the human organism undergoes following exposure to weightlessness, on a cellular or a physiological level, is imperative to reach the goal of exploring space and new planets. Building on the results of our CellBox-1 experiment, where thyroid cancer cells were flown to the International Space Station, we are now taking advantage of the newest technological opportunities to gain more insight into the changes in cell-cell communication of these cells. Analyzing the exosomal microRNA composition after several days of microgravity might elucidate some of the proteomic changes we have reported earlier. An array scan of a total of 754 miRNA targets revealed more than 100 differentially expressed miRNAs in our samples, many of which have been implicated in thyroid disease in other studies."
"34862387","Mental imagery of object motion in weightlessness.","NPJ Microgravity","Mental imagery represents a potential countermeasure for sensorimotor and cognitive dysfunctions due to spaceflight. It might help train people to deal with conditions unique to spaceflight. Thus, dynamic interactions with the inertial motion of weightless objects are only experienced in weightlessness but can be simulated on Earth using mental imagery. Such training might overcome the problem of calibrating fine-grained hand forces and estimating the spatiotemporal parameters of the resulting object motion. Here, a group of astronauts grasped an imaginary ball, threw it against the ceiling or the front wall, and caught it after the bounce, during pre-flight, in-flight, and post-flight experiments. They varied the throwing speed across trials and imagined that the ball moved under Earth's gravity or weightlessness. We found that the astronauts were able to reproduce qualitative differences between inertial and gravitational motion already on ground, and further adapted their behavior during spaceflight. Thus, they adjusted the throwing speed and the catching time, equivalent to the duration of virtual ball motion, as a function of the imaginary 0 g condition versus the imaginary 1 g condition. Arm kinematics of the frontal throws further revealed a differential processing of imagined gravity level in terms of the spatial features of the arm and virtual ball trajectories. We suggest that protocols of this kind may facilitate sensorimotor adaptation and help tuning vestibular plasticity in-flight, since mental imagery of gravitational motion is known to engage the vestibular cortex.© 2021.

"34836120","Does Physical Inactivity Induce Significant Changes in Human Gut Microbiota? New Answers Using the Dry Immersion Hypoactivity Model.","Nutrients","Gut microbiota, a major contributor to human health, is influenced by physical activity and diet, and displays a functional cross-talk with skeletal muscle. Conversely, few data are available on the impact of hypoactivity, although sedentary lifestyles are widespread and associated with negative health and socio-economic impacts. The study aim was to determine the effect of Dry Immersion (DI), a severe hypoactivity model, on the human gut microbiota composition. Stool samples were collected from 14 healthy men before and after 5 days of DI to determine the gut microbiota taxonomic profiles by 16S metagenomic sequencing in strictly controlled dietary conditions. The α and β diversities indices were unchanged. However, the operational taxonomic units associated with the Clostridiales order and theLachnospiraceaefamily, belonging to the Firmicutes phylum, were significantly increased after DI. Propionate, a short-chain fatty acid metabolized by skeletal muscle, was significantly reduced in post-DI stool samples. The finding that intestine bacteria are sensitive to hypoactivity raises questions about their impact and role in chronic sedentary lifestyles."

While the latter, assisted by microbial dark matter, presents a greater potential of creating an upsurge in in-situ and ex-situ rapid microbial detection techniques, this anticipated change will also set forth a revolution in microbial cultivation and diversity analyses. The availability of a microbial genetic toolbox at the expanse will help complement the current understanding of the microbiome and assist in real-time monitoring of the dynamics for detecting the health status of the host with utmost precision. Alongside, in light of the emerging infectious diseases, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and social demands for safer and better health care alternatives, microbiology laboratories are prospected to drift in terms of the volume and nature of research and outcomes. With today's microbiological lens, one can predict with certainty that in the years to come, microbes will play a significant role in therapeutic treatment and the designing of novel diagnostic techniques. Another area where the scope of microbial application seems to be promising is the use of novel probiotics as a method to offer health benefits whilst promoting metabolic outputs specific for microbiome replenishment. Nonetheless, the evolution of extraterrestrial microbes or the adaptation of earth microbes as extraterrestrial residents are also yet another prominent microbial event one may witness in the upcoming years.

"34956313","A Novel Gene Prognostic Signature Based on Differential DNA Methylation in Breast Cancer.","Front Genet","Background:DNA methylation played essential roles in regulating gene expression. The impact of DNA methylation status on the occurrence and development of cancers has been well demonstrated. However, little is known about its prognostic role in breast cancer (BC).Materials:The Illumina Human Methylation450 array (450k array) data of BC was downloaded from the UCSC xena database. Transcriptomic data of BC was downloaded from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Firstly, we used univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis to screen out independent prognostic CpGs, and then we identified methylation-associated prognosis subgroups by consensus clustering. Next, a methylation prognostic model was developed using multivariate Cox analysis and was validated with the Illumina Human Methylation27 array (27k array) dataset of BC. We then screened out differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between methylation high-risk and low-risk groups and constructed a methylation-based gene prognostic signature. Further, we validated the gene signature with three subgroups of the TCGA-BRCA dataset and an external dataset GSE146558 from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database.Results:We established a methylation prognostic signature and a methylation-based gene prognostic signature, and there was a close positive correlation between them. The gene prognostic signature involved six genes:IRF2, KCNJ11, ZDHHC9, LRP11, PCMT1,andTMEM70.We verified their expression in mRNA and protein levels in BC. Both methylation and methylation-based gene prognostic signatures showed good prognostic stratification ability. The AUC values of 3-years, 5-years overall survival (OS) were 0.737, 0.744 in the methylation signature and 0.725, 0.715 in the gene signature, respectively. In the validation groups, high-risk patients were confirmed to have poorer OS. The AUC values of 3 years were 0.757, 0.735, 0.733 in the three subgroups of TCGA dataset and 0.635 in GSE146558 dataset.Conclusion:This study revealed the DNA methylation landscape and established promising methylation and methylation-based gene prognostic signatures that could serve as potential prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets.Copyright © 2021 Zhu, Zhang, Liu, Wang, Yang, Zheng, Wu and Zhou."

Previous studies were controversial and inconsistent about PM2.5and SHS air pollutants on neonatal birth weight outcomes, and no studies assessed the potential interactive effects between PM2.5and SHS on birth weight outcomes.Purpose:To investigate the interaction between gestational PM2.5and SHS air pollution exposure on the risk of macrosomia among pregnant women and examine the modifying effect of SHS exposure on the association of PM2.5air pollution and birth weight outcomes during pregnancy.Methods:Research data were derived from the National Free Preconception Health Examination Project (NFPHEP), which lasted 3 years from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2012. At least 240,000 Chinese women from 220 counties were enrolled in this project. PM2.5exposure concentration was obtained using a hindcast model specific for historical PM2.5estimation from satellite-retrieved aerosol optic depth. Different interaction models about air pollution exposure on birth weight outcomes were established, according to the adjustment of different confounding factors and different pregnancy stages. The establishment of interaction models was based on multivariable logistic regression, and the main confounding factors were maternal age at delivery and pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) of participants. SHS subgroups analysis was conducted to further confirm the results of interaction models.Results:In total, 197,877 participants were included in our study. In the full-adjusted interaction model, maternal exposure to PM2.5was associated with an increased risk of macrosomia in whole, the first-, second-, and third trimesters of pregnancy (p< 0.001). The interactive effect was statistically significant between maternal exposure to PM2.5and SHS on the risk of macrosomia in the whole (interactionp< 0.050) and the first-trimester pregnancy (interactionp< 0.050), not in the second (interactionp> 0.050) or third trimester (interactionp> 0.050) of pregnancy. The higher frequency of SHS exposure prompted the stronger interaction between the two air pollutants in the whole pregnancy and the first-trimester pregnancy.Conclusions:In the whole and first-trimester pregnancy, maternal exposure to SHS during pregnancy enhanced the risk of macrosomia among pregnant women exposed to PM2.5air pollutants, and the interaction became stronger with the higher frequency of SHS exposure.Copyright © 2021 Luo, Zhang, Pan and Chen."
"34943909","Molecular Basis of Accelerated Aging with Immune Dysfunction-Mediated Inflammation (Inflamm-Aging) in Patients with Systemic Sclerosis.","Cells","Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a chronic connective tissue disorder characterized by immune dysregulation, chronic inflammation, vascular endothelial cell dysfunction, and progressive tissue fibrosis of the skin and internal organs. Moreover, increased cancer incidence and accelerated aging are also found. The increased cancer incidence is believed to be a result of chromosome instability. Accelerated cellular senescence has been confirmed by the shortening of telomere length due to increased DNA breakage, abnormal DNA repair response, and telomerase deficiency mediated by enhanced oxidative/nitrative stresses. The immune dysfunctions of SSc patients are manifested by excessive production of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1, IL-6, IL-17, IFN-α, and TNF-α, which can elicit potent tissue inflammation followed by tissue fibrosis. Furthermore, a number of autoantibodies including anti-topoisomerase 1 (anti-TOPO-1), anti-centromere (ACA or anti-CENP-B), anti-RNA polymerase enzyme (anti-RNAP III), anti-ribonuclear proteins (anti-U1, U2, and U11/U12 RNP), anti-nucleolar antigens (anti-Th/T0, anti-NOR90, anti-Ku, anti-RuvBL1/2, and anti-PM/Scl), and anti-telomere-associated proteins were also found. Based on these data, inflamm-aging caused by immune dysfunction-mediated inflammation exists in patients with SSc. Hence, increased cellular senescence is elicited by the interactions among excessive oxidative stress, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and autoantibodies. In the present review, we will discuss in detail the molecular basis of chromosome instability, increased oxidative stress, and functional adaptation by deranged immunome, which are related to inflamm-aging in patients with SSc."
"35034102","Loss of circadian gene Timeless induces EMT and tumor progression in colorectal cancer via Zeb1-dependent mechanism.","Cell Death Differ","The circadian gene Timeless (TIM) provides a molecular bridge between circadian and cell cycle/DNA replication regulatory systems and has been recently involved in human cancer development and progression. However, its functional role in colorectal cancer (CRC), the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, has not been fully clarified yet. Here, the analysis of two independent CRC patient cohorts (total 1159 samples) reveals that loss of TIM expression is an unfavorable prognostic factor significantly correlated with advanced tumor stage, metastatic spreading, and microsatellite stability status. Genome-wide expression profiling, in vitro and in vivo experiments, revealed that TIM knockdown induces the activation of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) program. Accordingly, the analysis of a large set of human samples showed that TIM expression inversely correlated with a previously established gene signature of canonical EMT markers (EMT score), and its ectopic silencing promotes migration, invasion, and acquisition of stem-like phenotype in CRC cells. Mechanistically, we found that loss of TIM expression unleashes ZEB1 expression that in turn drives the EMT program and enhances the aggressive behavior of CRC cells. Besides, the deranged TIM-ZEB1 axis sets off the accumulation of DNA damage and delays DNA damage recovery. Furthermore, we show that the aggressive and genetically unstable 'CMS4 colorectal cancer molecular subtype' is characterized by a lower expression of TIM and that patients with the combination of low-TIM/high-ZEB1 expression have a poorer outcome. In conclusion, our results as a whole suggest the engagement of an unedited TIM-ZEB1 axis in key pathological processes driving malignant phenotype acquisition in colorectal carcinogenesis. Thus, TIM-ZEB1 expression profiling could provide a robust prognostic biomarker in CRC patients, supporting targeted therapeutic strategies with better treatment selection and patients' outcomes.© 2022.

"35024093","Network-based prioritization of cancer biomarkers by phenotype-driven module detection and ranking.","Comput Struct Biotechnol J","This paper describes an ensemble method with supervised module detection and further module prioritization for reliable network-based biomarker discovery. We design a module detection and ranking method called mRank to discover reliable network modules as cancer diagnostic biomarkers, with two procedures: (1) an iterative supervised module detection guided by phenotypic states in a specific network, (2) a block-based module ranking locally and globally via network topological centrality. We validate its effectiveness and efficiency by identifying hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) network modules on a comprehensive gene regulatory network with specifying gene interactions by HCC RNA-seq data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). These top-ranked modules by mRank get a mean AUC of 0.995 on TCGA HCC dataset with 371 tumor samples and 50 controls by cross-validation SVM. Based on the prior knowledge of cancer dysfunctions enriched in top-ranked modules, 69 genes are identified as HCC candidate biomarkers. They are further validated in independent cohorts with a classifier trained on TCGA HCC dataset. A mean AUC of 0.846 is achieved in distinguishing 976 disease samples from 827 controls. Moreover, some known HCC signatures such as AFP and SPP1 are also included in our identified biomarkers. mRank enables us to find more reliable network modules for cancer diagnosis. For a proof-of-concept study, we validate it in identifying HCC network biomarkers and it is generalizable to other cancers or complex disease. The overall results have demonstrated that mRank can find effective network biomarkers for cancer diagnosis which result in less false positives.© 2021 The Author(s)."
"35022385","Connexin 43 confers chemoresistance through activating PI3K.","Oncogenesis","Circumventing chemoresistance is crucial for effectively treating cancer including glioblastoma, a lethal brain cancer. The gap junction protein connexin 43 (Cx43) renders glioblastoma resistant to chemotherapy; however, targeting Cx43 is difficult because mechanisms underlying Cx43-mediated chemoresistance remain elusive. Here we report that Cx43, but not other connexins, is highly expressed in a subpopulation of glioblastoma and Cx43 mRNA levels strongly correlate with poor prognosis and chemoresistance in this population, making Cx43 the prime therapeutic target among all connexins. Depleting Cx43 or treating cells with αCT1-a Cx43 peptide inhibitor that sensitizes glioblastoma to the chemotherapy temozolomide-inactivates phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K), whereas overexpression of Cx43 activates this signaling. Moreover, αCT1-induced chemo-sensitization is counteracted by a PI3K active mutant. Further research reveals that αCT1 inactivates PI3K without blocking the release of PI3K-activating molecules from membrane channels and that Cx43 selectively binds to the PI3K catalytic subunit β (PIK3CB, also called PI3Kβ or p110β), suggesting that Cx43 activates PIK3CB/p110β independent of its channel functions. To explore the therapeutic potential of simultaneously targeting Cx43 and PIK3CB/p110β, αCT1 is combined with TGX-221 or GSK2636771, two PIK3CB/p110β-selective inhibitors. These two different treatments synergistically inactivate PI3K and sensitize glioblastoma cells to temozolomide in vitro and in vivo. Our study has revealed novel mechanistic insights into Cx43/PI3K-mediated temozolomide resistance in glioblastoma and demonstrated that targeting Cx43 and PIK3CB/p110β together is an effective therapeutic approach for overcoming chemoresistance.© 2022.

"35018218","Induction of serine hydroxymethyltransferase 2 promotes tumorigenesis and metastasis in neuroblastoma.","Oncotarget","High-risk neuroblastoma (NB) remains an extremely difficult subgroup to cure and is associated withMYCNamplification. Serine hydroxymethyltransferase 2 (SHMT2) regulates serine metabolism in a myc-dependent manner; it is upregulated in several cancers and is associated with tumor aggressiveness. Akt-2, an important regulator ofMYCNvia the PI3K/Akt pathway, induces metastatic potential in NB. The association between SHMT2 and PI3K/Akt in hepatocyte regeneration has been well established but its mechanistic interaction in cancer has yet to be clearly elucidated. Herein, we evaluated the exact role of SHMT2 on the PI3K/Akt pathway, in addition to NB tumorigenesis and metastatic potentialin vitro.SHMT2gene expression and overall survival (OS) were assessed. Two human NB cell lines were examined. SHMT2 silencing and overexpression were performed. The downstream effects were analyzed with immunoblotting, RT-qPCR and functional assays were performed. We foundSHMT2gene expression is associated with decreased OS andMYCNamplification. SHMT2 protein and mRNA expression are increased inMYCN-amplified cells. SHMT2 expression has a direct interaction with Akt-2 andMYCN. Induction ofSHMT2increased cellular proliferation, colony formation and cellular migration andSHMT2expression was increased in metastatic NB cells. We conclude that SHMT2 regulates N-Myc via phosphorylation of Akt-2 and plays an important role in NB tumorigenesis by contributing to cell growth, migration, colony formation and metastasisin vitro.Copyright: © 2022 Clark et al."
"35017665","BRD4 inhibition induces synthetic lethality in ARID2-deficient hepatocellular carcinoma by increasing DNA damage.","Oncogene","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has emerged as the third cause of cancer-related death owing to lacking effective systemic therapies. Genomic DNA sequencing revealed the high frequency of loss-of-function mutations in ARID2, which encodes a subunit of SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, however, the therapeutic strategy for the HCC patients with ARID2 mutations is still completely unclear. In this study, we first performed a high-throughput screening approach using a compound library consisting of 2 180 FDA-approved drugs and other compounds, to elicit the potential drugs for synthetic lethality to target ARID2-deficient HCC cells. Interestingly, JQ1, a selective inhibitor of bromodomain protein BRD4, uniquely suppressed the growth of ARID2- deficient HCC cells. Next JQ1 is further confirmed to predominantly induce cell lethality upon ARID2 depletion through exacerbating DNA damage, especially double strand breaks (DSBs). Functional assays demonstrated that both BRD4 inhibition and ARID2 deficiency synergistically impede two main DNA damage repair pathways, homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), through attenuating the transcription of BRCA1, RAD51, and 53BP1, which encode the core molecules responsible for DSB repair. Mechanistically, both ARID2 and BRD4 exert a synergistic effect for maintaining transcriptional enhancer-promoter loops of these genes within chromatin conformation. However, as both ARID2 and BRD4 are disrupted, the expression of these DNA repair-related genes in response to DNA damage are hindered, resulting in DSB accumulation and cell apoptosis. Taken together, this study discloses that BRD4 inhibition may induce synthetic lethality in ARID2-deficient HCC cells, which might provide a potential therapeutic strategy for HCC patients with ARID2 mutations.© 2022.

To address this issue, we performed gene panel-based sequencing of 18 stage IB cervical cancers treated with definitive radiotherapy, including two cases of local recurrence, followed by in vitro and in silico analyses. Simultaneous mutations inKRASandSMAD4(KRASmt/SMAD4mt) were detected only in a local recurrence case, indicating potential association of this mutation signature with radioresistance. In isogenic cell-based experiments, a combination of activatingKRASmutation and SMAD4 deficiency led to X-ray resistance, whereas either of these factors alone did not. Analysis of genomic data from 55,308 cancers showed a significant trend toward co-occurrence of mutations inKRASandSMAD4. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis of the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia dataset suggested upregulation of the pathways involved in epithelial mesenchymal transition and inflammatory responses inKRASmt/SMAD4mtcancer cells. Notably, irradiation with therapeutic carbon ions led to robust killing of X-ray-resistantKRASmt/SMAD4mtcancer cells. These data indicate that theKRASmt/SMAD4mtsignature is a potential predictor of radioresistance, and that carbon ion radiotherapy is a potential option to treat early-stage cervical cancers with theKRASmt/SMAD4mtsignature."

Accumulating evidence has unveiled that inflammatory response promotes tumor progression, enhances angiogenesis, and causes local immunosuppression. Herein, we aim to develop an inflammatory related prognostic signature, and found it could be used to predict gemcitabine response in PDAC.Methods:PDAC cohorts with mRNA expression profiles and clinical information were systematically collected from the four public databases. An inflammatory response related genes (IRRGs) prognostic signature was constructed by LASSO regression analysis. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, receiver operating characteristic analysis, principal component analysis, and univariate and multivariate Cox analyses were carried out to evaluate effectiveness, and reliability of the signature. The correlation between gemcitabine response and risk score was evaluated in the TCGA-PAAD cohort. The GDSC database, pRRophetic algorithm, and connectivity map analysis were used to predict gemcitabine sensitivity and identify potential drugs for the treatment of PDAC. Finally, we analyzed differences in frequencies of gene mutations, infiltration of immune cells, as well as biological functions between different subgroups divided by the prognostic signature.Results:We established a seven IRRGs (ADM, DCBLD2, EREG, ITGA5, MIF, TREM1, and BTG2) signature which divided the PDAC patients into low- and high-risk groups. Prognostic value of the signature was validated in 11 PDAC cohorts consisting of 1337 PDAC patients from 6 countries. A nomogram that integrated the IRRGs signature and clinicopathologic factors of PDAC patients was constructed. The risk score showed positive correlation with gemcitabine resistance. Two drugs (BMS-536924 and dasatinib) might have potential therapeutic implications in high-risk PDAC patients. We found that the high-risk group had higher frequencies of KRAS, TP53, and CDKN2A mutations, increased infiltration of macrophages M0, neutrophils, and macrophages M2 cells, as well as upregulated hypoxia and glycolysis pathways, while the low-risk group had increased infiltration of CD8+T, naïve B, and plasma and macrophages M1 cells.Conclusion:We constructed and validated an IRRGs signature that could be used to predict the prognosis and gemcitabine response of patients with PDAC, as well as two drugs (BMS-536924 and dasatinib) may contribute to PDAC treatment.Copyright © 2021 Xiao, Li, Yu, Zhou, Duan, Yang, Liu and Xu."
"34993232","miRNA Combinatorics and its Role in Cell State Control-A Probabilistic Approach.","Front Mol Biosci","A hallmark of cancer evolution is that the tumor may change its cell identity and improve its survival and fitness. Drastic change in microRNA (miRNA) composition and quantities accompany such dynamic processes. Cancer samples are composed of cells' mixtures of varying stages of cancerous progress. Therefore, cell-specific molecular profiling represents cellular averaging. In this study, we consider the degree to which altering miRNAs composition shifts cell behavior. We used COMICS, an iterative framework that simulates the stochastic events of miRNA-mRNA pairing, using a probabilistic approach. COMICS simulates the likelihood that cells change their transcriptome following many iterations (100 k). Results of COMICS from the human cell line (HeLa) confirmed that most genes are resistant to miRNA regulation. However, COMICS results suggest that the composition of the abundant miRNAs dictates the nature of the cells (across three cell lines) regardless of its actual mRNA steady-state.In silicoperturbations of cell lines (i.e., by overexpressing miRNAs) allowed to classify genes according to their sensitivity and resilience to any combination of miRNA perturbations. Our results expose an overlooked quantitative dimension for a set of genes and miRNA regulation in living cells. The immediate implication is that even relatively modest overexpression of specific miRNAs may shift cell identity and impact cancer evolution.Copyright © 2021 Mahlab-Aviv, Linial and Linial."

However, the molecular and clinical implications of m6A modification in melanoma tumor microenvironment (TME) and immune infiltration remain largely unknown. Here, we utilized consensus molecular clustering with nonnegative matrix factorization based on the melanoma transcriptomic profiles of 23 m6A regulators to determine the m6A modification clusters and m6A-related gene signature. Three distinct m6A modification patterns (m6A-C1, C2, and C3), which are characterized by specific m6A regulator expression, survival outcomes, and biological pathways, were identified in more than 1,000 melanoma samples. The immune profile analyses showed that these three m6A modification subtypes were highly consistent with the three known immune phenotypes: immune-desert (C1), immune-excluded (C2), and immune-inflamed (C3). Tumor digital cytometry (CIBERSORT, ssGSEA) algorithm revealed an upregulated infiltration of CD8+T cell and NK cell in m6A-C3 subtype. An m6A scoring scheme calculated by principal component of m6A signatures stratified melanoma patients into high- and low-m6sig score subgroups; a high score was significantly associated with prolonged survival and enhanced immune infiltration. Furthermore, fewer somatic copy number alternations (SCNA) and PD-L1 expression were found in patients with high m6Sig score. In addition, patients with high m6Sig score demonstrated marked immune responses and durable clinical benefits in two independent immunotherapy cohorts. Overall, this study indicated that m6A modification is involved in melanoma tumor microenvironment immune regulation and contributes to formation of tumor immunogenicity. Comprehensive evaluation of the m6A modification pattern of individual tumors will provide more insights into molecular mechanisms of TME characterization and promote more effective personalized biotherapy strategies.Copyright © 2021 Du, Li, Li, Liu, Li, Dang, Chu, Yan, Fang, Wu, Zhang, Zhu and Li."

It directly affects the progression and prognosis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, the effects of STK25 on lipid metabolism in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain unexplored. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of STK25 in HCC and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms.Immunohistochemistry was used to measure the expression of STK25 in hepatic tissues of HCC patients, and public datasets were used as supplementary material for predicting the expression of STK25 and the prognosis of patients with HCC. The interaction between STK25 and striatin (STRN) was determined by the STRING database, immunohistochemistry and western blot analyses. The involved signaling pathway was detected by the KEGG database and western blot. Moreover, the biological behaviors of the HCC cells were detected by wound healing assays, Transwell invasion assays and oil red O staining. Finally, it was verified again by xenograft model.STK25 is highly expressed in HCC patients and is associated with poor prognosis. STK25 knockdown inhibited the HCC cell invasion and proliferation, promotes apoptosis. Consistently, STK25 knockdown inhibited tumor growth in xenograft mouse model. Besides, STK25 deficiency decreased lipid synthesis, energy reserve, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by down-regulating lipid metabolism signaling pathway. STRN could reverse the change of lipid metabolism.Our results demonstrated that STK25 interacted with STRN to regulates the energy reserve and EMT via lipid metabolism reprogramming. Accordingly, high expression of STK25 may be associated with HCC patients and poor prognosis, which implicates STK25 could be a potential target for lipid metabolism in cancer therapy.© 2021.

"34961772","Identification of an mRNA isoform switch for HNRNPA1 in breast cancers.","Sci Rep","Roles of HNRNPA1 are beginning to emerge in cancers; however, mechanisms causing deregulation of HNRNPA1 function remain elusive. Here, we describe an isoform switch between the 3'-UTR isoforms of HNRNPA1 in breast cancers. We show that the dominantly expressed isoform in mammary tissue has a short half-life. In breast cancers, this isoform is downregulated in favor of a stable isoform. The stable isoform is expressed more in breast cancers, and more HNRNPA1 protein is synthesized from this isoform. High HNRNPA1 protein levels correlate with poor survival in patients. In support of this, silencing of HNRNPA1 causes a reversal in neoplastic phenotypes, including proliferation, clonogenic potential, migration, and invasion. In addition, silencing of HNRNPA1 results in the downregulation of microRNAs that map to intragenic regions. Among these miRNAs, miR-21 is known for its transcriptional upregulation in breast and numerous other cancers. Altogether, the cancer-specific isoform switch we describe here for HNRNPA1 emphasizes the need to study gene expression at the isoform level in cancers to identify novel cases of oncogene activation.© 2021.

Yet, this problem is not routinely addressed in current sequence processing pipelines.We present cDNA-detector, a computational tool to identify and remove exogenous cDNA contamination in DNA sequencing experiments. We demonstrate that cDNA-detector can identify cDNAs quickly and accurately from alignment files. A source inference step attempts to separate endogenous cDNAs (retrocopied genes) from potential cloned, exogenous cDNAs. cDNA-detector provides a mechanism to decontaminate the alignment from detected cDNAs. Simulation studies show that cDNA-detector is highly sensitive and specific, outperforming existing tools. We apply cDNA-detector to several highly-cited public databases (TCGA, ENCODE, NCBI SRA) and show that contaminant genes appear in sequencing experiments where they lead to incorrect coverage peak calls.cDNA-detector is a user-friendly and accurate tool to detect and remove cDNA detection in NGS libraries. This two-step design reduces the risk of true variant removal since it allows for manual review of candidates. We find that contamination with intentionally and accidentally introduced cDNAs is an underappreciated problem even in widely-used consortium datasets, where it can lead to spurious results. Our findings highlight the importance of sensitive detection and removal of contaminant cDNA from NGS libraries before downstream analysis.© 2021. The Author(s)."
"34948172","Gene Expression Profile in Primary Tumor Is Associated with Brain-Tropism of Metastasis from Lung Adenocarcinoma.","Int J Mol Sci","Lung adenocarcinoma has a strong propensity to metastasize to the brain. The brain metastases are difficult to treat and can cause significant morbidity and mortality. Identifying patients with increased risk of developing brain metastasis can assist medical decision-making, facilitating a closer surveillance or justifying a preventive treatment. We analyzed 27 lung adenocarcinoma patients who received a primary lung tumor resection and developed metastases within 5 years after the surgery. Among these patients, 16 developed brain metastases and 11 developed non-brain metastases only. We performed targeted DNA sequencing, RNA sequencing and immunohistochemistry to characterize the difference between the primary tumors. We also compared our findings to the published data of brain-tropic and non-brain-tropic lung adenocarcinoma cell lines. The results demonstrated that the targeted tumor DNA sequencing did not reveal a significant difference between the groups, but the RNA sequencing identified 390 differentially expressed genes. A gene expression signature includingCDKN2Acould identify 100% of brain-metastasizing tumors with a 91% specificity. However, when compared to the differentially expressed genes between brain-tropic and non-brain-tropic lung cancer cell lines, a different set of genes was shared between the patient data and the cell line data, which include many genes implicated in the cancer-glia/neuron interaction. Our findings indicate that it is possible to identify lung adenocarcinoma patients at the highest risk for brain metastasis by analyzing the primary tumor. Further investigation is required to elucidate the mechanism behind these associations and to identify potential treatment targets."
"34941867","Co-existing TP53 and ARID1A mutations promote aggressive endometrial tumorigenesis.","PLoS Genet","TP53 and ARID1A are frequently mutated across cancer but rarely in the same primary tumor. Endometrial cancer has the highest TP53-ARID1A mutual exclusivity rate. However, the functional relationship between TP53 and ARID1A mutations in the endometrium has not been elucidated. We used genetically engineered mice and in vivo genomic approaches to discern both unique and overlapping roles of TP53 and ARID1A in the endometrium. TP53 loss with oncogenic PIK3CAH1047R in the endometrial epithelium results in features of endometrial hyperplasia, adenocarcinoma, and intraepithelial carcinoma. Mutant endometrial epithelial cells were transcriptome profiled and compared to control cells and ARID1A/PIK3CA mutant endometrium. In the context of either TP53 or ARID1A loss, PIK3CA mutant endometrium exhibited inflammatory pathway activation, but other gene expression programs differed based on TP53 or ARID1A status, such as epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Gene expression patterns observed in the genetic mouse models are reflective of human tumors with each respective genetic alteration. Consistent with TP53-ARID1A mutual exclusivity, the p53 pathway is activated following ARID1A loss in the endometrial epithelium, where ARID1A normally directly represses p53 pathway genes in vivo, including the stress-inducible transcription factor, ATF3. However, co-existing TP53-ARID1A mutations led to invasive adenocarcinoma associated with mutant ARID1A-driven ATF3 induction, reduced apoptosis, TP63+ squamous differentiation and invasion. These data suggest TP53 and ARID1A mutations drive shared and distinct tumorigenic programs in the endometrium and promote invasive endometrial cancer when existing simultaneously. Hence, TP53 and ARID1A mutations may co-occur in a subset of aggressive or metastatic endometrial cancers, with ARID1A loss promoting squamous differentiation and the acquisition of invasive properties."
"34930366","The oncogenic kinase NEK2 regulates an RBFOX2-dependent pro-mesenchymal splicing program in triple-negative breast cancer cells.","J Exp Clin Cancer Res","Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most heterogeneous and malignant subtype of breast cancer (BC). TNBC is defined by the absence of expression of estrogen, progesterone and HER2 receptors and lacks efficacious targeted therapies. NEK2 is an oncogenic kinase that is significantly upregulated in TNBC, thereby representing a promising therapeutic target. NEK2 localizes in the nucleus and promotes oncogenic splice variants in different cancer cells. Notably, alternative splicing (AS) dysregulation has recently emerged as a featuring trait of TNBC that contributes to its aggressive phenotype.To investigate whether NEK2 modulates TNBC transcriptome we performed RNA-sequencing analyses in a representative TNBC cell line (MDA-MB-231) and results were validated in multiple TNBC cell lines. Bioinformatics and functional analyses were carried out to elucidate the mechanism of splicing regulation by NEK2. Data from The Cancer Genome Atlas were mined to evaluate the potential of NEK2-sensitive exons as markers to identify the TNBC subtype and to assess their prognostic value.Transcriptome analysis revealed a widespread impact of NEK2 on the transcriptome of TNBC cells, with 1830 AS events that are susceptible to its expression. NEK2 regulates the inclusion of cassette exons in splice variants that discriminate TNBC from other BC and that correlate with poor prognosis, suggesting that this kinase contributes to the TNBC-specific splicing program. NEK2 elicits its effects by modulating the expression of the splicing factor RBFOX2, a well-known regulator of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). Accordingly, NEK2 splicing-regulated genes are enriched in functional terms related to cell adhesion and contractile cytoskeleton and NEK2 depletion in mesenchymal TNBC cells induces phenotypic and molecular traits typical of epithelial cells. Remarkably, depletion of select NEK2-sensitive splice-variants that are prognostic in TNBC patients is sufficient to interfere with TNBC cell morphology and motility, suggesting that NEK2 orchestrates a pro-mesenchymal splicing program that modulates migratory and invasive properties of TNBC cells.Our study uncovers an extensive splicing program modulated by NEK2 involving splice variants that confer an invasive phenotype to TNBCs and that might represent, together with NEK2 itself, valuable therapeutic targets for this disease.© 2021.

It plays an essential role in the prognosis and therapeutic response of patients. Nonetheless, the TME landscape of urothelial cancer (UC) has not been fully elucidated. In this study, we systematically analyzed several UC cohorts, and three types of TME patterns (stromal-activation subtype, immune-enriched subtype and immune-suppressive subtype) were defined. The tumor microenvironment signature (TMSig) was constructed by modified Lasso penalized regression. Patients were stratified into high- and low-TMSig score groups. The low-score group had a better prognosis (p< 0.0001), higher M1 macrophage infiltration (p< 0.01), better response to immunotherapy (p< 0.05), and more similar molecular characteristics to the luminal (differentiated) subtype. The accuracy of the TMSig for predicting the immunotherapy response was also verified in three independent cohorts. We highlighted that the TMSig is an effective predictor of patient prognosis and immunotherapy response. Quantitative evaluation of a single sample is valuable for us to combine histopathological and molecular characteristics to comprehensively evaluate the status of the patient.

Although they share some hallmarks, such as proliferation and metastasis, they are still very different from many perspectives. They grow on different organ or tissues. Does each cancer have a unique gene expression pattern that makes it different from other cancer types? After the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project, there are more and more pan-cancer studies. Researchers want to get robust gene expression signature from pan-cancer patients. But there is large variance in cancer patients due to heterogeneity. To get robust results, the sample size will be too large to recruit. In this study, we tried another approach to get robust pan-cancer biomarkers by using the cell line data to reduce the variance. We applied several advanced computational methods to analyze the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) gene expression profiles which included 988 cell lines from 20 cancer types. Two feature selection methods, including Boruta, and max-relevance and min-redundancy methods, were applied to the cell line gene expression data one by one, generating a feature list. Such list was fed into incremental feature selection method, incorporating one classification algorithm, to extract biomarkers, construct optimal classifiers and decision rules. The optimal classifiers provided good performance, which can be useful tools to identify cell lines from different cancer types, whereas the biomarkers (e.g. NCKAP1, TNFRSF12A, LAMB2, FKBP9, PFN2, TOM1L1) and rules identified in this work may provide a meaningful and precise reference for differentiating multiple types of cancer and contribute to the personalized treatment of tumors.Copyright © 2021 Ding, Li, Zhang, Zhou, Feng, Li, Chen, Huang and Cai."

A total of 886 active compounds, comprising of 418 targeted cancer, 404 non-oncology, and 64 chemotherapy compounds were identified for HNSCC. Top classes of mechanism of action amongst targeted cancer compounds included PI3K/AKT/MTOR, EGFR, and HDAC inhibitors.

However, knowledge about the molecular regulators underlying GSDME abundance remains limited. Here, we performed integrative bioinformatics analyses and identified that epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) gene signatures exhibited positive correlation with GSDME levels across human cancers. A causal role was supported by the observation that EMT dictated GSDME reversible upregulation in multiple experimental models. Mechanistically, transcriptional activation ofGSDMEwas directly driven by core EMT-activating transcription factors ZEB1/2, which bound to theGSDMEpromoter region. Of functional importance, elevated GSDME in mesenchymally transdifferentiated derivatives underwent proteolytic cleavage upon antineoplastic drug exposure, leading to pyroptotic cell death and consequent cytokine release. Taken together, our findings pinpointed a key transcriptional machinery controlling GSDME expression and indicated potential therapeutic avenues to exploit GSDME-mediated inflammatory pyroptosis for the treatment of mesenchymal malignancies.Copyright © 2021 Jia, Zhang, Tang, Cai, Zang, Shi, Sun, Wu, Shi, Shi, Ma, Zhao, Yu, Fu and Zhuang."

Here, we aimed to develop an m6A-related risk signature to improve prognostic and immunotherapy responder prediction performance in the context of melanoma. We comprehensively analyzed the m6A cluster and immune infiltration phenotypes of public datasets. The TCGA (n= 457) and eleven independent melanoma cohorts (n= 758) were used as the training and validation datasets, respectively. We identified two m6A clusters (m6A-clusterA and m6A-clusterB) based on the expression pattern of m6A regulatorsviaunsupervised consensus clustering.IGF2BP1(7.49%),KIAA1429(7.06%), andYTHDC1(4.28%) were the three most frequently mutated genes. There was a correlation between driver genes mutation statuses and the expression of m6A regulators. A significant difference in tumor-associated immune infiltration between two m6A clusters was detected. Compared with m6A-clusterA, the m6A-clusterB was characterized by a lower immune score and immune cell infiltration but higher mRNA expression-based stemness index (mRNAsi). An m6A-related risk signature consisting of 12 genes was determined via Cox regression analysis and divided the patients into low- and high-risk groups (IL6ST, MBNL1, NXT2, EIF2A, CSGALNACT1, C11orf58, CD14, SPI1, NCCRP1, BOK, CD74, PAEP). A nomogram was developed for the prediction of the survival rate. Compared with the high-risk group, the low-risk group was characterized by high expression of immune checkpoints and immunophenoscore (IPS), activation of immune-related pathways, and more enriched in immune cell infiltrations. The low-risk group had a favorable prognosis and contained the potential beneficiaries of the immune checkpoint blockade therapy and verified by the IMvigor210 cohort (n= 298).

Zotatifin (eFT226) is a selective eIF4A inhibitor that increases the affinity between eIF4A and specific polypurine sequence motifs and has been reported to inhibit translation of driver oncogenes in models of lymphoma. Here we report the identification of zotatifin binding motifs in the 5'-UTRs of HER2 and FGFR1/2 Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (RTKs). Dysregulation of HER2 or FGFR1/2 in human cancers leads to activation of the PI3K/AKT and RAS/ERK signaling pathways, thus enhancing eIF4A activity and promoting the translation of select oncogenes that are required for tumor cell growth and survival. In solid tumor models driven by alterations in HER2 or FGFR1/2, downregulation of oncoprotein expression by zotatifin induces sustained pathway-dependent anti-tumor activity resulting in potent inhibition of cell proliferation, induction of apoptosis, and significantin vivotumor growth inhibition or regression. Sensitivity of RTK-driven tumor models to zotatifin correlated with high basal levels of mTOR activity and elevated translational capacity highlighting the unique circuitry generated by the RTK-driven signaling pathway. This dependency identifies the potential for rational combination strategies aimed at vertical inhibition of the PI3K/AKT/eIF4F pathway. Combination of zotatifin with PI3K or AKT inhibitors was beneficial across RTK-driven cancer models by blocking RTK-driven resistance mechanisms demonstrating the clinical potential of these combination strategies.Copyright © 2021 Gerson-Gurwitz, Young, Goel, Eam, Stumpf, Chen, Fish, Barrera, Sung, Staunton, Chiang, Webster and Thompson."

We comprehensively explored the expression and mutation of OX40/OX40L in SCLC, and systematically linked OX40/OX40L with TME.The expression of OX40/OX40L on tumor cells and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) was found in the IHC cohort and verified in other cohorts with SCLC tissues and cell lines. The results showed co-expression patterns among OX40/OX40L, other ICs, and T-cell markers. The WES data suggested that OX40/OX40L mutation is rare in SCLC (<5%). Patients with positive OX40 protein expression on TILs showed substantially higher recurrence-free survival than those with negative expression (p=0.009).

In this study, we constructed and validated gene expression signatures of EAC vs. ESCC tumors using publicly available datasets, and subsequently assessed the enrichment levels of these signatures in commonly used EAC and ESCC cell lines, normal esophageal tissues and normal esophageal cell lines, and primary BE tissues and BE cell lines. We found that unlike ESCC cell lines which were quite similar to primary ESCC tumors, EAC cell lines were considerably different from primary EAC tumors but still more similar to EAC tumors than ESCC tumors, as the genes up in EAC vs. ESCC (EAChi) had considerably lower expression in EAC cell lines than EAC tumors. However, more surprisingly, unlike various normal cell lines (EPC2, Het-1A) which were very similar to various tissues from normal esophagus, BE cell lines (BAR-T, CP-A) were extremely different from primary BE tissues, as BE cell lines had substantially lower levels of EAChiand substantially higher levels of ESCChigene expression. This ESCC-like profile of the BAR-T remained unaltered even after prolonged exposure to an acidic bile mixture in vitro resulting in malignant transformation of this cell line. However, primary BE tissues had EAC-like gene expression profiles as expected. Only one EAC case from the Cancer Genome Atlas resembled BE cell lines, and while it had the clinical profile and some mutational features of EAC, it had some mutational features, the copy number alteration profile, and the gene expression profile of ESCC instead.

The transcription factor TBX3 is upregulated in a diverse range of sarcoma subtypes, where it plays a direct oncogenic role, and it may thus represent a novel therapeutic target. To identify versatile ways to target TBX3, we performed affinity purification coupled by mass spectrometry to identify putative TBX3 protein cofactors that regulate its oncogenic activity in sarcomas. Here we identify and validate the multifunctional phosphoprotein nucleolin as a TBX3 cofactor. We show that nucleolin is co-expressed with TBX3 in several sarcoma subtypes and their expression levels positively correlate in sarcoma patients which are associated with poor prognosis. Furthermore, we demonstrate that nucleolin and TBX3 interact in chondrosarcoma, liposarcoma and rhabdomyosarcoma cells where they act together to enhance proliferation and migration and regulate a common set of tumor suppressor genes. Importantly, the nucleolin targeting aptamer, AS1411, exhibits selective anti-cancer activity in these cells and mislocalizes TBX3 and nucleolin to the cytoplasm which correlates with the re-expression of the TBX3/nucleolin target tumor suppressorsCDKN1A(p21CIP1) andCDKN2A(p14ARF).

We analyzed data from The Cancer Genome Atlas to compare clinical phenotypes, somatic mutations, copy number variations, gene fusions, RNA expression, and DNA methylation profiles between APCmut-and APC mutation-positive (APCmut+) microsatellite stable CRCs. Transcriptionally, APCmut-CRCs clustered into two approximately equal groups. Cluster One was associated with enhanced mitochondrial activation. Cluster Two was strikingly associated with genetic inactivation or decreased RNA expression of the WNT antagonist RNF43, increased expression of the WNT agonist RSPO3, activating mutation of BRAF, or increased methylation and decreased expression of AXIN2. APCmut-CRCs exhibited evidence of increased immune cell infiltration, with significant correlation between M2 macrophages and RSPO3. APCmut-CRCs comprise two groups of tumors characterized by enhanced mitochondrial activation or increased sensitivity to extracellular WNT, suggesting that they could be respectively susceptible to inhibition of these pathways.© 2021.

Macrophages play an essential role in the occurrence and development of ovarian cancer, so the mechanisms of macrophage infiltration should be elucidated.We downloaded transcriptome data of ovarian cancers from the Gene Expression Omnibus and The Cancer Genome Atlas. After rigorous screening, 1566 HGSOC were used for data analysis. CIBERSORT was used to estimate the level of macrophage infiltration and WGCNA was used to identify macrophage-related modules. We constructed a macrophage-related prognostic model using machine learning LASSO algorithm and verified it using multiple HGSOC cohorts.In the GPL570-OV cohort, high infiltration level of M1 macrophages was associated with a good outcome, while high infiltration level of M2 macrophages was associated with poor outcomes. We used WGCNA to select genes correlated with macrophage infiltration. These genes were used to construct protein-protein interaction maps of macrophage infiltration. IFL44L, RSAD2, IFIT3, MX1, IFIH1, IFI44, and ISG15 were the hub genes in the network. We then constructed a macrophage-related prognostic model composed of CD38, ACE2, BATF2, HLA-DOB, and WARS. The model had the ability to predict the overall survival rate of HGSOC patients in GPL570-OV, GPL6480-OV, TCGA-OV, GSE50088, and GSE26712. In exploring the immune microenvironment, we found that CD4 memory T cells and activated mast cells showed that the degree of infiltration was higher in the high-risk group, while M1 macrophages were the opposite, and HLA molecules were overexpressed in the high-risk group.We constructed a macrophage infiltration-related protein interaction network that provides a basis for studying macrophages in HGSOC. Our macrophage-related prognostic model is robust and widely applicable. It predicts overall survival in HGSOC patients and may improve HGSOC treatment.Copyright © 2021 Hua Chang et al."

For less studied organisms essentiality might be predicted by gene homology. However, this approach cannot be applied to non-conserved genes. Additionally, divergent essentiality information is obtained from studying single cells or whole, multi-cellular organisms, and particularly when derived from human cell line screens and human population studies. We employed machine learning across six model eukaryotes and 60 381 genes, using 41 635 features derived from the sequence, gene function information and network topology. Within a leave-one-organism-out cross-validation, the classifiers showed high generalizability with an average accuracy close to 80% in the left-out species. As a case study, we applied the method toTribolium castaneumandBombyx moriand validated predictions experimentally yielding similar performances. Finally, using the classifier based on the studied model organisms enabled linking the essentiality information of human cell line screens and population studies.© The Author(s) 2021.

In this study, we found that UBE2C was elevated in this human pan-cancer analysis, and high expression of UBE2C was correlated with poor prognosis. In addition, UBE2C expression was markedly associated with tumor mutation burden (TMB), microsatellite instability (MSI), immune cell infiltration, and diverse drug sensitivities. Finally, we showed that the METTL3/SNHG1/miRNA-140-3p axis could potentially regulate UBE2C expression. N(6)-Methyladenosine (m6A) modifications improved the stability of methylated SNHG1 transcripts by decreasing the rate of RNA degradation, which lead to upregulation of SNHG1 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).In vitrofunctional experiments showed that SNHG1, as a competing endogenous RNA, sponges miR-140-3p to increase UBE2C expression in NSCLC cell lines. Our study elucidates the clinical importance and regulatory mechanism of the METTL3/SNHG1/miRNA-140-3p/UBE2C axis in NSCLC and provides a prognostic indicator, as well as a promising therapeutic target for patients with NSCLC.Copyright © 2021 Jiang, Yuan, Tang, Wang, Liu, Zou and Duan."

This study investigated the impact of plasma HGF levels on EGFR inhibition and the counter effect of MET inhibition in KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF (RAS/RAF) wild-type colorectal cancers (CRCs).Plasma HGF levels were analyzed with clinical outcomes of patients with metastatic CRC (mCRC) receiving palliative first-line chemotherapy. Then, in vitro experiments were conducted to validate the clinical findings and to establish pre-clinical evidence of MET inhibition by capmatinib.A total of 80 patients were included: cetuximab + FOLFIRI (n = 35) and bevacizumab + FOLFIRI (n = 45). Both progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were significantly lesser in the high vs low HGF group: median 11.8 vs. 24.7 months, respectively, for PFS (p = 0.009), and median 21.1 months vs. not reached, respectively, for OS (p = 0.018). The difference was significantly evident in the cetuximab group. In five RAS/RAF wild-type CRC cells, the addition of HGF activated ERK1/2 and AKT via MET phosphorylation, resulting in cetuximab resistance in vitro. In cetuximab-sensitive Caco-2 and SNU-C4 cells, capmatinib overcame cetuximab resistance in the presence of HGF by attenuating HGF-induced MET signaling activation.Patients with mCRC receiving cetuximab + FOLFIRI who presented with high plasma HGF levels had significantly worse PFS and OS. Cetuximab resistance induced by HGF was mediated by AKT and ERK activation and overcome by MET inhibition in vitro.© 2021.

"34853298","Tumor evolution selectively inactivates the core microRNA machinery for immune evasion.","Nat Commun","Cancer cells acquire genetic heterogeneity to escape from immune surveillance during tumor evolution, but a systematic approach to distinguish driver from passenger mutations is lacking. Here we investigate the impact of different immune pressure on tumor clonal dynamics and immune evasion mechanism, by combining massive parallel sequencing of immune edited tumors and CRISPR library screens in syngeneic mouse tumor model and co-culture system. We find that the core microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis and targeting machinery maintains the sensitivity of cancer cells to PD-1-independent T cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Genetic inactivation of the machinery or re-introduction of ANKRD52 frequent patient mutations dampens the JAK-STAT-interferon-γ signaling and antigen presentation in cancer cells, largely by abolishing miR-155-targeted silencing of suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1). Expression of each miRNA machinery component strongly correlates with intratumoral T cell infiltration in nearly all human cancer types. Our data indicate that the evolutionarily conserved miRNA pathway can be exploited by cancer cells to escape from T cell-mediated elimination and immunotherapy.© 2021. The Author(s)."

Through integrated analysis of >600 DNase-seq, ChIP-seq, GRO-seq, STARR-seq, RNA-seq, Hi-C and ChIA-PET data in five human cancer cell lines, we identified a new class of autonomous SEs (aSEs) that are excluded from classic SE calls by the widely used Rank Ordering of Super-Enhancers (ROSE) method. TF footprint analysis revealed that compared to classic SEs and regular enhancers, aSEs are tightly bound by a dense array of master lineage TFs, which serve as anchors to recruit additional TFs and co-factors in trans. In addition, aSEs are preferentially enriched for Cohesins, which likely involve in stabilizing long-distance interactions between aSEs and their distal target genes. Finally, we showed that aSEs can be reliably predicted using a single DNase-seq data or combined with Mediator and/or P300 ChIP-seq. Overall, our study demonstrates that aSEs represent a unique class of functionally important enhancer elements that distally regulate the transcription of highly expressed genes.© The Author(s) 2021.

The analysis of the relationship between selected aggregation dynamic parameters and the gene expression data for these cell lines from the CCLE database allowed identifying genes with expression significantly associated with aggregation parameter variations. Comparison of these transcripts with the perturbagen signatures from the Connectivity Map resource highlighted that they were strongly correlated with the transcriptional signature of most histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors. Experimental evaluation of two HDAC inhibitors (SAHA and ISOX) showed that they inhibited the initial step of in vitro tumor cell aggregation.

In addition, oxysterol-binding protein-like (OSBPL) family members are reported to be involved in lipid binding and transport and play critical roles in tumorigenesis. However, relationships between PDAC and OSBPL family members have not comprehensively been elucidated. In this study, we used the Oncomine and GEPIA 2 databases to analyze OSBPL transcription expressions in PDAC. The Kaplan-Meier plotter and TIMER 2.0 were used to assess the relationships between overall survival (OS) and immune-infiltration with OSBPL family members. Co-expression data from cBioPortal were downloaded to assess the correlated pathways with OSBPL gene family members using DAVID. The expressions of OSBPL3, OSBPL8, OSBPL10, and OSBPL11 were found to be highly upregulated in PDAC. Low expressions of OSBPL3, OSBPL8, and OSBPL10 indicated longer OS. The functions of OSBPL family members were mainly associated with several potential signaling pathways in cancer cells, including ATP binding, integrin binding, receptor binding, and the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) signaling pathway. The transcription levels of OSBPL gene family members were connected with several immune infiltrates. Collectively, OSBPL family members are influential biomarkers for the early diagnosis of PDAC and have prognostic value, with the promise of precise treatment of PDAC in the future."

However, the role of LIGs in breast cancer (BC) is still unclear. In this study, we aim to reveal the expression level, function, and prognostic value of LIGs in BC. Bioinformatic tools were used to study the expression level, potential function and prognostic value of LIG1 and LIG3 in BC patients. ENCORI was used to predict microRNAs (miRNAs) that regulate LIG1 and LIG3 and established a valuable miRNA-mRNA regulation network for BC. We found that the expression of LIG1 and LIG3 was upregulated in BC and predicted high relapse-free survival (RFS) in BC patients. Functional annotation analysis was performed to reveal the role of LIG1 and LIG3 in BC. In addition, hsa-miR-22-3p was identified to be potentially involved in the regulation of LIG3.

First, based on 107 high-quality genome-wide R-loop mapping datasets generated by 11 different technologies, we present a reference set of human R-loop zones for high-confidence R-loop localization, and spot conservative genomic features associated with R-loop formation. Second, through literature mining and multi-omics analyses, we curate the most comprehensive list of R-loop regulatory proteins and their targeted R-loops in multiple species to date. These efforts help reveal a global regulatory network of R-loop dynamics and its potential links to the development of cancers and neurological diseases. Finally, we integrate billions of functional genomic annotations, and develop interactive interfaces to search, visualize, download and analyze R-loops and R-loop regulators in a well-annotated genomic context.

"34788622","Rearrangement-mediated cis-regulatory alterations in advanced patient tumors reveal interactions with therapy.","Cell Rep","The global impact of somatic structural variants (SVs) on gene regulation in advanced tumors with complex treatment histories has been mostly uncharacterized. Here, using whole-genome and RNA sequencing from 570 recurrent or metastatic tumors, we report the altered expression of hundreds of genes in association with nearby SV breakpoints, including oncogenes and G-protein-coupled receptor-related genes such as PLEKHG2. A significant fraction of genes with SV-expression associations correlate with worse patient survival in primary and advanced cancers, including SRD5A1. In many instances, SV-expression associations involve retrotransposons being translocated near genes. High overall SV burden is associated with treatment with DNA alkylating agents or taxanes and altered expression of metabolism-associated genes. SV-expression associations within tumors from topoisomerase I inhibitor-treated patients include chromatin-related genes. Within anthracycline-treated tumors, SV breakpoints near chromosome 1p genes include PDE4B.

ATX/LPA promotes tumor cell migration and metastasis via LPAR1 and T cell motility via LPAR2, yet its actions in the tumor immune microenvironment remain unclear. Here, we show that ATX secreted by melanoma cells is chemorepulsive for tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and circulating CD8+T cells ex vivo, with ATX functioning as an LPA-producing chaperone. Mechanistically, T cell repulsion predominantly involves Gα12/13-coupled LPAR6. Upon anti-cancer vaccination of tumor-bearing mice, ATX does not affect the induction of systemic T cell responses but, importantly, suppresses tumor infiltration of cytotoxic CD8+T cells and thereby impairs tumor regression. Moreover, single-cell data from melanoma tumors are consistent with intratumoral ATX acting as a T cell repellent. These findings highlight an unexpected role for the pro-metastatic ATX-LPAR axis in suppressing CD8+T cell infiltration to impede anti-tumor immunity, suggesting new therapeutic opportunities.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).

Here, we show that low FBXO31 mRNA levels are associated with high pre-operative prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels and Gleason grade in human prostate cancer. Mechanistically, the ubiquitin ligase CRL1FBXO31promotes the ubiquitylation-mediated degradation of DUSP6, a dual specificity phosphatase that dephosphorylates and inactivates the extracellular-signal-regulated kinase-1 and -2 (ERK1/2). Depletion of FBXO31 stabilizes DUSP6, suppresses ERK signaling, and activates the PI3K-AKT signaling cascade. Moreover, deletion of FBXO31 promotes tumor development in a mouse orthotopic model of prostate cancer. Treatment with BCI, a small molecule inhibitor of DUSP6, suppresses AKT activation and prevents tumor formation, suggesting that the FBXO31 tumor suppressor activity is dependent on DUSP6. Taken together, our studies highlight the relevance of the FBXO31-DUSP6 axis in the regulation of ERK- and PI3K-AKT-mediated signaling pathways, as well as its therapeutic potential in prostate cancer.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).

With advances in next-generation sequencing technology, 5-methylcytosine (m5C) modification has also been found in multiple RNAs. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) were proved to have a key role in cancer progression and closely related to the tumor immune microenvironment. Thus, based on the PDAC patients' clinical information and genetic transcriptome data from the TCGA database, we performed a detailed bioinformatic analysis to establish a m5C-related lncRNA prognostic risk model for PDAC patients and discovered the relationship between the risk model and PDAC immune microenvironment. Pearson correlation coefficient analysis was applied to conduct a m5C regulatory gene and m5C-related lncRNA co-expression network. Expression of m5C-related lncRNAs screened by univariate regression analysis with prognostic value showed a significant difference between pancreatic cancer and normal tissues. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression method was applied to determine an 8-m5C-related lncRNA prognostic risk model. We used principal component analysis to indicate that the risk model could distinguish all the samples clearly. The clinical nomogram also accurately predicted 1-, 1.5-, 2-, and 3-year survival time among PDAC patients. Additionally, this risk model was validated in the entire group and sub-test groups using KM analysis and ROC analysis. Combined with the clinical characteristics, the risk score was found to be an independent factor for predicting the survival of PDAC patients. Furthermore, the association between the risk model and tumor immune microenvironment was evaluatedviathe ESTIMATE R package and CIBERSORT method. Consequently, the results indicated that immune cells were associated with m5C-related lncRNA risk model scores and had different distribution in the high- and low-risk groups. Based on all these analyses, the m5C-related lncRNA risk model could be a reliable prognostic tool and therapeutic target for PDAC patients.Copyright © 2021 Yuan, Liu, Zhao, Wu, Chen, Chen, Shen, Yang, Fan, Xiao and Jiang."

The role of MAP infection on the epigenetic modeling of gut immunity during the progression of JD is still unknown. This study investigated the DNA methylation patterns in ileal (IL) and ileal lymph node (ILLN) tissues from cows diagnosed with persistent subclinical MAP infection over a one to 4 years period. DNA samples from IL and ILLN tissues from cows negative (MAPneg) (n= 3) or positive for MAP infection (MAPinf) (n= 4) were subjected to whole genome bisulfite sequencing. A total of 11,263 and 62,459 differentially methylated cytosines (DMCs), and 1259 and 8086 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) (FDR<0.1) were found between MAPinf and MAPneg IL and ILLN tissues, respectively. The DMRs were found on 394 genes (denoted DMR genes) in the IL and on 1305 genes in the ILLN. DMR genes with hypermethylated promoters/5'UTR [3 (IL) and 88 (ILLN)] or hypomethylated promoters/5'UTR [10 (IL) and 25 (ILLN)] and having multiple functions including response to stimulus/immune response (BLK, BTC, CCL21, AVPR1A, CHRNG, GABRA4, TDGF1), cellular processes (H2AC20, TEX101, GLA, NCKAP5L, RBM27, SLC18A1, H2AC20BARHL2, NLGN3, SUV39H1, GABRA4, PPA1, UBE2D2) and metabolic processes (GSTO2, H2AC20, SUV39H1, PPA1, UBE2D2) are potential DNA methylation candidate genes of MAP infection. The ILLN DMR genes were enriched for more biological process (BP) gene ontology (GO) terms (n= 374), most of which were related to cellular processes (27.6%), biological regulation (16.6%), metabolic processes (15.4%) and response to stimulus/immune response (8.2%) compared to 75 BP GO terms (related to cellular processes, metabolic processes and transport, and system development) enriched for IL DMR genes. ILLN DMR genes were enriched for more pathways (n= 47) including 13 disease pathways compared with 36 enriched pathways, including 7 disease/immune pathways for IL DMR genes. In conclusion, the results show tissue specific responses to MAP infection with more epigenetic changes (DMCs and DMRs) in the ILLN than in the IL tissue, suggesting that the ILLN and immune processes were more responsive to regulation by methylation of DNA relative to IL tissue. Our data is the first to demonstrate a potential role for DNA methylation in the pathogenesis of MAP infection in dairy cattle.Copyright © 2021 Suraj Bhattarai, Stephanie McKay, Xin Zhao and Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada, as represented by the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada for the contribution of Eveline M.

"34990845","The hyperfunction theory: An emerging paradigm for the biology of aging.","Ageing Res Rev","The process of senescence (aging) is predominantly determined by the action of wild-type genes. For most organisms, this does not reflect any adaptive function that senescence serves, but rather evolutionary effects of declining selection against genes with deleterious effects later in life. To understand aging requires an account of how evolutionary mechanisms give rise to pathogenic gene action and late-life disease, that integrates evolutionary (ultimate) and mechanistic (proximate) causes into a single explanation. A well-supported evolutionary explanation by G.C. Williams argues that senescence can evolve due to pleiotropic effects of alleles with antagonistic effects on fitness and late-life health (antagonistic pleiotropy, AP). What has remained unclear is how gene action gives rise to late-life disease pathophysiology. One ultimate-proximate account is T.B.L. Kirkwood's disposable soma theory. Based on the hypothesis that stochastic molecular damage causes senescence, this reasons that aging is coupled to reproductive fitness due to preferential investment of resources into reproduction, rather than somatic maintenance. An alternative and more recent ultimate-proximate theory argues that aging is largely caused by programmatic, developmental-type mechanisms. Here ideas about AP and programmatic aging are reviewed, particularly those of M.V. Blagosklonny (the hyperfunction theory) and J.P. de Magalhães (the developmental theory), and their capacity to make sense of diverse experimental findings is assessed.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

While drug development conventionally focuses on disease-associated proteins, RNA has recently been shown to be druggable for therapeutic purposes as well. Approximately 70% of the human genome is transcribed into non-protein-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) such as microRNAs, long ncRNAs, and circular RNAs, which can adopt diverse structures and cellular functions. Many ncRNAs are specifically enriched in the central nervous system, and their dysregulation is implicated in ADRD pathogenesis, making them attractive therapeutic targets. In this review, we first detail why targeting ncRNAs with small molecules is a promising therapeutic strategy for ADRD. We then outline the process from discovery to validation of small molecules targeting ncRNAs in preclinical studies, with special emphasis on primary high-throughput screens for identifying lead compounds. Screening strategies for specific ncRNAs will also be included as examples. Key challenges-including selecting appropriate ncRNA targets, lack of specificity of small molecules, and general low success rate of neurological drugs and how they may be overcome-will be discussed throughout the review."

These four exosomal miRNAs could be used to distinguish LAA samples from small artery occlusion (SAO) samples, LAA samples from atherosclerosis (AS) samples, and LAA samples from control samples and were superior to plasma miRNAs. In addition, composite biomarkers achieved higher area under the curve (AUC) values than single biomarkers. According to our analysis, the expression levels of exosomal miR-493-3p and miR-1296-5p were negatively correlated with the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score. The four identified exosomal miRNAs are promising biomarkers for the diagnosis of LAA stroke, and their diagnostic efficiency is superior to that of their counterparts in plasma.Copyright © 2021 Niu, Li, Li, Yan, Ma, Pan and Zhu."
"34834581","Airway Wall Remodeling in Childhood Asthma-A Personalized Perspective from Cell Type-Specific Biology.","J Pers Med","Airway wall remodeling is a pathology occurring in chronic inflammatory lung diseases including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and fibrosis. In 2017, the American Thoracic Society released a research statement highlighting the gaps in knowledge and understanding of airway wall remodeling. The four major challenges addressed in this statement were: (i) the lack of consensus to define ""airway wall remodeling"" in different diseases, (ii) methodologic limitations and inappropriate models, (iii) the lack of anti-remodeling therapies, and (iv) the difficulty to define endpoints and outcomes in relevant studies. This review focuses on the importance of cell-cell interaction, especially the bronchial epithelium, in asthma-associated airway wall remodeling. The pathology of ""airway wall remodeling"" summarizes all structural changes of the airway wall without differentiating between different pheno- or endo-types of asthma. Indicators of airway wall remodeling have been reported in childhood asthma in the absence of any sign of inflammation; thus, the initiation event remains unknown. Recent studies have implied that the interaction between the epithelium with immune cells and sub-epithelial mesenchymal cells is modified in asthma by a yet unknown epigenetic mechanism during early childhood."
"35027621","Identification of long non-coding RNAs and RNA binding proteins in breast cancer subtypes.","Sci Rep","Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease classified into four main subtypes with different clinical outcomes, such as patient survival, prognosis, and relapse. Current genetic tests for the differential diagnosis of BC subtypes showed a poor reproducibility. Therefore, an early and correct diagnosis of molecular subtypes is one of the challenges in the clinic. In the present study, we identified differentially expressed genes, long non-coding RNAs and RNA binding proteins for each BC subtype from a public dataset applying bioinformatics algorithms. In addition, we investigated their interactions and we proposed interacting biomarkers as potential signature specific for each BC subtype. We found a network of only 2 RBPs (RBM20 and PCDH20) and 2 genes (HOXB3 and RASSF7) for luminal A, a network of 21 RBPs and 53 genes for luminal B, a HER2-specific network of 14 RBPs and 30 genes, and a network of 54 RBPs and 302 genes for basal BC. We validated the signature considering their expression levels on an independent dataset evaluating their ability to classify the different molecular subtypes with a machine learning approach. Overall, we achieved good performances of classification with an accuracy >0.80. In addition, we found some interesting novel prognostic biomarkers such as RASSF7 for luminal A, DCTPP1 for luminal B, DHRS11, KLC3, NAGS, and TMEM98 for HER2, and ABHD14A and ADSSL1 for basal. The findings could provide preliminary evidence to identify putative new prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for individual breast cancer subtypes.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"34870237","Proteogenomics of non-small cell lung cancer reveals molecular subtypes associated with specific therapeutic targets and immune evasion mechanisms.","Nat Cancer","Despite major advancements in lung cancer treatment, long-term survival is still rare, and a deeper understanding of molecular phenotypes would allow the identification of specific cancer dependencies and immune evasion mechanisms. Here we performed in-depth mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteogenomic analysis of 141 tumors representing all major histologies of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We identified six distinct proteome subtypes with striking differences in immune cell composition and subtype-specific expression of immune checkpoints. Unexpectedly, high neoantigen burden was linked to global hypomethylation and complex neoantigens mapped to genomic regions, such as endogenous retroviral elements and introns, in immune-cold subtypes. Further, we linked immune evasion with LAG3 via STK11 mutation-dependent HNF1A activation and FGL1 expression. Finally, we develop a data-independent acquisition MS-based NSCLC subtype classification method, validate it in an independent cohort of 208 NSCLC cases and demonstrate its clinical utility by analyzing an additional cohort of 84 late-stage NSCLC biopsy samples."
"34911936","Androgen receptor and MYC equilibration centralizes on developmental super-enhancer.","Nat Commun","Androgen receptor (AR) in prostate cancer (PCa) can drive transcriptional repression of multiple genes including MYC, and supraphysiological androgen is effective in some patients. Here, we show that this repression is independent of AR chromatin binding and driven by coactivator redistribution, and through chromatin conformation capture methods show disruption of the interaction between the MYC super-enhancer within the PCAT1 gene and the MYC promoter. Conversely, androgen deprivation in vitro and in vivo increases MYC expression. In parallel, global AR activity is suppressed by MYC overexpression, consistent with coactivator redistribution. These suppressive effects of AR and MYC are mitigated at shared AR/MYC binding sites, which also have markedly higher levels of H3K27 acetylation, indicating enrichment for functional enhancers. These findings demonstrate an intricate balance between AR and MYC, and indicate that increased MYC in response to androgen deprivation contributes to castration-resistant PCa, while decreased MYC may contribute to responses to supraphysiological androgen therapy.© 2021.

However, while the process of DNA integration in the genome is well understood, we still do not know much about the recombination between transgene molecules that happens in the first moments after DNA injection. Most of the time, injected molecules are joined together in head-to-tail tandem repeats-the so-called concatemers. In this review, we focused on the possible concatenation mechanisms and how they could be studied with genetic reporters tracking individual copies in concatemers. We also discuss various features of concatemers, including palindromic junctions and repeat-induced gene silencing (RIGS). Finally, we speculate how cooperation of DNA repair pathways creates a multicopy concatenated insert."

Long interspersed element 1 (L1) retrotransposons are a type of inherited polymorphic variant that may be associated with risk for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. We performed REBELseq, a genome wide assay for L1 sequences, on DNA from male and female persons with schizophrenia and controls (n= 63 each) to identify inherited L1 insertions and validated priority insertions. L1 insertions of interest were genotyped in DNA from a replication cohort of persons with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and controls (n= 2268 each) to examine differences in carrier frequencies. We identified an inherited L1 insertion inARHGAP24and a quadallelic SNP (rs74169643) inside an L1 insertion inSNTG2that are associated with risk for developing schizophrenia and bipolar disorder (all odds ratios ~1.2). Pathway analysis identified 15 gene ontologies that were differentially affected by L1 burden, including multiple ontologies related to glutamatergic signaling and immune function, which have been previously associated with schizophrenia. These findings provide further evidence supporting the role of inherited repetitive genetic elements in the heritability of psychiatric disorders.© The Author(s) 2021.

However, these projects also have presented major challenges with respect to the scalability and computational costs associated with performing MEI discovery on tens or even hundreds of thousands of samples. To meet these challenges, we have developed a more efficient and scalable version of our mobile element locator tool (MELT) called CloudMELT. We then used MELT and CloudMELT to perform MEI discovery in 57,919 human genomes and exomes, leading to the discovery of 104,350 nonredundant MEIs. We leveraged this collection (1) to examine potentially active L1 source elements that drive the mobilization of newAlu, L1, and SVA MEIs in humans; (2) to examine the population distributions and subfamilies of these MEIs; and (3) to examine the mutagenesis of GENCODE genes, ENCODE-annotated features, and disease genes by these MEIs. Our study provides new insights on the L1 source elements that drive MEI mutagenesis and brings forth a better understanding of how this mutagenesis impacts human genomes.© 2021 Chuang et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press."

"35017532","Identification of a modular super-enhancer in murine retinal development.","Nat Commun","Super-enhancers are expansive regions of genomic DNA comprised of multiple putative enhancers that contribute to the dynamic gene expression patterns during development. This is particularly important in neurogenesis because many essential transcription factors have complex developmental stage- and cell-type specific expression patterns across the central nervous system. In the developing retina, Vsx2 is expressed in retinal progenitor cells and is maintained in differentiated bipolar neurons and Müller glia. A single super-enhancer controls this complex and dynamic pattern of expression. Here we show that deletion of one region disrupts retinal progenitor cell proliferation but does not affect cell fate specification. The deletion of another region has no effect on retinal progenitor cell proliferation but instead leads to a complete loss of bipolar neurons. This prototypical super-enhancer may serve as a model for dissecting the complex gene expression patterns for neurogenic transcription factors during development. Moreover, it provides a unique opportunity to alter expression of individual transcription factors in particular cell types at specific stages of development. This provides a deeper understanding of function that cannot be achieved with traditional knockout mouse approaches.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"34966906","Single-Cell Transcriptomic Analysis Reveals Developmental Relationships and Specific Markers of Mouse Periodontium Cellular Subsets.","Front Dent Med","The periodontium is essential for supporting the functionality of the tooth, composed of diversity of mineralized and non-mineralized tissues such as the cementum, the periodontal ligament (PDL) and the alveolar bone. The periodontium is developmentally derived from the dental follicle (DF), a fibrous tissue surrounding the developing tooth bud. We previously showed throughin vivolineage-tracing experiments that DF contains mesenchymal progenitor cells expressing parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP), which give rise to cells forming the periodontal attachment apparatus in a manner regulated by autocrine signaling through the PTH/PTHrP receptor. However, the developmental relationships between PTHrP+DF cells and diverse cell populations constituting the periodontium remain undefined. Here, we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) analyses of cells in the periodontium by integrating the two datasets, i.e. PTHrP-mCherry+DF cells at P6 and 2.3kb Col1a1 promoter-driven GFP+periodontal cells at P25 that include descendants of PTHrP+DF cells, cementoblasts, osteoblasts and periodontal ligament cells. This integrative scRNA-seq analysis revealed heterogeneity of cells of the periodontium and their cell type-specific markers, as well as their relationships with DF cells. Most importantly, our analysis identified a cementoblast-specific metagene that discriminate cementoblasts from alveolar bone osteoblasts, includingPthlh(encoding PTHrP) andTubb3. RNA velocity analysis indicated that cementoblasts were directly derived from PTHrP+DF cells in the early developmental stage and did not interconvert with other cell types. Further, CellPhoneDB cell-cell communication analysis indicated that PTHrP derived from cementoblasts acts on diversity of cells in the periodontium in an autocrine and paracrine manner. Collectively, our findings provide insights into the lineage hierarchy and intercellular interactions of cells in the periodontium at a single-cell level, aiding to understand cellular and molecular basis of periodontal tissue formation."

To guide integration method choice, we benchmarked 68 method and preprocessing combinations on 85 batches of gene expression, chromatin accessibility and simulation data from 23 publications, altogether representing >1.2 million cells distributed in 13 atlas-level integration tasks. We evaluated methods according to scalability, usability and their ability to remove batch effects while retaining biological variation using 14 evaluation metrics. We show that highly variable gene selection improves the performance of data integration methods, whereas scaling pushes methods to prioritize batch removal over conservation of biological variation. Overall, scANVI, Scanorama, scVI and scGen perform well, particularly on complex integration tasks, while single-cell ATAC-sequencing integration performance is strongly affected by choice of feature space.

In particular, the development of single-cell analysis technology has made a significant contribution to the field; technologies that are centered on single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) have been reported to analyze cancer constituent cells, identify cell groups responsible for therapeutic resistance, and analyze gene signatures of resistant cell groups. However, although single-cell analysis is a powerful tool, various issues have been reported, including batch effects and transcriptional noise due to gene expression variation and mRNA degradation. To overcome these issues, machine learning techniques are currently being introduced for single-cell analysis, and promising results are being reported. In addition, machine learning has also been used in various ways for single-cell analysis, such as single-cell assay of transposase accessible chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq), chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) analysis, and multi-omics analysis; thus, it contributes to a deeper understanding of the characteristics of human diseases, especially cancer, and supports clinical applications.

We aimed at the elucidation of relationship between gut microbiota and the mortality rates of COVID-19 across countries. Raw sequencing data of 16S rRNA V3-V5 regions of gut microbiota in 953 healthy subjects in ten countries were obtained from the public database. We made a generalized linear model (GLM) to predict the COVID-19 mortality rates using gut microbiota. GLM revealed that low genus Collinsella predicted high COVID-19 mortality rates with a markedly low p-value. Unsupervised clustering of gut microbiota in 953 subjects yielded five enterotypes. The mortality rates were increased from enterotypes 1 to 5, whereas the abundances of Collinsella were decreased from enterotypes 1 to 5 except for enterotype 2. Collinsella produces ursodeoxycholate. Ursodeoxycholate was previously reported to inhibit binding of SARS-CoV-2 to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2; suppress pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-6; have antioxidant and anti-apoptotic effects; and increase alveolar fluid clearance in acute respiratory distress syndrome.

"34827623","Long-Term Consequences of Placental Vascular Pathology on the Maternal and Offspring Cardiovascular Systems.","Biomolecules","Over the last thirty years, evidence has been accumulating that Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy (HDP) and, specifically, Preeclampsia (PE) produce not only long-term effects on the pregnant woman, but have also lasting consequences for the fetus. At the core of these consequences is the phenomenon known as defective deep placentation, being present in virtually every major obstetrical syndrome. The profound placental vascular lesions characteristic of this pathology can induce long-term adverse consequences for the pregnant woman's entire arterial system. In addition, placental growth restriction and function can, in turn, cause a decreased blood supply to the fetus, with long-lasting effects. Women with a history of HDP have an increased risk of Cardiovascular Diseases (CVD) compared with women with normal pregnancies. Specifically, these subjects are at a future higher risk of: Hypertension; Coronary artery disease; Heart failure; Peripheral vascular disease; Cerebrovascular accidents (Stroke); CVD-related mortality. Vascular pathology in pregnancy and CVD may share a common etiology and may have common risk factors, which are unmasked by the ""stress"" of pregnancy. It is also possible that the future occurrence of a CVD may be the consequence of endothelial dysfunction generated by pregnancy-induced hypertension that persists after delivery. Although biochemical and biophysical markers of PE abound, information on markers for a comparative evaluation in the various groups is still lacking. Long-term consequences for the fetus are an integral part of the theory of a fetal origin of a number of adult diseases, known as the Barker hypothesis. Indeed, intrauterine malnutrition and fetal growth restriction represent significant risk factors for the development of chronic hypertension, diabetes, stroke and death from coronary artery disease in adults. Other factors will also influence the development later in life of hypertension, coronary and myocardial disease; they include parental genetic disposition, epigenetic modifications, endothelial dysfunction, concurrent intrauterine exposures, and the lifestyle of the affected individual."

Adult (>4 mo) HSA-GFP mice performed PoWeR for 8 wk then detrained for 12 wk; age-matched untrained mice were used to control for the long duration of the study. Myonuclei and interstitial nuclei from plantaris muscles were isolated for RRBS. Relative to untrained, PoWeR caused similar myonuclear CpG hypo- and hyper-methylation of promoter regions and substantial hypomethylation in interstitial nuclear promoters. Over-representation analysis of promoters revealed a larger number of hyper- versus hypo-methylated pathways in both nuclear populations after training and evidence for reciprocal regulation of methylation between nucleus types, with hypomethylation of promoter regions in Wnt signaling-related genes in myonuclei and hypermethylation in interstitial nuclei. After 12 wk of detraining, promoter CpGs in documented muscle remodeling-associated genes and pathways that were differentially methylated immediately after PoWeR were persistently differentially methylated in myonuclei, along with long-term promoter hypomethylation in interstitial nuclei. No enduring gene expression changes in muscle tissue were observed using RNA-sequencing. Upon 4 wk of retraining, mice that trained previously grew more at the whole muscle and fiber type-specific cellular level than training naïve mice, with no difference in myonuclear number. Muscle nuclei have a methylation epi-memory of prior training that may augment muscle adaptability to retraining.© The Author(s) 2021.

Optimally prescribing muscle activity for people with disability, such as a spinal cord injury, is challenging because of their loss of volitional movement control and the deterioration of their underlying skeletal systems. This report summarizes spinal cord injury-specific factors that should be considered in patient-centered, precision prescription of muscle activity for people with spinal cord injury. This report also presents a muscle genomic and epigenomic analysis to examine the regulation of the proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α) (oxidative) and myostatin (hypertrophy) signaling pathways in skeletal muscle during low-frequency (lower-force) electrically induced exercise versus higher-frequency (higher-force) electrically induced exercise under constant muscle recruitment (intensity).Seventeen people with spinal cord injury participated in 1 or more unilateral electrically induced exercise sessions using a lower-force (1-, 3-, or 5-Hz) or higher-force (20-Hz) protocol. Three hours after the exercise session, percutaneous muscle biopsies were performed on exercised and nonexercised muscles for genomic and epigenomic analysis.We found that low-frequency (low-force) electrically induced exercise significantly increased the expression of PGC-1α and decreased the expression of myostatin, consistent with the expression changes observed with high-frequency (higher-force) electrically induced exercise. Further, we found that low-frequency (lower-force) electrically induced exercise significantly demethylated, or epigenetically promoted, the PGC-1α signaling pathway. A global epigenetic analysis showed that >70 pathways were regulated with low-frequency (lower-force) electrically induced exercise.These novel results support the notion that low-frequency (low-force) electrically induced exercise may offer a more precise rehabilitation strategy for people with chronic paralysis and severe osteoporosis. Future clinical trials are warranted to explore whether low-frequency (lower-force) electrically induced exercise training affects the overall health of people with chronic spinal cord injury.© The Author(s) 2021.

Although increasing evidence supposes the association between KDM1A and cancers, no systematic multi-omics analysis of KDM1A is available.We systematically evaluated the KDM1A expression of various cancer and normal tissues and the unique relationship between KDM1A expression and prognosis of cancer cases based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Genotype Tissue Expression (GTEx), and Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) database. The genetic variations, phosphorylation, and DNA methylation of KDM1A were analyzed via various tools. We further analyzed the correlation of KDM1A expression and fibroblasts and immune cell infiltration score of TCGA samples via TIMER2.0.KDM1Awas highly expressed in 17 types of total 33 cancers, while it expressed low levels in only 4 cancers. High KDM1A expression was associated with worse survival status in various cancers. KDM1A expression was positively correlated with the cancer-associated fibroblasts and myeloid-derived suppressor cells infiltration levels in most cancer types. Additionally, KDM1A in most cancer types was negatively correlated with Th1 cell infiltration and positively correlated with Th2 cells. Moreover, spliceosome, cell cycle, and RNA transport pathways were involved in the functional mechanisms of KDM1A via enrichment analysis.Our study describes the epigenetic factor KDM1A as an oncogene and prognostic biomarker.

The downregulation of CDX2 or SATB2 was dependent on both MSI-H and CIMP-H, whereas that of KRT20 was more dependent on MSI-H than on CIMP-H. Next, we evaluated the immunohistochemical expression of CDX2, SATB2, and KRT20 in 436 primary CRCs. In contrast to RNA-level expression, decreased expression of CDX2 and SATB2 was more dependent on CIMP-H than on MSI-H. However, consistent with RNA-level expression, decreased expression of KRT20 was more dependent on MSI-H than on CIMP-H. CIMP-H and lymphatic invasion were consistently associated with both CDX2 loss and SATB2 loss in CRCs, regardless of MSI status. In microsatellite stable CRCs, CDX2 loss correlated with BRAF mutation, whereas SATB2 loss was associated with KRAS mutations and decreased T-cell infiltration. Cases with concurrent loss of all three markers were found exclusively in MLH1-methylated MSI-H/CIMP-H CRCs. In conclusion, MSI-H and/or CIMP-H are major common correlates of decreased CDX2/SATB2/KRT20 expression in CRCs, but the specific features associated with the loss of each marker are different in CRCs.© 2022.

A total of 24 samples were deployed in the gene expression and 118 samples were used in the DNA methylation study. Student'st-tests were used to analyze the gene expression and DNA methylation. The evaluation of DNA methylation in promoter regions ofJAK2andSTAT5Arevealed hypo-methylation levels of CpG sites and higher gene expression in cows diagnosed with mastitis as compared to the healthy control, and vice versa in those withCD4. DNA methylation was negatively correlated with gene expression inJAK2,STAT5A, andCD4genes. Six, two, and four active transcription factors were identified on the CpG sites in the promoter regions ofJAK2,STAT5A, andCD4genes, respectively. Regarding correlation analysis, the DNA methylation levels ofCD4showed significantly higher positive correlations with somatic cell counts (p< 0.05). Findings of the current study inferred that aberrant DNA methylation in the CpG sites at the 1 kb promoter region inJAK2,STAT5A, andCD4genes due to mastitis in cows can be used as potential epigenetic markers to estimate bovine mastitis susceptibility in dairy cattle."

Abnormal DNA methylation has an important role in the origin and dissemination of cervical cancer and other human tumors. In this work, we analyzed the methylation of eight genes (AJAP1, CDH1, CDH13, MAGI2, MGMT, MYOD1, RASSF1A and SOX17) that participate in several biological processes for the maintenance of cell normality. We analyzed DNA methylation by methylation-specific PCR (MSP) and HPV infection using the INNO‑LiPA genotyping kit in 59 samples diagnostic of normal cervical tissue (non-SIL), 107 low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSILs), 29 high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSILs) and 51 cervical cancers (CCs).We found that all samples of LSIL, HSIL, and CC were HPV-positive, and the genotypes with higher frequencies were 16, 18, 51 and 56. In general, the genes analyzed displayed a significant tendency toward an increase in methylation levels according to increasing cervical lesion severity, except for the CDH13 gene. High CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) was associated with a 50.6-fold (95% CI 4.72-2267.3)-increased risk of HSIL and a 122-fold risk of CC (95% CI 10.04-5349.7).We found that CIMP high was significantly associated with HSIL and CC risk. These results could indicate that CIMP together with HR-HPV infection and other factors participates in the development of HSIL and CC.© 2022. The Author(s)."

Cell-free DNA has been introduced as a promising tool in the liquid biopsy of cancer. There are increasing evidence indicating that 5hmC in cell-free DNA play an active role during carcinogenesis. However, it remains unclear whether 5hmC could surpass classical markers in cancer detection, treatment, and prognosis. Here, we systematically reviewed the recent advances in the clinic and basic research of DNA 5-hydroxymethylation in cancer, especially in cell-free DNA.

Because diagnosing RC can be challenging, RC patients are at risk of rapid decline due to delayed suitable treatment. Here, we aimed to identify the differences in the circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) methylome between BD patients with and without RC. The cfDNA methylome could potentially be developed as a diagnostic test for BD RC. We extracted cfDNA from plasma samples of BD1 patients (46 RC and 47 non-RC). cfDNA methylation levels were measured by 850K Infinium MethylationEPIC array. Principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted to assess global differences in methylome. cfDNA methylation levels were compared between RC groups using a linear model adjusted for age and sex. PCA suggested differences in methylation profiles between RC groups (p= 0.039) although no significant differentially methylated probes (DMPs;q> 0.15) were found. The top four CpG sites which differed between groups atp< 1E-05 were located inCGGPB1,PEX10,NR0B2, andTP53I11. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) on top DMPs (p< 0.05) showed significant enrichment of gene sets related to nervous system tissues, such as neurons, synapse, and glutamate neurotransmission. Other top notable gene sets were related to parathyroid regulation and calcium signaling. To conclude, our study demonstrated the feasibility of utilizing a microarray method to identify circulating cfDNA methylation sites associated with BD RC and found the top differentially methylated CpG sites were mostly related to the nervous system and the parathyroid.Copyright © 2021 Ho, Winham, McCauley, Kundakovic, Robertson, Sun, Ordog, Webb, Frye and Veldic."

Improved CC detection assays that are highly sensitive, specific, and available at point of care are needed. In this study, we systematically selected and tested methylated markers that demonstrate high sensitivity and specificity for detection of CC in tissue and circulating cell-free DNA.Hierarchical analysis of 22 candidate CpG loci was conducted using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) COAD 450K HumanMethylation database. Methylation of 13 loci was analyzed using quantitative multiplex methylation-specific PCR (QM-MSP) in a training set of fresh frozen colon tissues (N = 53). Hypermethylated markers were identified that were highest in cancer and lowest in normal colon tissue using the 75th percentile in Mann-Whitney analyses and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) statistic. The cumulative methylation status of the marker panel was assayed in an independent test set of fresh frozen colon tissues (N = 52) using conditions defined and locked in the training set. A minimal marker panel of 6 genes was defined based on ROC area under the curve (AUC). Plasma samples (N = 20 colorectal cancers, stage IV and N = 20 normal) were tested by cMethDNA assay to evaluate marker performance in liquid biopsy.In the test set of samples, compared to normal tissue, a 6-gene panel showed 100% sensitivity and 90% specificity for detection of CC, and an AUC of 1.00 (95% CI 1.00, 1.00). In stage IV colorectal cancer plasma versus normal, an 8-gene panel showed 95% sensitivity, 100% specificity, and an AUC of 0.996 (95% CI 0.986, 1.00) while a 5-gene subset showed 100% sensitivity, 100% specificity, and an AUC of 1.00 (95% CI 1.00, 1.00), highly concordant with our observations in tissue.We identified high performance methylated DNA marker panels for detection of CC. This knowledge has set the stage for development and implementation of novel, automated, self-contained CC detection assays in tissue and blood which can expeditiously and accurately detect colon cancer in both developed and underdeveloped regions of the world, enabling optimal use of limited resources in low- and middle-income countries.© 2021.

In order to define a simple, reliable method for predicting whether patients with isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-wildtype GB treated with the standard therapy will be short- or long-term survivors, we analyzed the correlation of preoperative blood counts and their combined forms with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in these patients.Eighty-five patients with primary IDH-wildtype GB treated with the standard therapy between 2012 and 2019 were analyzed retrospectively. Cox proportional hazards models and Kaplan-Meier analysis were used to investigate the survival function of preoperative hematological parameters.Preoperative high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR, >2.42), high platelet count (>236 × 109/L), and low red blood cell (RBC) count (≤4.59 × 1012/L) were independent prognostic factors for poorer OS (p= 0.030,p= 0.030, andp= 0.004, respectively). Moreover, a high NLR was an independent prognostic factor for shorter PFS (p= 0.010). We also found that, like NLR, preoperative high derived NLR (dNLR, >1.89) was of poor prognostic value for both PFS (p= 0.002) and OS (p= 0.033). A significant correlation was observed between NLR and dNLR (r = 0.88,p< 0.001), which had a similar prognostic power for OS (NLR: AUC = 0.58; 95% CI: [0.48; 0.68]; dNLR: AUC = 0.62; 95% CI: [0.51; 0.72]). Two scores, one based on preoperative platelet and RBC counts plus NLR and the other on preoperative platelet and RBC counts plus dNLR, were found to be independent prognostic factors for PFS (p= 0.006 andp= 0.002, respectively) and OS (p< 0.001 for both scores).Cheap, routinely ordered, preoperative assessments of blood markers, such as NLR, dNLR, RBC, and platelet counts, can predict the survival outcomes of patients with IDH-wildtype GB treated with the standard therapy."

This study aimed to use machine learning (ML) algorithms to estimate BA in the Chinese population.Materials and methods:We used data from 9,771 middle-aged and older Chinese adults (≥45 years) in the 2011/2012 wave of the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study and followed until 2018. We used several ML algorithms (e.g., Gradient Boosting Regressor, Random Forest, CatBoost Regressor, and Support Vector Machine) to develop new measures of biological aging (ML-BAs) based on physiological biomarkers. R-squared value and mean absolute error (MAE) were used to determine the optimal performance of these ML-BAs. We used logistic regression models to examine the associations of the best ML-BA and a conventional aging measure-Klemera and Doubal method-BA (KDM-BA) we previously developed-with physical disability and mortality, respectively.Results:The Gradient Boosting Regression model performed the best, resulting in an ML-BA with an R-squared value of 0.270 and an MAE of 6.519. This ML-BA was significantly associated with disability in basic activities of daily living, instrumental activities of daily living, lower extremity mobility, and upper extremity mobility, and mortality, with odds ratios ranging from 1 to 7% (per 1-year increment in ML-BA, allP< 0.001), independent of CA. These associations were generally comparable to that of KDM-BA.Conclusion:This study provides a valid ML-based measure of biological aging for middle-aged and older Chinese adults. These findings support the application of ML in geroscience research and may help facilitate preventive and geroprotector intervention studies.Copyright © 2021 Cao, Yang, Jin, He, Li, Zheng, Liu and Wu."
"34924932","Evolutionary Origins of the Oligodendrocyte Cell Type and Adaptive Myelination.","Front Neurosci","Oligodendrocytes are multifunctional central nervous system (CNS) glia that are essential for neural function in gnathostomes. The evolutionary origins and specializations of the oligodendrocyte cell type are among the many remaining mysteries in glial biology and neuroscience. The role of oligodendrocytes as CNS myelinating glia is well established, but recent studies demonstrate that oligodendrocytes also participate in several myelin-independent aspects of CNS development, function, and maintenance. Furthermore, many recent studies have collectively advanced our understanding of myelin plasticity, and it is now clear that experience-dependent adaptations to myelination are an additional form of neural plasticity. These observations beg the questions of when and for which functions the ancestral oligodendrocyte cell type emerged, when primitive oligodendrocytes evolved new functionalities, and the genetic changes responsible for these evolutionary innovations. Here, I review recent findings and propose working models addressing the origins and evolution of the oligodendrocyte cell type and adaptive myelination. The core gene regulatory network (GRN) specifying the oligodendrocyte cell type is also reviewed as a means to probe the existence of oligodendrocytes in basal vertebrates and chordate invertebrates.Copyright © 2021 Hines."

Differential expression analysis without accounting for cell type composition cannot separate the changes due to cell type composition or cell type-specific expression. We propose a computational framework to address these limitations:Cell TypeAware analysis ofRNA-seq(CARseq). CARseq employs a negative binomial distribution that appropriately models the count data from RNA-seq experiments. Simulation studies show that CARseq has substantially higher power than a linear model-based approach and it also provides more accurate estimate of the rankings of differentially expressed genes. We have applied CARseq to compare gene expression of schizophrenia/autism subjects versus controls, and identified the cell types underlying the difference and similarities of these two neuron-developmental diseases. Our results are consistent with the results from differential expression analysis using single cell RNA-seq data."
"34988115","A Novel Hybrid Logic-ODE Modeling Approach to Overcome Knowledge Gaps.","Front Mol Biosci","Mathematical modeling allows using different formalisms to describe, investigate, and understand biological processes. However, despite the advent of high-throughput experimental techniques, quantitative information is still a challenge when looking for data to calibrate model parameters. Furthermore, quantitative formalisms must cope with stiffness and tractability problems, more so if used to describe multicellular systems. On the other hand, qualitative models may lack the proper granularity to describe the underlying kinetic processes. We propose a hybrid modeling approach that integrates ordinary differential equations and logical formalism to describe distinct biological layers and their communication. We focused on a multicellular system as a case study by applying the hybrid formalism to the well-known Delta-Notch signaling pathway. We used a differential equation model to describe the intracellular pathways while the cell-cell interactions were defined by logic rules. The hybrid approach herein employed allows us to combine the pros of different modeling techniques by overcoming the lack of quantitative information with a qualitative description that discretizes activation and inhibition processes, thus avoiding complexity.Copyright © 2021 Selvaggio, Cristellon and Marchetti."

For neurogenetic conditions associated with intellectual disability and ASD, data on natural history in adults are scarce; however, as older adults with these disorders are identified, it is becoming clear that some conditions are associated with both neurodevelopmental problems and neurodegeneration. Moreover, emerging evidence indicates that some neurogenetic conditions associated primarily with neurodegeneration also affect neurodevelopment.

Based on genome-wide transcriptomes, specifically those of blood samples, we identify the shared disease-related signatures between AD and CVD. In addition to gene expressions in blood, the following prior knowledge were utilized to identify several candidate disease-related gene (DRG) sets: protein-protein interactions, transcription factors, disease-gene relationship databases, and single nucleotide polymorphisms. We selected the respective DRG sets for AD and CVD that show a high accuracy for disease prediction in bulk and single-cell gene expression datasets. Then, gene regulatory networks (GRNs) were constructed from each of the AD and CVD DRG sets to identify the upstream regulating genes. Using the GRNs, we identified two common upstream genes (GPBP1 and SETDB2) between the AD and CVD GRNs. In summary, this study has identified the potential AD- and CVD-related genes and common hub genes between these sets, which may help to elucidate the shared mechanisms between these two diseases."

However, they have limited statistical detection by making assumptions on the association between traits and single nucleotide polymorphisms. Thus, a gene-based method (GGInt-XGBoost) originated from XGBoost is proposed in this article. Assuming that log odds ratio of disease traits satisfies the additive relationship if the pair of genes had no interactions, the difference in error between the XGBoost model with and without additive constraint could indicate gene-gene interaction; we then used a permutation-based statistical test to assess this difference and to provide a statisticalp-value to represent the significance of the interaction.

"34956337","Testing Gene-Gene Interactions Based on a Neighborhood Perspective in Genome-wide Association Studies.","Front Genet","Unexplained genetic variation that causes complex diseases is often induced by gene-gene interactions (GGIs). Gene-based methods are one of the current statistical methodologies for discovering GGIs in case-control genome-wide association studies that are not only powerful statistically, but also interpretable biologically. However, most approaches include assumptions about the form of GGIs, which results in poor statistical performance. As a result, we propose gene-based testing based on the maximal neighborhood coefficient (MNC) called gene-based gene-gene interaction through a maximal neighborhood coefficient (GBMNC). MNC is a metric for capturing a wide range of relationships between two random vectors with arbitrary, but not necessarily equal, dimensions. We established a statistic that leverages the difference in MNC in case and in control samples as an indication of the existence of GGIs, based on the assumption that the joint distribution of two genes in cases and controls should not be substantially different if there is no interaction between them. We then used a permutation-based statistical test to evaluate this statistic and calculate a statisticalp-value to represent the significance of the interaction.

Major QTLs controlling high oil content, high oleic content, and low linoleic content have been characterized in several seed oil crop species. Here we employ genome-wide association approaches on a recently genotyped collection of 787 plant introduction accessions in the USDA peanut core collection, plus selected improved cultivars, to discover markers associated with the natural variation in fatty acid composition, and to explain the genetic control of fatty acid composition in seed oils. Overall, 251 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) had significant trait associations with the measured fatty acid components. Twelve SNPs were associated with two or three different traits. Of these loci with apparent pleiotropic effects, 10 were associated with both oleic (C18:1) and linoleic acid (C18:2) content at different positions in the genome. In all 10 cases, the favorable allele had an opposite effect-increasing and lowering the concentration, respectively, of oleic and linoleic acid. The other traits with pleiotropic variant control were palmitic (C16:0), behenic (C22:0), lignoceric (C24:0), gadoleic (C20:1), total saturated, and total unsaturated fatty acid content. One hundred (100) of the significantly associated SNPs were located within 1000 kbp of 55 genes with fatty acid biosynthesis functional annotations. These genes encoded, among others: ACCase carboxyl transferase subunits, and several fatty acid synthase II enzymes. With the exception of gadoleic (C20:1) and lignoceric (C24:0) acid content, which occur at relatively low abundance in cultivated peanut, all traits had significant SNP interactions exceeding a stringent Bonferroni threshold (α = 1%). We detected 7,682 pairwise SNP interactions affecting the relative abundance of fatty acid components in the seed oil. Of these, 627 SNP pairs had at least one SNP within 1000 kbp of a gene with fatty acid biosynthesis functional annotation. We evaluated 168 candidate genes underlying these SNP interactions. Functional enrichment and protein-to-protein interactions supported significant interactions (p-value < 1.0E-16) among the genes evaluated. These results show the complex nature of the biology and genes underlying the variation in seed oil fatty acid composition and contribute to an improved genotype-to-phenotype map for fatty acid variation in peanut seed oil.Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Genetics Society of America 2021.

"35002373","Current views in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease pathogenesis and management.","Saudi Pharm J","Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive lung dysfunction caused mainly by inhaling toxic particles and cigarette smoking (CS). The continuous exposure to ruinous molecules can lead to abnormal inflammatory responses, permanent damages to the respiratory system, and irreversible pathological changes. Other factors, such as genetics and aging, influence the development of COPD. In the last decade, accumulating evidence suggested that mitochondrial alteration, including mitochondrial DNA damage, increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), abnormal autophagy, and apoptosis, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of COPD. The alteration can also extend to epigenetics, namely DNA methylation, histone modification, and non-coding RNA. This review will discuss the recent progressions in COPD pathology, pathophysiology, and molecular pathways. More focus will be shed on mitochondrial and epigenetic variations related to COPD development and the role of nanomedicine as a potential tool for the prevention and treatment of this disease.© 2021 The Author(s)."

This study examined the association between optimism and mortality rate in African-Americans. Data were from African-American women (n = 2652) and men (n = 1444) in the United States from the Jackson Heart Study. Optimism was measured using the Life Orientation Test-Revised at the baseline period (2000-2004), and mortality data were obtained until 2018. Using Cox proportional hazards models, we estimated hazard ratios (HRs) of mortality by optimism level, controlling for sociodemographic factors, depressive symptoms, health conditions, and health behaviors. In secondary analyses, we evaluated potential effect modification by sex, age, income, and education. Higher optimism was related to lower mortality rates (HR = 0.85, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.74, 0.99), controlling for sociodemographic factors and depressive symptoms. After further adjusting for health conditions and health behaviors, associations were slightly attenuated (HR = 0.89; 95%CI = 0.77, 1.02). Stronger associations between optimism and mortality were observed in men, among those with higher income or education, and with age ≤ 55 (all p's for interaction terms <0.06). In summary, optimism was associated with lower mortality rates among African-Americans in the Jackson Heart Study. Effect modification by sociodemographic factors should be further explored in additional research considering optimism and mortality in diverse populations. Positive factors, such as optimism, may provide important health assets that can complement ongoing public health efforts to reduce health disparities, which have traditionally focused primarily on risk factors.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

The advanced stage upon diagnosis, limited success with effective targeted therapy and lack of reliable biomarkers are among the key factors underlying the marginally improved survival rates over the decades. Prevention, early detection and biomarker-driven treatment adaptation are crucial for timely interventions and improved clinical outcomes. Liquid biopsy, analysis of tumour-specific biomarkers circulating in bodily fluids, is a rapidly evolving field that may play a striking role in optimising patient care. In recent years, significant progress has been made towards advancing liquid biopsies for non-invasive early cancer detection, prognosis, treatment adaptation, monitoring of residual disease and surveillance of recurrence. While these emerging technologies have immense potential to improve patient survival, numerous methodological and biological limitations must be overcome before their implementation into clinical practice. This review outlines the current state of knowledge on various types of liquid biopsies in HNSCC, and their potential applications for diagnosis, prognosis, grading treatment response and post-treatment surveillance. It also discusses challenges associated with the clinical applicability of liquid biopsies and prospects of the optimised approaches in the management of HNSCC.© 2021.

For epigenomics, the application of DL to assist physicians and scientists in human disease-relevant prediction tasks has been relatively unexplored until very recently. In this article, we critically review published studies that employed DL models to predict disease detection, subtype classification, and treatment responses, using epigenomic data. A comprehensive search on PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and arXiv.org was performed following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Among 1140 initially identified publications, we included 22 articles in our review. DNA methylation and RNA-sequencing data are most frequently used to train the predictive models. The reviewed models achieved a high accuracy ranged from 88.3% to 100.0% for disease detection tasks, from 69.5% to 97.8% for subtype classification tasks, and from 80.0% to 93.0% for treatment response prediction tasks. We generated a workflow to develop a predictive model that encompasses all steps from first defining human disease-related tasks to finally evaluating model performance.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak represents an unprecedented threat for all health systems worldwide. The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 is highly heterogeneous, ranging from asymptomatic and mild upper respiratory tract illness to severe interstitial pneumonia with respiratory failure and even death. Highly age-dependent patterns of immune response potentially explain the higher rates of the severe forms of COVID-19 in elderly patients. However, genetic and epigenetic architecture can influence multiple biological processes during the lifespan, therefore as far as our knowledge shows, vulnerability to viral infection concerning telomere length and epigenetic signature is not a new idea. This review aims is to summarize the current understanding of the role of telomere length and epigenetic mechanisms on the severity of COVID-19. The current knowledge highlights the significant association between the shorter telomere length and the higher risk of developing severe COVID-19. Differential DNA methylation patterns and miRNA expression profiles imply that these hallmarks can play a pivotal role in COVID- 19 pathogenesis. Understanding the causes of inter-individual variations in COVID-19 outcomes could provide clues to the development of the personalized therapeutic intervention.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we aim to investigate the potential effect and mechanisms of RORA suppression on autism-like behavior (ALB) through maternal diabetes-mediated mouse model. Our in vitro study in human neural progenitor cells shows that transient hyperglycemia induces persistent RORA suppression through oxidative stress-mediated epigenetic modifications and subsequent dissociation of octamer-binding transcription factor 3/4 from the RORA promoter, subsequently suppressing the expression of aromatase and superoxide dismutase 2. The in vivo mouse study shows that prenatal RORA deficiency in neuron-specific RORA null mice mimics maternal diabetes-mediated ALB; postnatal RORA expression in the amygdala ameliorates, while postnatal RORA knockdown mimics, maternal diabetes-mediated ALB in offspring. In addition, RORA mRNA levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells decrease to 34.2% in ASD patients (n = 121) compared to the typically developing group (n = 118), and the related Receiver Operating Characteristic curve shows good sensitivity and specificity with a calculated 84.1% of Area Under the Curve for ASD diagnosis. We conclude that maternal diabetes contributes to ALB in offspring through suppression of RORA and aromatase, RORA expression in PBMC could be a potential marker for ASD screening.© 2022.

"34836233","Targeting DNA Methylation in the Adult Brain through Diet.","Nutrients","Metabolism and nutrition have a significant role in epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation, which can influence gene expression. Recently, it has been suggested that bioactive nutrients and gut microbiota can alter DNA methylation in the central nervous system (CNS) through the gut-brain axis, playing a crucial role in modulating CNS functions and, finally, behavior. Here, we will focus on the effect of metabolic signals in shaping brain DNA methylation during adulthood. We will provide an overview of potential interactions among diet, gastrointestinal microbiome and epigenetic alterations on brain methylation and behavior. In addition, the impact of different diet challenges on cytosine methylation dynamics in the adult brain will be discussed. Finally, we will explore new ways to modulate DNA hydroxymethylation, which is particularly abundant in neural tissue, through diet."
"34957106","Understanding 3D Genome Organization and Its Effect on Transcriptional Gene Regulation Under Environmental Stress in Plant: A Chromatin Perspective.","Front Cell Dev Biol","The genome of a eukaryotic organism is comprised of a supra-molecular complex of chromatin fibers and intricately folded three-dimensional (3D) structures. Chromosomal interactions and topological changes in response to the developmental and/or environmental stimuli affect gene expression. Chromatin architecture plays important roles in DNA replication, gene expression, and genome integrity. Higher-order chromatin organizations like chromosome territories (CTs), A/B compartments, topologically associating domains (TADs), and chromatin loops vary among cells, tissues, and species depending on the developmental stage and/or environmental conditions (4D genomics). Every chromosome occupies a separate territory in the interphase nucleus and forms the top layer of hierarchical structure (CTs) in most of the eukaryotes. While the A and B compartments are associated with active (euchromatic) and inactive (heterochromatic) chromatin, respectively, having well-defined genomic/epigenomic features, TADs are the structural units of chromatin. Chromatin architecture like TADs as well as the local interactions between promoter and regulatory elements correlates with the chromatin activity, which alters during environmental stresses due to relocalization of the architectural proteins. Moreover, chromatin looping brings the gene and regulatory elements in close proximity for interactions. The intricate relationship between nucleotide sequence and chromatin architecture requires a more comprehensive understanding to unravel the genome organization and genetic plasticity. During the last decade, advances in chromatin conformation capture techniques for unravelling 3D genome organizations have improved our understanding of genome biology. However, the recent advances, such as Hi-C and ChIA-PET, have substantially increased the resolution, throughput as well our interest in analysing genome organizations. The present review provides an overview of the historical and contemporary perspectives of chromosome conformation capture technologies, their applications in functional genomics, and the constraints in predicting 3D genome organization. We also discuss the future perspectives of understanding high-order chromatin organizations in deciphering transcriptional regulation of gene expression under environmental stress (4D genomics). These might help design the climate-smart crop to meet the ever-growing demands of food, feed, and fodder.Copyright © 2021 Kumar, Kaur, Seem, Kumar and Mohapatra."

This study aimed to identify a circRNA-miRNA-mRNA-associated ceRNA network and related pathways in PE.We downloaded 3 microarray datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus database, obtained 163 differentially expressed circRNAs (dif-circRNAs) (61 upregulated and 102 downregulated), 39 differentially expressed microRNAs (dif-miRNAs) (22 upregulated and 17 downregulated), and 271 differentially expressed mRNAs (dif-mRNAs) (168 upregulated and 103 downregulated) from placenta tissues of PE. Functional enrichment analysis and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network with module analysis of dif-mRNAs were performed. The regulatory relationship between dif-miRNAs and dif-mRNAs/circRNAs was predictedviarelated databases. A circRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory network was constructed.A total of 53 pairs were obtained, including 13 circRNAs (10 upregulated and 3 downregulated), 9 miRNAs (3 upregulated and 6 downregulated) and 31 mRNAs (22 upregulated and 9 downregulated). GNB5 and IL2RB were obtained. KEGG enrichment analysis showed that both of them were closely related with the PI3K-Akt signalling pathway. Therefore, ceRNAs might affect the PI3K-Akt signalling pathwayviathe upregulation of GNB5 by binding to miR-1248 in PE. Meanwhile, hsa_circ_0052661 might upregulate IL2RB by binding miR-4303 to play a role in PE in the same way.GNB5 and IL2RB might be key genes involved in the PI3K-Akt signalling pathway in PE, and hsa_circ_0087208, hsa_circ_0035443, hsa_circ_0067557 and hsa_circ_0052661 might regulate these key genes in PE by binding miR-1248 or miR-4303.Key messagesThere is still a lack of predictive and diagnostic factors for preeclampsia, which is a common cause of maternal death worldwide.This study identified a novel circRNA-associated ceRNA network and related pathways in preeclampsia.GNB5 and IL2RB might be key genes in their related circRNA-associated ceRNA network, and probably take an important role in preeclampsia via PI3K-Akt signalling pathway, which made them to be potential markers of preeclampsia."

Here, we aimed to determine if ART affects placental inflammation and oxidative stress as a mechanism for unfavorable pregnancy outcomes.The levels of six cytokines (IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNFα) were measured using multiplex ELISA. The activity of four antioxidant enzymes (glutathione S-transferase (GST), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase, superoxide dismutase) and levels of two antioxidants (GSH, vitamin E) were measured using commercial/in-house assays. Markers were compared between ART and unassisted pregnancies, and then groups were stratified using ICD9/10 codes to determine differences in specific clinical contexts.In unassisted twin pregnancies, there was a trend of decreased cytokine levels (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, TNFα, p < 0.05), but cytokines in ART twins were the same or higher. Additionally, GST and GPx activities were lower in unassisted twins, and vitamin E levels were higher in ART twins (p < 0.05). In pregnancies complicated by chorioamnionitis, there was a trend of increased cytokine levels in unassisted pregnancies (IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8, p < 0.05). No increase was observed in ART, and IFN-γ and TNFα were decreased (p < 0.05). Placental GST and GPx activities were higher in unassisted pregnancies with chorioamnionitis compared to ART (p < 0.05).Attenuation of protective placental inflammatory and oxidative stress responses may play a role in the underlying pathogenesis of negative birth outcomes in ART, expanding our understanding of adverse pregnancy outcomes when ART is used to conceive.© 2021.

However, its biological function in glioma has yet to be fully investigated. The PLOD1 mRNA status and clinical significance in gliomas were assessed via the GEPIA database. Overexpression or targeted depletion of PLOD1 was carried out in the human glioma cell line U87 and verified by western blotting. CCK8 and colony formation assays were implemented to examine the impact of PLOD1 on the proliferative and colony-forming phenotypes of U87 cells. Luciferase reporter assays and HSF1-specific pharmacologic inhibitors (KRIBB11) were employed to determine the regulatory relationship between PLOD1 and heat shock factor 1 (HSF1). High expression of PLOD1 was observed in tissue samples of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and brain lower-grade glioma (LGG). GEPIA overall survival further demonstrated that both GBM and LGG patients with high PLOD1 displayed worse clinical outcomes compared with those with low PLOD1. Overexpression and targeted depletion of PLOD1 enhanced and suppressed U87 cell proliferation and colony formation, respectively. Luciferase reporter assays showed that PLOD1 significantly enhanced the transcriptional activity of HSF1 in HEK293T cells. PLOD1 deficiency in U87 cells inhibited HSF1-induced survivin accumulation, whereas KRIBB11 also blocked the PLOD1-overexpressing induced survivin expression. An inhibitor of HSF1 signaling events abolished the increased clonogenic potential caused by PLOD1 overexpression in U87 cells. High expression of PLOD1 can increase the proliferation and colony formation of U87 cells by activating the HSF1 signaling pathway. This study suggested PLOD1/HSF1 as an effective therapeutic target for gliomas.© 2021. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."

Using datasets containing gene expression for dysplastic nevi and melanoma or melanoma arising in a nevus, we performed differential gene expression analysis and regularized regression models to identify genes and pathways that were associated with progression from nevi to melanoma. A small number of genes distinguished nevi from melanoma. Differential expression of seven genes was identified between nevi and melanoma in three independent datasets. C1QB, CXCL9, CXCL10, DFNA5 (GSDME), FCGR1B, and PRAME were increased in melanoma, and SCGB1D2 was decreased in melanoma, compared to dysplastic nevi or nevi that progressed to melanoma. Further supporting an association with melanomagenesis, these genes demonstrated a linear change in expression from benign nevi to dysplastic nevi to radial growth phase melanoma to vertical growth phase melanoma. The genes associated with melanoma progression showed significant enrichment of multiple pathways related to the immune system. This study demonstrates (1) a novel application of bioinformatic approaches to aid clinical trials of melanoma chemoprevention and (2) the feasibility of determining a gene signature biomarker of melanomagenesis."

But the implication of m6A modification in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is still unclear. Hence, this study conducted a comprehensive analysis of the expression and clinical implication of m6A regulators in LUAD.Methods:Consensus clustering analysis of 502 LUAD samples in the TCGA dataset was presented based on the expression profiles of 20 m6A regulators using ConsensusClusterPlus package. Overall survival (OS), activation of signaling pathways and tumor immunity (immune/stromal score, tumor purity, expression of HLA and immune checkpoints, and immune cell infiltration) were compared between m6A modification patterns. The m6A-related genes between patterns were identified and prognostic m6A-related genes were imported into LASSO-cox regression analysis. The m6A risk score was developed and its prognostic implication was evaluated and externally verified in the GSE30219 and GSE72094 dataset. Furthermore, a nomogram that contained independent prognostic indicators was established, followed by external verification.Results:Two m6A modification patterns were clustered across LUAD based on the expression similarity of the m6A regulators via consensus clustering analysis, with distinct OS, activation of signaling pathways and tumor immunity. Totally, 213 m6A-related genes that were identified by comparing two patterns were significantly related to LUAD prognosis. By LASSO method, we constructed the m6A risk score that was a reliable and independent prognostic factor for LUAD. Patients with low m6A risk score displayed a prominent survival advantage. After incorporating independent clinical features, we developed the prognostic nomogram that exhibited high predictive accuracy and the best clinical net benefit for OS.Conclusion:Collectively, our study may provide a clinically useful tool for precise prognostic management and optimization of immunotherapeutic strategies for LUAD patients.Copyright © 2021 Ma and Zhang."
"34956037","Risk Estimation of Infectious and Inflammatory Disorders in Hospitalized Patients With Acute Ischemic Stroke Using Clinical-Lab Nomogram.","Front Neurol","Background:Infections after acute ischemic stroke are common and likely to complicate the clinical course and negatively affect patient outcomes. Despite the development of various risk factors and predictive models for infectious and inflammatory disorders (IAID) after stroke, more objective and easily obtainable predictors remain necessary. This study involves the development and validation of an accessible, accurate nomogram for predicting in-hospital IAID in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS).Methods:A retrospective cohort of 2,257 patients with AIS confirmed by neurological examination and radiography was assessed. The International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Health related Problem's definition was used for IAID. Data was obtained from two hospitals between January 2016 and March 2020.Results:The incidence of IAID was 19.8 and 20.8% in the derivation and validation cohorts, respectively. Using an absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm, four biochemical blood predictors and four clinical indicators were optimized from fifty-five features. Using a multivariable analysis, four predictors, namely age (adjusted odds ratio, 1.05; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.038-1.062;p< 0.001), comatose state (28.033[4.706-536.403],p= 0.002), diabetes (0.417[0.27-0.649],p< 0.001), and congestive heart failure (CHF) (5.488[2.451-12.912],p< 0.001) were found to be risk factors for IAID. Furthermore, neutrophil, monocyte, hemoglobin, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein were also found to be independently associated with IAID. Consequently, a reliable clinical-lab nomogram was constructed to predict IAID in our study (C-index value = 0.83). The results of the ROC analysis were consistent with the calibration curve analysis. The decision curve demonstrated that the clinical-lab model added more net benefit than either the lab-score or clinical models in differentiating IAID from AIS patients.Conclusions:The clinical-lab nomogram predicted IAID in patients with acute ischemic stroke. As a result, this nomogram can be used for identification of high-risk patients and to further guide clinical decisions.Copyright © 2021 Li, Huang, Pang, Chen, Li, Wu, Hu and Chen."

R language software was used to obtain differentially expressed immune-related lncRNAs and immune-related lncRNA pairs. The model was constructed using least absolute shrinkage and selector operation regression analysis, and receiver operator characteristic curves were drawn. The Akaike information criterion was used to distinguish the high-risk from the low-risk group. We also conducted correlation analysis for the high- and low-risk subgroups.We identified 27 immune-related lncRNAs pairs, 16 of which were included in the model construction. After merging clinical data, the areas under the curve of 1 -year, 3-year, and 5-year survival times of ccRCC patients were 0.867, 0.832, and 0.838, respectively. Subgroup analyses were conducted according to the cut-off value. We found that the high-risk group was associated with poor outcomes. The risk score and tumor stage were independent predictors of the outcome of ccRCC. The risk model predicted specific immune cell infiltration, immune checkpoint gene expression levels, and high-risk groups more sensitive to sunitinib targeted therapy.We obtained prognostic-related novel ccRCC markers and risk model that predicts the outcome of patients with ccRCC and helps identify those who can benefit from sunitinib."

Analyses for functional enrichment, DNA variation, immune cell distribution, association with independent clinicopathological features, and predictive responses for immune checkpoint therapies were performed and validated.Results:Three immunophenotyping clusters with gradual levels of immune infiltration were identified. The intermediate and high immune infiltration clusters (Clusters B and C) were associated with a worse prognosis for ccRCC patients. Tumors in the immune-hot Clusters B and C showed pro-tumorigenic immune infiltration, and these patients showed significantly worse survival compared with patients in the immune-cold Cluster A in the training and testing cohorts (n= 422). In addition to distinct immune cell infiltrations of immunophenotyping, we detected significant differences in DNA variation among clusters, suggesting a high degree of genetic heterogeneity. Furthermore, expressions of multiple immune checkpoint molecules were significantly increased. Clusters B and C predicted favorable outcomes in 64 ccRCC patients receiving immune checkpoint therapies from the FUSCC cohort. In 360 ccRCC patients from the FUSCC validation cohort, Clusters B and C significantly predicted worse prognosis compared with Cluster A. After immunophenotyping of ccRCC was confirmed, significantly increased tertiary lymphatic structures, aggressive phenotype, elevated glycolysis and PD-L1 expression, higher abundance of CD8+T cells, and TCRn cell infiltration were found in the immune-hot Clusters B and C.Conclusion:This study described immunophenotyping clusters that improved the prognostic accuracy of the immune contexture in the ccRCC microenvironment.

The present study aimed to explore novel prognosis-related signatures of SKCM and determine the significance of immune cell infiltration in this pathology.Four gene expression profiles (GSE130244, GSE3189, GSE7553 and GSE46517) of SKCM and normal skin samples were retrieved from the GEO database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were then screened, and the feature genes were identified by the LASSO regression and Boruta algorithm. Survival analysis was performed to filter the potential prognostic signature, and GEPIA was used for preliminary validation. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was obtained to evaluate discriminatory ability. The Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) was performed, and the composition of the immune cell infiltration in SKCM was estimated using CIBERSORT. At last, paraffin-embedded specimens of primary SKCM and normal skin tissues were collected, and the signature was validated by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC).Totally 823 DEGs and 16 feature genes were screened. IFI16 was identified as the signature associated with overall survival of SKCM with a great discriminatory ability (AUC > 0.9 for all datasets). GSVA noticed that IFI16 might be involved in apoptosis and ultraviolet response in SKCM, and immune cell infiltration of IFI16 was evaluated. At last, FISH and IHC both validated the differential expression of IFI16 in SKCM.In conclusion, our comprehensive analysis identified IFI16 as a signature associated with overall survival and immune infiltration of SKCM, which may play a critical role in the occurrence and development of SKCM.© 2021.

Based on prognostic mRNAsi-related genes, a risk score model was constructed by the LASSO method. The predictive accuracy was evaluated by uni- and multivariate Cox analyses and ROC curves. Among the genes in the model, the functions of H2AFZ on proliferation, apoptosis, invasion, and EMT were investigated in OSCC cells.High mRNAsi was distinctly associated with undesirable prognosis, increased stromal and immune scores, and lowered tumor purity. The mRNAsi-associated signature containing 11 genes was developed, and high-risk score was distinctly related to poor survival outcomes. Moreover, this signature was an independent and robust risk factor. H2AFZ upregulation significantly enhanced proliferative and invasive capacities and facilitated EMT as well as lowered apoptotic levels in Cal-27 and HSC-3 cells.Our study characterized cancer stem cell characteristics that were closely related to tumor microenvironment and developed a stemness index cell-related signature that could assist prognosis prediction and risk stratification for OSCC.

Patients older than three years were recommended to receive irradiation: focal fields for non-metastatic CPC, incompletely resected atypical choroid plexus papilloma (APP) or metastatic choroid plexus papilloma (CPP); craniospinal fields for metastatic CPC/APP and non-responsive CPC. High risk was defined as choroid plexus carcinoma (CPC), incompletely resected APP, and all metastatic CPT. From 2000 until 2010, 158 CPT patients from 23 countries were enrolled.For randomized CPC, the 5/10 year progression free survival (PFS) of patients on CarbEV (n = 20) were 62%/47%, respectively, compared to 27%/18%, on CycEV (n = 15), (intention-to-treat, HR 2.6, p = 0.032). Within the registry, histological grading was the most influential prognostic factor: for CPP (n = 55) the 5/10 year overall survival (OS) and the event free survival (EFS) probabilities were 100%/97% and 92%/92%, respectively; for APP (n = 49) 96%/96% and 76%/76%, respectively; and for CPC (n = 54) 65%/51% and 41%/39%, respectively. Without irradiation, 12 out of 33 patients with CPC younger than three years were alive for a median of 8.52 years. Extent of surgery and metastases were not independent prognosticators.Chemotherapy for Choroid Plexus Carcinoma is feasible and effective. CarbEV is superior to CycEV.

"34986190","DNMT1 regulates the timing of DNA methylation by DNMT3 in an enzymatic activity-dependent manner in mouse embryonic stem cells.","PLoS One","DNA methylation (DNAme; 5-methylcytosine, 5mC) plays an essential role in mammalian development, and the 5mC profile is regulated by a balance of opposing enzymatic activities: DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and Ten-eleven translocation dioxygenases (TETs). In mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs), de novo DNAme by DNMT3 family enzymes, demethylation by the TET-mediated conversion of 5mC to 5-hydroxymethylation (5hmC), and maintenance of the remaining DNAme by DNMT1 are actively repeated throughout cell cycles, dynamically forming a constant 5mC profile. Nevertheless, the detailed mechanism and physiological significance of this active cyclic DNA modification in mouse ESCs remain unclear. Here by visualizing the localization of DNA modifications on metaphase chromosomes and comparing whole-genome methylation profiles before and after the mid-S phase in ESCs lacking Dnmt1 (1KO ESCs), we demonstrated that in 1KO ESCs, DNMT3-mediated remethylation was interrupted during and after DNA replication. This results in a marked asymmetry in the distribution of 5hmC between sister chromatids at mitosis, with one chromatid being almost no 5hmC. When introduced in 1KO ESCs, the catalytically inactive form of DNMT1 (DNMT1CI) induced an increase in DNAme in pericentric heterochromatin and the DNAme-independent repression of IAPEz, a retrotransposon family, in 1KO ESCs. However, DNMT1CI could not restore the ability of DNMT3 to methylate unmodified dsDNA de novo in S phase in 1KO ESCs. Furthermore, during in vitro differentiation into epiblasts, 1KO ESCs expressing DNMT1CI showed an even stronger tendency to differentiate into the primitive endoderm than 1KO ESCs and were readily reprogrammed into the primitive streak via an epiblast-like cell state, reconfirming the importance of DNMT1 enzymatic activity at the onset of epiblast differentiation. These results indicate a novel function of DNMT1, in which DNMT1 actively regulates the timing and genomic targets of de novo methylation by DNMT3 in an enzymatic activity-dependent and independent manner, respectively."
"34947873","Structure, Activity, and Function of SETMAR Protein Lysine Methyltransferase.","Life (Basel)","SETMAR is a protein lysine methyltransferase that is involved in several DNA processes, including DNA repair via the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway, regulation of gene expression, illegitimate DNA integration, and DNA decatenation. However, SETMAR is an atypical protein lysine methyltransferase since in anthropoid primates, the SET domain is fused to an inactive DNA transposase. The presence of the DNA transposase domain confers to SETMAR a DNA binding activity towards the remnants of its transposable element, which has resulted in the emergence of a gene regulatory function. Both the SET and the DNA transposase domains are involved in the different cellular roles of SETMAR, indicating the presence of novel and specific functions in anthropoid primates. In addition, SETMAR is dysregulated in different types of cancer, indicating a potential pathological role. While some light has been shed on SETMAR functions, more research and new tools are needed to better understand the cellular activities of SETMAR and to investigate the therapeutic potential of SETMAR."

Thus, using multifocal prostate cancer as a model to investigate tumor inter-clonal relationships and tumor evolution could aid in our understanding of drug resistance. Previous studies discovered genomic alterations by comparing hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (HSPC) with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) in large cohorts. However, most studies did not sequentially sample tumors from the same patient. In our study, we performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) on 14 specimens from five locally relapsed patients before and after androgen-deprivation therapy. We described the landscape of genomic alterations before and after treatment and identified critical driver events that could have contributed to the evolution of CRPC. In addition to confirming known cancer genes such as TP53 and CDK12, we also identified new candidate genes that may play a role in the progression of prostate cancer, including MYO15A, CHD6 and LZTR1. At copy number alteration (CNA) level, gain of 8q24.13-8q24.3 was observed in 60% of patients and was the most commonly altered locus in both HSPC and CRPC tumors. Finally, utilizing phylogenetic reconstruction, we explored the clonal progression pattern from HSPC to CRPC in each patient.

"34857746","Repression of germline genes by PRC1.6 and SETDB1 in the early embryo precedes DNA methylation-mediated silencing.","Nat Commun","Silencing of a subset of germline genes is dependent upon DNA methylation (DNAme) post-implantation. However, these genes are generally hypomethylated in the blastocyst, implicating alternative repressive pathways before implantation. Indeed, in embryonic stem cells (ESCs), an overlapping set of genes, including germline ""genome-defence"" (GGD) genes, are upregulated following deletion of the H3K9 methyltransferase SETDB1 or subunits of the non-canonical PRC1 complex PRC1.6. Here, we show that in pre-implantation embryos and naïve ESCs (nESCs), hypomethylated promoters of germline genes bound by the PRC1.6 DNA-binding subunits MGA/MAX/E2F6 are enriched for RING1B-dependent H2AK119ub1 and H3K9me3. Accordingly, repression of these genes in nESCs shows a greater dependence on PRC1.6 than DNAme. In contrast, GGD genes are hypermethylated in epiblast-like cells (EpiLCs) and their silencing is dependent upon SETDB1, PRC1.6/RING1B and DNAme, with H3K9me3 and DNAme establishment dependent upon MGA binding. Thus, GGD genes are initially repressed by PRC1.6, with DNAme subsequently engaged in post-implantation embryos.© 2021. The Author(s)."

Precisely how PHIP functions in these contexts is not fully understood. Here we demonstrate that PHIP is a chromatin-associated CRL4 ubiquitin ligase substrate receptor and is required for CRL4 recruitment to chromatin. PHIP binds to chromatin through a trivalent reader domain consisting of a H3K4-methyl binding Tudor domain and two bromodomains (BD1 and BD2). Using semisynthetic nucleosomes with defined histone post-translational modifications, we characterize PHIPs BD1 and BD2 as respective readers of H3K14ac and H4K12ac, and identify human disease-associated mutations in each domain and the intervening linker region that likely disrupt chromatin binding. These findings provide new insight into the biological function of this enigmatic chromatin protein and set the stage for the identification of both upstream chromatin modifiers and downstream targets of PHIP in human disease.© 2021 Morgan et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press."

The quality of a BS-seq library is measured by its bisulfite conversion efficiency. Libraries with low conversion rates are typically excluded from analysis resulting in reduced coverage and increased costs.We have developed a probabilistic method and software, LuxRep, that implements a general linear model and simultaneously accounts for technical replicates (libraries from the same biological sample) from different bisulfite-converted DNA libraries. Using simulations and actual DNA methylation data, we show that including technical replicates with low bisulfite conversion rates generates more accurate estimates of methylation levels and differentially methylated sites. Moreover, using variational inference speeds up computation time necessary for whole genome analysis.In this work we show that taking into account technical replicates (i.e. libraries) of BS-seq data of varying bisulfite conversion rates, with their corresponding experimental parameters, improves methylation level estimation and differential methylation detection.© 2022.

"34854250","A functional methylation signature to predict the prognosis of Chinese lung adenocarcinoma based on TCGA.","Cancer Med","Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer morbidity and mortality worldwide, however, the individualized treatment is still unsatisfactory. DNA methylation can affect gene regulation and may be one of the most valuable biomarkers in predicting the prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma. This study was aimed to identify methylation CpG sites that may be used to predict lung adenocarcinoma prognosis.The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database was used to detect methylation CpG sites associated with lung adenocarcinoma prognosis and construct a methylation signature model. Then, a Chinese cohort was carried out to estimate the association between methylation and lung adenocarcinoma prognosis. Biological function studies, including demethylation treatment, cell proliferative capacity, and gene expression changes in lung adenocarcinoma cell lines, were further performed.In the TCGA set, three methylation CpG sites were selected that were associated with lung adenocarcinoma prognosis (cg14517217, cg15386964, and cg18878992). The risk of mortality was increased in lung adenocarcinoma patients with the gradual increase level of methylation signature based on three methylation sites levels (HR = 45.30, 95% CI = 26.69-66.83; p < 0.001). The C-statistic value increased to 0.77 when age, gender, and other clinical variables were added to the signature to prediction model. A similar situation was confirmed in Chinese lung adenocarcinoma cohort. In the biological function studies, the proliferative capacity of cell lines was inhibited when the cells were demethylated with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-2dC). The mRNA and protein expression levels of SEPT9 and HIST1H2BH (cg14517217 and cg15386964) were downregulated with different concentrations of 5-aza-2dC treatment, while cg18878992 showed the opposite result.This study is the first to develop a three-CpG-based model for lung adenocarcinoma, which is a practical and useful tool for prognostic prediction that has been validated in a Chinese population.© 2021 The Authors.

They have a higher biological reactivity than bigger particles and can reach the placenta after maternal exposure. One study has shown an association between maternal occupational exposure to UFPs and fetal growth restriction. Yet few studies have focused on the effects of UFP exposure on placental histopathological lesions. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between maternal occupational exposure to UFPs and histopathological lesions of their placenta. The analyses were based on data from the ARTEMIS Center. A job-exposure matrix was used to assess occupational exposure to UFPs. The histopathological placental exam was performed by two pathologists who were blinded to the exposure of each subject. The examination was conducted in accordance with the recommendations of the Amsterdam consensus. The study sample included 130 placentas (30 exposed, 100 unexposed). Maternal occupational exposure to UFPs during pregnancy is significantly associated with placental hypoplasia (the phenomenon affected 61% of the exposed patients and 34% of the unexposed ones,p< 0.01).

"34858022","Focus on Early COPD: Definition and Early Lung Development.","Int J Chron Obstruct Pulmon Dis","Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a disease with high incidence rate and mortality rates worldwide. It is the third leading cause of death in the world. Nevertheless, little progress has been made in treating and preventing the disease. Under these circumstances, the concept of ""early COPD"" was proposed. Although this concept is not new, most health-care workers do not fully understand early COPD and tend to confuse it with mild COPD. In this review, we mainly discuss the definition of early COPD and the developmental trajectory of lung function. Although patients with early COPD have no symptoms, their lung function is already lower than that of normal people. A relatively complete definition is needed to identify this group of people. Reduced lung function is the diagnostic criterion for COPD, but lung development is a long-term dynamic process. In addition to smoking and air pollution, we should pay more attention to prenatal and childhood risk factors, for example, parents smoking, birth weight, preterm birth, mode of delivery, childhood respiratory infections and childhood asthma. Health-care workers need to be fully aware of early COPD, to reduce the morbidity of COPD and take effective measures to prevent these risk factors.© 2021 Yang et al."

We quantified HAP exposure by repeated, personal prenatal and postnatal carbon monoxide (CO) and, in a subset, fine particulate matter [PM with an aerodynamic diameter of≤2.5μm(PM2.5)] assessments. Length, weight, mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) and head circumference (HC) were measured at birth, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months; weight-for-age, length-for-age (LAZ), and weight-for-lengthz(WLZ)-scores were calculated. For each anthropometric measure, we employed latent class growth analysis to generate growth trajectories over the first year of life and assigned each child to a trajectory group. We then employed ordinal logistic regression to determine associations between HAP exposures and growth trajectory assignments. Associations with stove intervention arm were also considered.Of the 1,306 live births, 1,144 had valid CO data and anthropometric variables measured at least once. Prenatal HAP exposure increased risk for lower length [COodds ratio (OR)=1.17, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.35 per 1-ppm increase;PM2.5OR=1.07, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.13per 10-μg/m3increase], lower LAZz-score (COOR=1.15, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.32 per 1-ppm increase) and stunting (COOR=1.25, 95% CI: 1.08, 1.45) trajectories. Postnatal HAP exposure increased risk for smaller HC (COOR=1.09, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.13 per 1-ppm increase), smaller MUAC and lower WLZ-score (PM2.5OR=1.07, 95% CI: 1.00, 1.14 andOR=1.09, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.19per 10-μg/m3increase, respectively) trajectories.

However, the biological functions of integrator complex subunit 8 (INTS8) in CHOL remain unknown. Thus, this research aimed to explore the potential role of INTS8 as a novel diagnostic or therapeutic target in CHOL. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in two Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets were obtained by the ""RRA"" package in R software. The ""maftools"" package was used to visualize the CHOL mutation data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. The expression of INTS8 was detected by performing quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry in cell lines and human samples. The association between subtypes of tumour-infiltrating immune cells (TIICs) and INTS8 expression in CHOL was determined by using CIBERSORT tools. We evaluated the correlations between INTS8 expression and mismatch repair (MMR) genes and DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) in pan-cancer analysis. Finally, the pan-cancer prognostic signature of INTS8 was identified by univariate analysis. We obtained the mutation landscapes of an RRA gene set in CHOL. The expression of INTS8 was upregulated in CHOL cell lines and human CHOL samples. Furthermore, INTS8 expression was closely associated with a distinct landscape of TIICs, MMR genes, and DNMTs in CHOL. In addition, the high INTS8 expression group presented significantly poor outcomes, including overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS) and disease-free interval (DFI) (p < 0.05) in pan-cancer. INTS8 contributes to the tumorigenesis and progression of CHOL.

The lncRNA MIR4435‑2HG was previously reported to act as an oncogene in human cancer, including liver cancer. However, its role in the pathogenesis in liver cancer is largely unclear. The present study aimed to reveal the molecular mechanism by which MIR4435‑2HG regulates liver cancer. The expression levels of MIR4435‑2HG in liver cancer and adjacent normal tissues were analyzed using The Cancer Genome Atlas database. MIR4435‑2HG expression was validated by reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‑qPCR) in cancer cells in vitro. The target genes of MIR4435‑2HG were predicted using bioinformatics analysis. Interactions between miR‑136‑5p, MIR4435‑2HG and B3GNT5 were detected using luciferase reporter assays, and their effects on cell viability, migration and invasion were assessed using Cell Counting Kit‑8, wound healing and Transwell assays. The effects of miR‑136‑5p and MIR4435‑2HG on B3GNT5 expression were confirmed by western blot analysis. The results revealed that MIR4435‑2HG expression was upregulated in primary liver cancer and liver cancer cell lines, and was positively associated with advanced tumor stage, metastasis and poor prognosis in patients with liver cancer. Knockdown of MIR4435‑2HG significantly inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion of liver cancer cells. Furthermore, miR‑136‑5p was determined to be a direct target of MIR4435‑2HG and suppressed MIR4435‑2HG expression by binding with the seed region of the 3'‑UTR of MIR4435‑2HG in liver cancer cells. Functional studies showed that the inhibitory effects of MIR4435‑2HG knockdown on cell proliferation, migration and invasion were significantly rescued by inhibiting miR‑136‑5p. Furthermore, the target gene, B3GNT5, of miR‑136‑5p was confirmed by bioinformatics analysis and RT‑qPCR. In addition, B3GNT5 expression was regulated by the MIR4435‑2HG/miR‑136‑5p axis. In conclusion, the present study indicated that MIR4435‑2HG facilitated the progression of liver cancer via the MIR4435‑2HG/miR‑136‑5p/B3GNT5 axis, which demonstrated that MIR4435‑2HG may be a potential biomarker for the prognosis and treatment of liver cancer."
"35039676","Immune targets for therapeutic development in depression: towards precision medicine.","Nat Rev Drug Discov","Over the past two decades, compelling evidence has emerged indicating that immune mechanisms can contribute to the pathogenesis of major depressive disorder (MDD) and that drugs with primary immune targets can improve depressive symptoms. Patients with MDD are heterogeneous with respect to symptoms, treatment responses and biological correlates. Defining a narrower patient group based on biology could increase the treatment response rates in certain subgroups: a major advance in clinical psychiatry. For example, patients with MDD and elevated pro-inflammatory biomarkers are less likely to respond to conventional antidepressant drugs, but novel immune-based therapeutics could potentially address their unmet clinical needs. This article outlines a framework for developing drugs targeting a novel patient subtype within MDD and reviews the current state of neuroimmune drug development for mood disorders. We discuss evidence for a causal role of immune mechanisms in the pathogenesis of depression, together with targets under investigation in randomized controlled trials, biomarker evidence elucidating the link to neural mechanisms, biological and phenotypic patient selection strategies, and the unmet clinical need among patients with MDD.© 2022.

Despite this, the cause of most ALS cases remains obscure. In this review, we describe the current evidence implicating genetic and environmental factors in motor neuron degeneration. While the risk exerted by many environmental factors may appear small, their effect could be magnified by the presence of a genetic predisposition. We postulate that gene-environment interactions account for at least a portion of the unknown etiology in ALS. Climate underlies multiple environmental factors, some of which have been implied in ALS etiology, and the impact of global temperature increase on the gene-environment interactions should be carefully monitored. We describe the main concepts underlying such interactions. Although a lack of large cohorts with detailed genetic and environmental information hampers the search for gene-environment interactions, newer algorithms and machine learning approaches offer an opportunity to break this stalemate.

These proteins share a similar domain consisting of tandem repeats approximately 42 amino acids in length, and this domain constitutes a substantial platform for the binding between ARMCs and other proteins. An ARMC subfamily, including ARMC1∼10, ARMC12, and ARMCX1∼6, has received increasing attention. These proteins may have many terminal regions and play a critical role in various diseases. On the one hand, based on their similar central domain of tandem repeats, this ARMC subfamily may function similarly to other ARMCs. On the other hand, the unique domains on their terminals may cause these proteins to have different functions. Here, we focus on the ARMC subfamily (ARMC1∼10, ARMC12, and ARMCX1∼6), which is relatively conserved in vertebrates and highly conserved in mammals, particularly primates. We review the structures, biological functions, evolutions, interactions, and related diseases of the ARMC subfamily, which involve more than 30 diseases and 40 bypasses, including interactions and relationships between more than 100 proteins and signaling molecules.

Previous work has indicated that transcription factors (TFs) play a role in regulating senescence. However, a systematic study of regulatory TFs during replicative senescence (RS) using multi-omics analysis is still lacking. Here, we generated time-resolved RNA-seq, reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) and ATAC-seq datasets during RS of mouse skin fibroblasts, which demonstrated that an enhanced inflammatory response and reduced proliferative capacity were the main characteristics of RS in both the transcriptome and epigenome. Through integrative analysis and genetic manipulations, we found that transcription factors E2F4, TEAD1 and AP-1 are key regulators of RS. Overexpression of E2f4 improved cellular proliferative capacity, attenuated SA-β-Gal activity and changed RS-associated differentially methylated sites (DMSs). Moreover, knockdown of Tead1 attenuated SA-β-Gal activity and partially altered the RS-associated transcriptome. In addition, knockdown of Atf3, one member of AP-1 superfamily TFs, reduced Cdkn2a (p16) expression in pre-senescent fibroblasts.

G-quadruplexes are four-stranded DNA secondary structures (G4s) that have been implicated in transcriptional regulation and cancer. Here, we show that G4s are key genomic structural features linked to cellular differentiation. We find that G4s are highly abundant in human embryonic stem cells and are lost during lineage specification. G4s are prevalent in enhancers and promoters. G4s that are found in common between embryonic and downstream lineages are tightly linked to transcriptional stabilisation of genes involved in essential cellular functions as well as transitions in the histone post-translational modification landscape. Furthermore, the application of small molecules that stabilise G4s causes a delay in stem cell differentiation, keeping cells in a more pluripotent-like state. Collectively, our data highlight G4s as important epigenetic features that are coupled to stem cell pluripotency and differentiation.© 2022. The Author(s)."

How countless partially overlapping but cell-type-specific patterns of gene expression are controlled at the genomic level remains poorly understood. Here we show that neuronal genes are associated with highly complex gene regulatory systems composed of independent cell-type- and cell-stage-specific regulatory elements that reside in expanded non-coding genomic domains. Mapping enhancer-promoter interactions revealed that motor neuron enhancers are broadly distributed across the large chromatin domains. This distributed regulatory architecture is not a unique property of motor neurons but is employed throughout the nervous system. The number of regulatory elements increased dramatically during the transition from invertebrates to vertebrates, suggesting that acquisition of new enhancers might be a fundamental process underlying the evolutionary increase in cellular complexity.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Trauma and PTSD represent potent exposures that may interact with genetic markers to influence brain structure and function. Genetic variants, associated with subcortical volumes in two large normative discovery samples, were used to compute polygenic scores (PGS) for the volume of seven subcortical structures. These were applied to a target sample enriched for childhood trauma and PTSD. Subcortical volume PGS from the discovery sample were strongly associated in our trauma/PTSD enriched sample (n = 7580) with respective subcortical volumes of the hippocampus (p = 1.10 × 10-20), thalamus (p = 7.46 × 10-10), caudate (p = 1.97 × 10-18), putamen (p = 1.7 × 10-12), and nucleus accumbens (p = 1.99 × 10-7). We found a significant association between the hippocampal volume PGS and hippocampal volume in control subjects from our sample, but was absent in individuals with PTSD (GxE; (beta = -0.10, p = 0.027)). This significant GxE (PGS × PTSD) relationship persisted (p < 1 × 10-19) in four out of five threshold peaks (0.024, 0.133, 0.487, 0.730, and 0.889) used to calculate hippocampal volume PGSs. We detected similar GxE (G × ChildTrauma) relationships in the amygdala for exposure to childhood trauma (rs4702973; p = 2.16 × 10-7) or PTSD (rs10861272; p = 1.78 × 10-6) in the CHST11 gene. The hippocampus and amygdala are pivotal brain structures in mediating PTSD symptomatology. Trauma exposure and PTSD modulate the effect of polygenic markers on hippocampal volume (GxE) and the amygdala volume PGS is associated with PTSD risk, which supports the role of amygdala volume as a risk factor for PTSD.© 2021.

However, the extent and pattern of pleiotropy among distinct psychiatric disorders remain not completely clear.We analyzed 14 psychiatric disorders using summary statistics available from the largest GWASs by far. We first applied the cross-trait linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC) to estimate genetic correlation between disorders. Then, we performed a gene-based pleiotropy analysis by first aggregating a set of SNP-level associations into a single gene-level association signal using MAGMA. From a methodological perspective, we viewed the identification of pleiotropic associations across the entire genome as a high-dimensional problem of composite null hypothesis testing and utilized a novel method called PLACO for pleiotropy mapping. We ultimately implemented functional analysis for identified pleiotropic genes and used Mendelian randomization for detecting causal association between these disorders.We confirmed extensive genetic correlation among psychiatric disorders, based on which these disorders can be grouped into three diverse categories. We detected a large number of pleiotropic genes including 5884 associations and 2424 unique genes and found that differentially expressed pleiotropic genes were significantly enriched in pancreas, liver, heart, and brain, and that the biological process of these genes was remarkably enriched in regulating neurodevelopment, neurogenesis, and neuron differentiation, offering substantial evidence supporting the validity of identified pleiotropic loci. We further demonstrated that among all the identified pleiotropic genes there were 342 unique ones linked with 6353 drugs with drug-gene interaction which can be classified into distinct types including inhibitor, agonist, blocker, antagonist, and modulator. We also revealed causal associations among psychiatric disorders, indicating that genetic overlap and causality commonly drove the observed co-existence of these disorders.Our study is among the first large-scale effort to characterize gene-level pleiotropy among a greatly expanded set of psychiatric disorders and provides important insight into shared genetic etiology underlying these disorders. The findings would inform psychiatric nosology, identify potential neurobiological mechanisms predisposing to specific clinical presentations, and pave the way to effective drug targets for clinical treatment.© 2021.

"34861174","Phenome risk classification enables phenotypic imputation and gene discovery in developmental stuttering.","Am J Hum Genet","Developmental stuttering is a speech disorder characterized by disruption in the forward movement of speech. This disruption includes part-word and single-syllable repetitions, prolongations, and involuntary tension that blocks syllables and words, and the disorder has a life-time prevalence of 6-12%. Within Vanderbilt's electronic health record (EHR)-linked biorepository (BioVU), only 142 individuals out of 92,762 participants (0.15%) are identified with diagnostic ICD9/10 codes, suggesting a large portion of people who stutter do not have a record of diagnosis within the EHR. To identify individuals affected by stuttering within our EHR, we built a PheCode-driven Gini impurity-based classification and regression tree model, PheML, by using comorbidities enriched in individuals affected by stuttering as predicting features and imputing stuttering status as the outcome variable. Applying PheML in BioVU identified 9,239 genotyped affected individuals (a clinical prevalence of ∼10%) for downstream genetic analysis. Ancestry-stratified GWAS of PheML-imputed affected individuals and matched control individuals identified rs12613255, a variant near CYRIA on chromosome 2 (B = 0.323; p value = 1.31 × 10-8) in European-ancestry analysis and rs7837758 (B = 0.518; p value = 5.07 × 10-8), an intronic variant found within the ZMAT4 gene on chromosome 8, in African-ancestry analysis. Polygenic-risk prediction and concordance analysis in an independent clinically ascertained sample of developmental stuttering cases validate our GWAS findings in PheML-imputed affected and control individuals and demonstrate the clinical relevance of our population-based analysis for stuttering risk.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

"34860306","Associations Between Traumatic Stress, Brain Volumes and Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms in Children: Data from the ABCD Study.","Behav Genet","Reduced volumes in brain regions of interest (ROIs), primarily from adult samples, are associated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We extended this work to children using data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study® (N = 11,848; Mage = 9.92). Structural equation modeling and an elastic-net (EN) machine-learning approach were used to identify potential effects of traumatic events (TEs) on PTSD symptoms (PTSDsx) directly, and indirectly via the volumes 300 subcortical and cortical ROIs. We then estimated the genetic and environmental variation in the phenotypes. TEs were directly associated with PTSDsx (r = 0.92) in children, but their indirect effects (r < 0.0004)-via the volumes of EN-identified subcortical and cortical ROIs-were negligible at this age. Additive genetic factors explained a modest proportion of the variance in TEs (23.4%) and PTSDsx (21.3%), and accounted for most of the variance of EN-identified volumes of four of the five subcortical (52.4-61.8%) three of the nine cortical ROIs (46.4-53.3%) and cerebral white matter in the left hemisphere (57.4%). Environmental factors explained most of the variance in TEs (C = 61.6%, E = 15.1%), PTSDsx (residual-C = 18.4%, residual-E = 21.8%), right lateral ventricle (C = 15.2%, E = 43.1%) and six of the nine EN-identified cortical ROIs (C = 4.0-13.6%, E = 56.7-74.8%). There is negligible evidence that the volumes of brain ROIs are associated with the indirect effects of TEs on PTSDsx at this age. Overall, environmental factors accounted for more of the variation in TEs and PTSDsx. Whereas additive genetic factors accounted for most of the variability in the volumes of a minority of cortical and in most of subcortical ROIs.© 2021. The Author(s)."

Methylated RNA immunoprecipitation with next-generation sequencing (MeRIP-seq) was used to analyze m6A methylation-associated transcripts in the NP, and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to detect the expression of methylation-related enzymes and conduct bio-informatics analysis.The standing mouse model caused IDD. Continuous axial pressure changed the expression of related methylases in degenerated NP tissue. Relative to the control group, the expression levels of KIAA1429, METTL14, METTL3, METTL4, WTAP, DGCR8, EIF3A and YTHDC1 in the experimental group were higher, while those of FTO, ELAVL1, HNRNPC1 and SRSF2 were lower. We identified 985 differentially expressed genes through MeRIP-Seq, among which 363 genes were significantly up-regulated, and 622 genes were significantly down-regulated. In addition, among the 9648 genes counted, 1319 m6A peaks with significant differences in methylation were identified, among which 933 were significantly up-regulated, and 386 were significantly down-regulated. Genes and pathways that were enriched in IDD have been identified.The results of this study elucidated the m6A methylation pattern of NP tissue in degenerated lumbar intervertebral disc of mice and provided new perspectives and clues for research on and the treatment of lumbar disc degeneration.As one of the important causes of low back and leg pain, intervertebral disc degeneration brings a huge economic burden to the society, family and medical system. Therefore, understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms of intervertebral disc degeneration is of great significance for guiding clinical treatment. In this study, methylated RNA immunoprecipitation with next-generation sequencing on mice lumbar nucleus pulposus tissues found that differentially expressed genes and changes in the expression of related methylases, confirming that RNA methylation is involved in intervertebral disc degeneration. The process provides new vision and clues for future research on intervertebral disc degeneration.© 2021 The Authors."
"34845273","Single cell imaging-based chromatin biomarkers for tumor progression.","Sci Rep","Tumour progression within the tissue microenvironment is accompanied by complex biomechanical alterations of the extracellular environment. While histopathology images provide robust biochemical markers for tumor progression in clinical settings, a quantitative single cell score using nuclear morphology and chromatin organization integrated with the long range mechanical coupling within the tumor microenvironment is missing. We propose that the spatial chromatin organization in individual nuclei characterises the cell state and their alterations during tumor progression. In this paper, we first built an image analysis pipeline and implemented it to classify nuclei from patient derived breast tissue biopsies of various cancer stages based on their nuclear and chromatin features. Replacing H&E with DNA binding dyes such as Hoescht stained tissue biopsies, we improved the classification accuracy. Using the nuclear morphology and chromatin organization features, we constructed a pseudo-time model to identify the chromatin state changes that occur during tumour progression. This enabled us to build a single-cell mechano-genomic score that characterises the cell state during tumor progression from a normal to a metastatic state. To gain further insights into the alterations in the local tissue microenvironments, we also used the nuclear orientations to identify spatial neighbourhoods that have been posited to drive tumor progression. Collectively, we demonstrate that image-based single cell chromatin and nuclear features are important single cell biomarkers for phenotypic mapping of tumor progression.© 2021. The Author(s)."
"35018201","TOXGB: Teamwork Optimization Based XGBoost model for early identification of post-traumatic stress disorder.","Cogn Neurodyn","Post-traumatic stress (PTSD) is considered a clinical issue that influences numerous people from diverse trades all over the world. Numerous research scholars recorded diverse complexities to estimate the severity of the PTSD symptoms in the patients. But diagnosing PTSD and obtaining accurate diagnosing techniques becomes a more complicated task. Therefore, this paper develops a speech based post-traumatic stress disorder monitoring method and the significant objective of the proposed method is to determine if the patients are affected by PTSD. The proposed approach utilizes three different steps: pre-processing or pre-emphasis, feature extraction as well as classification to evaluate the patients affected by PTSD or not. The input speech signal is initially provided to the pre-processing phase where the speech gets segmented into frames. The speech frame is then extracted and classified using XGBoost based Teamwork optimization (XGB-TWO) algorithm. In addition to this, we utilized two different types of datasets namely TIMIT and FEMH to evaluate and classify the PSTD from the speech signals. Furthermore, based on the evaluation of the proposed model to diagnose PTSD patients, various evaluation metrics namely accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and recall are evaluated. Finally, the experimental investigation and comparative analysis are carried out and the evaluation results demonstrated that the accuracy rate achieved for the proposed technique is 98.25%.© The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2022."
"34930307","Detecting prognostic biomarkers of breast cancer by regularized Cox proportional hazards models.","J Transl Med","The successful identification of breast cancer (BRCA) prognostic biomarkers is essential for the strategic interference of BRCA patients. Recently, various methods have been proposed for exploring a small prognostic gene set that can distinguish the high-risk group from the low-risk group.Regularized Cox proportional hazards (RCPH) models were proposed to discover prognostic biomarkers of BRCA from gene expression data. Firstly, the maximum connected network with 1142 genes by mapping 956 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 677 previously BRCA-related genes into the gene regulatory network (GRN) was constructed. Then, the 72 union genes of the four feature gene sets identified by Lasso-RCPH, Enet-RCPH, [Formula: see text]-RCPH and SCAD-RCPH models were recognized as the robust prognostic biomarkers. These biomarkers were validated by literature checks, BRCA-specific GRN and functional enrichment analysis. Finally, an index of prognostic risk score (PRS) for BRCA was established based on univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis. Survival analysis was performed to investigate the PRS on 1080 BRCA patients from the internal validation. Particularly, the nomogram was constructed to express the relationship between PRS and other clinical information on the discovery dataset. The PRS was also verified on 1848 BRCA patients of ten external validation datasets or collected cohorts.The nomogram highlighted that the importance of PRS in guiding significance for the prognosis of BRCA patients. In addition, the PRS of 301 normal samples and 306 tumor samples from five independent datasets showed that it is significantly higher in tumors than in normal tissues ([Formula: see text]). The protein expression profiles of the three genes, i.e., ADRB1, SAV1 and TSPAN14, involved in the PRS model demonstrated that the latter two genes are more strongly stained in tumor specimens. More importantly, external validation illustrated that the high-risk group has worse survival than the low-risk group ([Formula: see text]) in both internal and external validations.The proposed pipelines of detecting and validating prognostic biomarker genes for BRCA are effective and efficient. Moreover, the proposed PRS is very promising as an important indicator for judging the prognosis of BRCA patients.© 2021. The Author(s)."
"35036125","A novel machine learning derived RNA-binding protein gene-based score system predicts prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma patients.","PeerJ","Although the expression of RNA-binding protein (RBP) genes in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) varies and is associated with tumor progression, there has been no overview study with multiple cohorts and large samples. The HCC-associated RBP genes need to be more accurately identified, and their clinical application value needs to be further explored.First, we used the robust rank aggregation (RRA) algorithm to extract HCC-associated RBP genes from nine HCC microarray datasets and verified them in The Cancer Genome Atlas Liver Hepatocellular Carcinoma (TCGA-LIHC) cohort and International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) Japanese liver cancer (ICGC-LIRI-JP) cohort. In addition, the copy number variation (CNV), single-nucleotide variant (SNV), and promoter-region methylation data of HCC-associated RBP genes were analyzed. Using the random forest algorithm, we constructed an RBP gene-based prognostic score system (RBP-score). We then evaluated the ability of RBP-score to predict the prognosis of patients. The relationships between RBP-score and other clinical characteristics of patients were analyzed.The RRA algorithm identified 30 RBP mRNAs with consistent expression patterns across the nine HCC microarray datasets. These 30 RBP genes were defined as HCC-associated RBP genes. Their mRNA expression patterns were further verified in the TCGA-LIHC and ICGC-LIRI-JP cohorts. Among these 30 RBP genes, some showed significant copy number gain or loss, while others showed differences in the methylation levels of their promoter regions. Some RBP genes were risk factors or protective factors for the prognosis of patients. We extracted 10 key HCC-associated RBP genes using the random forest algorithm and constructed an RBP-score system. RBP-score effectively predicted the overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) of HCC patients and was associated with the tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) stage, α-fetoprotein (AFP), and metastasis risk. The clinical value of RBP-score was validated in datasets from different platforms. Cox analysis suggested that a high RBP-score was an independent risk factor for poor prognosis in HCC patients. We also successfully established a combined RBP-score+TNM LASSO-Cox model that more accurately predicted the prognosis.The RBP-score system constructed based on HCC-associated RBP genes is a simple and highly effective prognostic evaluation tool. It is suitable for different subgroups of HCC patients and has cross-platform characteristics. Combining RBP-score with the TNM staging system or other clinical parameters can lead to an even greater clinical benefit. In addition, the identified HCC-associated RBP genes may serve as novel targets for HCC treatment.© 2021 Zhang et al."

Nevertheless, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Recent studies indicate that the methylation state of circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is different between cancer patients and healthy individuals. Therefore, we speculate that abnormal expression of miRNA may be associated with cfDNA methylation.A green fluorescent protein (GFP) labeled B-ALL transplantation animal model was established to explore the relationship between the miRNA expression and cfDNA methylation of the related gene. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to detect the expression levels of miRNAs. Further, cfDNA methylation levels of the related genes were evaluated through bisulfite sequencing polymerase chain reaction (BSP).The expression levels of miR-196b, miR-203, miR-34a-5p, miR-335-3p, miR-34b-5p, miR-615, miR-375-3p and miR-193b-5p in the serum of the model mice were significantly lower than those of the control group (P < 0.05). The methylation level of miR-196b promoter in cfDNA of the model group was significantly lower than that of the control group (P < 0.05), whereas no significant difference was noted in miR-203 promoter. The methylation levels of miR-196b and miR-203 coding region in cfDNA of the model group were significantly higher than those of the control group (P < 0.05).These results showed that CpG island hypermethylation in the miRNA coding region of cfDNA is related to the low expression of miR-196b and miR-203.© 2021.

"34976191","Hypermethylation of mitochondrial DNA facilitates bone metastasis of renal cell carcinoma.","J Cancer","Kidney cancers including clear cell carcinoma (RCC) are identified with very vulnerable mitochondria DNA (mtDNA) and frequent epigenetic aberrations. Bone metastasis from RCC is prevalent and destructive. Bone marrow contains a quite hypoxic microenvironment that usually insitigate 50% of hypermethylation events in conferring a selective advantage for tumor growth. We hypothesized that hypermethylation of mtDNA in RCC cells would significantly contribute to bone metastatic tumor progression. Methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction assay (MSP) was adopted to measure the methylation status of D-loop region of mtDNA in 15 pairs of bone metastatic and primary RCC as well as tumor adjescent normal kidney tissues. mtDNA copy number was examined by the real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Western blotting analysis was used to measure the accumulation of several DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) in the mitochondria and nucleus fractions of bone metastatic RCC cells. mRNA expression of mitochondria encoded genes was examined by RT-PCR. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP content were measured usingin vitrocells treated with de-methylation drug 5-Azacytidine (5-Aza). Non-invasive bioluminescent imaging was performed to monitor tumor occurrence in skeleton in mice. Our results showed that the D-loop region in bone metastatic tumor cells was markedly hypermethylated than those in primary RCC tumor cells, that is associated with a decreased mtDNA copy number and accumulation of DNMT1 in the mitochondria. The bone-tropism tumor colonization and progression of RCC cells was significantly suppressed by demethylating the D-loop region of mtDNA and reducing the intracellular level of ROS and ATP by 5-Aza treatment. In conclusion, our study provided a direct association between hypermethylation of mtDNA in RCC with bone metastastic tumor growth.© The author(s)."
"34944052","Cytosolic Self-DNA-A Potential Source of Chronic Inflammation in Aging.","Cells","Aging is the consequence of a lifelong accumulation of stochastic damage to tissues and cellular components. Advancing age closely associates with elevated markers of innate immunity and low-grade chronic inflammation, probably reflecting steady increasing incidents of cellular and tissue damage over the life course. The DNA sensing cGAS-STING signaling pathway is activated by misplaced cytosolic self-DNA, which then initiates the innate immune responses. Here, we hypothesize that the stochastic release of various forms of DNA from the nucleus and mitochondria, e.g., because of DNA damage, altered nucleus integrity, and mitochondrial damage, can result in chronic activation of inflammatory responses that characterize the aging process. This cytosolic self-DNA-innate immunity axis may perturb tissue homeostasis and function that characterizes human aging and age-associated pathology. Proper techniques and experimental models are available to investigate this axis to develop therapeutic interventions."
"34850108","Assessing genome-wide dynamic changes in enhancer activity during early mESC differentiation by FAIRE-STARR-seq.","Nucleic Acids Res","Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) can differentiate into any given cell type and therefore represent a versatile model to study the link between gene regulation and differentiation. To quantitatively assess the dynamics of enhancer activity during the early stages of murine ESC differentiation, we analyzed accessible genomic regions using STARR-seq, a massively parallel reporter assay. This resulted in a genome-wide quantitative map of active mESC enhancers, in pluripotency and during the early stages of differentiation. We find that only a minority of accessible regions is active and that such regions are enriched near promoters, characterized by specific chromatin marks, enriched for distinct sequence motifs, and modeling shows that active regions can be predicted from sequence alone. Regions that change their activity upon retinoic acid-induced differentiation are more prevalent at distal intergenic regions when compared to constitutively active enhancers. Further, analysis of differentially active enhancers verified the contribution of individual TF motifs toward activity and inducibility as well as their role in regulating endogenous genes. Notably, the activity of retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARα) occupied regions can either increase or decrease upon the addition of its ligand, retinoic acid, with the direction of the change correlating with spacing and orientation of the RARα consensus motif and the co-occurrence of additional sequence motifs. Together, our genome-wide enhancer activity map elucidates features associated with enhancer activity levels, identifies regulatory regions disregarded by computational prediction tools, and provides a resource for future studies into regulatory elements in mESCs.© The Author(s) 2021.

Little is known regarding this association, limiting appropriate diagnosis and management. We aimed to describe the characteristics of bipolar patients with late cognitive impairment for whom the hypothesis of an underlying neurodegenerative disease had been raised. We performed a retrospective multicenter study, recruiting bipolar patients over 50 years old from five French tertiary memory centers who had undergone cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker assessment for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Clinical, neuropsychological, and paraclinical characteristics were analyzed and 78 patients were included. The mean age at the onset of cognitive impairment was 62.4 years (±9.2). The mean MMSE score was 22.8 (±4.5), the mean FAB was 11.7 (±3.9), and the mean FCRST was 15.8 (±7.4)/36.8 (±9.7) (free/total recall). A total of 48.6% of the patients displayed cognitive fluctuations, and 38.2% showed cognitive improvement during follow-ups; and 56.3% of the patients showed Parkinsonism, of which 12.7% had never received antipsychotics. Among patients who underwent DAT-scans, 35.3% displayed dopaminergic denervation; 10.3% of patients had CSF AD biological signature (""A+ T+"" profile), while 56.4% had other abnormal CSF profiles. Thus, clinical presentation was dominated by executive dysfunction, episodic memory impairment, fluctuating cognition, and a high frequency of Parkinsonism. Specifically, high frequency of delusional episodes suggests limited tolerance of psychotropic drugs. Most patients had abnormal CSF biomarker profiles, but only a minority displayed AD's specific biomarker signature. Therefore, while our results unveil shared common neurocognitive features in bipolar patients with cognitive impairment of suspected neurodegenerative origin they suggest a participation of various underlying pathologies rather than a common degenerative mechanism in the pathophysiology of this condition."

However, controversial results have also been reported. In addition, the relationship between accelerated aging and treatment-resistance has scarcely been investigated. In the current study, we measured leukocyte telomere length (LTL) in 148 patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD, 125 with major depressive disorder, MDD, and 23 with bipolar disorder, BD) treated with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and analyzed whether LTL was associated with different response profiles. We also compared LTL between patients with TRD and 335 non-psychiatric controls. For 107 patients for which genome-wide association data were available, we evaluated whether a significant overlap among genetic variants or genes associated with LTL and with response to ECT could be observed. LTL was negatively correlated with age (Spearman's correlation coefficient = -0.25,p< 0.0001) and significantly shorter in patients with treatment-resistant MDD (Quade's F = 35.18,p< 0.0001) or BD (Quade's F = 20.84,p< 0.0001) compared to controls. Conversely, baseline LTL was not associated with response to ECT or remission. We did not detect any significant overlap between genetic variants or genes associated with LTL and response to ECT. Our results support previous findings suggesting premature cell senescence in patients with severe psychiatric disorders and suggest that LTL could not be a predictive biomarker of response to ECT."

AD characterized by metabolic disturbances can be quantitatively analyzed by metabolomics to identify the alterations in metabolic pathways. This study aimed to: i) compare the plasma metabolic profiling between healthy and AD-diagnosed individuals to reveal the altered metabolic profiles in AD, and ii) identify potential biological correlates of alcohol-dependent inpatients based on metabolomics and interpretable machine learning. Plasma samples were obtained from healthy (n= 42) and AD-diagnosed individuals (n= 43). The plasma metabolic differences between them were investigated using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (AB SCIEX®QTRAP 4500 system) in different electrospray ionization modes with scheduled multiple reaction monitoring scans. In total, 59 and 52 compounds were semi-quantitatively measured in positive and negative ionization modes, respectively. In addition, 39 metabolites were identified as important variables to contribute to the classifications using an orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) (VIP > 1) and also significantly different between healthy and AD-diagnosed individuals using univariate analysis (p-value < 0.05 and false discovery rate < 0.05). Among the identified metabolites, indole-3-carboxylic acid, quinolinic acid, hydroxy-tryptophan, and serotonin were involved in the tryptophan metabolism along the indole, kynurenine, and serotonin pathways. Metabolic pathway analysis revealed significant changes or imbalances in alanine, aspartate, glutamate metabolism, which was possibly the main altered pathway related to AD. Tryptophan metabolism interactively influenced other metabolic pathways, such as nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism. Furthermore, among the OPLS-DA-identified metabolites, normetanephrine and ascorbic acid were demonstrated as suitable biological correlates of AD inpatients from our model using an interpretable, supervised decision tree classifier algorithm. These findings indicate that the discriminatory metabolic profiles between healthy and AD-diagnosed individuals may benefit researchers in illustrating the underlying molecular mechanisms of AD. This study also highlights the approach of combining metabolomics and interpretable machine learning as a valuable tool to uncover potential biological correlates. Future studies should focus on the global analysis of the possible roles of these differential metabolites and disordered metabolic pathways in the pathophysiology of AD.Copyright © 2021 Zhu, Huang, Huang, Wen, Lan, Wang, Lu, Wang, Fan and Shang."

However, TE activities in osteosarcoma (OS) have not been extensively studied yet. By integrative analysis of RNA-seq, whole-genome sequencing (WGS), and methylation data, we showed aberrant TE activities associated with dysregulations of TEs in OS tumors. Specifically, expression levels of LINE-1 and Alu of different evolutionary ages, as well as subfamilies of SVA and HERV-K, were significantly up-regulated in OS tumors, accompanied by enhanced DNA repair responses. We verified the characteristics of LINE-1 mediated TE insertions, including target site duplication (TSD) length (centered around 15 bp) and preferential insertions into intergenic and AT-rich regions as well as intronic regions of longer genes. By filtering polymorphic TE insertions reported in 1000 genome project (1KGP), besides 148 tumor-specific somatic TE insertions, we found most OS patient-specific TE insertions (3175 out of 3326) are germline insertions, which are associated with genes involved in neuronal processes or with transcription factors important for cancer development. In addition to 68 TE-affected cancer genes, we found recurrent germline TE insertions in 72 non-cancer genes with high frequencies among patients. We also found that +/- 500 bps flanking regions of transcription start sites (TSS) of LINE-1 (young) and Alu showed lower methylation levels in OS tumor samples than controls. Interestingly, by incorporating patient clinical data and focusing on TE activities in OS tumors, our data analysis suggested that higher TE insertions in OS tumors are associated with a longer event-free survival time.© 2022.

"34968365","Can Immune Suppression and Epigenome Regulation in Placenta Offer Novel Insights into Cancer Immune Evasion and Immunotherapy Resistance?","Epigenomes","Cancer is the second leading cause of mortality and morbidity in the developed world. Cancer progression involves genetic and epigenetic alterations, accompanied by aggressive changes, such as increased immune evasion, onset of metastasis, and drug resistance. Similar to cancer, DNA hypomethylation, immune suppression, and invasive cell behaviours are also observed in the human placenta. Mechanisms that lead to the acquisition of invasive behaviour, immune evasion, and drug and immunotherapy resistance are presently under intense investigations to improve patient outcomes. Here, we review current knowledge regarding the similarities between immune suppression and epigenome regulation, including the expression of repetitive elements (REs), endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) and transposable elements (TEs) in cells of the placenta and in cancer, which are associated with changes in immune regulation and invasiveness. We explore whether immune suppression and epigenome regulation in placenta offers novel insights into immunotherapy resistance in cancer, and we also discuss the implications and the knowledge gaps relevant to these findings, which are rapidly being accrued in these quite disparate research fields. Finally, we discuss potential linkages between TE, ERV and RE activation and expression, regarding mechanisms of immune regulation in placenta and cancer. A greater understanding of the role of immune suppression and associated epigenome regulation in placenta could help to elucidate some comparable mechanisms operating in cancer, and identify potential new therapeutic targets for treating cancer."

We investigated two potential roles for ERVs in prostate cancer (PCa). First, the PCa of Black Americans (BA) is diagnosed at an earlier median age and at a more advanced stage than the PCa of White Americans (WA). We used publicly available RNA-seq data from tumor-enriched samples of 27 BA and 65 WA PCa patients in order to identify 12 differentially expressed ERVs (padj< 0.1) and used a tissue microarray of the PCa cores from an independent set of BA and WA patients to validate the differential protein expression of one of these ERVs, ERV3-1 (p= 2.829 × 10-7). Second, we used 57 PCa tumors from patients of all ancestries from one hospital as a training set to identify the ERVs associated with time to biochemical relapse. A 29-ERV prognostic panel was then tested and validated on 35 separate PCa tumors from patients obtained in two different hospitals with a dramatic increase in prognostic power relative to clinical parameters alone (p= 7.4 × 10-11). In summary, ERV RNA expression differences in the prostate tumors of patients of different ancestries may be associated with dissimilarities in the mechanism of cancer progression. In addition, the correlation of expression of certain ERVs in prostate tumors with the risk of biochemical relapse indicates a possible role for ERV expression in cancer progression."
"34925363","Antiviral Responses in Cancer: Boosting Antitumor Immunity Through Activation of Interferon Pathway in the Tumor Microenvironment.","Front Immunol","In recent years, it became apparent that cancers either associated with viral infections or aberrantly expressing endogenous retroviral elements (EREs) are more immunogenic, exhibiting an intense intra-tumor immune cell infiltration characterized by a robust cytolytic apparatus. On the other hand, epigenetic regulation of EREs is crucial to maintain steady-state conditions and cell homeostasis. In line with this, epigenetic disruptions within steady-state cells can lead to cancer development and trigger the release of EREs into the cytoplasmic compartment. As such, detection of viral molecules by intracellular innate immune sensors leads to the production of type I and type III interferons that act to induce an antiviral state, thus restraining viral replication. This knowledge has recently gained momentum due to the possibility of triggering intratumoral activation of interferon responses, which could be used as an adjuvant to elicit strong anti-tumor immune responses that ultimately lead to a cascade of cytokine production. Accordingly, several therapeutic approaches are currently being tested using this rationale to improve responses to cancer immunotherapies. In this review, we discuss the immune mechanisms operating in viral infections, show evidence that exogenous viruses and endogenous retroviruses in cancer may enhance tumor immunogenicity, dissect the epigenetic control of EREs, and point to interferon pathway activation in the tumor milieu as a promising molecular predictive marker and immunotherapy target.

But currently, there are no recognized standard biomarkers to assess SCI levels alone, and SCI is typically measured by combining biomarkers of acute inflammation and infection, e.g., CRP, IL-6, and TNFα. In this review, we highlight 10 properties and characteristics that are shared by the blood proteinsoluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor(suPAR) and SCI, supporting the argument that suPAR is a biomarker of SCI: (1) Expression and release of suPAR is upregulated by immune activation; (2) uPAR and suPAR exert pro-inflammatory functions; (3) suPAR is associated with the amount of circulating immune cells; (4) Blood suPAR levels correlate with the levels of established inflammatory biomarkers; (5) suPAR is minimally affected by acute changes and short-term influences, in contrast to many currently used markers of systemic inflammation; (6) Like SCI, suPAR is non-specifically associated with multiple diseases; (7) suPAR and SCI both predict morbidity and mortality; (8) suPAR and SCI share the same risk factors; (9) suPAR is associated with risk factors and outcomes of inflammation above and beyond other inflammatory biomarkers; (10) The suPAR level can be reduced by anti-inflammatory interventions and treatment of disease. Assessing SCI has the potential to inform risk for morbidity and mortality. Blood suPAR is a newer biomarker which may, in fact, be a biomarker of SCI since it is stably associated with inflammation and immune activation; shares the same risk factors as many age-related diseases; is both elevated by and predicts age-related diseases. There is strong evidence that suPAR is a prognostic marker of adverse events, morbidity, and mortality. It is associated with immune activity and prognosis across diverse conditions, including kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, and inflammatory disorders. Thus, we think it likely represents a common underlying disease-process shared by many diseases; that is, SCI. We review the supporting literature and propose a research agenda that can help test the hypothesis that suPAR indexes SCI, with the potential of becoming the new gold standard for measuring SCI.Copyright © 2021 Rasmussen, Petersen and Eugen-Olsen."
"34899540","Immune and Epigenetic Pathways Linking Childhood Adversity and Health Across the Lifespan.","Front Psychol","Childhood adversity is associated with a host of mental and physical health problems across the lifespan. Individuals who have experienced childhood adversity (e.g., child abuse and neglect, family conflict, poor parent/child relationships, low socioeconomic status or extreme poverty) are at a greater risk for morbidity and premature mortality than those not exposed to childhood adversity. Several mechanisms likely contribute to the relationship between childhood adversity and health across the lifespan (e.g., health behaviors, cardiovascular reactivity). In this paper, we review a large body of research within the field of psychoneuroimmunology, demonstrating the relationship between early life stress and alterations of the immune system. We first review the literature demonstrating that childhood adversity is associated with immune dysregulation across different indices, including proinflammatory cytokine production (and its impact on telomere length), illness and infection susceptibility, latent herpesvirus reactivation, and immune response to a tumor. We then summarize the growing literature on how childhood adversity may alter epigenetic processes. Finally, we propose future directions related to this work that have basic and applied implications.Copyright © 2021 Chen, LeRoy, Majd, Chen, Brown, Christian and Fagundes."

Recent studies have reported an association between ZFHX3/PRRX1 polymorphisms and AF. In this study, a meta-analysis was conducted to confirm these associations.Objective and Methods. The PubMed, Embase, and Wanfang databases were searched, covering all publications before July 20, 2020.Overall, seven articles including 3,674 cases and 8,990 healthy controls for ZFHX3 rs2106261 and 1045 cases and 1407 controls for PRRX1 rs3903239 were included. The odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence interval (CI)) was used to assess the associations. Publication bias was calculated using Egger's and Begg's tests. We found that the ZFHX3 rs2106261 polymorphism increased AF risk in Asians (for example, allelic contrast: OR [95% CI]: 1.39 [1.31-1.47],P< 0.001). Similarly, strong associations were detected through stratified analysis using source of control and genotype methods (for example, allelic contrast: OR [95% CI]: 1.51 [1.38-1.64],P< 0.001 for HB; OR [95% CI]: 1.31 [1.21-1.41],P< 0.001 for PB; OR [95% CI]: 1.55 [1.33-1.80],P< 0.001 for TaqMan; and OR [95% CI]: 1.31 [1.21-1.41],P< 0.001 for high-resolution melt). In contrast, an inverse relationship was observed between the PRRX1 rs3903239 polymorphism and AF risk (C-allelevs.T-allele: OR [95% CI]: 0.83 [0.77-0.99],P=0.036; CTvs.TT: OR [95% CI]: 0.79 [0.67-0.94],P=0.006). No obvious evidence of publication bias was observed.In summary, our study suggests that the ZFHX3 rs2106261 and PRRX1 rs3903239 polymorphisms are associated with AF risk, and larger case-controls must be carried out to confirm the abovementioned conclusions.Copyright © 2021 Liting Wu et al."

They can present as pure or complex forms with all classical modes of monogenic inheritance reported. To date, there are more than 100 loci/88 spastic paraplegia genes (SPG) involved in the pathogenesis of HSP. New patterns of inheritance are being increasingly identified in this era of huge advances in genetic and functional studies. A wide range of clinical symptoms and signs are now reported to complicate HSP with increasing overall complexity of the clinical presentations considered as HSP. This is especially true with the emergence of multiple HSP phenotypes that are situated in the borderline zone with other neurogenetic disorders. The genetic diagnostic approaches and the utilized techniques leave a diagnostic gap of 25% in the best studies. In this review, we summarize the known types of HSP with special focus on those in which spasticity is the principal clinical phenotype (""SPGn"" designation). We discuss their modes of inheritance, clinical phenotypes, underlying genetics, and molecular pathways, providing some observations about therapeutic opportunities gained from animal models and functional studies. This review may pave the way for more analytic approaches that take into consideration the overall picture of HSP. It will shed light on subtle associations that can explain the occurrence of the disease and allow a better understanding of its observed variations. This should help in the identification of future biomarkers, predictors of disease onset and progression, and treatments for both better functional outcomes and quality of life.Copyright © 2021 Elsayed, Eltazi, Ahmed and Stevanin."
"34898591","Screening for Colorectal Cancer Leading into a New Decade: The ""Roaring '20s"" for Epigenetic Biomarkers?","Curr Oncol","Colorectal cancer (CRC) has an important bearing (top five) on cancer incidence and mortality in the world. The etiology of sporadic CRC is related to the accumulation of genetic and epigenetic alterations that result in the appearance of cancer hallmarks such as abnormal proliferation, evasion of immune destruction, resistance to apoptosis, replicative immortality, and others, contributing to cancer promotion, invasion, and metastasis. It is estimated that, each year, at least four million people are diagnosed with CRC in the world. Depending on CRC staging at diagnosis, many of these patients die, as CRC is in the top four causes of cancer death in the world. New and improved screening tests for CRC are needed to detect the disease at an early stage and adopt patient management strategies to decrease the death toll. The three pillars of CRC screening are endoscopy, radiological imaging, and molecular assays. Endoscopic procedures comprise traditional colonoscopy, and more recently, capsule-based endoscopy. The main imaging modality remains Computed Tomography (CT) of the colon. Molecular approaches continue to grow in the diversity of biomarkers and the sophistication of the technologies deployed to detect them. What started with simple fecal occult blood tests has expanded to an armamentarium, including mutation detection and identification of aberrant epigenetic signatures known to be oncogenic. Biomarker-based screening methods have critical advantages and are likely to eclipse the classical modalities of imaging and endoscopy in the future. For example, imaging methods are costly and require highly specialized medical personnel. In the case of endoscopy, their invasiveness limits compliance from large swaths of the population, especially those with average CRC risk. Beyond mere discomfort and fear, there are legitimate iatrogenic concerns associated with endoscopy. The risks of perforation and infection make endoscopy best suited for a confirmatory role in cases where there are positive results from other diagnostic tests. Biomarker-based screening methods are largely non-invasive and are growing in scope. Epigenetic biomarkers, in particular, can be detected in feces and blood, are less invasive to the average-risk patient, detect early-stage CRC, and have a demonstrably superior patient follow-up. Given the heterogeneity of CRC as it evolves, optimal screening may require a battery of blood and stool tests, where each can leverage different pathways perturbed during carcinogenesis. What follows is a comprehensive, systematic review of the literature pertaining to the screening and diagnostic protocols used in CRC. Relevant articles were retrieved from the PubMed database using keywords including: ""Screening"", ""Diagnosis"", and ""Biomarkers for CRC"". American and European clinical trials in progress were included as well."
"35008708","Fundamental Clock of Biological Aging: Convergence of Molecular, Neurodegenerative, Cognitive and Psychiatric Pathways: Non-Equilibrium Thermodynamics Meet Psychology.","Int J Mol Sci","In humans, age-associated degrading changes, widely observed in molecular and cellular processes underly the time-dependent decline in spatial navigation, time perception, cognitive and psychological abilities, and memory. Cross-talk of biological, cognitive, and psychological clocks provides an integrative contribution to healthy and advanced aging. At the molecular level, genome, proteome, and lipidome instability are widely recognized as the primary causal factors in aging. We narrow attention to the roles of protein aging linked to prevalent amino acids chirality, enzymatic and spontaneous (non-enzymatic) post-translational modifications (PTMsSP), and non-equilibrium phase transitions. The homochirality of protein synthesis, resulting in the steady-state non-equilibrium condition of protein structure, makes them prone to multiple types of enzymatic and spontaneous PTMs, including racemization and isomerization. Spontaneous racemization leads to the loss of the balanced prevalent chirality. Advanced biological aging related to irreversible PTMsSPhas been associated with the nontrivial interplay between somatic (molecular aging) and mental (psychological aging) health conditions. Through stress response systems (SRS), the environmental and psychological stressors contribute to the age-associated ""collapse"" of protein homochirality. The role of prevalent protein chirality and entropy of protein folding in biological aging is mainly overlooked. In a more generalized context, the time-dependent shift from enzymatic to the non-enzymatic transformation of biochirality might represent an important and yet underappreciated hallmark of aging. We provide the experimental arguments in support of the racemization theory of aging."

Given the effects of age and mood on cognitive performance, it was hypothesized that using such data a model could be built to predict chronological age and that differences between predicted age and actual age could be a marker of pathology.Methods:These data were collected via the ongoing BiAffect study. Participants complete the Mood Disorders Questionnaire (MDQ), a screening questionnaire for bipolar disorder, and self-reported their birth year. Data were split into training and validation sets. Features derived from the smartphone kinematics were used to train random forest regression models to predict age. Prediction errors were compared between participants screening positive and negative on the MDQ.Results:Three hundred forty-four participants had analyzable data of which 227 had positive screens for bipolar disorder and 117 had negative screens. The absolute prediction error tended to be lower for participants with positive screens (median 4.50 years) than those with negative screens (median 7.92 years) (W= 508,p= 0.0049). The raw prediction error tended to be lower for participants with negative screens (median = -5.95 years) than those with positive screens (median = 0.55 years) (W= 1,037,p= 0.037).Conclusions:The tendency to underestimate the chronological age of participants screening negative for bipolar disorder compared to those screening positive is consistent with the finding that bipolar disorder may be associated with brain changes that could reflect pathological aging. This interesting result could also reflect that those who screen negative for bipolar disorder and who engaged in the study were more likely to have higher premorbid functioning.

Despite this, the mitochondrial molecular cascades promoting age-dependent synaptic demise remain to be elucidated. Here, we sought to examine how the synaptic mitochondrial proteome (including strongly mitochondrial associated proteins) was dynamically and temporally regulated throughout ageing to determine whether alterations in the expression of individual candidates can influence synaptic stability/morphology. Proteomic profiling of wild-type mouse cortical synaptic and non-synaptic mitochondria across the lifespan revealed significant age-dependent heterogeneity between mitochondrial subpopulations, with aged organelles exhibiting unique protein expression profiles. Recapitulation of aged synaptic mitochondrial protein expression at theDrosophilaneuromuscular junction has the propensity to perturb the synaptic architecture, demonstrating that temporal regulation of the mitochondrial proteome may directly modulate the stability of the synapse in vivo."
"35000600","The landscape of human tissue and cell type specific expression and co-regulation of senescence genes.","Mol Neurodegener","Cellular senescence is a complex stress response that impacts cellular function and organismal health. Multiple developmental and environmental factors, such as intrinsic cellular cues, radiation, oxidative stress, oncogenes, and protein accumulation, activate genes and pathways that can lead to senescence. Enormous efforts have been made to identify and characterize senescence genes (SnGs) in stress and disease systems. However, the prevalence of senescent cells in healthy human tissues and the global SnG expression signature in different cell types are poorly understood.This study performed an integrative gene network analysis of bulk and single-cell RNA-seq data in non-diseased human tissues to investigate SnG co-expression signatures and their cell-type specificity.Through a comprehensive transcriptomic network analysis of 50 human tissues in the Genotype-Tissue Expression Project (GTEx) cohort, we identified SnG-enriched gene modules, characterized SnG co-expression patterns, and constructed aggregated SnG networks across primary tissues of the human body. Our network approaches identified 51 SnGs highly conserved across the human tissues, including CDKN1A (p21)-centered regulators that control cell cycle progression and the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). The SnG-enriched modules showed remarkable cell-type specificity, especially in fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and immune cells. Further analyses of single-cell RNA-seq and spatial transcriptomic data independently validated the cell-type specific SnG signatures predicted by the network analysis.This study systematically revealed the co-regulated organizations and cell type specificity of SnGs in major human tissues, which can serve as a blueprint for future studies to map senescent cells and their cellular interactions in human tissues.© 2021.

"34956130","Taxonomy and Functional Diversity in the Fecal Microbiome of Beef Cattle Reared in Brazilian Traditional and Semi-Intensive Production Systems.","Front Microbiol","The importance of beef production for economy of Brazil and the growing demand for animal protein across the globe warrant an improvement in the beef production system. Although most attention has been on modulation of the rumen microbiome to improve ruminant production, the role of the lower gut microbiome in host health and nutrition remains relatively unexplored. This work aimed to investigate the taxonomy and functional variations in the fecal microbiome of Brazilian beef cattle reared in two different production systems using a metagenomic approach. Sixty male beef cattle from six farms representing semi-intensive (I,n= 2) and traditional (T,n= 4) Brazilian beef production systems were enrolled in the study. Shotgun sequencing was used to characterize taxonomic and functional composition and diversity of the microbiome in fecal samples collected from each animal. Fecal samples were analyzed for copper (Cu), lead (Pb), nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P), selenium (Se), and zinc (Zn) and stable isotopes of carbon (13C) and nitrogen (15N). The fecal microbiome was influenced by the beef production systems with greater functional and lower taxonomic diversity in beef cattle feces from I systems compared with that from T systems. The concentration of N, P, and Zn was higher in beef cattle feces from I systems compared with that from T systems and was associated with taxonomic and functional profile of fecal microbiome in I system, suggesting the role of fecal nutrients in shaping system-specific microbiome. Semi-intensive management practices led to a more complex but less connected fecal microbiome in beef cattle. The microbial community in beef cattle feces from I systems was characterized by greater abundance of beneficial bacteria (phylum Firmicutes and butyrate-producing bacteria familyLachnospiraceaeand generaAnaerostipes,Blautia,Butyrivibrio,Eubacterium,Roseburia, andRuminococcus). In addition, the fecal abundance of microbial genes related to immune system, nutrient metabolism, and energy production was greater in beef cattle raised under I systems compared with that under T systems. Findings of the current study suggest that semi-intensive management practices could facilitate the development of a healthier and more efficient fecal microbiome in beef cattle by driving an increase in the abundance of beneficial bacteria and functional genes.Copyright © 2021 Corrêa, Jimenez, Mendes, Rymer, Ray, Gerdes, da Silva, De Nadai Fernandes, Abdalla and Louvandini."

Although it is a main cause of human pregnancy loss and a hallmark of cancer, how aneuploidy affects cellular function has been elusive. The last two decades have seen rapid advances in the understanding of the causes and consequences of aneuploidy at the molecular and cellular levels. These studies have uncovered effects of aneuploidy that can be beneficial or detrimental to cells and organisms in an environmental context-dependent and karyotype-dependent manner. Aneuploidy also imposes general stress on cells that stems from an imbalanced genome and, consequently, also an imbalanced proteome.

"34934158","Rats exhibit age-related mosaic loss of chromosome Y.","Commun Biol","Mosaic loss of the Y chromosome (LOY) is the most frequent chromosomal aberration in aging men and is strongly correlated with mortality and disease. To date, studies of LOY have only been performed in humans, and so it is unclear whether LOY is a natural consequence of our relatively long lifespan or due to exposure to human-specific external stressors. Here, we explored whether LOY could be detected in rats. We applied a locus-specific PCR and target sequencing approach that we used as a proxy to estimate LOY in 339 samples covering eleven tissues from young and old individuals. We detected LOY in four tissues of older rats. To confirm the results from the PCR screening, we re-sequenced 60 full genomes from old rats, which revealed that the Y chromosome is the sole chromosome with low copy numbers. Finally, our results suggest that LOY is associated with other structural aberrations on the Y chromosome and possibly linked to the mosaic loss of the X chromosome. This is the first report, to our knowledge, demonstrating that the patterns of LOY observed in aging men are also present in a rodent, and conclude that LOY may be a natural process in placental mammals.© 2021.

LOY in leukocytes is associated with increased risk for all-cause mortality and a range of common disease such as hematological and non-hematological cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and cardiovascular events. Recent genome-wide association studies identified up to 156 germline variants associated with risk of LOY. The objective of this study was to use these variants to calculate a novel polygenic risk score (PRS) for LOY, and to assess the predictive performance of this score in a large independent population of older men.We calculated a PRS for LOY in 5131 men aged 70 years and older. Levels of LOY were estimated using microarrays and validated by whole genome sequencing. After adjusting for covariates, the PRS was a significant predictor of LOY (odds ratio [OR] = 1.74 per standard deviation of the PRS, 95% confidence intervals [CI] 1.62-1.86, p < 0.001). Men in the highest quintile of the PRS distribution had > fivefold higher risk of LOY than the lowest (OR = 5.05, 95% CI 4.05-6.32, p < 0.001). Adding the PRS to a LOY prediction model comprised of age, smoking and alcohol consumption significantly improved prediction (AUC = 0.628 [CI 0.61-0.64] to 0.695 [CI 0.67-0.71], p < 0.001).Our results suggest that a PRS for LOY could become a useful tool for risk prediction and targeted intervention for common disease in men.© 2021.

"34906245","Driving mosaicism: somatic variants in reference population databases and effect on variant interpretation in rare genetic disease.","Hum Genomics","Genetic variation databases provide invaluable information on the presence and frequency of genetic variants in the 'untargeted' human population, aggregated with the primary goal to facilitate the interpretation of clinically important variants. The presence of somatic variants in such databases can affect variant assessment in undiagnosed rare disease (RD) patients. Previously, the impact of somatic mosaicism was only considered in relation to two Mendelian disease-associated genes. Here, we expand the analyses to identify additional mosaicism-prone genes in blood-derived reference population databases.To identify additional mosaicism-prone genes relevant to RDs, we focused on known/previously established ClinVar pathogenic and likely pathogenic single-nucleotide variants, residing in genes associated with early onset, severe autosomal dominant diseases. We asked whether any of these variants are present in a higher-than-expected frequency in the reference population databases and whether there is evidence of somatic origin (i.e., allelic imbalance) rather than germline heterozygosity (~ half of the reads supporting alternative allele). The mosaicism-prone genes identified were further categorized according to the processes they are involved in. Beyond the previously reported ASXL1 and DNMT3A, we identified 7 additional autosomal dominant RD-associated genes with known pathogenic single-nucleotide variants present in the reference population databases and good evidence of allelic imbalance: BRAF, CBL, FGFR3, IDH2, KRAS, PTPN11 and SETBP1. From this group of 9 genes, the majority (n = 7) was important for hematopoiesis. In addition, 4 of these genes were involved in cell proliferation. Further assessment of the known 156 hematopoietic genes led to identification of 48 genes (21 not yet associated with RDs) with at least some evidence of mosaicism detectable in reference population databases.These results stress the importance of considering genes involved in hematopoiesis and cell proliferation when interpreting the presence and frequency of genetic variants in blood-derived reference population databases, both public and private. This is especially important when considering new variants of uncertain significance in known hematopoietic/cell proliferation RD genes and future novel gene-disease associations involving this class of genes.© 2021.

"34888527","Cells with Cancer-associated Mutations Overtake Our Tissues as We Age.","Aging Cancer","To shed light on the earliest events in oncogenesis, there is growing interest in understanding the mutational landscapes of normal tissues across ages. In the last decade, next-generation sequencing of human tissues has revealed a surprising abundance of cells with what would be considered oncogenic mutations.We performed meta-analysis on previously published sequencing data on normal tissues to categorize mutations based on their presence in cancer and showcase the quantity of cells with cancer-associated mutations in cancer-free individuals.We analyzed sequencing data from these studies of normal tissues to determine the prevalence of cells with mutations in three different categories across multiple age groups: 1) mutations in genes designated as drivers, 2) mutations that are in the Cancer Gene Census (CGC), and 3) mutations in the CGC that are considered pathogenic. As we age, the percentage of cells in all three levels increase significantly, reaching over 50% of cells having oncogenic mutations for multiple tissues in the older age groups. The clear enrichment for these mutations, particularly at older ages, likely indicates strong selection for the resulting phenotypes. Combined with an estimation of the number of cells in tissues, we calculate that most older, cancer-free individuals possess at least a 100 billion cells that harbor at least one oncogenic mutation, presumably emanating from a fitness advantage conferred by these mutations that promotes clonal expansion.These studies of normal tissues have highlighted the specific drivers of clonal expansion and how frequently they appear in us. Their high prevalence throughout cancer-free individuals necessitates reconsideration of the oncogenicity of these mutations, which could shape methods of detection, prevention and treatment of cancer, as well as of the potential impact of these mutations on tissue function and our health."

However, MA experiments can also shed light on somatic genome plasticity in a habitual and genetic drift-maximizing environment. Here, we revisit an MA experiment that uncovered extraordinary germline genome stability in Paramecium tetraurelia, a single-celled eukaryote with nuclear dimorphism. Our re-examination of isogenic P. tetraurelia MA lines propagated in nutrient-rich medium for >40 sexual cycles reveals that their polyploid somatic genome accrued hundreds of intervening DNA segments (IESs), which are normally eliminated during germline-soma differentiation. These IESs frequently occupy a fraction of the somatic DNA copies of a given locus, producing IES excision/retention polymorphisms, and preferentially fall into a class of epigenetically controlled sequences. Relative to control lines, retained IESs are flanked by stronger cis-acting signals and interrupt an excess of highly expressed coding exons. These findings suggest that P. tetraurelia's elevated germline DNA replication fidelity is associated with pervasive somatic genome plasticity. They show that MA regimes are powerful tools for investigating the role that developmental plasticity, somatic mutations, and epimutations have in ecology and evolution.© The Author(s) 2021.

To establish a less invasive method of creating organoids from a patient's tumor, we examined whether PC organoids can be established using residual samples from saline flushes (RSSFs) during endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA).Methods Five patients with PC who underwent EUS-FNA were enrolled in a prospective study conducted at our institution. RSSFs obtained during EUS-FNA procedures were collected. An organoid culture was considered as established when ≥ 5 passages were successful. Organoid-derived xenografts were created using established organoids.Results EUS-FNA was performed using a 22- or 25-gauge lancet needle without complications. Patient-derived organoids were successfully established in four patients (80.0 %) with the complete medium and medium for the selection ofKRASmutants. Organoid-derived xenografts were successfully created and histologically similar to EUS-FNA samples.Conclusions Patient-derived PC organoids were successfully established using EUS-FNA RSSFs, which are produced as a byproduct of standard manipulations, but are usually not used for diagnosis. This method can be applied to all patients with PC, without additional invasive procedures, and can contribute to the development of personalized medicine and molecular research.The Author(s).

They also provided an essential boost to cancer drug discovery. Nevertheless, these model systems failed to reproduce the tumor heterogeneity and the complex biological interactions between cancer cells and human hosts, making a high priority search for alternative methods that are able to export results from model systems to humans, which has become a major bottleneck in the drug development. The emergent humanin vitro3D cell culture technologies have attracted widespread attention because they seem to have the potential to overcome these limitations. Organoids are unique 3D culture models with the ability to self-organize in contained structures. Their versatility has offered an exceptional window of opportunity to approach human cancers. Pancreatic cancers (PCs) patient-derived-organoids (PDOs) preserve histological, genomic, and molecular features of neoplasms they originate from and therefore retain their heterogeneity. Patient-derived organoids can be established with a high success rate from minimal tissue core specimens acquired with endoscopic-ultrasound-guided techniques and assembled into platforms, representing tens to hundreds of cancers each conserving specific features, expanding the types of patient samples that can be propagated and analyzed in the laboratory. Because of their nature, PDO platforms are multipurpose systems that can be easily adapted in co-culture settings to perform a wide spectrum of studies, ranging from drug discovery to immune response evaluation to tumor-stroma interaction. This possibility to increase the complexity of organoids creating a hybrid culture with non-epithelial cells increases the interest in organoid-based platforms giving a pragmatic way to deeply study biological interactionsin vitro. In this view, implementing organoid models in co-clinical trials to compare drug responses may represent the next step toward even more personalized medicine. In the present review, we discuss how PDO platforms are shaping modern-day oncology aiding to unravel the most complex aspects of PC.Copyright © 2021 Piro, Agostini, Larghi, Quero, Carbone, Esposito, Rizzatti, Attili, Alfieri, Costamagna and Tortora."
"35004672","Microfluidic Platforms for High-Throughput Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Organoid Culture and Drug Screening.","Front Cell Dev Biol","Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC), the most common pancreatic cancer type, is believed to become the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths by 2030 with mortality rates of up to 93%. It is often detected at a late stage due to lacking symptoms, and therefore surgical removal of the tumor is the only treatment option for patients. Only 20% of the tumors are resectable, mainly due to early metastasis. Therefore, for 80% of cases chemotherapeutic treatment is the leading therapy for patients. PDAC is characterized by high-density stroma which induces hypoxic conditions and high interstitial pressure. These factors impact carcinogenesis and progression of PDAC and support the formation of an immunosuppressive microenvironment that renders this tumor type refractory to immunotherapies. Mostin vitroPDAC models have limited translational relevance, as these fail to recapitulate relevant aspects of PDAC complexity. Altogether, there is an urgent need for novel and innovative PDAC modeling platforms. Here, we discuss the relevance of microfluidic and organoid technologies as platforms for modeling bio- and physicochemical features of PDAC and as translational models that enable high-throughput phenotypic drug screenings, while also allowing for the development of novel personalized models used to identify treatment responsive patient subsets.Copyright © 2021 Geyer and Queiroz."
"34957115","PDAC as an Immune Evasive Disease: Can 3D Model Systems Aid to Tackle This Clinical Problem?","Front Cell Dev Biol","Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive cancer with a high mortality rate. The presence of a dense desmoplastic stroma rich in fibroblasts, extracellular matrix, and immune cells plays a critical role in disease progression, therapy response and is a distinguishing feature of PDAC. PDAC is currently treated with a combination of surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy in selected cases which results in long-term survival only in a small percentage of patients. Cancer therapies that incorporate immunotherapy-based techniques have become increasingly common in recent years. While such a strategy has been shown to be effective for immunogenic, ""hot"" tumors like melanoma and lung cancer, thus far PDAC patients display poor responses to this therapeutic approach. Various factors, such as low tumor mutational burden, increased infiltration of immunosuppressive cells, like MDSCs and Treg cells promote tolerance and immune deviation, further aggravating adaptive immunity in PDAC. In this review we will elaborate on the ability of PDAC tumors to evade immune detection. We will also discuss various 3D model system that can be used as a platform in preclinical research to investigate rational combinations of immunotherapy with chemotherapy or targeted therapy, to prime the immune microenvironment to enhance antitumor activity.Copyright © 2021 Narayanan, Vicent and Ponz-Sarvisé."
"34906890","Relevance of biopsy-derived pancreatic organoids in the development of efficient transcriptomic signatures to predict adjuvant chemosensitivity in pancreatic cancer.","Transl Oncol","Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients are frequently treated by chemotherapy. Even if personalized therapy based on molecular analysis can be performed for some tumors, PDAC regimens selection is still mainly based on patients' performance status and expected efficacy. Therefore, the establishment of molecular predictors of chemotherapeutic efficacy could potentially improve prognosis by tailoring treatments. We have recently developed an RNA-based signature that predicts the efficacy of adjuvant gemcitabine using 38 PDAC primary cell cultures. While demonstrated its efficiency, a significant association with the classical/basal-like PDAC spectrum was observed. We hypothesized that this flaw was due to the basal-like biased phenotype of cellular models used in our strategy. To overcome this limitation, we generated a prospective cohort of 27 consecutive biopsied derived pancreatic organoids (BDPO) and include them in the signature identification strategy. As BDPO's do not have the same biased phenotype as primary cell cultures we expect they can compensate one with each other and cover a broader range of molecular phenotypes. We then obtained an improved signature predicting gemcitabine sensibility that was validated in a cohort of 300 resected PDAC patients that have or have not received adjuvant gemcitabine. We demonstrated a significant association between the improved signature and the overall and disease-free survival in patients predicted as sensitive and treated with adjuvant gemcitabine. We propose then that including BDPO along primary cell cultures represent a powerful strategy that helps to overcome primary cell cultures limitations producing unbiased RNA-based signatures predictive of adjuvant treatments in PDAC.Copyright © 2021.

"34893703","Towards organoid culture without Matrigel.","Commun Biol","Organoids-cellular aggregates derived from stem or progenitor cells that recapitulate organ function in miniature-are of growing interest in developmental biology and medicine. Organoids have been developed for organs and tissues such as the liver, gut, brain, and pancreas; they are used as organ surrogates to study a wide range of questions in basic and developmental biology, genetic disorders, and therapies. However, many organoids reported to date have been cultured in Matrigel, which is prepared from the secretion of Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm mouse sarcoma cells; Matrigel is complex and poorly defined. This complexity makes it difficult to elucidate Matrigel-specific factors governing organoid development. In this review, we discuss promising Matrigel-free methods for the generation and maintenance of organoids that use decellularized extracellular matrix (ECM), synthetic hydrogels, or gel-forming recombinant proteins.© 2021.

"34713636","Tumor organoids: synergistic applications, current challenges, and future prospects in cancer therapy.","Cancer Commun (Lond)","Patient-derived cancer cells (PDCs) and patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) are often used as tumor models, but have many shortcomings. PDCs not only lack diversity in terms of cell type, spatial organization, and microenvironment but also have adverse effects in stem cell cultures, whereas PDX are expensive with a low transplantation success rate and require a long culture time. In recent years, advances in three-dimensional (3D) organoid culture technology have led to the development of novel physiological systems that model the tissues of origin more precisely than traditional culture methods. Patient-derived cancer organoids bridge the conventional gaps in PDC and PDX models and closely reflect the pathophysiological features of natural tumorigenesis and metastasis, and have led to new patient-specific drug screening techniques, development of individualized treatment regimens, and discovery of prognostic biomarkers and mechanisms of resistance. Synergistic combinations of cancer organoids with other technologies, for example, organ-on-a-chip, 3D bio-printing, and CRISPR-Cas9-mediated homology-independent organoid transgenesis, and with treatments, such as immunotherapy, have been useful in overcoming their limitations and led to the development of more suitable model systems that recapitulate the complex stroma of cancer, inter-organ and intra-organ communications, and potentially multiorgan metastasis. In this review, we discuss various methods for the creation of organ-specific cancer organoids and summarize organ-specific advances and applications, synergistic technologies, and treatments as well as current limitations and future prospects for cancer organoids.

"34693619","Modelling of primary ciliary dyskinesia using patient-derived airway organoids.","EMBO Rep","Patient-derived human organoids can be used to model a variety of diseases. Recently, we described conditions for long-term expansion of human airway organoids (AOs) directly from healthy individuals and patients. Here, we first optimize differentiation of AOs towards ciliated cells. After differentiation of the AOs towards ciliated cells, these can be studied for weeks. When returned to expansion conditions, the organoids readily resume their growth. We apply this condition to AOs established from nasal inferior turbinate brush samples of patients suffering from primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a pulmonary disease caused by dysfunction of the motile cilia in the airways. Patient-specific differences in ciliary beating are observed and are in agreement with the patients' genetic mutations. More detailed organoid ciliary phenotypes can thus be documented in addition to the standard diagnostic procedure. Additionally, using genetic editing tools, we show that a patient-specific mutation can be repaired. This study demonstrates the utility of organoid technology for investigating hereditary airway diseases such as PCD.© 2021 The Authors. Published under the terms of the CC BY 4.0 license."
"34836171","Vitamins as Possible Cancer Biomarkers: Significance and Limitations.","Nutrients","The Western-style diet, which is common in developed countries and spreading into developing countries, is unbalanced in many respects. For instance, micronutrients (vitamins A, B complex, C, D, E, and K plus iron, zinc, selenium, and iodine) are generally depleted in Western food (causing what is known as 'hidden hunger'), whereas some others (such as phosphorus) are added beyond the daily allowance. This imbalance in micronutrients can induce cellular damage that can increase the risk of cancer. Interestingly, there is a large body of evidence suggesting a strong correlation between vitamin intake as well as vitamin blood concentrations with the occurrence of certain types of cancer. The direction of association between the concentration of a given vitamin and cancer risk is tumor specific. The present review summarized the literature regarding vitamins and cancer risk to assess whether these could be used as diagnostic or prognostic markers, thus confirming their potential as biomarkers. Despite many studies that highlight the importance of monitoring vitamin blood or tissue concentrations in cancer patients and demonstrate the link between vitamin intake and cancer risk, there is still an urgent need for more data to assess the effectiveness of vitamins as biomarkers in the context of cancer. Therefore, this review aims to provide a solid basis to support further studies on this promising topic."
"34886409","The Exposome Approach in Allergies and Lung Diseases: Is It Time to Define a Preconception Exposome?","Int J Environ Res Public Health","Emerging research suggests environmental exposures before conception may adversely affect allergies and lung diseases in future generations. Most studies are limited as they have focused on single exposures, not considering that these diseases have a multifactorial origin in which environmental and lifestyle factors are likely to interact. Traditional exposure assessment methods fail to capture the interactions among environmental exposures and their impact on fundamental biological processes, as well as individual and temporal factors. A valid estimation of exposure preconception is difficult since the human reproductive cycle spans decades and the access to germ cells is limited. The exposome is defined as the cumulative measure of external exposures on an organism (external exposome), and the associated biological responses (endogenous exposome) throughout the lifespan, from conception and onwards. An exposome approach implies a targeted or agnostic analysis of the concurrent and temporal multiple exposures, and may, together with recent technological advances, improve the assessment of the environmental contributors to health and disease. This review describes the current knowledge on preconception environmental exposures as related to respiratory health outcomes in offspring. We discuss the usefulness and feasibility of using an exposome approach in this research, advocating for the preconception exposure window to become included in the exposome concept."

However, paternal contribution of PM2.5 exposure to hypertension in offspring remains unknown. In the present study, male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with PM2.5 suspension (10 mg/ml) for 12 weeks and/or fed with tap water containing an antioxidant tempol (1 mM/L) for 16 weeks. The blood pressure, 24 h-urine volume and sodium excretion were determined in male offspring. The offspring were also administrated with losartan (20 mg/kg/d) for 4 weeks. The expressions of angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) and G-protein-coupled receptor kinase type 4 (GRK4) were determined by qRT-PCR and immunoblotting. We found that long-term PM2.5 exposure to paternal rats caused hypertension and impaired urine volume and sodium excretion in male offspring. Both the mRNA and protein expression of GRK4 and its downstream target AT1R were increased in offspring of PM2.5-exposed paternal rats, which was reflected in its function because treatment with losartan, an AT1R antagonist, decreased the blood pressure and increased urine volume and sodium excretion. In addition, the oxidative stress level was increased in PM2.5-treated paternal rats. Administration with tempol in paternal rats restored the increased blood pressure and decreased urine volume and sodium excretion in the offspring of PM2.5-exposed paternal rats. Treatment with tempol in paternal rats also reversed the increased expressions of AT1R and GRK4 in the kidney of their offspring. We suggest that paternal PM2.5 exposure causes hypertension in offspring. The mechanism may be involved that paternal PM2.5 exposure-associated oxidative stress induces the elevated renal GRK4 level, leading to the enhanced AT1R expression and its-mediated sodium retention, consequently causes hypertension in male offspring.© 2021 The Author(s)."
"35022547","Effects of paternal overnutrition and interventions on future generations.","Int J Obes (Lond)","In the last two decades, evidence from human and animal studies suggests that paternal obesity around the time of conception can have adverse effects on offspring health through developmental programming. This may make significant contributions to the current epidemic of obesity and related metabolic and reproductive complications like diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and subfertility/infertility. To date, changes in seminal fluid composition, sperm DNA methylation, histone composition, small non-coding RNAs, and sperm DNA damage have been proposed as potential underpinning mechanism to program offspring health. In this review, we discuss current human and rodent evidence on the impact of paternal obesity/overnutrition on offspring health, followed by the proposed mechanisms, with a focus on sperm DNA damage underpinning paternal programming. We also summarize the different intervention strategies implemented to minimize effects of paternal obesity. Upon critical review of literature, we find that obesity-induced altered sperm quality in father is linked with compromised offspring health. Paternal exercise intervention before conception has been shown to improve metabolic health. Further work to explore the mechanisms underlying benefits of paternal exercise on offspring are warranted. Conversion to healthy diets and micronutrient supplementation during pre-conception have shown some positive impacts towards minimizing the impact of paternal obesity on offspring. Pharmacological approaches e.g., metformin are also being applied. Thus, interventions in the obese father may ameliorate the potential detrimental impacts of paternal obesity on offspring.© 2021.

Infant birthweight was recorded at delivery. The impact of parental obesity and their interaction on first singleton term (≥37 weeks' gestation) birthweight was assessed using linear regressions assessing nonlinearity and a pairwise linear interactions.In the base model where parental BMI is assumed linear, there was strong evidence for higher birthweight with increasing maternal BMI (11.2 g per maternal kg/m2; 95% confidence interval, 7.2, 15.1) but not paternal BMI. The inclusion of a pairwise linear interaction indicated that paternal BMI attenuates the positive association between maternal BMI and infant birthweight (interaction -0.88; 95% confidence interval, -1.49, -0.27). The inclusion of nonlinear maternal BMI terms did not change the conclusions.Increases in the mean infant birthweight associated with maternal obesity are attenuated when the father is obese. While maternal BMI contributed more to the mean infant birthweight than paternal BMI, a couple-centered approach to preconception health advice is recommended, given the documented relationships between parental obesity and childhood weight beyond infancy. Further studies in both assisted reproductive technology and general population cohorts assessing the parental BMI interaction on infant birthweight are warranted.© 2021 The Author(s)."

The objective of this study was to describe the gestational age-dependent changes in the AF proteome during normal pregnancy by using an omics platform. The abundance of 1310 proteins was measured on a high-throughput aptamer-based proteomics platform in AF samples collected from women during midtrimester (16-24 weeks of gestation, n = 15) and at term without labor (37-42 weeks of gestation, n = 13). Only pregnancies without obstetrical complications were included in the study. Almost 25% (320) of AF proteins significantly changed in abundance between the midtrimester and term gestation. Of these, 154 (48.1%) proteins increased, and 166 (51.9%) decreased in abundance at term compared to midtrimester. Tissue-specific signatures of the trachea, salivary glands, brain regions, and immune system were increased while those of the gestational tissues (uterus, placenta, and ovary), cardiac myocytes, and fetal liver were decreased at term compared to midtrimester. The changes in AF protein abundance were correlated with those previously reported in the cell-free AF transcriptome. Intersecting gestational age-modulated AF proteins and their corresponding mRNAs previously reported in the maternal blood identified neutrophil-related protein/mRNA pairs that were modulated in the same direction. The first study to utilize an aptamer-based assay to profile the AF proteome modulation with gestational age, it reveals that almost one-quarter of the proteins are modulated as gestation advances, which is more than twice the fraction of altered plasma proteins (~ 10%). The results reported herein have implications for future studies focused on discovering biomarkers to predict, monitor, and diagnose obstetrical diseases.© 2022. The Author(s)."

This study aimed to investigate the utility of proteomic profiling of plasma combined with bioinformatic mining, and to define molecular endotypes and expand our knowledge of the underlying biology in chronic respiratory diseases.The plasma proteome was evaluated using an aptamer-based affinity proteomics platform (SOMAscan®), representing 1238 proteins in 34 subjects with stable COPD and 51 subjects with stable but severe asthma. For each disease, we evaluated a range of clinical/demographic characteristics including bronchodilator reversibility, blood eosinophilia levels, and smoking history. We applied modified bioinformatic approaches used in the evaluation of RNA transcriptomics.Subjects with COPD and severe asthma were distinguished from each other by 365 different protein abundancies, with differential pathway networks and upstream modulators. Furthermore, molecular endotypes within each disease could be defined. The protein groups that defined these endotypes had both known and novel biology including groups significantly enriched in exosomal markers derived from immune/inflammatory cells. Finally, we observed associations to clinical characteristics that previously have been under-explored.This investigational study evaluating the plasma proteome in clinically-phenotyped subjects with chronic airway diseases provides support that such a method can be used to define molecular endotypes and pathobiological mechanisms that underpins these endotypes. It provided new concepts about the complexity of molecular pathways that define these diseases.

Levels of 261 proteins related to inflammation and/or tumor processes were measured using the proximity extension assay (PEA) in 179 plasma samples (42 collected before diagnosis of SCCOT with 81 matched controls; 28 collected at diagnosis of SCCOT with 28 matched controls). Statistical modeling tools principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial least square - discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) were applied to provide insights into separations between groups. PCA models failed to achieve group separation of SCCOT patients from controls based on protein levels in samples taken prior to diagnosis or at the time of diagnosis. For pre-diagnostic samples and their controls, no significant OPLS-DA model was identified. Potentials for separating pre-diagnostic samples collected up to five years before diagnosis (n= 15) from matched controls (n= 28) were seen in four proteins. For diagnostic samples and controls, the OPLS-DA model indicated that 21 proteins were important for group separation. TNF receptor associated factor 2 (TRAF2), decreased in pre-diagnostic plasma (< 5 years) but increased at diagnosis, was the only protein showing altered levels before and at diagnosis of SCCOT (p-value < 0.05). Taken together, changes in plasma protein profiles at diagnosis were evident, but not reliably detectable in pre-diagnostic samples taken before clinical signs of tumor development. Variation in protein levels during cancer development poses a challenge for the identification of biomarkers that could predict SCCOT development.Copyright © 2021 Gu, Coates, Wang, Erdogan, Salehi, Sgaramella, Zborayova and Nylander."
"34868919","Gene Co-Expression in Breast Cancer: A Matter of Distance.","Front Oncol","Gene regulatory and signaling phenomena are known to be relevant players underlying the establishment of cellular phenotypes. It is also known that such regulatory programs are disrupted in cancer, leading to the onset and development of malignant phenotypes. Gene co-expression matrices have allowed us to compare and analyze complex phenotypes such as breast cancer (BrCa) and their control counterparts. Global co-expression patterns have revealed, for instance, that the highest gene-gene co-expression interactions often occur between genes from the same chromosome (cis-), meanwhile inter-chromosome (trans-) interactions are scarce and have lower correlation values. Furthermore, strength ofcis-correlations have been shown to decay with the chromosome distance of gene couples. Despite thisloss of long-distance co-expressionhas been clearly identified, it has been observed only in a small fraction of the whole co-expression landscape, namely the most significant interactions. For that reason, an approach that takes into account the whole interaction set results appealing. In this work, we developed a hybrid method to analyze whole-chromosome Pearson correlation matrices for the four BrCa subtypes (Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2+ and Basal), as well as adjacent normal breast tissue derived matrices. We implemented a systematic method for clustering gene couples, by using eigenvalue spectral decomposition and thek-medoids algorithm, allowing us to determine a number of clusters without removing any interaction. With this method we compared, for each chromosome in the five phenotypes:a)Whether or not the gene-gene co-expression decays with the distance in the breast cancer subtypesb)the chromosome location ofcis-clusters of gene couples, andc)whether or not theloss of long-distance co-expressionis observed in the whole range of interactions. We found that in the correlation matrix for the control phenotype, positive and negative Pearson correlations deviate from a random null model independently of the distance between couples. Conversely, for all BrCa subtypes, in all chromosomes, positive correlations decay with distance, and negative correlations do not differ from the null model. We also found that BrCa clusters are distance-dependent, meanwhile for the control phenotype, chromosome location does not determine the clustering. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a dependence on distance is reported for gene clusters in breast cancer. Since this method uses the wholecis-interaction geneset, combination with other -omics approaches may provide further evidence to understand in a more integrative fashion, the mechanisms that disrupt gene regulation in cancer.Copyright © 2021 González-Espinoza, Zamora-Fuentes, Hernández-Lemus and Espinal-Enríquez."

Successfully integrating research projects into society requires (1) good collaboration between scientists and societal stakeholders, (2) collaboration partners with common expectations and goals, and (3) investment in clear communication. Here we describe an integrative research project conducted by a large Dutch consortium that consisted of neuroscientists, psychologists, sociologists, ethicists, teachers, health care professionals and policy makers, focusing on applying cognitive developmental neuroscience for the benefit of youth in education and social safety. We argue that to effectively integrate cognitive developmental neuroscience in society, (1) it is necessary to invest in a well-functioning, diverse and multidisciplinary team involving societal stakeholders and youth themselves from the start of the project. This aids to build a so-called productive interactive network that increases the chances to realize societal impact in the long-term. Additionally, we propose that to integrate knowledge, (2) a different than standard research approach should be taken. When focusing on integration, the ultimate goal of research is not solely to understand the world better, but also to intervene with real-life situations, such as education or (forensic) youth care. To accomplish this goal, we propose an approach in which integration is not only started after the research has been conducted, but taken into account throughout the entire project. This approach helps to create common expectations and goals between different stakeholders. Finally, we argue that (3) dedicating sufficient resources to effective communication, both within the consortium and between scientists and society, greatly benefits the integration of cognitive developmental neuroscience in society.Copyright © 2021 Vandenbroucke, Crone, Erp, Güroğlu, Hulshoff Pol, de Kogel, Krabbendam, Jansen and Brouwer."

A better understanding of the tumor biology of nccRCC can provide more effective treatment paradigms for different subtypes. To reveal the heterogeneity of tumor microenvironment (TME) in nccRCC, we performed 10x sing-cell genomics on tumor and normal tissues from patients with papillary renal cell carcinoma (pRCC), chromophobe RCC (chrRCC), collecting duct carcinoma (CDRCC) and sarcomatoid RCC (sarRCC). 15 tissue samples were finally included. 34561 cells were identified as 16 major cell clusters with 34 cell subtypes. Our study presented the sing-cell landscape for four types of nccRCC, and demonstrated that CD8+ T cells exhaustion, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and sarcomatoid process were the pivotal factors in immunosuppression of nccRCC tissues and were closely correlated with poor prognosis. Abnormal metabolic patterns were present in both cancer cells and tumor-infiltrating stromal cells, such as fibroblasts and endothelial cells. Combined with CIBERSORTx tool, the expression data of bulk RNA-seq from TCGA were labeled with cell types of our sing-cell data. Calculation of the relative abundance of cell types revealed that greater proportion of exhausted CD8+ T cells, TAMs and sarRCC derived cells were correlated with poor prognosis in the cohort of 274 nccRCC patients. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that provides a more comprehensive sight about the heterogeneity and tumor biology of nccRCC, which may potentially facilitate the development of more effective therapies for nccRCC.© 2022.

"35006460","Extracellular vesicles (exosomes and ectosomes) play key roles in the pathology of brain diseases.","Mol Biomed","Last century, neurons and glial cells were mostly believed to play distinct functions, relevant for the brain. Progressively, however, it became clear that neurons, astrocytes and microglia co-operate intensely with each other by release/binding of signaling factors, direct surface binding and generation/release of extracellular vesicles, the exosomes and ectosomes, called together vesicles in this abstract. The present review is focused on these vesicles, fundamental in various brain diseases. Their properties are extraordinary. The specificity of their membrane governs their fusion with distinct target cells, variable depending on the state and specificity of their cells of origin and target. Result of vesicle fusion is the discharge of their cargos into the cytoplasm of target cells. Cargos are composed of critical molecules, from proteins (various nature and function) to nucleotides (especially miRNAs), playing critical roles in immune and neurodegenerative diseases. Among immune diseases is multiple sclerosis, affected by extensive dysregulation of co-trafficking neural and glial vesicles, with distinct miRNAs inducing severe or reducing effects. The vesicle-dependent differences between progressive and relapsing-remitting forms of the disease are relevant for clinical developments. In Alzheimer's disease the vesicles can affect the brain by changing their generation and inducing co-release of effective proteins, such Aβ and tau, from neurons and astrocytes. Specific miRNAs can delay the long-term development of the disease. Upon their traffic through the blood-brainbarrier, vesicles of various origin reach fluids where they are essential for the identification of biomarkers, important for diagnostic and therapeutic innovations, critical for the future of many brain patients.© 2021.

"34991629","MicroRNA-210 regulates the metabolic and inflammatory status of primary human astrocytes.","J Neuroinflammation","Astrocytes are the most numerous glial cell type with important roles in maintaining homeostasis and responding to diseases in the brain. Astrocyte function is subject to modulation by microRNAs (miRs), which are short nucleotide strands that regulate protein expression in a post-transcriptional manner. Understanding the miR expression profile of astrocytes in disease settings provides insight into the cellular stresses present in the microenvironment and may uncover pathways of therapeutic interest.Laser-capture microdissection was used to isolate human astrocytes surrounding stroke lesions and those from neurological control tissue. Astrocytic miR expression profiles were examined using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Primary human fetal astrocytes were cultured under in vitro stress conditions and transfection of a miR mimic was used to better understand how altered levels of miR-210 affect astrocyte function. The astrocytic response to stress was studied using qPCR, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), measurement of released lactate, and Seahorse.Here, we measured miR expression levels in astrocytes around human ischemic stroke lesions and observed differential expression of miR-210 in chronic stroke astrocytes compared to astrocytes from neurological control tissue. We also identified increased expression of miR-210 in mouse white matter tissue around middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) brain lesions. We aimed to understand the role of miR-210 in primary human fetal astrocytes by developing an in vitro assay of hypoxic, metabolic, and inflammatory stresses. A combination of hypoxic and inflammatory stresses was observed to upregulate miR-210 expression. Transfection with miR-210-mimic (210M) increased glycolysis, enhanced lactate export, and promoted an anti-inflammatory transcriptional and translational signature in astrocytes. Additionally, 210M transfection resulted in decreased expression of complement 3 (C3) and semaphorin 5b (Sema5b).We conclude that miR-210 expression in human astrocytes is modulated in response to ischemic stroke disease and under in vitro stress conditions, supporting a role for miR-210 in the astrocytic response to disease conditions. Further, the anti-inflammatory and pro-glycolytic impact of miR-210 on astrocytes makes it a potential candidate for further research as a neuroprotective agent.© 2022. The Author(s)."

However, the last decade of the twentieth century and the twenty-first century have brought the astroglial ""renaissance"", which has put astroglial cells as key players in pathophysiology of most if not all disorders of the nervous system and has regarded astroglia as a fertile ground for therapeutic intervention.Astrocytic contribution to neuropathology can be primary, whereby cell-autonomous changes, such as mutations in gene encoding for glial fibrillary acidic protein, can drive the pathologic progression, in this example, Alexander disease. They can also be secondary, when astrocytes respond to a variety of insults to the nervous tissue. Regardless of their origin, being cell-autonomous or not, changes in astroglia that occur in pathology, that is, astrogliopathology, can be contemporary and arbitrary classified into four forms: (i) reactive astrogliosis, (ii) astrocytic atrophy with loss of function, (iii) pathological remodelling of astrocytes and (iv) astrodegeneration morphologically manifested as clasmatodendrosis.

Different subtypes of gray matter astrocytes have been identified, yet molecular and functional diversity of white matter astrocytes remains largely unexplored. Nonetheless, their important and diverse roles in maintaining white matter integrity and function are well recognized. Compelling evidence indicate that impairment of normal astrocytic function and their response to injury contribute to a wide variety of diseases, including white matter disorders. In this review, we highlight our current understanding of astrocyte heterogeneity in the white matter of the mammalian brain and how an interplay between developmental origins and local environmental cues contribute to astroglial diversification. In addition, we discuss whether, and if so, how, heterogeneous astrocytes could contribute to white matter function in health and disease and focus on the sparse human research data available. We highlight four leukodystrophies primarily due to astrocytic dysfunction, the so-called astrocytopathies. Insight into the role of astroglial heterogeneity in both healthy and diseased white matter may provide new avenues for therapies aimed at promoting repair and restoring normal white matter function.© 2021.

"34846518","Gap Junctional Coupling Between Retinal Astrocytes Exacerbates Neuronal Damage in Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury.","Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci","Retinal astrocytes abundantly express connexin 43 (Cx43), a transmembrane protein that forms gap junction (GJ) channels and unopposed hemichannels. While it is well established that Cx43 is upregulated in retinal injuries, it is unclear whether astrocytic Cx43 plays a role in retinal ganglion cell (RGC) loss associated with injury. Here, we investigated the effect of astrocyte-specific deletion of Cx43 (Cx43KO) and channel inhibitors on RGC loss in retinal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury and assessed changes in expression and GJ channel and hemichannel function that occur in I/R injury. The effect of Cx43 deletion on neural function in the uninjured retina was also assessed.Cx43 expression, astrocyte density and morphology, and RGC death in wild-type and Cx43KO mice after I/R injury were determined using immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. Visual function was assessed using ERG recordings. GJ coupling and hemichannel activity were evaluated using tracer coupling and uptake studies, respectively.Loss of RGCs in I/R injury was accompanied by an increase of Cx43 expression in astrocytes. Functional studies indicated that I/R injury augmented astrocytic GJ coupling but not Cx43 hemichannel activity. Importantly, deletion of astrocytic Cx43 improved neuronal survival in acute ischemia but did not affect RGC function in the absence of injury. In support, pharmacologic inhibition of GJ coupling provided neuroprotection in I/R injury.The increase in Cx43 expression and GJ coupling during acute I/R injury exacerbates RGC loss. Inhibition of astrocytic Cx43 channels might represent a useful strategy to promote RGC survival in pathologic conditions."

This review summarizes the cellular sources, patterns of expression and physiological roles of the macrophage (CSF-1, IL-34), granulocyte-macrophage (GM-CSF) and granulocyte (G-CSF) colony stimulating factors within the nervous system, with a particular focus on their actions on microglia. CSF-1 and IL-34, via the CSF-1R, are required for the development, proliferation and maintenance of essentially all CNS microglia in a temporal and regional specific manner. In contrast, in steady state, GM-CSF and G-CSF are mainly involved in regulation of microglial function. The alterations in expression of these growth factors and their receptors, that have been reported in several neurological diseases, are described and the outcomes of their therapeutic targeting in mouse models and humans are discussed.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Senescence provides programming during development and wound healing, while limiting tumorigenesis. However, pathologic accumulation of senescent cells is implicated in a range of diseases and age-associated morbidities across organ systems. Senescent cells produce distinct paracrine and endocrine signals, causing local tissue dysfunction and exerting deleterious systemic effects. Senescent cell removal by apoptosis-inducing ""senolytic"" agents or therapies that inhibit the senescence-associated secretory phenotype, SASP inhibitors, have demonstrated benefit in both pre-clinical and clinical models of geriatric decline and chronic diseases, suggesting senescent cells represent a pharmacologic target for alleviating effects of fundamental aging processes. However, senescent cell populations are heterogeneous in form, function, tissue distribution, and even differ among species, possibly explaining issues of bench-to-bedside translation in current clinical trials. Here, we review features of senescent cells and strategies for targeting them, including immunologic approaches, as well as key intracellular signaling pathways. Additionally, we survey current senolytic therapies in human trials. Collectively, there is demand for research to develop targeted senotherapeutics that address the needs of the aging and chronically-ill."

Moreover, solid tumors influence circulating lymphocytes, which has been shown for several types of cancer. In our prospective study we elucidate changes in lymphocyte subsets in patients with colorectal carcinoma compared to healthy volunteers.Flow cytometry was performed at diagnosis of colon carcinoma to analyze B cells, T cells and NK cells including various subtypes of each group. Univariate and multivariate analyses including age, gender, tumor stage, sidedness and microsatellite instability status (MSI) were performed.Forty-seven patients and 50 healthy volunteers were included. Median age was 65 years in patients and 43 years in the control group. Univariate analysis revealed lower total lymphocyte counts, lower CD4 + cells, CD8 + cells, B cells and NKs including various of their subsets in patients. In multivariate analysis patients had inferior values of B cells, CD4 + cells and NK cells and various subsets, regardless of age and gender. Naïve, central memory and HLADR + CD8 + cells showed an increase in patients whereas all other altered subsets declined. MSI status had no influence on circulating lymphocytes except for higher effector memory CD8 + cells in MSI-high patients. Localization in the left hemicolon led to higher values of total cytotoxic T cells and various T cell subsets.We found significant changes in circulating lymphocyte subsets in colon carcinoma patients, independent of physiological alterations due to gender or age. For some lymphocyte subsets significant differences according to tumor localization or MSI-status could be seen.© 2021. The Author(s)."

This may reflect the contribution of gender-related factors, such as sex hormones, to COVID-19 pathogenesis. However, the mechanism linking gender disparities to COVID-19 severity is still poorly understood. In this review, we will pinpoint several elements involved in COVID-19 pathogenesis that are regulated by the two main sex hormones, estrogen and androgen. These include tissue specific gene regulation of SARS-CoV2 entry factors, innate and adaptive immune responses to infection, immunometabolism, and susceptibility to tissue injury by cytopathic effect or hyper-inflammatory response. We will discuss the mechanistic link between sex hormone regulation of COVID-19 pathogenetic factors and disease severity. Finally, we will summarize current evidence from clinical studies and trials targeting sex hormones and their signalling in COVID-19.

Despite long-term sequelae are an increasing concern, long-term neuropsychiatric consequences remain largely unclear. This cohort study aimed at investigating the psychopathological impact of COVID-19 in Italy one year after infection, outlining the trajectory of symptomatology at one, six-, and twelve-months follow-up. We evaluated 402, 216, and 192 COVID-19 survivors respectively at one, six, and 12 months. A subgroup of 95 patients was evaluated longitudinally both at one, six, and 12 months. Validated self-report questionnaires were administered to assess depression, fatigue, anxiety, and post-traumatic distress. Socio-demographics and setting of care information were gathered for each participant. At six and twelve months, respectively 94 (44%) and 86 (45%) patients self-rated in the clinical range in at least one psychopathological dimension. Pathological fatigue at twelve months was detected in 63 patients (33%). Considering the longitudinal cohort an interaction effect of sex and time was observed for depression (F = 8.63, p < 0.001) and anxiety (F = 5.42, p = 0.005) with males showing a significant increasing trend of symptoms, whereas an opposite course was observed in females. High prevalence of psychiatric sequelae six and 12 months after COVID-19 was reported for the first time.

"34858409","Why Females Do Better: The X Chromosomal TLR7 Gene-Dose Effect in COVID-19.","Front Immunol","A male sex bias has emerged in the COVID-19 pandemic, fitting to the sex-biased pattern in other viral infections. Males are 2.84 times more often admitted to the ICU and mortality is 1.39 times higher as a result of COVID-19. Various factors play a role in this, and novel studies suggest that the gene-dose of Toll-Like Receptor (TLR) 7 could contribute to the sex-skewed severity. TLR7 is one of the crucial pattern recognition receptors for SARS-CoV-2 ssRNA and the gene-dose effect is caused by X chromosome inactivation (XCI) escape. Female immune cells with TLR7 XCI escape have biallelic TLR7 expression and produce more type 1 interferon (IFN) upon TLR7 stimulation. In COVID-19, TLR7 in plasmacytoid dendritic cells is one of the pattern recognition receptors responsible for IFN production and a delayed IFN response has been associated with immunopathogenesis and mortality. Here, we provide a hypothesis that females may be protected to some extend against severe COVID-19, due to the biallelic TLR7 expression, allowing them to mount a stronger and more protective IFN response early after infection. Studies exploring COVID-19 treatment via the TLR7-mediated IFN pathway should consider this sex difference. Various factors such as age, sex hormones and escape modulation remain to be investigated concerning the TLR7 gene-dose effect.Copyright © 2021 Spiering and de Vries."

However, the presented data are partially conflicting, and mechanisms are difficult to identify from single publications. These shortcomings can be addressed by a systematic review and meta-analysis of current literature. As a first step, we here present the methodology and protocol for a systematic review to answer the following research question: Does ultrasound alter the immune reaction of peripheral solid tumors in humans and animals compared to control conditions without ultrasound?We designed a protocol to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis. The suitability of the protocol to detect and sort relevant literature was tested using a subset of publications. We extracted study characteristics, ultrasound parameters, and study outcomes to pre-evaluate the differences between publications and present the data as a scoping review.From 6532 publications detected by our preliminary literature search, 320 were selected for testing our systematic review protocol. Of the latter, 15 publications were eligible for data extraction. There, we found large differences between study characteristics (e.g., tumor type, age) and ultrasound settings (e.g., wavelength 0.5-9.5 MHz, acoustic pressure 0.0001-15,000 W/cm2). Finally, study outcomes included reports on cells of the innate (e.g., dendritic cells, macrophages) and adaptive immune system (e.g., CD8-/CD4-positive T cells).We designed a protocol to identify relevant literature and perform a systematic review and meta-analysis. The differences between extracted features between publications show the necessity for a comprehensive search and selection strategy in the systematic review to get a complete overview of the literature. Meta-analyses of the extracted outcomes can then enable evidence-based conclusions.© 2021. The Author(s)."

In mixed peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from the same individuals, we show to what extent mitochondrial measures are confounded by both cell type distributions and contaminating platelets. Cell subtype-specific measures among women and men spanning four decades of life indicate potential age- and sex-related differences, including an age-related elevation in mtDNAcn, which are masked or blunted in mixed PBMCs. Finally, a proof-of-concept, repeated-measures study in a single individual validates cell type differences and also reveals week-to-week changes in mitochondrial activities. Larger studies are required to validate and mechanistically extend these findings.

Here, we generated single-cell transcriptome profiles for 350 cells from six primary UV-induced cSCCs, together with matched adjacent skin samples, and three healthy control skin tissues by single-cell RNA-sequencing technology based on Smart-seq2 strategy. A series of bioinformatics analyses and in vitro experiments were used to decipher and validate the critical molecular pattern of cSCC. Results showed that cSCC cells and normal keratinocytes were significantly distinct in gene expression and chromosomal copy number variation. Furthermore, cSCC cells exhibited 18 hallmark pathways of cancer by gene set enrichment analysis. Differential expression analysis demonstrated that many members belonging to S100 gene family, SPRR gene family, and FABP5 were significantly upregulated in cSCC cells. Further experiments confirmed their upregulation and showed that S100A9 or FABP5 knockdown in cSCC cells inhibited their proliferation and migration through NF-κB pathway. Taken together, our data provide a valuable resource for deciphering the molecular pattern in UV-induced cSCC at a single-cell level and suggest that S100A9 and FABP5 may provide novel targets for therapeutic intervention of cSCC in the future.© 2021.

Key profibrotic mechanisms are common pathways involved in tumorigenesis. Characterizing the profibrotic phenotype will help reveal the underlying mechanisms of early development and progression of a variety of human diseases, such as fibrosis and cancer. Fibroblasts have been center stage in response to various stimuli, such as viral infections. However, a comprehensive catalog of cell types involved in this process is currently lacking. Here, we deployed single-cell transcriptomic data across multi-organ systems (i.e., heart, kidney, liver, and lung) to identify novel profibrotic cell populations based on ECM pathway activity at single-cell resolution. In addition to fibroblasts, we also reported that epithelial, endothelial, myeloid, natural killer T, and secretory cells, as well as proximal convoluted tubule cells of the nephron, were significantly actively involved. Cell-type-specific gene signatures were enriched in viral infection pathways, enhanced glycolysis, and carcinogenesis, among others; they were validated using independent datasets in this study. By projecting the signatures into bulk TCGA tumor samples, we could predict prognosis in the patients using profibrotic scores.

In the present study, we summarize the past and ongoing pivotal clinical trials of immunotherapies for ccRCC, emphasizing the potential molecular and cellular mechanisms that lead to the success or failure of ICI therapy. Single-cell analysis of ccRCC has provided a more thorough and detailed understanding of the tumor immune microenvironment and has facilitated the discovery of molecular biomarkers from the tumor-infiltrating immune cells.

Although the clinical management of pediatric leukemia underwent a spectacular improvement during the past decades, resistant disease is a major cause of therapy failure. Currently, only a small proportion of childhood leukemia patients benefit from genomics-driven therapy, as 15-20% of them meet the indication criteria of on-label targeted agents, and their overall response rate falls in a relatively wide range (40-85%). The in-depth scrutiny of various cell populations influencing the development, progression, and treatment resistance of different disease subtypes can potentially uncover a wider range of driver mechanisms for innovative therapeutic interventions."

Although many genes have been found associated with diabetes mellitus, more novel genes are still needed to be discovered towards a complete picture of the underlying mechanism. With the development of complex molecular networks, network-based disease-gene prediction methods have been widely proposed. However, most existing methods are based on the hypothesis of guilt-by-association and often handcraft node features based on local topological structures. Advances in graph embedding techniques have enabled automatically global feature extraction from molecular networks. Inspired by the successful applications of cutting-edge graph embedding methods on complex diseases, we proposed a computational framework to investigate novel genes associated with diabetes mellitus. There are three main steps in the framework: network feature extraction based on graph embedding methods; feature denoising and regeneration using stacked autoencoder; and disease-gene prediction based on machine learning classifiers. We compared the performance by using different graph embedding methods and machine learning classifiers and designed the best workflow for predicting genes associated with diabetes mellitus.

"35022609","Mutation bias reflects natural selection in Arabidopsis thaliana.","Nature","Since the first half of the twentieth century, evolutionary theory has been dominated by the idea that mutations occur randomly with respect to their consequences1. Here we test this assumption with large surveys of de novo mutations in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana. In contrast to expectations, we find that mutations occur less often in functionally constrained regions of the genome-mutation frequency is reduced by half inside gene bodies and by two-thirds in essential genes. With independent genomic mutation datasets, including from the largest Arabidopsis mutation accumulation experiment conducted to date, we demonstrate that epigenomic and physical features explain over 90% of variance in the genome-wide pattern of mutation bias surrounding genes. Observed mutation frequencies around genes in turn accurately predict patterns of genetic polymorphisms in natural Arabidopsis accessions (r = 0.96). That mutation bias is the primary force behind patterns of sequence evolution around genes in natural accessions is supported by analyses of allele frequencies. Finally, we find that genes subject to stronger purifying selection have a lower mutation rate. We conclude that epigenome-associated mutation bias2reduces the occurrence of deleterious mutations in Arabidopsis, challenging the prevailing paradigm that mutation is a directionless force in evolution.© 2022.

"34926276","Why Single-Cell Sequencing Has Promise in MDS.","Front Oncol","Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of diseases characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis. The risk of MDS is associated with aging and the accumulation of somatic mutations in hematopoietic stem cells and progenitors (HSPC). While advances in DNA sequencing in the past decade unveiled clonal selection driven by mutations in MDS, it is unclear at which stage the HSPCs are trapped or what prevents mature cells output. Single-cell-sequencing techniques in recent years have revolutionized our understanding of normal hematopoiesis by identifying the transitional cell states between classical hematopoietic hierarchy stages, and most importantly the biological activities behind cell differentiation and lineage commitment. Emerging studies have adapted these powerful tools to investigate normal hematopoiesis as well as the clonal heterogeneity in myeloid malignancies and provide a progressive description of disease pathogenesis. This review summarizes the potential of growing single-cell-sequencing techniques, the evolving efforts to elucidate hematopoiesis in physiological conditions and MDS at single-cell resolution, and discuss how they may fill the gaps in our current understanding of MDS biology.Copyright © 2021 Zhang and Grimes."

The methyltransferaseDNMT3Ais a key regulator of DNA methylation. AlthoughDNMT3Asomatic mutations in CLL are rare, we found that lowDNMT3Aexpression is associated with more aggressive disease. A conditional knockout mouse model showed that homozygous depletion ofDnmt3afrom B cells results in the development of CLL with 100% penetrance at a median age of onset of 5.3 months, and heterozygousDnmt3adepletion yields a disease penetrance of 89% with a median onset at 18.5 months, confirming its role as a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor. B1a cells were confirmed as the cell of origin of disease in this model, andDnmt3adepletion resulted in focal hypomethylation and activation ofNotchandMycsignaling. Amplification of chromosome 15 containing theMycgene was detected in all CLL mice tested, and infiltration of high-Myc-expressing CLL cells in the spleen was observed. Notably, hyperactivation ofNotchandMycsignaling was exclusively observed in theDnmt3aCLL mice, but not in three other CLL mouse models tested (Sf3b1-Atm,Ikzf3, andMDR), andDnmt3a-depleted CLL were sensitive to pharmacologic inhibition ofNotchsignalingin vitroandin vivo. Consistent with these findings, human CLL samples with lowerDNMT3Aexpression were more sensitive toNotchinhibition than those with higherDNMT3Aexpression. Altogether, these results suggest thatDnmt3adepletion induces CLL that is highly dependent on activation ofNotchandMycsignaling. SIGNIFICANCE: Loss ofDNMT3Aexpression is a driving event in CLL and is associated with aggressive disease, activation ofNotchandMycsignaling, and enhanced sensitivity toNotchinhibition.©2021 American Association for Cancer Research."

However, the assumptions behind the statistical models and performance evaluations in ML software frequently are not met in biological systems. In this Review, we illustrate the impact of several common pitfalls encountered when applying supervised ML in genomics. We explore how the structure of genomics data can bias performance evaluations and predictions. To address the challenges associated with applying cutting-edge ML methods to genomics, we describe solutions and appropriate use cases where ML modelling shows great potential.© 2021.

Although the maternal allele-specific insulator activity of the H19 ICR in regulating imprinted Igf2 expression has been well established, the detailed mechanism by which the H19 ICR controls mono-allelic H19 gene expression has not been fully elucidated. In this study, we evaluated the effect of H19 ICR orientation on imprinting regulation in mutant mice in which the H19 ICR sequence was inverted at the endogenous locus. When the inverted-ICR allele was paternally inherited, the methylation level of the H19 promoter was decreased and the H19 gene was derepressed, suggesting that methylation of the H19 promoter is essential for complete repression of H19 gene expression. Unexpectedly, when the inverted allele was maternally inherited, the expression level of the H19 gene was lower than that of the WT allele, even though the H19 promoter remained fully hypomethylated. These observations suggested that the polarity of the H19 ICR is involved in controlling imprinted H19 gene expression on each parental allele, dependent or independent on DNA methylation of the H19 promoter.© 2021.

We also identify gaps in the literature and priorities for future research.Findings indicate that age, measurement method, reporter, and timing of sleep measurements can influence heritability estimates. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified differences in the heritability of sleep problems when ancestral differences are considered, but sample sizes are small compared to adult GWAS. Most studies focus on sleep variables in the full range rather than on disorder. Studies using objective measures of sleep typically comprised small samples.Current evidence demonstrates a wide range of heritability estimates across sleep phenotypes in childhood and adolescence, but research in larger samples, particularly using objective sleep measures and GWAS, is needed. Further understanding of environmental mechanisms and the interaction between genes and environment is key for future research.© Crown 2021."

This study aimed to examine the associations of AD, CVD, and endocrine-metabolic diseases (EMDs) with the levels of ACE1 and 9 APO proteins (ApoAI, ApoAII, ApoAIV, ApoB, ApoCI, ApoCIII, ApoD, ApoE, and ApoH). Non-Hispanic white individuals including 109 patients with AD, 356 mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 373 CVD, 198 EMD and controls were selected from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. Multivariable general linear model (GLM) was used to examine the associations.ApoEε4 allele was associated with AD, as well as ApoAIV, ApoB and ApoE proteins, but not associated with CVD and EMD. Both AD and CVD were associated with levels of ACE1, ApoB, and ApoH proteins. AD, MCI and EMD were associated with levels of ACE1, ApoAII, and ApoE proteins. This is the first study to report associations of ACE1 and several APO proteins with AD, MCI, CVD and EMD, respectively, including upregulated and downregulated protein levels. In conclusion, as specific or shared biomarkers, the levels of ACE1 and APO proteins are implicated for AD, CVD, EMD andApoEε4 allele. Further studies are required for validation to establish reliable biomarkers for these health conditions."

GPCRs also possess a pivotal role in the regulation of the physiological balance between healthy and pathological conditions; thus, their importance in systems biology cannot be underestimated. The molecular diversity of GPCR signaling systems is likely to be closely associated with disease-associated changes in organismal tissue complexity and compartmentalization, thus enabling a nuanced GPCR-based capacity to interdict multiple disease pathomechanisms at a systemic level. GPCRs have been long considered as controllers of communication between tissues and cells. This communication involves the ligand-mediated control of cell surface receptors that then direct their stimuli to impact cell physiology. Given the tremendous success of GPCRs as therapeutic targets, considerable focus has been placed on the ability of these therapeutics to modulate diseases by acting at cell surface receptors. In the past decade, however, attention has focused upon how stable multiprotein GPCR superstructures, termed receptorsomes, both at the cell surface membrane and in the intracellular domain dictate and condition long-term GPCR activities associated with the regulation of protein expression patterns, cellular stress responses and DNA integrity management. The ability of these receptorsomes (often in the absence of typical cell surface ligands) to control complex cellular activities implicates them as key controllers of the functional balance between health and disease. A greater understanding of this function of GPCRs is likely to significantly augment our ability to further employ these proteins in a multitude of diseases."
"34831907","Social and Biological Transgenerational Underpinnings of Adolescent Pregnancy.","Int J Environ Res Public Health","Adolescent pregnancy (occurring < age 20) is considered a public health problem that creates and perpetuates inequities, affecting not only women, but societies as a whole globally. The efficacy of current approaches to reduce its prevalence is limited. Most existing interventions focus on outcomes without identifying or addressing upstream social and biological causes. Current rhetoric revolves around the need to change girls' individual behaviours during adolescence and puberty. Yet, emerging evidence suggests risk for adolescent pregnancy may be influenced by exposures taking place much earlier during development, starting as early as gametogenesis. Furthermore, pregnancy risks are determined by complex interactions between socio-structural and ecological factors including housing and food security, family structure, and gender-based power dynamics. To explore these interactions, we merge three complimentary theoretical frameworks: ""Eco-Social"", ""Life History"" and ""Developmental Origins of Health and Disease"". We use our new lens to discuss social and biological determinants of two key developmental milestones associated with age at first birth: age at girls' first menstrual bleed (menarche) and age at first sexual intercourse (coitarche). Our review of the literature suggests that promoting stable and safe environments starting at conception (including improving economic and social equity, in addition to gender-based power dynamics) is paramount to effectively curbing adolescent pregnancy rates. Adolescent pregnancy exacerbates and perpetuates social inequities within and across generations. As such, reducing it should be considered a key priority for public health and social change agenda."

Few studies have focused on the effect of noise exposure on the extra auditory system, especially the urinary system. We analyzed 17,154 participants aged 40-79 years from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey between 2013 and 2018. A self-reported questionnaire was used to assess occupational or environmental noise exposure. Logistic regression was used to determine the differences in the prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) based on noise exposure characteristics. For participants with noise exposure, linear regression was performed to determine relationship of the noise exposure period and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). In the noise exposure group, a higher CKD prevalence was associated with females who experienced long-term occupational noise (≥ 240 months) (adjusted OR 2.72, 95% CI 1.11-6.66). An increase of one month of occupational noise exposure was associated with a 0.0106 mL/min/1.73 m2decrease in eGFR in females aged < 60 years. Overall, noise exposure may be a risk factor for reduced renal function, especially long-term occupational noise exposure. More precise studies should determine (1) the relationship between noise and renal function and (2) the underlying mechanisms.© 2021. The Author(s)."

Noise is part of the exposome and is increasingly being investigated as a health risk factor impacting neurological, cardiometabolic, endocrine, and immune health. Beyond the well-characterized effects of high-intensity noise on cochlear damage, noise is relatively well-studied in the cardiovascular field, where evidence is emerging from both human and translational experiments that noise from traffic-related sources could represent a risk factor for hypertension, ischemic heart disease, diabetes, and atherosclerosis. In the present review, we comprehensively discuss the current state of knowledge in the field of noise research. We give a brief survey of the literature documenting experiments in noise exposure in both humans and animals with a focus on cardiovascular disease. We also discuss the mechanisms that have been uncovered in recent years that describe how exposure to noise affects physiological homeostasis, leading to aberrant redox signaling resulting in metabolic and immune consequences, both of which have considerable impact on cardiovascular health. Additionally, we discuss the molecular pathways of redox involvement in the stress responses to noise and how they manifest in disruptions of the circadian rhythm, inflammatory signaling, gut microbiome composition, epigenetic landscape and vessel function.Copyright © 2021 Frenis, Kuntic, Hahad, Bayo Jimenez, Oelze, Daub, Steven, Münzel and Daiber."
"35005326","Multi-omic approaches to acute kidney injury and repair.","Curr Opin Biomed Eng","The kidney has a remarkable regenerative capacity. In response to ischemic or toxic injury, proximal tubule cells can proliferate to rebuild damaged tubules and restore kidney function. However, severe acute kidney injury (AKI) or recurrent AKI events can lead to maladaptive repair and disease progression from AKI to chronic kidney disease (CKD). The application of single cell technologies has identified injured proximal tubule cell states weeks after AKI, distinguished by a pro-inflammatory senescent molecular signature. Epigenetic studies highlighted dynamic changes in the chromatin landscape of the kidney following AKI and described key transcription factors linked to the AKI response. The integration of multi-omic technologies opens new possibilities to improve our understanding of AKI and the driving forces behind the AKI-to-CKD transition, with the ultimate goal of designing tailored diagnostic and therapeutic strategies to improve AKI outcomes and prevent kidney disease progression."
"34921638","Evolving features of human cortical development and the emerging roles of non-coding RNAs in neural progenitor cell diversity and function.","Cell Mol Life Sci","The human cerebral cortex is a uniquely complex structure encompassing an unparalleled diversity of neuronal types and subtypes. These arise during development through a series of evolutionary conserved processes, such as progenitor cell proliferation, migration and differentiation, incorporating human-associated adaptations including a protracted neurogenesis and the emergence of novel highly heterogeneous progenitor populations. Disentangling the unique features of human cortical development involves elucidation of the intricate developmental cell transitions orchestrated by progressive molecular events. Crucially, developmental timing controls the fine balance between cell cycle progression/exit and the neurogenic competence of precursor cells, which undergo morphological transitions coupled to transcriptome-defined temporal states. Recent advances in bulk and single-cell transcriptomic technologies suggest that alongside protein-coding genes, non-coding RNAs exert important regulatory roles in these processes. Interestingly, a considerable number of novel long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) have appeared in human and non-human primates suggesting an evolutionary role in shaping cortical development. Here, we present an overview of human cortical development and highlight the marked diversification and complexity of human neuronal progenitors. We further discuss how lncRNAs and miRNAs constitute critical components of the extended epigenetic regulatory network defining intermediate states of progenitors and controlling cell cycle dynamics and fate choices with spatiotemporal precision, during human neurodevelopment.© 2021.

MicroRNAs (miRs) maintain cellular homeostasis and may regulate the response to environmental stress.We tested the hypothesis that specific miRs are associated with liver disease and PCB exposures in a residential cohort.Sixty-eight targeted hepatotoxicity miRs were measured in archived serum from 734 PCB-exposed participants in the cross-sectional Anniston Community Health Survey. Necrotic and other liver disease categories were defined by serum keratin 18 (K18) biomarkers. Associations were determined between exposure biomarkers (35 ortho-substituted PCB congeners) and disease biomarkers (highly expressed miRs or previously measured cytokines), and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis was performed.The necrotic liver disease category was associated with four up-regulated miRs (miR-99a-5p, miR-122-5p, miR-192-5p, and miR-320a) and five down-regulated miRs (let-7d-5p, miR-17-5p, miR-24-3p, miR-197-3p, and miR-221-3p). Twenty-two miRs were associated with the other liver disease category or with K18 measurements. Eleven miRs were associated with 24 PCBs, most commonly congeners with anti-estrogenic activities. Most of the exposure-associated miRs were associated with at least one serum hepatocyte death, pro-inflammatory cytokine or insulin resistance bioarker, or with both. Within each biomarker category, associations were strongest for the liver-specific miR-122-5p. Pathways of liver toxicity that were identified included inflammation/hepatitis, hyperplasia/hyperproliferation, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Tumor protein p53 and tumor necrosis factorαwere well integrated within the top identified networks.These results support the human hepatotoxicity of environmental PCB exposures while elucidating potential modes of PCB action.

Senescence is a cellular response to a stressor and is observed with aging, but also during wound healing and in embryogenic developmental processes. Senescent cells are metabolically active and secrete a multitude of molecules gathered in the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). The SASP includes inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, growth factors and metalloproteinases, with autocrine and paracrine activities. Among hundreds of molecules, angiopoietin-like 2 (angptl2) is an interesting, although understudied, SASP member identified in various types of senescent cells. Angptl2 is a circulatory protein, and plasma angptl2 levels increase with age and with various chronic inflammatory diseases such as cancer, atherosclerosis, diabetes, heart failure and a multitude of age-related diseases. In this review, we will examine in which context angptl2 was identified as a SASP factor, describe the experimental evidence showing that angptl2 is a marker of senescence in vitro and in vivo, and discuss the impact of angptl2-related senescence in both physiological and pathological conditions. Future work is needed to demonstrate whether the senescence marker angptl2 is a potential clinical biomarker of age-related diseases."

We assessed CCL-2 serum levels in a longitudinal cohort to clarify this association, combined with genetic data to elucidate the regulatory role of CCL-2 in T1D pathogenesis. The Diabetes Autoimmunity Study in the Young (DAISY) followed 310 subjects with high risk of developing T1D. Of these, 42 became persistently seropositive for islet autoantibodies but did not develop T1D (non-progressors); 48 did develop T1D (progressors). CCL-2 serum levels among the three study groups were compared using linear mixed models adjusting for age, sex, HLA genotype, and family history of T1D. Summary statistics were obtained from the CCL-2 protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) andCCR2expression QTL (eQTL) studies. The T1D fine mapping association data were provided by the Type 1 Diabetes Genetics Consortium (T1DGC). Serum CCL-2 levels were significantly lower in both progressors (p = 0.004) and non-progressors (p = 0.005), compared to controls. Two SNPs (rs1799988 and rs746492) in the 3p21.31 genetic locus, which includes the CCL-2 receptor,CCR2, were associated with increasedCCR2expression (p = 8.2e-5 and 5.2e-5, respectively), decreased CCL-2 serum level (p = 2.41e-9 and 6.21e-9, respectively), and increased risk of T1D (p = 7.9e-5 and 7.9e-5, respectively).

If there are no clues as to the identity of the remains, then the age, sex, and origin are the most important factors to limit the search for a matching person. Here, we present the outcome of application of so-called bomb pulse radiocarbon (14C derived from above-ground nuclear bomb tests during 1955-1963) analysis to birthdate human remains. In nine identified cases,14C analysis of tooth crowns provided an estimate of the true date of birth with an average absolute error of 1.2 ± 0.8 years. Analysis of14C in tooth roots also showed a good precision with an average absolute error of 2.3 ± 2.5 years. Levels of14C in bones can determine whether a subject has lived after 1955 or not, but more precise carbon turnover data for bones would be needed to calculate date of birth and date of death. Aspartic acid racemization analysis was performed on samples from four cases; in one of these, the year of birth could be predicted with good precision, whereas the other three cases are still unidentified. The stable isotope13C was analyzed in tooth crowns to estimate provenance. Levels of13C indicative of Scandinavian provenance were found in known Scandinavian subjects. Teeth from four Polish subjects all showed higher13C levels than the average for Scandinavian subjects."

By allowing for timely intervention or preventive measures, epigenomics technologies show promise for public health, notably in population screening. In order to assess whether implementation of epigenomics technologies in population screening may be morally acceptable, it is important to understand - in an early stage of development - ethical and societal issues that may arise. We held 3 focus groups with experts in science and technology studies (STS) (n = 13) in the Netherlands, on 3 potential future applications of epigenomic technologies in screening programmes of increasing scope: cervical cancer, female cancers and 'global' cancer. On the basis of these discussions, this paper identifies ethical issues pertinent to epigenomics-based population screening, such as risk communication, trust and public acceptance; personal responsibility, stigmatisation and societal pressure, and data protection and data governance. It also points out how features of epigenomics (eg, modifiability) and changing concepts (eg, of cancer) may challenge the existing evaluative framework for screening programmes. This paper aims to anticipate and prepare for future ethical challenges when epigenomics technologies can be tested and introduced in public health settings.© The Author(s) 2021."

Then, multiple machine learning algorithms were applied to develop and validate a diagnostic signature by comparing cHL with normal control. In addition, we identified prognostic genes and built a prognostic model with them to predict the prognosis for 130 patients with cHL which were treated with first-line treatment (ABVD chemotherapy or an ABVD-like regimen).A diagnostic prediction signature was constructed and showed high specificity and sensitivity (training cohort: AUC=0.981,95% CI 0.933-0.998, P<0.001, validation cohort: AUC=0.955,95% CI 0.895-0.986, P<0.001).

Abnormal glycosylation of these glycoproteins may activate tumor signal transduction and lead to tumor development. The tumor microenvironment alters its molecular composition, some of which regulate protein glycosylation biosynthesis. The glycosylation of saliva proteins in lung cancer patients is different from healthy controls, in which the glycans of cancer patients are highly sialylated and hyperfucosylated. Most studies have shown that O-glycans from cancer are truncated O-glycans, while N-glycans contain fucoses and sialic acids. Because glycosylation analysis is challenging, there are few reports on how glycosylation of saliva proteins is related to the occurrence or progression of lung cancer. In this review, we discussed glycoenzymes involved in protein glycosylation, their changes in tumor microenvironment, potential tumor biomarkers present in body fluids, and abnormal glycosylation of saliva or lung glycoproteins. We further explored the effect of glycosylation changes on tumor signal transduction, and emphasized the role of receptor tyrosine kinases in tumorigenesis and metastasis.© 2021 The Author(s)."

Fifteen candidate protein markers and 3 candidate epigenetic markers were validated first in primary breast tumours and then in plasma samples of cases [N = 202 invasive, 16 DCIS] and controls [N = 203 healthy, 37 benign] using antibody array and methylation specific PCR. Diagnostic efficiency of single and combined markers was assessed. Combination of 6 protein markers (Adipsin, Leptin, Syndecan-1, Basic fibroblast growth factor, Interleukin 17B and Dickopff-3) resulted in 65% sensitivity and 80% specificity in detecting breast cancer. Multivariate diagnostic analysis of methylation status of SOSTDC1, DACT2, WIF1 showed 100% sensitivity and up to 91% specificity in discriminating BC from benign and controls. Hence, combination of SOSTDC1, DACT2 and WIF1 was effective in differentiating breast cancer [non-invasive and invasive] from benign diseases of the breast and healthy individuals and could help as a complementary diagnostic tool for breast cancer.© 2022.

Early screening tools that can: i) detect with high specificity and sensitivity before conventional tools such as transvaginal ultrasound and CA-125, ii) use non-invasive sampling methods and iii) longitudinally significantly increase survival rates in ovarian cancer are needed. Studies that employ blood-based screening tools using circulating tumor-cells, -DNA, and most recently tumor-derived small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) have shown promise in non-invasive detection of cancer before standard of care. Our findings in this study show the promise of a sEV-derived signature as a non-invasive longitudinal screening tool in ovarian cancer.Human serum samples as well as plasma and ascites from a mouse model of ovarian cancer were collected at various disease stages. Small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) were extracted using a commercially available kit. RNA was isolated from lysed sEVs, and quantitative RT-PCR was performed to identify specific metastatic gene expression.This paper highlights the potential of sEVs in monitoring ovarian cancer progression and metastatic development. We identified a 7-gene panel in sEVs derived from plasma, serum, and ascites that overlapped with an established metastatic ovarian carcinoma signature. We found the 7-gene panel to be differentially expressed with tumor development and metastatic spread in a mouse model of ovarian cancer. The most notable finding was a significant change in the ascites-derived sEV gene signature that overlapped with that of the plasma-derived sEV signature at varying stages of disease progression. While there were quantifiable changes in genes from the 7-gene panel in serum-derived sEVs from ovarian cancer patients, we were unable to establish a definitive signature due to low sample number. Taken together our findings show that differential expression of metastatic genes derived from circulating sEVs present a minimally invasive screening tool for ovarian cancer detection and longitudinal monitoring of molecular changes associated with progression and metastatic spread.Copyright © 2021 Gonda, Zhao, Shah, Siebert, Gunda, Inan, Kwon, Libutti, Moghe, Francis and Ganapathy."

Articles reporting the use of cfDNA liquid biopsy in the screening or diagnosis of gastrointestinal cancers were included in the analysis.A total of 263 articles were screened for eligibility, of which 13 articles were included. Studies investigated colorectal cancer (5 studies), pancreatic cancer (2 studies), hepatocellular carcinoma (3 studies), and multi-cancer detection (3 studies), including gastric, oesophageal, or bile duct cancer, representing a total of 4824 patients. Test sensitivities ranged from 71% to 100%, and specificities ranged from 67.4% to 100%. Pre-cancerous lesions detection was less performant with a sensitivity of 16.9% and a 100% specificity in one study. Another study using a large biobank demonstrated a 94.9% sensitivity in detecting cancer up to 4 years before clinical symptoms, with a 61% accuracy in tissue-of-origin identification.cfDNA liquid biopsy seems capable of detecting gastrointestinal cancers at an early stage of development in a non-invasive and repeatable manner and screening simultaneously for multiple cancer types in a single blood sample.

The nanosquare array with a diameter of 250 nm and irradiated with electromagnetic waves with a wavelength of around 800 nm possessed the greatest electric field distribution compared to the other variations of diameters and wavelengths. The results of the absorption measurement and simulation showed a greater shift in absorption peak wavelength when carried out using the Ag nanosquare array. The absorption peak wavelengths of the Ag nanosquare array in normal blood and blood with cancer lymphocytes were 700-774 nm and 800-850 nm, respectively. The electrochemical test showed that the sensitivity values of the Ag thin-film electrode deposited using DC sputtering, the Ag thin-film electrode deposited using spin coating, and the Ag nanosquare array in detecting PBS+BSA concentration in the cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiment were 1.308 µA mM-1cm-2, 0.022 µA mM-1cm-2, and 39.917 µA mM-1cm-2, respectively. Meanwhile, the sensitivity values of the Ag thin film and the Ag nanosquare array in detecting the PBS+BSA concentration in the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement were 6593.76 Ohm·cm2/mM and 69,000 Ohm·cm2/mM, respectively. Thus, our analysis of the optical and electrochemical characteristics of Ag thin films and Ag nanosquare arrays showed that both can be used as an alternative biomedical technology to monitor the prognosis of blood cancer based on the concentration of serum albumin in blood."

Non-invasive bioimaging tools such as fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) and Raman-microspectroscopy have evolved over the last decade, providing the potential to be translated into clinics for early-stage disease detection, in vitro drug screening, and drug efficacy studies in personalized medicine. Accessing tissue- and cell-specific spectral signatures, Raman microspectroscopy has emerged as a diagnostic tool to identify precancerous lesions, cancer stages, or cell malignancy. In vivo Raman measurements have been enabled by recent technological advances in Raman endoscopy and signal-enhancing setups such as coherent anti-stokes Raman spectroscopy or surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy. FLIM enables in situ investigations of metabolic processes such as glycolysis, oxidative stress, or mitochondrial activity by using the autofluorescence of co-enzymes NADH and FAD, which are associated with intrinsic proteins as a direct measure of tumor metabolism, cell death stages and drug efficacy. The combination of non-invasive and molecular-sensitive in situ techniques and advanced 3D tumor models such as patient-derived organoids or microtumors allows the recapitulation of tumor physiology and metabolism in vitro and facilitates the screening for patient-individualized drug treatment options."

Thus, a rapid and inexpensive detection method is required for disease diagnosis. We have previously reported that cytosine methylation in G-quadruplex (G4)-forming oligonucleotides develops different G4 topologies. In this study, we developed a method for detecting CpG methylation in G4-forming oligonucleotides based on the structural differences between methylated and unmethylated G4 DNAs. The differences in G4 topologies due to CpG methylation can be discriminated by G4 ligands. We performed a binding assay between methylated or unmethylated G4 DNAs and G4 ligands. The binding abilities of fluorescent G4 ligands toBCL-2,HRAS1,HRAS2,VEGFG4-forming sequences were examined by fluorescence-based microtiter plate assay. The differences in fluorescence intensities between methylated and unmethylated G4 DNAs were statistically significant. In addition to fluorescence detection, the binding of G4 ligand to DNA was detected by chemiluminescence. A significant difference was also detected in chemiluminescence intensity between methylated and unmethylated DNA. This is the first study on the detection of CpG methylation in G4 structures, focusing on structural changes using G4 ligands."

An unresolved question is how cell type-specific 3D genome structures are established during development. Here, we analyzed 3D genome structures in muscle cells from mice lacking the muscle lineage transcription factor (TF), MyoD, versus wild-type mice. We show that MyoD functions as a ""genome organizer"" that specifies 3D genome architecture unique to muscle cell development, and that H3K27ac is insufficient for the establishment of MyoD-induced chromatin loops in muscle cells. Moreover, we present evidence that other cell lineage-specific TFs might also exert functional roles in orchestrating lineage-specific 3D genome organization during development.© 2022.

During the last decades, the genetic basis of several monogenic forms of diabetes has been recognized. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have also facilitated the identification of common genetic variants associated with an increased risk of diabetes. These studies highlight the importance of impaired β cell function in all forms of diabetes. However, how most of these risk variants confer disease risk, remains unanswered. Understanding the specific contribution of genetic variants and the precise role of their molecular effectors is the next step toward developing treatments that target β cell dysfunction in the era of personalized medicine. Protocols that allow derivation of β cells from pluripotent stem cells, represent a powerful research tool that allows modeling of human development and versatile experimental designs that can be used to shed some light on diabetes pathophysiology. This article reviews different models to study the genetic basis of β cell dysfunction, focusing on the recent advances made possible by stem cell applications in the field of diabetes research."
"34975594","Rewiring of the Serotonin System in Major Depression.","Front Psychiatry","Serotonin is a key neurotransmitter that is implicated in a wide variety of behavioral and cognitive phenotypes. Originating in the raphe nuclei, 5-HT neurons project widely to innervate many brain regions implicated in the functions. During the development of the brain, as serotonin axons project and innervate brain regions, there is evidence that 5-HT plays key roles in wiring the developing brain, both by modulating 5-HT innervation and by influencing synaptic organization within corticolimbic structures. These actions are mediated by 14 different 5-HT receptors, with region- and cell-specific patterns of expression. More recently, the role of the 5-HT system in synaptic re-organization during adulthood has been suggested. The 5-HT neurons have the unusual capacity to regrow and reinnervate brain regions following insults such as brain injury, chronic stress, or altered development that result in disconnection of the 5-HT system and often cause depression, anxiety, and cognitive impairment. Chronic treatment with antidepressants that amplify 5-HT action, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), appears to accelerate the rewiring of the 5-HT system by mechanisms that may be critical to the behavioral and cognitive improvements induced in these models. In this review, we survey the possible 5-HT receptor mechanisms that could mediate 5-HT rewiring and assess the evidence that 5-HT-mediated brain rewiring is impacting recovery from mental illness. By amplifying 5-HT-induced rewiring processes using SSRIs and selective 5-HT agonists, more rapid and effective treatments for injury-induced mental illness or cognitive impairment may be achieved.Copyright © 2021 Vahid-Ansari and Albert."

With advances in RNA detection, various forms of RNA methylation can be found, including N6-methyladenosine (m6A), N1-methyladenosine (m1A), and 5-methylcytosine (m5C). Emerging reports confirm that dysregulation of RNA methylation gives rise to a variety of human diseases, particularly hepatocellular carcinoma. We will summarize essential regulators of RNA methylation and biological functions of these modifications in coding and noncoding RNAs.

MM is the second most common hematologic malignancy, and it poses a heavy economic and social burden because it remains incurable and confers a profound disability to patients. Despite current progress in MM treatment, the disease invariably recurs, even after the transplantation of autologous hematopoietic stem cells (ASCT). Biological processes leading to a pathological myeloma clone and the mechanisms of further evolution of the disease are far from complete understanding. Genetically, MM is a complex disease that demonstrates a high level of heterogeneity. Myeloma genomes carry numerous genetic changes, including structural genome variations and chromosomal gains and losses, and these changes occur in combinations with point mutations affecting various cellular pathways, including genome maintenance. MM genome instability in its extreme is manifested in mutationkataegisand complex genomic rearrangements: chromothripsis, templated insertions, and chromoplexy. Chemotherapeutic agents used to treat MM add another level of complexity because many of them exacerbate genome instability. Genome abnormalities are driver events and deciphering their mechanisms will help understand the causes of MM and play a pivotal role in developing new therapies."

MCQs were validated and tested for their reliability. Self-assessment of students' genetics knowledge was also determined by asking them whether their knowledge in genetics is sufficient or not sufficient for their future clinical practice. Data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20.Forty-one second-year and thirty fourth-year medical students took the Genetic test. Exam results showed insufficient knowledge of Genetics, with 43.85% among the students answering the exam correctly. In self-assessment, the majority (83.3% to 87.8%) of the respondents considered their knowledge of genetics insufficient for future clinical practice. A higher knowledge level of basic genetics compared with clinically related genetics concepts was observed. Generally, second-year students significantly scored higher in molecular and cytogenetics (P=0.012), principles of genetic transmission (P=0.022), and inheritance of genetic diseases (P=0.024), compared with the fourth-year medical students who only scored higher in items related to cancer genetics (P=0.022).Medical students' genetics knowledge is insufficient, especially on clinically oriented concepts like genetic testing and genetic counseling and should be strengthened for future clinical practice.

Rats in the model group were intratracheally instilled with 50 mg/mL silicon dioxide (1 mL per rat) and rats in the control group were treated with 1.0 mL saline (1 mL per rat). Twenty-eight days later, transcriptomic analysis by microarray and tandem mass tags (TMT)-based proteomic analysis were performed to reveal the expression of mRNAs and proteins in lung tissues. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) were applied to analyze the altered genes and proteins. The integrated analysis was performed between transcriptome and proteome. The data were further verified by RT-qPCR and parallel reaction monitoring (PRM).In total, 1769 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 650 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified between the silicosis model and control groups. The integrated analysis showed 250 DEPs were correlated to the corresponding DEGs (cor-DEPs-DEGs), which were mainly enriched in phagosome, leukocyte transendothelial migration, complement and coagulation cascades and cellular adhesion molecule (CAM).

Risk factor exposure can modify EC signaling and behavior, leading to arterial and venous disease development. Here, we aimed to identify biomarker panels for the assessment of EC dysfunction, which could be useful for risk stratification or to monitor treatment response. Approach and Results: We used affinity proteomics to identify EC proteins circulating in plasma that were associated with cardiovascular disease risk factor exposure. Two hundred sixteen proteins, which we previously predicted to be EC-enriched across vascular beds, were measured in plasma samples (N=1005) from the population-based SCAPIS (Swedish Cardiopulmonary Bioimage Study) pilot. Thirty-eight of these proteins were associated with body mass index, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, smoking, hypertension, or diabetes. Sex-specific analysis revealed that associations predominantly observed in female- or male-only samples were most frequently with the risk factors body mass index, or total cholesterol and smoking, respectively. We show a relationship between individual cardiovascular disease risk, calculated with the Framingham risk score, and the corresponding biomarker profiles.EC proteins in plasma could reflect vascular health status."

This study aims to investigate the impact of these compounds on the healthspan and mitochondrial functions in an invertebrate in vivo model and in vitro in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, and to investigate the potential of polyphenolic metabolites to compensate for potential impacts. Wild-type nematodes (Caenorhabditis elegans,N2) were treated with pesticides such as pyraclostrobin (Pyr), glyphosate (Gly), or fluopyram (Fluo). The lifespans of the nematodes under heat stress conditions (37 °C) were determined, and the chemotaxis was assayed. Energetic metabolites, including adenosine triphosphate (ATP), lactate, and pyruvate, were analyzed in lysates of nematodes and cells. Genetic expression patterns of several genes associated with lifespan determination and mitochondrial parameters were assessed via qRT-PCR. After incubation with environmentally hazardous substances, nematodes were incubated with a pre-fermented polyphenol mixture (Rechtsregulat®Bio, RR) or protocatechuic acid (PCA) to determine heat stress resistance. Treatment with Pyr, Glyph and Fluo leads to dose-dependently decreased heat stress resistance, which was significantly improved by RR and PCA. The chemotaxes of the nematodes were not affected by pesticides. ATP levels were not significantly altered by the pesticides, except for Pyr, which increased ATP levels after 48 h leads. The gene expression of healthspan and mitochondria-associated genes were diversely affected by the pesticides, while Pyr led to an overall decrease of mRNA levels. Over time, the treatment of nematodes leads to a recovery of the nematodes on the mitochondrial level but not on stress resistance on gene expression. Fermented extracts of fruits and vegetables and phenolic metabolites such as PCA seem to have the potential to recover the vitality ofC. elegansafter damage caused by pesticides."

Gestational exposure to acute stress, such as that derived from the earthquake experienced on 19 September 2017 in Mexico City, could be associated with changes in mtDNAcn at birth. Our study used data from the OBESO (Biochemical and Epigenetic Origins of Overweight and Obesity) perinatal cohort in Mexico City. We compared the mtDNAcn in the umbilical cord blood of 22 infants born before the earthquake, 24 infants whose mothers were pregnant at the time of the earthquake (exposed), and 37 who were conceived after the earthquake (post-earthquake). We quantified mtDNAcn by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction normalized with a nuclear gene. We used a linear model adjusted by maternal age, body mass index, socioeconomic status, perceived stress, and pregnancy comorbidities. Compared to non-exposed newborns (mean ± SD mtDNAcn: 0.740 ± 0.161), exposed and post-earthquake newborns (mtDNAcn: 0.899 ± 0.156 and 0.995 ± 0.169, respectively) had increased mtDNAcn,p= 0.001. The findings of this study point at mtDNAcn as a potential biological marker of acute stress and suggest that experiencing an earthquake during pregnancy or before gestation can have programing effects in the unborn child. Long-term follow-up of newborns to women who experience stress prenatally, particularly that derived from a natural disaster, is warranted."

Intermediate outcomes have been noted in patients with p16+ tumors and smoking exposure. However, the extent of smoking exposure required for outcomes to decrease has not been delineated due to low failure rates and poor availability of quantitative tobacco smoke exposure data. Our primary objective is to characterize the dose-dependent relationship between recurrence-free survival (RFS) and tobacco smoke exposure in p16+ OPSCC and secondarily correlate tobacco smoke exposure with genomic alterations.Single institution chart review was performed of patients diagnosed with p16+ OPSCC from 2003 to 2015. Patients were excluded if staging, treatment details, recurrence status, or smoking exposure in pack-years were not available. Two hundred and forty-four patients were included.Patients with 25 pack-years or greater smoking history exhibited a dose-dependent decrease in RFS compared to never smokers. This was robust to multivariate analysis for including staging and demographic factors. Forty-three patients with available targeted tumor sequencing data were identified. A strong trend was observed for increased C to A transversion mutations above 25 pack-years, which are known to be associated with exposure to tobacco smoke. Similarly, the proportion of COSMIC Signature 4 mutations were also found to be more common in patients with more than 25 pack-years of smoking exposure.Evidence-based smoking exposure thresholds are needed to define inclusion criteria for trials of de-escalation therapy for p16+ OPSCC. Patients with smoking exposure greater than 20 pack-years have increased risk of recurrence and a distinct pattern of genomic alterations. Further studies are needed to delineate the potential consequences of mild smoking exposure.

Epidemiological studies showed that obesity might influence many cancers including OC. One of the key factors that may link obesity and OC is leptin (LEP), known as an adipokine with pleiotropic effects on body homeostasis. This study aims to investigate the expression pattern of LEP, assess the methylation profiles ofLEPand their associations with clinicopathological features including survival outcomes of OC patients. The protein expression of LEP was evaluated in 208 samples using both tissue microarray and immunohistochemistry techniques. The methylation profiles ofLEPwere measured in 63 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissues by quantitative polymerase chain reaction using a MethyLight assay. Our results showed a significant association of LEP protein overexpression with several clinicopathological variables, mainly tumor subtype, LVI, age of menarche, tumor size and stage (p <0.04). Kaplan-Meier analysis (using low expression versus high expression as a discriminator) indicated that LEP protein overexpression is a powerful positive prognosticator of both OC recurrence (DFS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) in our OC cohort (log-rankp= 0.01 andp= 0.002, respectively). This implies that patients with high LEP expression profiles live longer with less recurrence rates. Methylation analysis results demonstrated a clear association between no/low LEP protein expression pattern (38%) and LEP promoter CpG island hypermethylation (43%). Results of this study suggest that LEP is a powerful prognosticator of OC recurrence and DSS.LEPexpression in OC seems to be regulated by its promoter hypermethylation through gene partial/total silencing. Further multi-institutional studies using larger cohorts are required to demystify the intricate molecular functions of this leptin-driven effects in OC pathophysiology and to accurately assess its theranostic potential and validate its prognostic/predictive power in OC onset, progression towards more effective and personalized management of OC patients."

ChIP-seq of Histone H3K27 acetylation (H3K27ac) has revealed enhancers that play an important role in CRC. This study examined the relationship between an active CRC enhancer and claudin-1 (CLDN1), and its effect on CRC radiation resistance.The target CRC genes of active enhancers were obtained from public H3K27ac ChIP-seq, and the genes highly expressed in radio-resistant CRC were screened and intersected with enhancer-driven genes. The clinical roles of CLDN1 in radiation resistance were examined using the t-test, standard mean deviation (SMD), summary receiver operating characteristic curve and Kaplan-Meier curves. The co-expressed genes of CLDN1 were calculated using Pearson Correlation analysis, and Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes and Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) analyses were used to examine the molecular mechanisms of CLDN1.Total 13 703 CRC genes were regulated by enhancers using 58 H3K27ac ChIP-seq. Claudin-1 (CLDN1) was enhancer-driven and notably up-regulated in CRC tissues compared to non-CRC controls, with a SMD of 3.45 (95 CI % = .56-4.35).

"34834492","Role of Sex on the Genetic Susceptibility to Childhood Asthma in Latinos and African Americans.","J Pers Med","Asthma is a respiratory disease whose prevalence changes throughout the lifespan and differs by sex, being more prevalent in males during childhood and in females after puberty. In this study, we assessed the influence of sex on the genetic susceptibility to childhood asthma in admixed populations. Sex-interaction and sex-stratified genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were performed in 4291 Latinos and 1730 African Americans separately, and results were meta-analyzed. Genome-wide (p≤ 9.35 × 10-8) and suggestive (p≤ 1.87 × 10-6) population-specific significance thresholds were calculated based on 1000 Genomes Project data. Additionally, protein quantitative trait locus (pQTL) information was gathered for the suggestively associated variants, and enrichment analyses of the proteins identified were carried out. Four independent loci showed interaction with sex at a suggestive level. The stratified GWAS highlighted the 17q12-21 asthma locus as a contributor to asthma susceptibility in both sexes but reached genome-wide significance only in females (p-females < 9.2 × 10-8;p-males < 1.25 × 10-2). Conversely, genetic variants upstream of ligand-dependent nuclear receptor corepressor-like gene (LCORL), previously involved in height determination and spermatogenesis, were associated with asthma only in males (minimump= 5.31 × 10-8for rs4593128). Enrichment analyses revealed an overrepresentation of processes related to the immune system and highlighted differences between sexes. In conclusion, we identified sex-specific polymorphisms that could contribute to the differences in the prevalence of childhood asthma between males and females."
"34885197","Integration of Tumor Heterogeneity for Recurrence Prediction in Patients with Esophageal Squamous Cell Cancer.","Cancers (Basel)","Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is one of the deadliest malignancies in China. The prognostic value of mutations, especially those in minor tumor clones, has not been systematically investigated. We conducted targeted deep sequencing to analyze the mutation status and the cancer cell fraction (CCF) of mutations in 201 ESCC patients. Our analysis showed that the prognostic effect of mutations was relevant to the CCF, and it should be considered in prognosis prediction. EP300 was a promising biomarker for overall survival, impairing prognosis in a CCF dose-dependent manner. We constructed a CCF-based predictor using a smooth clipped absolute deviation Cox model in the training set of 143 patients. The 3-year disease-free survival rates were 6.3% (95% CI: 1.6-23.9%), 29.8% (20.9-42.6%) and 70.5% (56.6-87.7%) in high-, intermediate- and low-risk patients, respectively, in the training set. The prognostic accuracy was verified in a validation set of 58 patients and the TCGA-ESCC cohort. The eight-gene model predicted prognosis independent of clinicopathological factors and the combination of our model and pathological staging markedly improved the prognostic accuracy of pathological staging alone. Our study describes a novel recurrence predictor for ESCC patients and provides a new perspective for the clinical translation of genomic findings."

"34987221","Decoding gene regulation in the fly brain.","Nature","The Drosophila brain is a frequently used model in neuroscience. Single-cell transcriptome analysis1-6, three-dimensional morphological classification7and electron microscopy mapping of the connectome8,9have revealed an immense diversity of neuronal and glial cell types that underlie an array of functional and behavioural traits in the fly. The identities of these cell types are controlled by gene regulatory networks (GRNs), involving combinations of transcription factors that bind to genomic enhancers to regulate their target genes. Here, to characterize GRNs at the cell-type level in the fly brain, we profiled the chromatin accessibility of 240,919 single cells spanning 9 developmental timepoints and integrated these data with single-cell transcriptomes. We identify more than 95,000 regulatory regions that are used in different neuronal cell types, of which 70,000 are linked to developmental trajectories involving neurogenesis, reprogramming and maturation. For 40 cell types, uniquely accessible regions were associated with their expressed transcription factors and downstream target genes through a combination of motif discovery, network inference and deep learning, creating enhancer GRNs. The enhancer architectures revealed by DeepFlyBrain lead to a better understanding of neuronal regulatory diversity and can be used to design genetic driver lines for cell types at specific timepoints, facilitating their characterization and manipulation.© 2022.

"34863284","Concurrent mapping of multiple epigenetic marks and co-occupancy using ACT2-seq.","Cell Biosci","Genome-wide profiling of epigenetic marks is a core technology in molecular genetics. Co-occupancy of different epigenetic marks or protein factors at the same genomic locations must often be inferred from multiple independently collected data sets. However, this strategy does not provide direct evidence of co-enrichment in the same cells due to the existence of cellular heterogeneity. To address this issue, we have developed a technique termed ACT2-seq that is capable of concurrently profiling multiple epigenetic marks in a single biological sample. In addition to reducing the numbers of samples required for experiments, ACT2-seq is capable of mapping co-occupancy of epigenetic factors on chromatin. This strategy provides direct evidence of co-enrichment without requiring complex single-molecule, single-cell, or magnetic bead-based approaches.We concurrently profiled pairs of two epigenetic marks using ACT2-seq as well as three marks in individual samples. Data obtained using ACT2-seq were found to be reproducible and robust. ACT2-seq was capable of cleanly partitioning concurrently mapped data sets that exhibited distinct enrichment patterns. Using ACT2-seq, we identified distinct relationships between co-occupancy of specific histone modifications and gene expression patterns.We conclude that ACT2-seq presents an attractive option for epigenomic profiling due to its ease of use, potential for reducing sample and sequencing costs, and ability to simultaneously profile co-occupancy of multiple histone marks and/or chromatin-associated proteins.© 2021.

The constellation of transcription factors and chromatin regulatory complexes in cells results in characteristic patterns of chromatin accessibility. The study of these patterns in tissues has been limited because existing chromatin accessibility assays are ineffective for archival formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues. We have developed a method to efficiently extract intact chromatin from archival tissue via enhanced cavitation with a nanodroplet reagent consisting of a lipid shell with a liquid perfluorocarbon core. Inclusion of nanodroplets during the extraction of chromatin from FFPE tissues enhances the recovery of intact accessible and nucleosome-bound chromatin. We show that the addition of nanodroplets to the chromatin accessibility assay formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements (FAIRE), does not affect the accessible chromatin signal. Applying the technique to FFPE human tumor xenografts, we identified tumor-relevant regions of accessible chromatin shared with those identified in primary tumors. Further, we deconvoluted non-tumor signal to identify cellular components of the tumor microenvironment. Incorporation of this method of enhanced cavitation into FAIRE offers the potential for extending chromatin accessibility to clinical diagnosis and personalized medicine, while also enabling the exploration of gene regulatory mechanisms in archival samples.© 2021 Marcel et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press."

These GRNs control temporal patterning in primary progenitors, regulate transition from primary to neurogenic progenitors, and drive specification of each major retinal cell type. We confirm that NFI transcription factors selectively activate expression of genes promoting late-stage temporal identity in primary retinal progenitors and identify other transcription factors that regulate rod photoreceptor specification in postnatal retina.

"34998435","The Alzheimer susceptibility gene BIN1 induces isoform-dependent neurotoxicity through early endosome defects.","Acta Neuropathol Commun","The Bridging Integrator 1 (BIN1) gene is a major susceptibility gene for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Deciphering its pathophysiological role is challenging due to its numerous isoforms. Here we observed in Drosophila that human BIN1 isoform1 (BIN1iso1) overexpression, contrary to human BIN1 isoform8 (BIN1iso8) and human BIN1 isoform9 (BIN1iso9), induced an accumulation of endosomal vesicles and neurodegeneration. Systematic search for endosome regulators able to prevent BIN1iso1-induced neurodegeneration indicated that a defect at the early endosome level is responsible for the neurodegeneration. In human induced neurons (hiNs) and cerebral organoids, BIN1 knock-out resulted in the narrowing of early endosomes. This phenotype was rescued by BIN1iso1 but not BIN1iso9 expression. Finally, BIN1iso1 overexpression also led to an increase in the size of early endosomes and neurodegeneration in hiNs. Altogether, our data demonstrate that the AD susceptibility gene BIN1, and especially BIN1iso1, contributes to early-endosome size deregulation, which is an early pathophysiological hallmark of AD pathology.© 2022.

Both factors are dynamic throughout male germ cell differentiation on the seminiferous tubule, despite the transcriptional inactivation in the last stages of spermatogenesis. Sperm maturation during the caput-to-cauda transit on the epididymis involves changes in chromatin organization and the soma-to-germ line transference of ncRNAs that are essential to obtain a functional sperm for fertilization and embryo development. Here, the male environment (diseases, drugs, mental stress) is crucial to modulate these epigenetic factors throughout sperm maturation, affecting the corresponding offspring. Paternal transgenerational inheritance has been directly related to sperm epigenetic changes, most of them associated with variations in the ncRNA content and chromatin marks. Our aim is to give an overview about how epigenetics, focused on ncRNAs and chromatin, is pivotal to understand spermatogenesis and sperm maturation, and how the male environment impacts the sperm epigenome modulating the offspring gene expression pattern.© 2021.

Current strategies, albeit successful in moderately reducing morbidity and mortality of BPD, failed to draw overall satisfactory conclusion. Here, using a typical mouse model mimicking hallmarks of BPD, we revealed that both cord blood-derived mononuclear cells (CB-MNCs) and umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) are efficient in alleviating BPD. Notably, infusion of CB-MNCs has more prominent effects in preventing alveolar simplification and pulmonary vessel loss, restoring pulmonary respiratory functions and balancing inflammatory responses. To further elucidate the underlying mechanisms within the divergent therapeutic effects of UC-MSC and CB-MNC, we systematically investigated the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA)-microRNA (miRNA)-messenger RNA (mRNA) and circular RNA (circRNA)-miRNA-mRNA networks by whole-transcriptome sequencing. Importantly, pathway analysis integrating Gene Ontology (GO)/Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)/gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) method indicates that the competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network is mainly related to the regulation of GTPase activity (GO: 0043087), extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (ERK1) and ERK2 signal cascade (GO: 0070371), chromosome regulation (GO: 0007059), and cell cycle control (GO: 0044770). Through rigorous selection of the lncRNA/circRNA-based ceRNA network, we demonstrated that the hub genes reside in UC-MSC- and CB-MNC-infused networks directed to the function of cell adhesion, motor transportation (Cdk13, Lrrn2), immune homeostasis balance, and autophagy (Homer3, Prkcd) relatively. Our studies illustrate the first comprehensive mRNA-miRNA-lncRNA and mRNA-miRNA-circRNA networks in stem cell-infused BPD model, which will be valuable in identifying reliable biomarkers or therapeutic targets for BPD pathogenesis and shed new light in the priming and conditioning of UC-MSCs or CB-MNCs in the treatment of neonatal lung injury.Copyright © 2021 Chen, Chen, Du, Liu, Fei, Peng, Zhang, Xiao, Wang, Yang and Feng."

We investigated the effects of chronic RU dietary exposure (46.8 mg kg-1day-1glyphosate) for 5 weeks in 32-week-old roosters (n= 5 RU-exposed andn= 5 control (CT)). Although the concentrations of glyphosate and its main metabolite AMPA (aminomethylphosphonic acid) increased in blood plasma and seminal fluid during exposure, no significant differences in testis weight and sperm concentrations were observed between RU and CT roosters. However, sperm motility was significantly reduced, associated with decreased calcium and ATP concentrations in RU spermatozoa. Plasma testosterone and oestradiol concentrations increased in RU roosters. These negative effects ceased 14 days after RU removal from the diet. Epigenetic analysis showed a global DNA hypomethylation in RU roosters. After artificial insemination of hens (n= 40) with sperm from CT or RU roosters, eggs were collected and artificially incubated. Embryo viability did not differ, but chicks from RU roosters (n= 118) had a higher food consumption, body weight and subcutaneous adipose tissue content. Chronic dietary RU exposure in roosters reduces sperm motility and increases plasma testosterone levels, growth performance, and fattening in offspring."

Deep learning (DL) can learn an informative representation that addresses the need for defining relevant features. However, deep learning models are computationally expensive, and they require large training datasets to achieve good classification performance.One approach to addressing these challenges is to use a less complex deep learning network for feature selection and Machine Learning (ML) for classification. In the current study, we introduce a hybrid DL-ML approach that uses a deep neural network for extracting molecular features and a non-DL classifier to predict environmentally responsive transgenerational differential DNA methylated regions (DMRs), termed epimutations, based on the extracted DL-based features. Various environmental toxicant induced epigenetic transgenerational inheritance sperm epimutations were used to train the model on the rat genome DNA sequence and use the model to predict transgenerational DMRs (epimutations) across the entire genome.The approach was also used to predict potential DMRs in the human genome. Experimental results show that the hybrid DL-ML approach outperforms deep learning and traditional machine learning methods.© 2021. The Author(s)."

It is always used mixed with formulants. G acts in particular on the shikimate pathway, which exists in bacteria, for aromatic amino acids synthesis, but this pathway does not exist in vertebrates. In recent decades, researchers have shown by using various animal models that GBHs are endocrine disruptors that might alter reproductive functions. Our review describes the effects of exposure to G or GBHs on the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis in males and females in terms of endocrine disruption, cell viability, and proliferation. Most of the main regulators of the reproductive axis (GPR54, GnRH, LH, FSH, estradiol, testosterone) are altered at all levels of the HPG axis (hypothalamus, pituitary, ovaries, testis, placenta, uterus) by exposure to GBHs which are considered more toxic than G alone due to the presence of formulants such as polyoxyethylene tallow amine (POEA)."" In addition, we report intergenerational impacts of exposure to G or GBHs and, finally, we discuss different strategies to reduce the negative effects of GBHs on fertility."

However, few studies have been carried out in the same sample to simultaneously explore the WM pathology relating to clinical behaviors, as well as the DNA methylation basis underlying the WM deficits.Methods:We performed DTI scans in 42 treatment-naïve first-episode schizophrenia patients and 38 healthy controls. Voxel-based method of fractional anisotropy (FA) derived from DTI was used to assess WM integrity. Participants' peripheral blood genomic DNAm status, quantified by using Infinium® Human Methylation 450K BeadChip, was examined in parallel with DTI scanning. Participants completed Digit Span test and Trail Making test, as well as Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale measurement. We acquired genes that are differentially expressed in the brain regions with abnormal FA values according to the Allen anatomically comprehensive atlas, obtained DNAm levels of the corresponding genes, and then performed Z-test to compare the differential epigenetic-imaging associations (DEIAs) between the two groups.Results:Significant decreases of FA values in the patient group were in the right middle temporal lobe WM, right cuneus WM, right anterior cingulate WM, and right inferior parietal lobe WM, while the significant increases were in the bilateral middle cingulate WM (Ps < 0.01, GRF correction). Abnormal FA values were correlated with patients' clinical symptoms and cognitive impairments. In the DEIAs, patients showed abnormal couple patterns between altered FA and DNAm components, for which the enriched biological processes and pathways could be largely grouped into three biological procedures: the neurocognition, immune, and nervous system.Conclusion:Schizophrenia may not cause widespread neuropathological changes, but subtle alterations affecting local cingulum WM, which may play a critical role in positive symptoms and cognitive impairments. This imaging-epigenetics study revealed for the first time that DNAm of genes enriched in neuronal, immunologic, and cognitive processes may serve as the basis in the effect of WM deficits on clinical behaviors in schizophrenia.Copyright © 2021 Zong, Zhang, He, Huang, Zhang, Wang, Lv, Sang, Zou, Chen, Zheng and Hu."

Axonal transport deficits have been demonstrated to be the earliest crucial pathophysiological changes underlying axonal degeneration in glaucoma. Here, we explored the role of the tetraspanin superfamily member CD82 in an acute ocular hypertension model. We found a transient downregulation of CD82 after acute IOP elevation, with parallel emergence of axonal transport deficits. The overexpression of CD82 with an AAV2/9 vector in the mouse retina improved optic nerve axonal transport and ameliorated subsequent axon degeneration. Moreover, the CD82 overexpression stimulated optic nerve regeneration and restored vision in a mouse optic nerve crush model. CD82 exerted a protective effect through the upregulation of TRAF2, which is an E3 ubiquitin ligase, and activated mTORC1 through K63-linked ubiquitylation and intracellular repositioning of Raptor.

Trauma reduced cell viability, mitochondrial membrane potential and spontaneous synchronous electrophysiological activity in the spheroids. Electrophysiological deficits emerged at lower injury severities than changes in cell viability.

Previous studies have found that m6A methylation plays a role in mammalian skeletal muscle development. However, the effect of m6A on bovine skeletal myogenesis are still unclear. Here, we selected proliferating myoblasts (GM) and differentiated myotubes (on the 4th day of differentiation, DM) for m6A-seq and RNA-seq to explore the m6A methylation modification pattern during bovine skeletal myogenesis. m6A-seq analysis revealed that m6A methylation was an abundant modification of the mRNA in bovine myoblasts and myotubes. We scanned 5,691-8,094 m6A-modified transcripts, including 1,437 differentially methylated genes (DMGs). GO and KEGG analyses revealed that DMGs were primarily involved in transcriptional regulation and RNA metabolism, as well as insulin resistance and metabolic pathways related to muscle development. The combined analysis further identified 268 genes that had significant changes at both m6A and mRNA levels, suggesting that m6A modification may regulate myoblast differentiation by mediating the expression of these genes. Furthermore, we experimentally confirmed four genes related to myogenesis, including MYOZ2, TWIST1, KLF5 and MYOD1, with differential changes in both m6A and mRNA levels during bovine myoblast differentiation, indicating that they can be potential candidate targets for m6A regulation of skeletal myogenesis.

However, changes in three-dimensional chromatin structure and interaction, a newly emerged mediator of gene expression, during the skeletal muscle development and IMF deposition have remained unclear. In the present study, we analyzed the differences in muscle development and IMF content between one-day-old commercial Arbor Acres broiler (AA) and Chinese indigenous Lushi blue-shelled-egg chicken (LS) and performed Hi-C analysis on their breast muscles. Our results indicated that significantly higher IMF content, however remarkably lower muscle fiber diameter was detected in breast muscle of LS chicken compared to that of AA broiler. The chromatin intra-interaction was prior to inter-interaction in both AA and LS chicken, and chromatin inter-interaction was heavily focused on the small and gene-rich chromosomes. For genomic compartmentalization, no significant difference in the number of B type compartments was found, but AA had more A type compartments versus LS. The A/B compartment switching of AA versus LS showed more A to B switching than B to A switching. There were no significant differences in the average sizes and distributions of topologically associating domains (TAD). Additionally, approximately 50% of TAD boundaries were overlapping. The reforming and disappearing events of TAD boundaries were identified between AA and LS chicken breast muscles. Among these, theHMGCRgene was located in the TAD-boundary regions in AA broilers, but in TAD-interior regions in LS chickens, and theIGF2BP3gene was located in the AA-unique TAD boundaries. BothHMGCRandIGF2BP3genes exhibited increased mRNA expression in one-day-old AA broiler breast muscles. It was demonstrated that theIGF2BP3andHMGCRgenes regulated by TAD boundary sliding were potential biomarkers for chicken breast muscle development and IMF deposition. Our data not only provide a valuable understanding of higher-order chromatin dynamics during muscle development and lipid accumulation but also reveal new insights into the regulatory mechanisms of muscle development and IMF deposition in chicken.Copyright © 2021 Tian, Wang, Wang, Zhi, Dong, Jiang, Han, Li, Kang, Li and Liu."

However, the molecular regulation of skeletal muscle diversity remains largely unknown. Here, we conducted transcriptome profiling of skeletal muscle across 27 time points, and performed whole-genome re-sequencing in Landrace (lean-type) and Tongcheng (obese-type) pigs. The transcription activity decreased with development, and the high-resolution transcriptome precisely captured the characterizations of skeletal muscle with distinct biological events in four developmental phases: Embryonic, Fetal, Neonatal, and Adult. A divergence in the developmental timing and asynchronous development between the two breeds was observed; Landrace showed a developmental lag and stronger abilities of myoblast proliferation and cell migration, whereas Tongcheng had higher ATP synthase activity in postnatal periods. The miR-24-3p driven network targeting insulin signaling pathway regulated glucose metabolism.

"34937547","Epigenetic marker of telomeric age is associated with exacerbations and hospitalizations in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.","Respir Res","Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an age-related condition that has been associated with early telomere attrition; the clinical implications of telomere shortening in COPD are not well known. In this study we aimed to determine the relationship of the epigenetic regulation of telomeric length in peripheral blood with the risk of exacerbations and hospitalization in patients with COPD.Blood DNA methylation profiles were obtained from 292 patients with COPD enrolled in the placebo arm of the Macrolide Azithromycin to Prevent Rapid Worsening of Symptoms Associated with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (MACRO) Study and who were followed for 1-year. We calculated telomere length based on DNA methylation markers (DNAmTL) and related this biomarker to the risk of exacerbation and hospitalization and health status (St. George Respiratory Questionnaire [SGRQ]) score over time using a Cox proportional hazards model. We also used linear models to investigate the associations of DNAmTL with the rates of exacerbation and hospitalization (adjusted for chronological age, lung function, race, sex, smoking, body mass index and cell composition).Participants with short DNAmTL demonstrated increased risk of exacerbation (P = 0.02) and hospitalization (P = 0.03) compared to those with longer DNAmTL. DNAmTL age acceleration was associated with higher rates of exacerbation (P = 1.35 × 10-04) and hospitalization (P = 5.21 × 10-03) and poor health status (lower SGRQ scores) independent of chronological age (P = 0.03).Telomeric age based on blood DNA methylation is associated with COPD exacerbation and hospitalization and thus a promising biomarker for poor outcomes in COPD.© 2021.

"35022890","Fine mapping with epigenetic information and 3D structure.","Semin Immunopathol","Since 2005, thousands of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been published, identifying hundreds of thousands of genetic variants that increase risk of complex traits such as autoimmune diseases. This wealth of data has the potential to improve patient care, through personalized medicine and the identification of novel drug targets. However, the potential of GWAS for clinical translation has not been fully achieved yet, due to the fact that the functional interpretation of risk variants and the identification of causal variants and genes are challenging. The past decade has seen the development of great advances that are facilitating the overcoming of these limitations, by utilizing a plethora of genomics and epigenomics tools to map and characterize regulatory elements and chromatin interactions, which can be used to fine map GWAS loci, and advance our understanding of the biological mechanisms that cause disease.© 2022.

High quantities of heavy metal ions in the amniotic fluid have been linked to poor health, especially in industrial, polluted and poor areas. The aim of the present study was to assess the differences in the concentration of these ions between preterm (weeks 15-37) and term pregnancies (starting at week 37). Another objective was to compare pregnancies from two cities with different industry levels. Two sample lots from two Romanian cities were analyzed. A total of 100 patients from Timisoara were compared with 60 from Petrosani, a heavy industry city in Romania. Demographic data were collected, and amniocentesis was performed on all women. Lead (Pb), copper (Cu), nickel (Ni), cadmium (Cd), arsenic (As), iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn) concentrations were assessed. Descriptive and analytical statistics were performed using the Mann-Whitney U test for non-parametric data and the Fisher's exact test for categorical data. In addition, categorical data was represented graphically. In the Timisoara cohort, the differences in heavy metal concentrations between preterm and term pregnancies were not statistically significant. In the Petrosani cohort, however, the concentrations of Zn (P=0.02606) and Cd (P=0.01512) were higher in preterm than in term pregnancies. When comparing the two cohorts as a whole, the concentration of Pb (P=0.04513), Cd (P=0.00002), As (P=0.03027) and Zn (P<0.00001) were higher in the patients from Petrosani than in those from Timisoara. Only Cu concentrations were higher in the Timisoara cohort (P<0.00001). The concentrations of Ni (P=0.78150) and Fe (P=0.44540) did not differ statistically. Thus, amniocentesis is an important diagnostic and exploratory tool in determining differences in the concentrations of elements such as heavy metal ions. Research over a longer period of time should be carried out to examine the relation between heavy metal ions concentration and possible postnatal health outcomes.Copyright: © Neamtu et al."

The pathobiological effects of these mutations vary considerably, impeding the identification of common expression profiles. We performed an expression meta-analysis between IDH-mutant (IDHmut) and IDH-wild-type (IDHwt) conditions in six human and mouse isogenic disease models. The datasets included colon cancer cells, glioma cells, heart tissue, hepatoblasts, and neural stem cells. Among differentially expressed genes (DEGs), serine protease 23 (PRSS23) was upregulated in four datasets, i.e., in human colon carcinoma cells, mouse heart tissue, mouse neural stem cells, and human glioma cells. Carbonic anhydrase 2 (CA2) and prolyl 3-hydroxylase 2 (P3H2) were upregulated in three datasets, and SOX2 overlapping transcript (SOX2-OT) was downregulated in three datasets. The most significantly overrepresented protein class was termed intercellular signal molecules. An additional DEG set contained genes that were both up- and downregulated in different datasets and included oxidases and extracellular matrix structural proteins as the most significantly overrepresented protein classes. In conclusion, this meta-analysis provides a comprehensive overview of the expression effects of IDH mutations shared between different isogenic disease models. The generated dataset includes biomarkers, e.g., PRSS23 that may gain relevance for further research or clinical applications in IDHmuttumors.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"34968368","Evolution of CG Methylation Maintenance Machinery in Plants.","Epigenomes","Cytosine methylation is an epigenetic mark present in most eukaryotic genomes that contributes to the regulation of gene expression and the maintenance of genome stability. DNA methylation mostly occurs at CG sequences, where it is initially deposited by de novo DNA methyltransferases and propagated by maintenance DNA methyltransferases (DNMT) during DNA replication. In this review, we first summarize the mechanisms maintaining CG methylation in mammals that involve the DNA Methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) enzyme and its cofactor, UHRF1 (Ubiquitin-like with PHD and RING Finger domain 1). We then discuss the evolutionary conservation and diversification of these two core factors in the plant kingdom and speculate on potential functions of novel homologues typically observed in land plants but not in mammals."

"34940760","CRISPR-Based Approaches for the High-Throughput Characterization of Long Non-Coding RNAs.","Noncoding RNA","Over the last decade, tens of thousands of new long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been identified in the human genome. Nevertheless, except for a handful of genes, the genetic characteristics and functions of most of these lncRNAs remain elusive; this is partially due to their relatively low expression, high tissue specificity, and low conservation across species. A major limitation for determining the function of lncRNAs was the lack of methodologies suitable for studying these genes. The recent development of CRISPR/Cas9 technology has opened unprecedented opportunities to uncover the genetic and functional characteristics of the non-coding genome via targeted and high-throughput approaches. Specific CRISPR/Cas9-based approaches were developed to target lncRNA loci. Some of these approaches involve modifying the sequence, but others were developed to study lncRNAs by inducing transcriptional and epigenetic changes. The discovery of other programable Cas proteins broaden our possibilities to target RNA molecules with greater precision and accuracy. These approaches allow for the knock-down and characterization of lncRNAs. Here, we review how various CRISPR-based strategies have been used to characterize lncRNAs with important functions in different biological contexts and how these approaches can be further utilized to improve our understanding of the non-coding genome."

Fortunately, on-going research is identifying noninvasive biomarkers that address some of these limitations. This review provides an update on noninvasive blood-based methods for rejection surveillance and diagnosis in heart transplantation.Recent studies highlight good test performance to detect acute rejection for donor-derived cell-free DNA (dd-cfDNA) and microRNAs (miR). dd-cfDNA is sensitive, nonspecific, and has a high negative predictive value for acute cellular and antibody-mediated rejection. Clinical utility trials are being planned to test its role as a rule-out test for acute rejection as compared to the EMB. miRs may have an added advantage as it may phenotype the subtypes of rejection alleviating the need for an EMB or permitting the initiation of targeted therapy while awaiting the results of the EMB.In this review, we discuss recent advances in the field of noninvasive biomarkers to detect allograft rejection after heart transplant.

The purpose of this review is to provide a survey of pediatric cell-free DNA (cfDNA) studies, illustrate their potential applications in pediatric oncology, and to discuss technological challenges and approaches to overcome these hurdles.Recent literature has demonstrated liquid biopsies' ability to inform treatment selection at diagnosis, monitor clonal evolution during treatment, sensitively detect minimum residual disease following local control, and provide sensitive posttherapy surveillance. Advantages include reduced procedural anesthesia, molecular profiling unbiased by tissue heterogeneity, and ability to track clonal evolution. Challenges to wider implementation in pediatric oncology, however, include blood volume restrictions and relatively low mutational burden in childhood cancers. Multiomic approaches address challenges presented by low-mutational burden, and novel bioinformatic analyses allow a single assay to yield increasing amounts of information, reducing blood volume requirements.Liquid biopsies hold tremendous promise in pediatric oncology, enabling noninvasive serial surveillance with adaptive care. Already integrated into adult care, recent advances in technologies and bioinformatics have improved applicability to the pediatric cancer landscape."

Acid rain could play an etiologic role in PD by mobilizing metals, e.g., lead, from watersheds and pipes into drinking water. We assessed the correlation of PD with lead service lines, the underground pipes that connect homes to municipal water sources, which are a major aqueous source of lead.We used multiple regression techniques to examine PD prevalence rates by state relative to the number of lead service lines. We included known or suspected aqueous risk factors, e.g., the Acid Precipitation Index (a measure of acid rain) and well water use.Age-, race-, and sex-adjusted prevalence rates for PD were significantly and positively correlated with the log number of lead service lines (p = 0.0004). The effect of lead service lines remained significant after adjusting for the effects of acid rain and well water use (p = 0.0019).These findings are consistent with a role for lead in the etiology of PD. Studies of lead service line exposure in relation to PD at the individual level are warranted.© 2021 The Author(s)."

However, centromeres are essential for the stable propagation of chromosomes, so tools are urgently needed to monitor centromere copy number and how it influences chromosome transmission and genome stability. We developed and benchmarked droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) assays that measure copy number for five human centromeric arrays. We applied them to characterize natural variation in centromeric array size, analyzing normal tissue from 37 individuals from China and 39 individuals from the US and UK. Each chromosome-specific array varies in size up to 10-fold across individuals and up to 50-fold across chromosomes, indicating a unique complement of arrays in each individual. We also used the ddPCR assays to analyze centromere copy number in 76 matched tumor-normal samples across four cancer types, representing the most-comprehensive quantitative analysis of centromeric array stability in cancer to date. In contrast to stable transmission in cultured cells, centromeric arrays show gain and loss events in each of the cancer types, suggesting centromeric α-satellite DNA represents a new category of genome instability in cancer. Our methodology for measuring human centromeric-array copy number will advance research on centromeres and genome integrity in normal and disease states."
"34726732","Population-scale detection of non-reference sequence variants using colored de Bruijn Graphs.","Bioinformatics","With the increasing throughput of sequencing technologies, structural variant (SV) detection has become possible across tens of thousands of genomes. Non-reference sequence (NRS) variants have drawn less attention compared to other types of SVs due to the computational complexity of detecting them. When using short-read data, the detection of NRS variants inevitably involves a de novo assembly which requires high-quality sequence data at high coverage. Previous studies have demonstrated how sequence data of multiple genomes can be combined for the reliable detection of NRS variants. However, the algorithms proposed in these studies have limited scalability to larger sets of genomes.We introduce PopIns2, a tool to discover and characterize NRS variants in many genomes, which scales to considerably larger numbers of genomes than its predecessor PopIns. In this article, we briefly outline the PopIns2 workflow and highlight our novel algorithmic contributions. We developed an entirely new approach for merging contig assemblies of unaligned reads from many genomes into a single set of NRS using a colored de Bruijn graph. Our tests on simulated data indicate that the new merging algorithm ranks among the best approaches in terms of quality and reliability and that PopIns2 shows the best precision for a growing number of genomes processed. Results on the Polaris Diversity Cohort and a set of 1000 Icelandic human genomes demonstrate unmatched scalability for the application on population-scale datasets.The source code of PopIns2 is available from https://github.com/kehrlab/PopIns2.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.© The Author(s) 2021.

"35024974","Altered DNA methylation in kidney disease: useful markers and therapeutic targets.","Clin Exp Nephrol","Recent studies have demonstrated the association of altered epigenomes with lifestyle-related diseases. Epigenetic regulation promotes biological plasticity in response to environmental changes, and such plasticity may cause a 'memory effect', a sustained effect of transient treatment or an insult in the course of lifestyle-related diseases. We investigated the significance of epigenetic changes in several genes required for renal integrity, including the nephrin gene in podocytes, and the sustained anti-proteinuric effect, focusing on the transcription factor Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4). We further reported the role of the DNA repair factor lysine-acetyl transferase 5 (KAT5), which acts coordinately with KLF4, in podocyte injury caused by a hyperglycemic state through the acceleration of DNA damage and epigenetic alteration. In contrast, KAT5 in proximal tubular cells prevents acute kidney injury via glomerular filtration regulation by an epigenetic mechanism as well as promotion of DNA repair, indicating the cell type-specific action and roles of DNA repair factors. This review summarizes epigenetic alterations in kidney diseases, especially DNA methylation, and their utility as markers and potential therapeutic targets. Focusing on transcription factors or DNA damage repair factors associated with epigenetic changes may be meaningful due to their cell-specific expression or action. We believe that a better understanding of epigenetic alterations in the kidney will lead to the development of a novel strategy for chronic kidney disease (CKD) treatment.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"34991694","Fasting before living-kidney donation: effect on donor well-being and postoperative recovery: study protocol of a multicenter randomized controlled trial.","Trials","One of the main effectors on the quality of life of living-kidney donors is postoperative fatigue. Caloric restriction (CR) and short-term fasting (STF) are associated with improved fitness and increased resistance to acute stress. CR/STF increases the expression of cytoprotective genes, increases immunomodulation via increased anti-inflammatory cytokine production, and decreases the expression of pro-inflammatory markers. As such, nutritional preconditioning by CR or STF represents a non-invasive and cost-effective method that could mitigate the effects of acute surgery-induced stress and postoperative fatigue. To investigate whether preoperative STF contributes to a reduction in fatigue after living-kidney donation, a randomized clinical trial is indicated.We aim to determine whether 2.5 days of fasting reduces postoperative fatigue score in subjects undergoing living-kidney donation. In this randomized study, the intervention group will follow a preoperative fasting regime for 2.5 days with a low-dose laxative, while the control group will receive standard care. The main study endpoint is postoperative fatigue, 4 weeks after living-kidney donation. Secondary endpoints include the effect of preoperative fasting on postoperative hospital admission time, the feasibility of STF, and the postoperative recovery of donor and recipient kidney function. This study will provide us with knowledge of the feasibility of STF and confirm its effect on postoperative recovery.Our study will provide clinically relevant information on the merits of caloric restriction for living-kidney donors and recipients. We expect to reduce the postoperative fatigue in living-kidney donors and improve the postoperative recovery of living-kidney recipients.

"34950659","Tools for Decoding Ubiquitin Signaling in DNA Repair.","Front Cell Dev Biol","The maintenance of genome stability requires dedicated DNA repair processes and pathways that are essential for the faithful duplication and propagation of chromosomes. These DNA repair mechanisms counteract the potentially deleterious impact of the frequent genotoxic challenges faced by cells from both exogenous and endogenous agents. Intrinsic to these mechanisms, cells have an arsenal of protein factors that can be utilised to promote repair processes in response to DNA lesions. Orchestration of the protein factors within the various cellular DNA repair pathways is performed, in part, by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, ubiquitin, SUMO and other ubiquitin-like modifiers (UBLs). In this review, we firstly explore recent advances in the tools for identifying factors involved in both DNA repair and ubiquitin signaling pathways. We then expand on this by evaluating the growing repertoire of proteomic, biochemical and structural techniques available to further understand the mechanistic basis by which these complex modifications regulate DNA repair. Together, we provide a snapshot of the range of methods now available to investigate and decode how ubiquitin signaling can promote DNA repair and maintain genome stability in mammalian cells.Copyright © 2021 Foster, Attwood and Gibbs-Seymour."

The infection now shows devastating impacts on the younger population, who were not previously predicted to be vulnerable, such as in the older population. COVID-19-related complications have been reported in neonates whose mothers were infected with SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy, and in children who get infected. Hence, a deeper understanding of the pathophysiology of COVID-19 during various developmental stages and placental transmission is essential. Although a connection has not yet been established between exosomal trafficking and the placental transmission of COVID-19, reports indicate that SARS-CoV-2 components may be trafficked between cells through exosomes. As the infection spreads, the transcriptome of cells is drastically perturbed, e.g., through the severe upregulation of several immune-related genes. Consequently, a major outcome of COVID-19 is an elevated immune response and the detection of viral RNA transcripts in host tissue. In this direction, this review focuses on SARS-CoV-2 virology, its in utero transmission from infected pregnant mothers to fetuses, SARS-CoV-2 and exosomal cellular trafficking, transcriptomic impacts, and RNA-mediated therapeutics against COVID-19. Future research will establish stronger connections between the above processes to develop diagnostic and therapeutic solutions towards COVID-19 and similar viral outbreaks."

"34950048","Vascular Stiffness in Aging and Disease.","Front Physiol","The goal of this review is to provide further understanding of increased vascular stiffness with aging, and how it contributes to the adverse effects of major human diseases. Differences in stiffness down the aortic tree are discussed, a topic requiring further research, because most prior work only examined one location in the aorta. It is also important to understand the divergent effects of increased aortic stiffness between males and females, principally due to the protective role of female sex hormones prior to menopause. Another goal is to review human and non-human primate data and contrast them with data in rodents. This is particularly important for understanding sex differences in vascular stiffness with aging as well as the changes in vascular stiffness before and after menopause in females, as this is controversial. This area of research necessitates studies in humans and non-human primates, since rodents do not go through menopause. The most important mechanism studied as a cause of age-related increases in vascular stiffness is an alteration in the vascular extracellular matrix resulting from an increase in collagen and decrease in elastin. However, there are other mechanisms mediating increased vascular stiffness, such as collagen and elastin disarray, calcium deposition, endothelial dysfunction, and the number of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Populations with increased longevity, who live in areas called ""Blue Zones,"" are also discussed as they provide additional insights into mechanisms that protect against age-related increases in vascular stiffness. Such increases in vascular stiffness are important in mediating the adverse effects of major cardiovascular diseases, including atherosclerosis, hypertension and diabetes, but require further research into their mechanisms and treatment.Copyright © 2021 Vatner, Zhang, Vyzas, Mishra, Graham and Vatner."

In this paper, we proposed a new method, the low rank penalized regression method (LORSEN), for eQTL mapping. We evaluated and compared the performance of LORSEN with two existing methods for eQTL mapping using extensive simulations as well as real data from the HapMap3 project. Simulation studies showed that our method outperformed two commonly used methods for eQTL mapping, LORS and FastLORS, in many scenarios in terms of area under the curve (AUC).

The second step consists of the delivery of science-based nutrition advice, behavior change support, and the monitoring of health and performance efficacy and benefits relative to cost. Individuals vary widely in the way they respond to exercise and nutritional interventions, and understanding why this metabolic heterogeneity exists is critical for further advances in precision nutrition. Another major challenge is the development of evidence-based individualized nutrition recommendations that are embraced and efficacious for athletes seeking the most effective enhancement of performance, metabolic recovery, and health.

By using our pipeline, we built 3D comparative models of the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD/ACE2 protein complexes for the VoC B.1.1.7-United Kingdom (carrying the mutations of concern/interest N501Y, S494P, E484K at the RBD), P.1-Japan/Brazil (RBD mutations: K417T, E484K, N501Y), B.1.351-South Africa (RBD mutations: K417N, E484K, N501Y), B.1.427/B.1.429-California (RBD mutations: L452R), the B.1.141 (RBD mutations: N439K), and the recent B.1.617.1-India (RBD mutations: L452R; E484Q) and the B.1.620 (RBD mutations: S477N; E484K). Then, we used the obtained 3D comparative models of the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD/ACE2 protein complexes for predicting the interaction energies at the protein-protein interface.Along SARS-CoV-2 mutation database screening and mutation localization analysis, it was ascertained that the most dangerous mutations at VoC/VoI spike proteins are located mainly at three regions of the SARS-CoV-2 spike ""boat-shaped"" receptor binding motif, on the RBD domain. Notably, the P.1 Japan/Brazil variant present three mutations, K417T, E484K, N501Y, located along the entire receptor binding motif, which apparently determines the highest interaction energy at the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD/ACE2 protein-protein interface, among those calculated. Conversely, it was also observed that the replacement of a single acidic/hydrophilic residue with a basic residue (E484K or N439K) at the ""stern"" or ""bow"" regions, of the boat-shaped receptor binding motif on the RBD, appears to determine an interaction energy with ACE2 receptor higher than that observed with single mutations occurring at the ""hull"" region or with other multiple mutants. In addition, our pipeline allowed searching for ACE2 structurally related proteins, i.e., THOP1 and NLN, which deserve to be investigated for their possible involvement in interactions with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, in those tissues showing a low expression of ACE2, or as a novel receptor for future spike variants. A freely available web-tool for the in silico calculation of the interaction energy at the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD/ACE2 protein-protein interface, starting from the sequences of the investigated spike and/or ACE2 variants, was made available for the scientific community at: https://www.mitoairm.it/covid19affinities.In the context of the PPPM/3PM, the employment of the described pipeline through the provided webservice, together with the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequencing, would help to predict the transmissibility of new variants sequenced from future patients, depending on SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequencing activities and on the specific amino acid replacement and/or on its location on the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD, to put in play all the possible counteractions for preventing the most deleterious scenarios of new outbreaks, taking into consideration that a greater transmissibility has not to be necessarily related to a more severe manifestation of the disease.The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s13167-021-00267-w.© The Author(s), under exclusive licence to European Association for Predictive, Preventive and Personalised Medicine (EPMA) 2022."

"34844191","Next generation plasma proteome profiling of COVID-19 patients with mild to moderate symptoms.","EBioMedicine","COVID-19 has caused millions of deaths globally, yet the cellular mechanisms underlying the various effects of the disease remain poorly understood. Recently, a new analytical platform for comprehensive analysis of plasma protein profiles using proximity extension assays combined with next generation sequencing has been developed, which allows for multiple proteins to be analyzed simultaneously without sacrifice on accuracy or sensitivity.We analyzed the plasma protein profiles of COVID-19 patients (n = 50) with mild and moderate symptoms by comparing the protein levels in newly diagnosed patients with the protein levels in the same individuals after 14 days.The study has identified more than 200 proteins that are significantly elevated during infection and many of these are related to cytokine response and other immune-related functions. In addition, several other proteins are shown to be elevated, including SCARB2, a host cell receptor protein involved in virus entry. A comparison with the plasma protein response in patients with severe symptoms shows a highly similar pattern, but with some interesting differences.The study presented here demonstrates the usefulness of ""next generation plasma protein profiling"" to identify molecular signatures of importance for disease progression and to allow monitoring of disease during recovery from the infection. The results will facilitate further studies to understand the molecular mechanism of the immune-related response of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.This work was financially supported by Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) in blood reflect cell activation and tissue injury. We aimed to determine the association of circulating miRNAs with COVID-19 severity and 28-day intensive care unit (ICU) mortality.We performed RNA-Seq in plasma of healthy controls (n = 11), non-severe (n = 18) and severe (n = 18) COVID-19 patients and selected 14 miRNAs according to cell- and tissue origin for measurement by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) in a separate cohort of mild (n = 6), moderate (n = 39) and severe (n = 16) patients. Candidates were then measured by RT-qPCR in longitudinal samples of ICU COVID-19 patients (n = 240 samples from n = 65 patients). 60 miRNAs, including platelet-, endothelial-, hepatocyte- and cardiomyocyte-derived miRNAs, were differentially expressed depending on severity, with increased miR-133a and reduced miR-122 also being associated with 28-day mortality. We leveraged mass spectrometry-based proteomics data for corresponding protein trajectories. Myocyte-derived (myomiR) miR-133a was inversely associated with neutrophil counts and positively with proteins related to neutrophil degranulation, such as myeloperoxidase. In contrast, levels of hepatocyte-derived miR-122 correlated to liver parameters and to liver-derived positive (inverse association) and negative acute phase proteins (positive association). Finally, we compared miRNAs to established markers of COVID-19 severity and outcome, i.e. SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia, age, BMI, D-dimer and troponin. Whilst RNAemia, age and troponin were better predictors of mortality, miR-133a and miR-122 showed superior classification performance for severity. In binary and triplet combinations, miRNAs improved classification performance of established markers for severity and mortality.Circulating miRNAs of different tissue origin, including several known cardiometabolic biomarkers, rise with COVID-19 severity. MyomiR miR-133a and liver-derived miR-122 also relate to 28-day mortality. MiR-133a reflects inflammation-induced myocyte damage, whilst miR-122 reflects the hepatic acute phase response.Adding biomarkers to conventional scores for illness severity and mortality could improve prognostic performance in COVID-19 patients. Circulating miRNAs are emerging as promising biomarkers with tissue specific origins but have only sparsely been investigated in COVID-19. We quantified circulating miRNAs of different tissue origin in COVID-19 patients, identifying several miRNAs of the cardiometabolic system to be associated with severity. Myocyte-derived miR-133a and liver-derived miR-122 also associated with mortality. Through longitudinal proteomics measurements, we related myomiR miR-133a release to neutrophil activation and miR-122 release to the hepatic acute phase response. Our findings highlight key pathophysiological changes and provide first evidence on the performance of miRNA biomarkers in COVID-19.© The Author(s) 2021.

"34842724","Insights into the Role of Telomeres in Human Embryological Parameters. Opinions Regarding IVF.","J Dev Biol","Telomeres promote genome integrity by protecting chromosome ends from the activation of the DNA damage response and protecting chromosomes from the loss of coding sequences due to the end replication problem. Telomere length (TL) is progressively shortened as age progresses, thus resulting in cellular senescence. Therefore, TL is in strong adverse linear correlation with aging. Mounting evidence supports the notion that telomeres and male/female infertility are in a close relationship, posing the biology of telomeres as a hot topic in the era of human-assisted reproduction. Specifically, the length of sperm telomeres is gradually increasing as men get older, while the telomere length of the oocytes seems not to follow similar patterns with that of sperm. Nonetheless, the telomere length of the embryos during the cleavage stages seems to have a paternal origin, but the telomere length can be further extended by telomerase activity during the blastocyst stage. The latter has been proposed as a new molecular biomarker with strong predictive value regarding male infertility. As far as the role of telomeres in assisted reproduction, the data is limited but the length of telomeres in both gametes seems to be affected mainly by the cause of infertility rather than the assisted reproductive therapy (ART) procedure itself. The present review aims to shed more light into the role of telomeres in human embryological parameters, including gametes and embryos and also presents opinions regarding the association between telomeres and in vitro fertilization (IVF)."
"34767750","Single-cell transcriptomics identifies master regulators of neurodegeneration in SOD1 ALS iPSC-derived motor neurons.","Stem Cell Reports","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative condition characterized by the loss of motor neurons. We utilized single-cell transcriptomics to uncover dysfunctional pathways in degenerating motor neurons differentiated from SOD1 E100G ALS patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and respective isogenic controls. Differential gene expression and network analysis identified activation of developmental pathways and core transcriptional factors driving the ALS motor neuron gene dysregulation. Specifically, we identified activation of SMAD2, a downstream mediator of the transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) signaling pathway as a key driver of SOD1 iPSC-derived motor neuron degeneration. Importantly, our analysis indicates that activation of TGFβ signaling may be a common mechanism shared between SOD1, FUS, C9ORF72, VCP, and sporadic ALS motor neurons. Our results demonstrate the utility of single-cell transcriptomics in mapping disease-relevant gene regulatory networks driving neurodegeneration in ALS motor neurons. We find that ALS-associated mutant SOD1 targets transcriptional networks that perturb motor neuron homeostasis.Copyright © 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
"34893889","Coordinated glucocorticoid receptor and MAFB action induces tolerogenesis and epigenome remodeling in dendritic cells.","Nucleic Acids Res","Glucocorticoids (GCs) exert potent anti-inflammatory effects in immune cells through the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Dendritic cells (DCs), central actors for coordinating immune responses, acquire tolerogenic properties in response to GCs. Tolerogenic DCs (tolDCs) have emerged as a potential treatment for various inflammatory diseases. To date, the underlying cell type-specific regulatory mechanisms orchestrating GC-mediated acquisition of immunosuppressive properties remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the transcriptomic and epigenomic remodeling associated with differentiation to DCs in the presence of GCs. Our analysis demonstrates a major role of MAFB in this process, in synergy with GR. GR and MAFB both interact with methylcytosine dioxygenase TET2 and bind to genomic loci that undergo specific demethylation in tolDCs. We also show that the role of MAFB is more extensive, binding to thousands of genomic loci in tolDCs. Finally, MAFB knockdown erases the tolerogenic properties of tolDCs and reverts the specific DNA demethylation and gene upregulation. The preeminent role of MAFB is also demonstrated in vivo for myeloid cells from synovium in rheumatoid arthritis following GC treatment. Our results imply that, once directly activated by GR, MAFB plays a critical role in orchestrating the epigenomic and transcriptomic remodeling that define the tolerogenic phenotype.© The Author(s) 2021.

"34909208","CLARITY: comparing heterogeneous data using dissimilarity.","R Soc Open Sci","Integrating datasets from different disciplines is hard because the data are often qualitatively different in meaning, scale and reliability. When two datasets describe the same entities, many scientific questions can be phrased around whether the (dis)similarities between entities are conserved across such different data. Our method, CLARITY, quantifies consistency across datasets, identifies where inconsistencies arise and aids in their interpretation. We illustrate this using three diverse comparisons: gene methylation versus expression, evolution of language sounds versus word use, and country-level economic metrics versus cultural beliefs. The non-parametric approach is robust to noise and differences in scaling, and makes only weak assumptions about how the data were generated. It operates by decomposing similarities into two components: a 'structural' component analogous to a clustering, and an underlying 'relationship' between those structures. This allows a 'structural comparison' between two similarity matrices using their predictability from 'structure'. Significance is assessed with the help of re-sampling appropriate for each dataset.

"34940535","Failing Heart Transplants and Rejection-A Cellular Perspective.","J Cardiovasc Dev Dis","The median survival of patients with heart transplants is relatively limited, implying one of the most relevant questions in the field-how to expand the lifespan of a heart allograft? Despite optimal transplantation conditions, we do not anticipate a rise in long-term patient survival in near future. In order to develop novel strategies for patient monitoring and specific therapies, it is critical to understand the underlying pathological mechanisms at cellular and molecular levels. These events are driven by innate immune response and allorecognition driven inflammation, which controls both tissue damage and repair in a spatiotemporal context. In addition to immune cells, also structural cells of the heart participate in this process. Novel single cell methods have opened new avenues for understanding the dynamics driving the events leading to allograft failure. Here, we review current knowledge on the cellular composition of a normal heart, and cellular mechanisms of ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI), acute rejection and cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) in the transplanted hearts. We highlight gaps in current knowledge and suggest future directions, in order to improve cellular and molecular understanding of failing heart allografts."
"34884559","Sparsely Connected Autoencoders: A Multi-Purpose Tool for Single Cell omics Analysis.","Int J Mol Sci","Biological processes are based on complex networks of cells and molecules. Single cell multi-omics is a new tool aiming to provide new incites in the complex network of events controlling the functionality of the cell.Since single cell technologies provide many sample measurements, they are the ideal environment for the application of Deep Learning and Machine Learning approaches. An autoencoder is composed of an encoder and a decoder sub-model. An autoencoder is a very powerful tool in data compression and noise removal. However, the decoder model remains a black box from which is impossible to depict the contribution of the single input elements. We have recently developed a new class of autoencoders, called Sparsely Connected Autoencoders (SCA), which have the advantage of providing a controlled association among the input layer and the decoder module. This new architecture has the benefit that the decoder model is not a black box anymore and can be used to depict new biologically interesting features from single cell data.Here, we show that SCA hidden layer can grab new information usually hidden in single cell data, like providing clustering on meta-features difficult, i.e. transcription factors expression, or not technically not possible, i.e. miRNA expression, to depict in single cell RNAseq data. Furthermore, SCA representation of cell clusters has the advantage of simulating a conventional bulk RNAseq, which is a data transformation allowing the identification of similarity among independent experiments.In our opinion, SCA represents the bioinformatics version of a universal ""Swiss-knife"" for the extraction of hidden knowledgeable features from single cell omics data."
"34795059","Molecular characterization of Barrett's esophagus at single-cell resolution.","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","Barrett's esophagus (BE) is categorized, based on morphological appearance, into different stages, which correlate with the risk of developing esophageal adenocarcinoma. More advanced stages are more likely to acquire chromosomal instabilities, but stage-specific markers remain elusive. Here, we performed single-cell DNA-sequencing experiments (scDNAseq) with fresh BE biopsies. Dysplastic BE cells frequently contained chromosomal instability (CIN) regions, and these CIN cells carried mutations corresponding to the COSMIC mutational signature SBS17, which were not present in biopsy-matched chromosomally stable (CS) cells or patient-matched nondiseased control cells. CS cells were predominantly found in nondysplastic BE biopsies. The single-base substitution (SBS) signatures of all CS BE cells analyzed were indistinguishable from those of nondiseased esophageal or gastric cells. Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNAseq) experiments with BE biopsies identified two sets of marker genes which facilitate the distinction between columnar BE epithelium and nondysplastic/dysplastic stages. Moreover, histological validation confirmed a correlation between increased CLDN2 expression and the presence of dysplastic BE stages. Our scDNAseq and scRNAseq datasets, which are a useful resource for the community, provide insight into the mutational landscape and gene expression pattern at different stages of BE development."
"34868485","NETfacts: a community intervention integrating trauma treatment at the individual and collective level.","Eur J Psychotraumatol","The aim of this article is to present a research-based rationale for NETfacts, a newly developed integrated approach at the individual and the community level in order to mitigate the mental and social sequelae of war and crisis. To this end, we provide a selective review of relevant literature from neuroscience, clinical psychology, and social science. In psychotraumatology, individual avoidance describes the effort to prevent exposure to trauma reminders. Among patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), this becomes pathological, exacerbating distress and preventing recovery. This silence resonates in traumatized communities and consequently taboo builds - ultimately to the advantage of the perpetrators. The resulting collective avoidance leads to a fragmented collective memory about trauma or human rights violations in the community so that a shared account of the group's history becomes impossible. The deficient collective memory promotes ambiguous truths and anxiety, enabling a reactive construction of safety based on selective information that leads to an endorsement of extreme opinions. Ongoing insecurity, violence and crime lead to increasing anxiety and fear. The self-interest of the perpetrators and the abnormal behaviour of survivors leads to an escalation in stigma and social exclusion resulting in the prevention or limitation of community exposure to traumatic material, i.e., to reduce tension and protect the construction of safety. The exposure to and recognition of traumatic facts subject to avoidance is key to a coherent collective memory and sense of communion, and to prevent further cycles of violence. The NETfacts health system combines individual and community-based intervention to treat the structure of memory at both the individual and collective levels.Abbreviations:NET: narrative exposure therapy; FORNET: narrative exposure therapy for forensic offender rehabilitation; NETfacts: facts derived from narrative exposure therapy.© 2021 The Author(s).

A subgroup of patients has Modic changes (MC), identifiable by MRI as vertebral bone marrow lesions. The cause of such changes and their relationship to pain are not yet understood. We explored the pathobiology of these lesions using profiling of gene expression in blood, coupled with an edema-sensitive MRI technique known as short tau inversion recovery (STIR) imaging. STIR images and total RNA from blood were collected from 96 patients with chronic LBP and MC type I, the most inflammatory MC state. We found the expression of 37 genes significantly associated with STIR signal volume, ten genes with edema abundancy (a constructed combination of STIR signal volume, height, and intensity), and one gene with expression levels significantly associated with maximum STIR signal intensity. Gene sets related to interferon signaling, mitochondrial metabolism and defense response to virus were identified as significantly enriched among the upregulated genes in all three analyses. Our results point to inflammation and immunological defense as important players in MC biology in patients with chronic LBP.© 2022. The Author(s)."
