,37630778,"The Microbiome, Epigenome, and Diet in Adults with Obesity during Behavioral Weight Loss.",Nutrients,"Obesity has been linked to the gut microbiome, epigenome, and diet, yet these factors have not been studied together during obesity treatment. Our objective was to evaluate associations among gut microbiota (MB), DNA methylation (DNAme), and diet prior to and during a behavioral weight loss intervention. Adults (n= 47, age 40.9 ± 9.7 years, body mass index (BMI) 33.5 ± 4.5 kg/m2, 77% female) with data collected at baseline (BL) and 3 months (3 m) were included. Fecal MB was assessed via 16S sequencing and whole blood DNAme via the Infinium EPIC array. Food group and nutrient intakes and Healthy Eating Index (HEI) scores were calculated from 7-day diet records. Linear models were used to test for the effect of taxa relative abundance on DNAme and diet cross-sectionally at each time point, adjusting for confounders and a false discovery rate of 5%. Mean weight loss was 6.2 ± 3.9% at 3 m. At BL, one MB taxon,Ruminiclostridium, was associated with DNAme of the genesCOL20A1(r = 0.651,p= 0.029),COL18A1(r = 0.578,p= 0.044), andNT5E(r = 0.365,p= 0.043). At 3 m, there were 14 unique MB:DNAme associations, such asAkkermansiawith DNAme ofGUSB(r = -0.585,p= 0.003),CRYL1(r = -0.419,p= 0.007),C9(r = -0.439,p= 0.019), andGMDS(r = -0.559,p= 0.046). Among taxa associated with DNAme, no significant relationships were seen with dietary intakes of relevant nutrients, food groups, or HEI scores. Our findings indicate that microbes linked to mucin degradation, short-chain fatty acid production, and body weight are associated with DNAme of phenotypically relevant genes. These relationships offer an initial understanding of the possible routes by which alterations in gut MB may influence metabolism during weight loss."
,37629043,Epigenetic Regulation in Lean Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.,Int J Mol Sci,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), the most prominent cause of chronic liver disease worldwide, is a rapidly growing epidemic. It consists of a wide range of liver diseases, from steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and predisposes patients to liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and even hepatocellular carcinoma. NAFLD is strongly correlated with obesity; however, it has been extensively reported among lean/nonobese individuals in recent years. Although lean patients demonstrate a lower prevalence of diabetes mellitus, central obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and metabolic syndrome, a percentage of these patients may develop steatohepatitis, advanced liver fibrosis, and cardiovascular disease, and have increased all-cause mortality. The pathophysiological mechanisms of lean NAFLD remain vague. Studies have reported that lean NAFLD demonstrates a close association with environmental factors, genetic predisposition, and epigenetic modifications. In this review, we aim to discuss and summarize the epigenetic mechanisms involved in lean NAFLD and to introduce the interaction between epigenetic patterns and genetic or non genetic factors. Several epigenetic mechanisms have been implicated in the regulation of lean NAFLD. These include DNA methylation, histone modifications, and noncoding-RNA-mediated gene regulation. Epigenetics is an area of special interest in the setting of lean NAFLD as it could provide new insights into the therapeutic options and noninvasive biomarkers that target this under-recognized and challenging disorder."
,37626900,The Transcription Factor HOXA5: Novel Insights into Metabolic Diseases and Adipose Tissue Dysfunction.,Cells,"The transcription factorHOXA5, from theHOXgene family, has long been studied due to its critical role in physiological activities in normal cells, such as organ development and body patterning, and pathological activities in cancer cells. Nonetheless, recent evidence supports the hypothesis of a role forHOXA5in metabolic diseases, particularly in obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D). In line with the current opinion that adipocyte and adipose tissue (AT) dysfunction belong to the group of primary defects in obesity, linking this condition to an increased risk of insulin resistance (IR) and T2D, theHOXA5gene has been shown to regulate adipocyte function and AT remodeling both in humans and mice. Epigenetics adds complexity toHOXA5gene regulation in metabolic diseases. Indeed, epigenetic mechanisms, specifically DNA methylation, influence the dynamicHOXA5expression profile. In human AT, the DNA methylation profile at theHOXA5gene is associated with hypertrophic obesity and an increased risk of developing T2D. Thus, an inappropriateHOXA5gene expression may be a mechanism causing or maintaining an impaired AT function in obesity and potentially linking obesity to its associated disorders. In this review, we integrate the current evidence about the involvement ofHOXA5in regulating AT function, as well as its association with the pathogenesis of obesity and T2D. We also summarize the current knowledge on the role of DNA methylation in controllingHOXA5expression. Moreover, considering the susceptibility of epigenetic changes to reversal through targeted interventions, we discuss the potential therapeutic value of targetingHOXA5DNA methylation changes in the treatment of metabolic diseases."
,37604969,Micronutrients in early life and offspring metabolic health programming: a promising target for preventing non-communicable diseases.,Eur J Clin Nutr,"Chronic non-communicable diseases are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Developing and implementing effective preventive strategies is the best way to ensure the overall metabolic health status of the population and to counter the global burden of non-communicable diseases. Predisposition to obesity and other non-communicable diseases is due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors throughout life, but the early environment, particularly the environment during the fetal period and the early years of life, is crucial in determining metabolic health, hence the concept of 'fetal programming'. The origins of this causal link between environmental factors and disease lie in epigenetic mechanisms. Among the environmental factors, diet plays a crucial role in this process. Substantial evidence documented the key role of macronutrients in the programming of metabolic diseases early in life. Recently, the effect of maternal micronutrient intake on offspring metabolic health in later life emerged. The purpose of this narrative review is to bring to light available evidence in the literature on the effect of maternal micronutrient status on offspring metabolic health and underlying epigenetic mechanisms that drive this link to highlight its potential role in the prevention of non-communicable diseases.© 2023.

,37591977,NA,NA,"Obesity is a chronic, multifactorial disease which is linked to a number of adverse endocrinological and metabolic conditions. Currently, bariatric surgery is one of the most effective treatments for individuals diagnosed with severe obesity. However, the current indications for bariatric surgery are based on inadequate metrics (i.e., BMI) which do not account for the complexity of the disease, nor the heterogeneity among the patient population. Moreover, there is a lack of understanding with respect to the biological underpinnings that influence successful and sustained weight loss post-bariatric surgery. Studies have implicated age and pre-surgery body weight as two factors that are associated with favorable patient outcomes. Still, there is an urgent medical need to identify other potential factors that could improve the specificity of candidate selection and better inform the treatment plan of patients with obesity. In this report, we present and describe the cohort of the DECON pilot project, a multicenter study which aims to identify predictive biomarkers of successful weight loss after bariatric surgery.© 2023.

The metabolism of ingested nutrients by gut bacteria produces novel chemical mediators that can influence chemosensory cells lining the gastrointestinal tract. Specifically, hormone-releasing enteroendocrine cells which express a host of receptors activated by these bacterial metabolites. This review will focus on the activation mechanisms of glucagon-like peptide-1 releasing enteroendocrine cells by the three main bacterial metabolites produced in the gut: short-chain fatty acids, secondary bile acids and indoles. Given the importance of enteroendocrine cells in regulating glucose homeostasis and food intake, we will also discuss therapies based on these bacterial metabolites used in the treatment of metabolic diseases such as diabetes and obesity. Elucidating the mechanisms gut bacteria can influence cellular function in the host will advance our understanding of this fundamental symbiotic relationship and unlock the potential of harnessing these pathways to improve human health.Copyright © 2023 Masse and Lu."
,37663891,Nourishing the brain on deep space missions: nutritional psychiatry in promoting resilience.,Front Neural Circuits,"The grueling psychological demands of a journey into deep space coupled with ever-increasing distances away from home pose a unique problem: how can we best take advantage of the benefits of fresh foods in a place that has none? Here, we consider the biggest challenges associated with our current spaceflight food system, highlight the importance of supporting optimal brain health on missions into deep space, and discuss evidence about food components that impact brain health. We propose a future food system that leverages the gut microbiota that can be individually tailored to best support the brain and mental health of crews on deep space long-duration missions. Working toward this goal, we will also be making investments in sustainable means to nourish the crew that remains here on spaceship Earth.Copyright © 2023 Pathare, Fayet-Moore, Fogarty, Jacka, Strandwitz, Strangman and Donoviel."
,37624890,NA,NA,"The next steps of deep space exploration are manned missions to Moon and Mars. For safe space missions for crew members, it is important to understand the impact of space flight on the immune system. We studied the effects of 21 days dry immersion (DI) exposure on the transcriptomes of T cells isolated from blood samples of eight healthy volunteers. Samples were collected 7 days before DI, at day 7, 14, and 21 during DI, and 7 days after DI. RNA sequencing of CD3+T cells revealed transcriptional alterations across all time points, with most changes occurring 14 days after DI exposure. At day 21, T cells showed evidence of adaptation with a transcriptional profile resembling that of 7 days before DI. At 7 days after DI, T cells again changed their transcriptional profile. These data suggest that T cells adapt by rewiring their transcriptomes in response to simulated weightlessness and that remodeling cues persist when reexposed to normal gravity."
,37597101,Demethylation of CDKN2A in systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis: a blood biomarker for diagnosis and assessment of disease activity.,Clin Rheumatol,"Considering the phenotypic and serological heterogeneity of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), significant challenges may intervene with the precise diagnosis. In this regard, numerous studies have shown that changes in DNA methylation levels can be used to distinguish between healthy individuals and those with SLE and RA, as well as to predict disease activity and prognosis.In the current study, we evaluated quantitative methylation level of CDKN2A promoter in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of SLE and RA patients, and healthy controls by methylation-quantification of endonuclease-resistant DNA (MethyQESD), a bisulfite conversion-independent method.Our findings revealed an excessive hypomethylation of CDKN2A in SLE and RA patients compared to healthy individuals (P < 0.001). Besides, by determining efficient cutoff value, the specificity of CDKN2A for correct diagnosis of healthy subjects was measured to be 77.30% and the sensitivity for SLE and RA diagnosis were 81.33%, and 72%, respectively. Furthermore, CDKN2A methylation level was shown to be positively associated with C3 and C4 levels and negatively associated with anti‑dsDNA concentration (P < 0.001). Moreover, a statistically significant difference in the DNA methylation levels of CDKN2A promoter was identified between SLE cases with age of ≤ 18 and patients with > 18 years of age (P = 0.025).Our findings demonstrated that CDKN2A methylation levels in PBMCs of SLE and RA patients could be used as a promising diagnostic biomarker. The significant association between hypomethylation of CDKN2A promoter and disease activity factors in SLE patients, is suggesting that CDKN2A hypomethylation could be used as an alternative biomarker for assessment of disease activity. Key Points • Several studies have reported increased expression of CDKN2A in SLE and RA suggesting that it may be involved in the pathogenesis of these disorders. • CDKN2A hypomethylation has been implicated in different autoimmune diseases. • Our findings demonstrated that CDKN2A methylation levels in PBMCs of SLE and RA patients could be used as a promising diagnostic and prognostic biomarker.© 2023.

,37669926,NA,NA,"Cell lines are valuable resources as model for human biology and translational medicine. It is thus important to explore the concordance between the expression in various cell lines vis-à-vis human native and disease tissues. In this study, we investigate the expression of all human protein-coding genes in more than 1,000 human cell lines representing 27 cancer types by a genome-wide transcriptomics analysis. The cell line gene expression is compared with the corresponding profiles in various tissues, organs, single-cell types and cancers. Here, we present the expression for each cell line and give guidance for the most appropriate cell line for a given experimental study. In addition, we explore the cancer-related pathway and cytokine activity of the cell lines to aid human biology studies and drug development projects.

,37659057,NA,NA,"Surgical resection, when combined with chemotherapy, has been shown to significantly improve the survival rate of patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). However, this treatment option is only feasible for a fraction of patients, as more than 50% of cases are diagnosed with metastasis. The multifaceted process of metastasis is still not fully understood, but recent data suggest that transcriptional and epigenetic plasticity play significant roles. Interfering with epigenetic reprogramming can potentially control the adaptive processes responsible for metastatic progression and therapy resistance, thereby enhancing treatment responses and preventing recurrence. This review will focus on the relevance of histone-modifying enzymes in pancreatic cancer, specifically on their impact on the metastatic cascade. Additionally, it will also provide a brief update on the current clinical developments in epigenetic therapies.© 2023. The Author(s)."
,37660055,TAZ2 truncation confers overactivation of p300 and cellular vulnerability to HDAC inhibition.,Nat Commun,"The histone acetyltransferase p300/CBP is composed of several conserved domains, among which, the TAZ2 domain is known as a protein-protein interaction domain that binds to E1A and various transcription factors. Here we show that TAZ2 has a HAT autoinhibitory function. Truncating p300/CBP at TAZ2 leads to hyperactive HAT and elevated histone H3K27 and H3K18 acetylation in cells. Mechanistically, TAZ2 cooperates with other HAT neighboring domains to maintain the HAT active site in a 'closed' state. Truncating TAZ2 or binding of transcription factors to TAZ2 induces a conformational change that 'opens' the active site for substrate acetylation. Importantly, genetic mutations that lead to p300/CBP TAZ2 truncations are found in human cancers, and cells with TAZ2 truncations are vulnerable to histone deacetylase inhibitors. Our study reveals a function of the TAZ2 domain in HAT autoinhibitory regulation and provides a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of cancers harboring p300/CBP TAZ2 truncations.© 2023.

,37647391,TERT accelerates BRAF mutant-induced thyroid cancer dedifferentiation and progression by regulating ribosome biogenesis.,Sci Adv,"TERT reactivation occurs frequently in human malignancies, especially advanced cancers. However, in vivo functions of TERT reactivation in cancer progression and the underlying mechanism are not fully understood. In this study, we expressed TERT and/or active BRAF (BRAFV600E) specifically in mouse thyroid epithelium. WhileBRAFV600E alone induced papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), coexpression ofBRAFV600E and TERT resulted in poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma (PDTC). Spatial transcriptome analysis revealed that tumors from mice coexpressingBRAFV600E and TERT were highly heterogeneous, and cell dedifferentiation was positively correlated with ribosomal biogenesis. Mechanistically, TERT boosted ribosomal RNA (rRNA) expression and protein synthesis by interacting with multiple proteins involved in ribosomal biogenesis. Furthermore, we found that CX-5461, an rRNA transcription inhibitor, effectively blocked proliferation and induced redifferentiation of thyroid cancer. Thus, TERT promotes thyroid cancer progression by inducing cancer cell dedifferentiation, and ribosome inhibition represents a potential strategy to treat TERT-reactivated cancers."
,37645963,Multi-omic stratification of the missense variant cysteinome.,bioRxiv,"Cancer genomes are rife with genetic variants; one key outcome of this variation is gain-of-cysteine, which is the most frequently acquired amino acid due to missense variants in COSMIC. Acquired cysteines are both driver mutations and sites targeted by precision therapies. However, despite their ubiquity, nearly all acquired cysteines remain uncharacterized. Here, we pair cysteine chemoproteomics-a technique that enables proteome-wide pinpointing of functional, redox sensitive, and potentially druggable residues-with genomics to reveal the hidden landscape of cysteine acquisition. For both cancer and healthy genomes, we find that cysteine acquisition is a ubiquitous consequence of genetic variation that is further elevated in the context of decreased DNA repair. Our chemoproteogenomics platform integrates chemoproteomic, whole exome, and RNA-seq data, with a customized 2-stage false discovery rate (FDR) error controlled proteomic search, further enhanced with a user-friendly FragPipe interface. Integration of CADD predictions of deleteriousness revealed marked enrichment for likely damaging variants that result in acquisition of cysteine. By deploying chemoproteogenomics across eleven cell lines, we identify 116 gain-of-cysteines, of which 10 were liganded by electrophilic druglike molecules. Reference cysteines proximal to missense variants were also found to be pervasive, 791 in total, supporting heretofore untapped opportunities for proteoform-specific chemical probe development campaigns. As chemoproteogenomics is further distinguished by sample-matched combinatorial variant databases and compatible with redox proteomics and small molecule screening, we expect widespread utility in guiding proteoform-specific biology and therapeutic discovery."
,37629096,"Construction and Validation of a Reliable Disulfidptosis-Related LncRNAs Signature of the Subtype, Prognostic, and Immune Landscape in Colon Cancer.",Int J Mol Sci,"Disulfidptosis, a novel form of regulated cell death (RCD) associated with metabolism, represents a promising intervention target in cancer therapy. While abnormal lncRNA expression is associated with colon cancer development, the prognostic potential and biological characteristics of disulfidptosis-related lncRNAs (DRLs) remain unclear. Consequently, the research aimed to discover a novel indication of DRLs with significant prognostic implications, and to investigate their possible molecular role in the advancement of colon cancer. Here, we acquired RNA-seq data, pertinent clinical data, and genomic mutations of colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) from the TCGA database, and then DRLs were determined through Pearson correlation analysis. A total of 434 COAD patients were divided in to three subgroups through clustering analysis based on DRLs. By utilizing univariate Cox regression, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm, and multivariate Cox regression analysis, we ultimately created a prognostic model consisting of four DRLs (AC007728.3, AP003555.1, ATP2B1.AS1, and NSMCE1.DT), and an external database was used to validate the prognostic features of the risk model. According to the Kaplan-Meier curve analysis, patients in the low-risk group exhibited a considerably superior survival time in comparison to those in the high-risk group. Enrichment analysis revealed a significant association between metabolic processes and the genes that were differentially expressed in the high- and low-risk groups. Additionally, significant differences in the tumor immune microenvironment landscape were observed, specifically pertaining to immune cells, function, and checkpoints. High-risk patients exhibited a low likelihood of immune evasion, as indicated by the Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE) analysis. Patients who exhibit both a high risk and high Tumor Mutational Burden (TMB) experience the least amount of time for survival, whereas those belonging to the low-risk and low-TMB category demonstrate the most favorable prognosis. In addition, the risk groups determined by the 4-DRLs signature displayed distinct drug sensitivities. Finally, we confirmed the levels of expression for four DRLs through rt-qPCR in both tissue samples from colon cancer patients and cell lines. Taken together, the first 4-DRLs-based signature we proposed may serve for a hopeful instrument for forecasting the prognosis, immune landscape, and therapeutic responses in colon cancer patients, thereby facilitating optimal clinical decision-making."
,37627150,Luciferase Expressing Preclinical Model Systems Representing the Different Molecular Subtypes of Colorectal Cancer.,Cancers (Basel),"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a heterogeneous disease. More insight into the biological diversity of CRC is needed to improve therapeutic outcomes. Established CRC cell lines are frequently used and were shown to be representative models of the main subtypes of CRC at the genomic and transcriptomic level. In the present work, we established stable, luciferase expressing derivatives from 10 well-established CRC cell lines, generated spheroids and subcutaneous xenograft tumors in nude mice, and performed comparative characterization of these model systems. Transcriptomic analyses revealed the close relation of cell lines with their derived spheroids and xenograft tumors. The preclinical model systems clustered with patient tumor samples when compared to normal tissue thereby confirming that cell-line-based tumor models retain specific characteristics of primary tumors. Xenografts showed different differentiation patterns and bioluminescence imaging revealed metastatic spread to the lungs. In addition, the models were classified according to the CMS classification system, with further sub-classification according to the recently identified two intrinsic epithelial tumor cell states of CRC, iCMS2 and iCMS3. The combined data showed that regarding primary tumor characteristics, 3D-spheroid cultures resemble xenografts more closely than 2D-cultured cells do. Furthermore, we set up a bioluminescence-based spheroid cytotoxicity assay in order to be able to perform dose-response relationship studies in analogy to typical monolayer assays. Applying the established assay, we studied the efficacy of oxaliplatin. Seven of the ten used cell lines showed a significant reduction in the response to oxaliplatin in the 3D-spheroid model compared to the 2D-monolayer model. Therapy studies in selected xenograft models confirmed the response or lack of response to oxaliplatin treatment. Analyses of differentially expressed genes in these models identified CAV1 as a possible marker of oxaliplatin resistance. In conclusion, we established a combined 2D/3D, in vitro/in vivo model system representing the heterogeneity of CRC, which can be used in preclinical research applications."
,37620409,Synthetic viability induces resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors in cancer cells.,Br J Cancer,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have revolutionized the treatment for multiple cancers. However, most of patients encounter resistance. Synthetic viability (SV) between genes could induce resistance. In this study, we established SV signature to predict the efficacy of ICI treatment for melanoma.We collected features and predicted SV gene pairs by random forest classifier. This work prioritized SV gene pairs based on CRISPR/Cas9 screens. SV gene pairs signature were constructed to predict the response to ICI for melanoma patients.This study predicted robust SV gene pairs based on 14 features. Filtered by CRISPR/Cas9 screens, we identified 1,861 SV gene pairs, which were also related with prognosis across multiple cancer types. Next, we constructed the six SV pairs signature to predict resistance to ICI for melanoma patients. This study applied the six SV pairs signature to divide melanoma patients into high-risk and low-risk. High-risk melanoma patients were associated with worse response after ICI treatment. Immune landscape analysis revealed that high-risk melanoma patients had lower natural killer cells and CD8+T cells infiltration.In summary, the 14 features classifier accurately predicted robust SV gene pairs for cancer. The six SV pairs signature could predict resistance to ICI.© 2023. The Author(s)."
,37612728,Partial gene suppression improves identification of cancer vulnerabilities when CRISPR-Cas9 knockout is pan-lethal.,Genome Biol,"Hundreds of functional genomic screens have been performed across a diverse set of cancer contexts, as part of efforts such as the Cancer Dependency Map, to identify gene dependencies-genes whose loss of function reduces cell viability or fitness. Recently, large-scale screening efforts have shifted from RNAi to CRISPR-Cas9, due to superior efficacy and specificity. However, many effective oncology drugs only partially inhibit their protein targets, leading us to question whether partial suppression of genes using RNAi could reveal cancer vulnerabilities that are missed by complete knockout using CRISPR-Cas9. Here, we compare CRISPR-Cas9 and RNAi dependency profiles of genes across approximately 400 matched cancer cell lines.We find that CRISPR screens accurately identify more gene dependencies per cell line, but the majority of each cell line's dependencies are part of a set of 1867 genes that are shared dependencies across the entire collection (pan-lethals). While RNAi knockdown of about 30% of these genes is also pan-lethal, approximately 50% have selective dependency patterns across cell lines, suggesting they could still be cancer vulnerabilities. The accuracy of the unique RNAi selectivity is supported by associations to multi-omics profiles, drug sensitivity, and other expected co-dependencies.Incorporating RNAi data for genes that are pan-lethal knockouts facilitates the discovery of a wider range of gene targets than could be detected using the CRISPR dataset alone. This can aid in the interpretation of contrasting results obtained from CRISPR and RNAi screens and reinforce the importance of partial gene suppression methods in building a cancer dependency map.© 2023.

,37591722,A novel antifolate suppresses growth of FPGS-deficient cells and overcomes methotrexate resistance.,Life Sci Alliance,"Cancer cells make extensive use of the folate cycle to sustain increased anabolic metabolism. Multiple chemotherapeutic drugs interfere with the folate cycle, including methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil that are commonly applied for the treatment of leukemia and colorectal cancer (CRC), respectively. Despite high success rates, therapy-induced resistance causes relapse at later disease stages. Depletion of folylpolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS), which normally promotes intracellular accumulation and activity of natural folates and methotrexate, is linked to methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil resistance and its association with relapse illustrates the need for improved intervention strategies. Here, we describe a novel antifolate (C1) that, like methotrexate, potently inhibits dihydrofolate reductase and downstream one-carbon metabolism. Contrary to methotrexate, C1 displays optimal efficacy in FPGS-deficient contexts, due to decreased competition with intracellular folates for interaction with dihydrofolate reductase. We show that FPGS-deficient patient-derived CRC organoids display enhanced sensitivity to C1, whereas FPGS-high CRC organoids are more sensitive to methotrexate. Our results argue that polyglutamylation-independent antifolates can be applied to exert selective pressure on FPGS-deficient cells during chemotherapy, using a vulnerability created by polyglutamylation deficiency.© 2023 van der Krift et al."
,37578979,Deconvolution of cancer cell states by the XDec-SM method.,PLoS Comput Biol,"Proper characterization of cancer cell states within the tumor microenvironment is a key to accurately identifying matching experimental models and the development of precision therapies. To reconstruct this information from bulk RNA-seq profiles, we developed the XDec Simplex Mapping (XDec-SM) reference-optional deconvolution method that maps tumors and the states of constituent cells onto a biologically interpretable low-dimensional space. The method identifies gene sets informative for deconvolution from relevant single-cell profiling data when such profiles are available. When applied to breast tumors in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), XDec-SM infers the identity of constituent cell types and their proportions. XDec-SM also infers cancer cells states within individual tumors that associate with DNA methylation patterns, driver somatic mutations, pathway activation and metabolic coupling between stromal and breast cancer cells. By projecting tumors, cancer cell lines, and PDX models onto the same map, we identify in vitro and in vivo models with matching cancer cell states. Map position is also predictive of therapy response, thus opening the prospects for precision therapy informed by experiments in model systems matched to tumors in vivo by cancer cell state.Copyright: © 2023 Murillo et al.

,37578973,NA,NA,"Although children and adolescents with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) have high survival rates, approximately 15-20% of patients relapse. Risk of relapse is routinely estimated at diagnosis by biological factors, including flow cytometry data. This high-dimensional data is typically manually assessed by projecting it onto a subset of biomarkers. Cell density and ""empty spaces"" in 2D projections of the data, i.e. regions devoid of cells, are then used for qualitative assessment. Here, we use topological data analysis (TDA), which quantifies shapes, including empty spaces, in data, to analyse pre-treatment ALL datasets with known patient outcomes. We combine these fully unsupervised analyses with Machine Learning (ML) to identify significant shape characteristics and demonstrate that they accurately predict risk of relapse, particularly for patients previously classified as 'low risk'. We independently confirm the predictive power of CD10, CD20, CD38, and CD45 as biomarkers for ALL diagnosis. Based on our analyses, we propose three increasingly detailed prognostic pipelines for analysing flow cytometry data from ALL patients depending on technical and technological availability: 1. Visual inspection of specific biological features in biparametric projections of the data; 2. Computation of quantitative topological descriptors of such projections; 3. A combined analysis, using TDA and ML, in the four-parameter space defined by CD10, CD20, CD38 and CD45.

,37577299,Overexpression of MRPL19 in predicting poor prognosis and promoting the development of lung adenocarcinoma.,Transl Lung Cancer Res,"Mitochondrial ribosomal protein L19 (MRPL19) is a member of the mitochondrial ribosomal protein (MRP) family. MRPs have a role in the progression of many cancers. However, the role ofMRPL19in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is yet unknown.The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets, real-time polymerase chain reaction, and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were used to assessMRPL19expression and clinical relevance. Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) and the online Kaplan-Meier (KM) Plotter database were used to determine the prognostic significance. Through use of LinkedOmics, genes that were coexpressed withMRPL19and its regulators were identified. The biological roles ofMRPL19were investigated through R-implemented packages and RNA interference. The Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER) was employed to assess the connection betweenMRPL19expression and infiltrated immune cells in LUAD.MRPL19expression in LUAD was upregulated and was correlated with lymph node metastasis, differentiation level, and tumor status.MRPL19was prognostic and associated with poor prognosis. Functional network analysis revealed thatMRPL19may be associated with the cell cycle, cell adhesion molecules, spliceosome, and T-helper cell differentiation and was regulated by several microRNA and the E2F family. The gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network indicated thatMRPL19was correlated with cancer proliferation signaling pathways. The immune infiltration analysis revealed a correlation betweenMRPL19expression and the extent of B cells, CD4+T cells, and dendritic cells' infiltration in LUAD. Additionally,MRPL19knockdown in LUAD cells substantially reduced cell growth, migration, and invasion of malignant cells.The poor prognosis and immunological infiltration in LUAD were significantly associated withMRPL19, which may have pro-oncogenic effects on the disease.2023 Translational Lung Cancer Research.

,37572177,Tumoral P2Y(2) receptor modulates tumor growth and host anti-tumor immune responses in a syngeneic murine model of oral cancer.,Purinergic Signal,"Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) are a heterogenous group of tumors and among the top 10 most common cancers and they arise from the epithelial tissues of the mucosal surfaces of the oral cavity, oropharynx, and larynx. Aberrant purinergic signaling has been associated with various cancer types. Here, we studied the role of the P2Y2purinergic receptor (P2Y2R) in the context of oral cancer. We utilized bioinformatics analysis of deposited datasets to examine purinome gene expression in HNSCC tumors and cells lines and functionally characterized nucleotide-induced P2 receptor signaling in human FaDu and Cal27 and murine MOC2 oral cancer cell lines. Utilizing tumorigenesis assays with wild-type or P2ry2 knockout MOC2 cells we evaluated the role of P2Y2Rs in tumor growth and the host anti-tumor immune responses. Our data demonstrate that human and murine oral cancer cell lines express numerous P2 receptors, with the P2Y2R being highly expressed. Using syngeneic tumor grafts in wild-type mice, we observed that MOC2 tumors expressing P2Y2R were larger than P2Y2R-/-tumors. Wild-type MOC2 tumors contained a lower population of tumor-infiltrating CD11b+F4/80+macrophages and CD3+ cells, which were revealed to be CD3+CD4+IFNγ+T cells, compared to P2Y2R-/-tumors. These results were mirrored when utilizing P2Y2R-/-mice, indicating that the changes in MOC2 tumor growth and to the host anti-tumor immune response were independent of host derived P2Y2Rs. Results suggest that targeted suppression of the P2Y2R in HNSCC cells in vivo, rather than systemic P2Y2R antagonism, may be a more effective treatment strategy for HNSCCs.© 2023.

The aim of our study was to clarify the role ofFoxP3in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) progression and metastasis. We verified theFoxP3characteristic clinicopathological data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database using bioinformatics tools. Meanwhile, RNA sequencing was performed to determine theFoxP3biofunction in RCC progression. Our results showed that high expression ofFoxP3was found inBAP1- orSETD2-mutant patients with RCC, and a higherFoxP3expression was related to worse prognosis. However, there was no statistically significant relationship between theFoxP3IHC score and RCC malignant progression owning to the limited number of patients in our tissue microarray. Using in vitroFoxP3loss-of-function assays, we verified that silencingFoxP3in 786-O and ACHN cells could inhibit the cell migration/invasion capability, which was consistent with the data from RNA sequencing in 786-O cells and from the TCGA datasets. Using an in vivo nude mice orthotopic kidney cancer model, we found that silencingFoxP3could inhibit tumor growth. In conclusion, our study demonstrated thatBAP1orSEDT2mutation could lead to higher expression ofFoxP3in RCC patients, andFoxP3could eventually stimulate RCC cells' invasion and metastasis, which might indicate thatFoxP3could function as a potential oncogene in RCC progression."
,37564101,Comparative transcriptome characterization of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma.,Comput Struct Biotechnol J,"Esophageal cancers are primarily categorized as esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). While various (epi) genomic alterations associated with tumor development in ESCC and EAC have been documented, a comprehensive comparison of the transcriptomes in these two cancer subtypes remains lacking.We collected 551 gene expression profiles from publicly available sources, including normal, ESCC, and EAC tissues or cell lines. Subsequently, we conducted a systematic analysis to compare the transcriptomes of these samples at various levels, including gene expression, promoter activity, alternative splicing (AS), alternative polyadenylation (APA), and gene fusion.Seven distinct cluster gene expression patterns were identified among the differentially expressed genes in normal, ESCC, and EAC tissues. These patterns were enriched in the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway and the activation of extracellular matrix organization and exhibited repression of epidermal development. Notably, we observed additional genes or unique expression levels enriched in these shared pathways and biological processes related to tumor development and immune activation. In addition to the differentially expressed genes, there was an enrichment of lncRNA co-expression networks and downregulation of promoter activity associated with the repression of epidermal development in both ESCC and EAC. This indicates a common feature between these two cancer subtypes. Furthermore, differential AS and APA patterns in ESCC and EAC appear to partially affect the expression of host genes associated with bacterial or viral infections in these subtypes. No gene fusions were observed between ESCC and EAC, thus highlighting the distinct molecular mechanisms underlying these two cancer subtypes.We conducted a comprehensive comparison of ESCC and EAC transcriptomes and uncovered shared and distinct transcriptomic signatures at multiple levels. These findings suggest that ESCC and EAC may exhibit common and unique mechanisms involved in tumorigenesis.© 2023 The Authors.

,37558831,NA,NA,"Aberrant DNA methylation accompanies genetic alterations during oncogenesis and tumour homeostasis and contributes to the transcriptional deregulation of key signalling pathways in cancer. Despite increasing efforts in DNA methylation profiling of cancer patients, there is still a lack of epigenetic biomarkers to predict treatment efficacy. To address this, we analyse 721 cancer cell lines across 22 cancer types treated with 453 anti-cancer compounds. We systematically detect the predictive component of DNA methylation in the context of transcriptional and mutational patterns, i.e., in total 19 DNA methylation biomarkers across 17 drugs and five cancer types. DNA methylation constitutes drug sensitivity biomarkers by mediating the expression of proximal genes, thereby enhancing biological signals across multi-omics data modalities. Our method reproduces anticipated associations, and in addition, we find that the NEK9 promoter hypermethylation may confer sensitivity to the NEDD8-activating enzyme (NAE) inhibitor pevonedistat in melanoma through downregulation of NEK9. In summary, we envision that epigenomics will refine existing patient stratification, thus empowering the next generation of precision oncology.© 2023. Springer Nature Limited."
,37554444,The SWI/SNF complex member SMARCB1 supports lineage fidelity in kidney cancer.,iScience,"Lineage switching can induce therapy resistance in cancer. Yet, how lineage fidelity is maintained and how it can be lost remain poorly understood. Here, we have used CRISPR-Cas9-based genetic screening to demonstrate that loss of SMARCB1, a member of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, can confer an advantage to clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) cells upon inhibition of the renal lineage factor PAX8. Lineage factor inhibition-resistant ccRCC cells formed tumors with morphological features, but not molecular markers, of neuroendocrine differentiation. SMARCB1 inactivation led to large-scale loss of kidney-specific epigenetic programs and restoration of proliferative capacity through the adoption of new dependencies on factors that represent rare essential genes across different cancers. We further developed an analytical approach to systematically characterize lineage fidelity using large-scale CRISPR-Cas9 data. An understanding of the rules that govern lineage switching could aid the development of more durable lineage factor-targeted and other cancer therapies.© 2023 The Author(s)."
,37546802,Ribosome subunit attrition and activation of the p53-MDM4 axis dominate the response of MLL-rearranged cancer cells to WDR5 WIN site inhibition.,bioRxiv,"The chromatin-associated protein WDR5 is a promising target for cancer drug discovery, with most efforts blocking an arginine-binding cavity on the protein called the ""WIN"" site that tethers WDR5 to chromatin. WIN site inhibitors (WINi) are active against multiple cancer cell types in vitro, the most notable of which are those derived from MLL-rearranged (MLLr) leukemias. Peptidomimetic WINi were originally proposed to inhibit MLLr cells via dysregulation of genes connected to hematopoetic stem cell expansion. Our discovery and interrogation of small molecule WIN site inhibitors, however, revealed that they act in MLLr cell lines to suppress ribosome protein gene (RPG) transcription, induce nucleolar stress, and activate p53. Because there is no precedent for an anti-cancer strategy that specifically targets RPG expression, we took an integrated multi-omics approach to further interrogate the mechanism of action of WINi in MLLr cancer cells. We show that WINi induce depletion of the stock of ribosomes, accompanied by a broad translational choke, induction of a DNA damage response, and changes in alternative mRNA splicing that inactivate the p53 antagonist MDM4. We also show that WINi are synergistic with agents including venetoclax and BET-bromodomain inhibitors. Together, these studies reinforce the concept that WINi are a novel type of ribosome-directed anti-cancer therapy and provide a resource to support their clinical implementation in MLLr leukemias and other malignancies."
,37544034,APE1 promotes radiation resistance against radiation-induced pyroptosis by inhibiting the STING pathway in lung adenocarcinoma.,Transl Oncol,"Mammalian apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1, APEX1) is a multifunctional enzyme that maintains cellular homeostasis. It is involved in the base excision repair (BER) pathway and plays a key role in radiation-induced DNA damage response. However, the relationship between APE1-driven radiation resistance and pyroptosis in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) cells and the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. We found that APE1 was significantly upregulated in LUAD tissues compared to para-carcinoma tissues and promoted the proliferation and invasion of LUAD cells in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, APE1 inhibited pyroptosis by inactivating the interferon gene stimulator (STING) pathway via direct interaction with AIM2 and DDX41, as detected by RNA-seq and co-immunoprecipitation. APE1 protects LUAD cells against radiation-induced damage and induces radio-resistance by targeting the STING pathway. It can induce pyroptosis and is negatively regulated by interactions with AIM2 and DDX41. Therefore, APE1 inhibitors should be considered to enhance the radiosensitivity of LUAD cells and improve patient prognosis and therapeutic outcomes. Thus, APE1 play a role in the tumor immune microenvironment and in tumor immunotherapy.Copyright © 2023. Published by Elsevier Inc."
,37523146,High-Throughput Drug Screening of Primary Tumor Cells Identifies Therapeutic Strategies for Treating Children with High-Risk Cancer.,Cancer Res,"For one-third of patients with pediatric cancer enrolled in precision medicine programs, molecular profiling does not result in a therapeutic recommendation. To identify potential strategies for treating these high-risk pediatric patients, we performed in vitro screening of 125 patient-derived samples against a library of 126 anticancer drugs. Tumor cell expansion did not influence drug responses, and 82% of the screens on expanded tumor cells were completed while the patients were still under clinical care. High-throughput drug screening (HTS) confirmed known associations between activating genomic alterations in NTRK, BRAF, and ALK and responses to matching targeted drugs. The in vitro results were further validated in patient-derived xenograft models in vivo and were consistent with clinical responses in treated patients. In addition, effective combinations could be predicted by correlating sensitivity profiles between drugs. Furthermore, molecular integration with HTS identified biomarkers of sensitivity to WEE1 and MEK inhibition. Incorporating HTS into precision medicine programs is a powerful tool to accelerate the improved identification of effective biomarker-driven therapeutic strategies for treating high-risk pediatric cancers.Integrating HTS with molecular profiling is a powerful tool for expanding precision medicine to support drug treatment recommendations and broaden the therapeutic options available to high-risk pediatric cancers.©2023 The Authors; Published by the American Association for Cancer Research."
,37488358,Collateral lethality between HDAC1 and HDAC2 exploits cancer-specific NuRD complex vulnerabilities.,Nat Struct Mol Biol,"Transcriptional co-regulators have been widely pursued as targets for disrupting oncogenic gene regulatory programs. However, many proteins in this target class are universally essential for cell survival, which limits their therapeutic window. Here we unveil a genetic interaction between histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) and HDAC2, wherein each paralog is synthetically lethal with hemizygous deletion of the other. This collateral synthetic lethality is caused by recurrent chromosomal deletions that occur in diverse solid and hematological malignancies, including neuroblastoma and multiple myeloma. Using genetic disruption or dTAG-mediated degradation, we show that targeting HDAC2 suppresses the growth of HDAC1-deficient neuroblastoma in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, we find that targeted degradation of HDAC2 in these cells prompts the degradation of several members of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex, leading to diminished chromatin accessibility at HDAC2-NuRD-bound sites of the genome and impaired control of enhancer-associated transcription. Furthermore, we reveal that several of the degraded NuRD complex subunits are dependencies in neuroblastoma and multiple myeloma, providing motivation to develop paralog-selective HDAC1 or HDAC2 degraders that could leverage HDAC1/2 synthetic lethality to target NuRD vulnerabilities. Altogether, we identify HDAC1/2 collateral synthetic lethality as a potential therapeutic target and reveal an unexplored mechanism for targeting NuRD-associated cancer dependencies.© 2023.

,37487008,Single-cell transcriptomics reveals the drivers and therapeutic targets of lymph node metastasis in lung adenocarcinoma.,Aging (Albany NY),"Lymph node metastasis (LNM) is usually the most common metastatic pathway in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and is associated with a poorer prognosis and higher possibility of recurrence. Therefore, discovering the drivers and therapeutic targets of LNM is important for early and non-invasive detection of patients with a high risk of LNM and guiding individualized therapy. Various cell constitutions of the primary tumor and lymph node microenvironment was characterized based on scRNA-seq data. The copy number variation (CNV) analysis was performed to probe clonal structures and origins of metastatic lymph nodes, and found 6q loss and 20q gain may drive LNM in LUAD. Then a LNM-related cell subset, named Scissor+ cells, was identified using the Scissor algorithm. And cell-cell communication network among Scissor+ cells and microenvironment was further analyzed. Besides, a pro-LNM signature was subsequently constructed based on 27 genes using pseudotime trajectory analysis and gene set variation analysis. The pro-LNM signature showed a significant correlation withNstage and a good predictive ability of LUAD survival. At last, we identified that erastin and gefitinib could potentially inhibit LNM by targeting Scissor+ cells based on the drug sensitivity data of the cancer cell lines, which provided new insights for LUAD therapy."
,37577627,KAT6A mutations in Arboleda-Tham syndrome drive epigenetic regulation of posterior HOXC cluster.,bioRxiv,"Arboleda-Tham Syndrome (ARTHS) is a rare genetic disorder caused by heterozygous,de novotruncating mutations inLysine(K) acetyltransferase 6A(KAT6A). ARTHS is clinically heterogeneous and characterized by several common features including intellectual disability, developmental and speech delay, hypotonia and affects multiple organ systems.KAT6Ais highly expressed in early development and plays a key role in cell-type specific differentiation. KAT6A is the enzymatic core of a histone-acetylation protein complex, however the direct histone targets and gene regulatory effects remain unknown. In this study, we use ARTHS patient (n=8) and control (n=14) dermal fibroblasts and perform comprehensive profiling of the epigenome and transcriptome caused byKAT6Amutations. We identified differential chromatin accessibility within the promoter or gene body of 23%(14/60) of genes that were differentially expressed between ARTHS and controls. Within fibroblasts, we show a distinct set of genes from the posteriorHOXCgene cluster (HOXC10,HOXC11,HOXC-AS3, HOXC-AS2, HOTAIR) that are overexpressed in ARTHS and are transcription factors critical for early development body segment patterning. The genomic loci harboring HOXC genes are epigenetically regulated with increased chromatin accessibility, high levels of H3K23ac, and increased gene-body DNA methylation compared to controls, all of which are consistent with transcriptomic overexpression. Finally, we used unbiased proteomic mass spectrometry and identified two new histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) that are disrupted in ARTHS: H2A and H3K56 acetylation. Our multi-omics assays have identified novel histone and gene regulatory roles ofKAT6Ain a large group of ARTHS patients harboring diverse pathogenic mutations. This work provides insight into the role of KAT6A on the epigenomic regulation in somatic cell types."
,37627316,NA,NA,"Intracranial and extracranial large-artery atherosclerosis (LAA) are a main cause of ischemic stroke. Biomarkers may aid in the diagnosis of LAA and help to stratify patients' risk of stroke. We performed a narrative review of the literature, mainly published in the last five years, with the aim of identifying biomarkers associated either with intracranial or extracranial LAA in humans. Several potential biomarkers of LAA, mainly related to lipidic pathways and inflammation, have been studied. Diagnostic biomarkers of LAA were evaluated by measuring biomarkers levels in patients with LAA stroke and other stroke etiologies. Some biomarkers were associated with the functional prognosis of LAA stroke patients. Increased levels of IL-6 and sLOX-1 were associated with a risk of progression of carotid atherosclerotic disease. Findings support the notion that the immune system plays a central role in the pathogenesis of LAA. Overall, in most studies, results were not externally validated. In the future, biomarkers could be useful for the selection of patients for clinical trials. To adopt these biomarkers in clinical practice, we will need robust multicentric studies proving their reproducibility and a clear practical applicability for their use."

It was hypothesized that the gut microbiota, the plasma and fecal metabolites significantly correlated with intelligence quotient (IQ) in school-age children in current study.This cross-sectional study enrolled 452 children aged 6-9 years old. IQ was measured using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Fourth Edition. Fecal microbiota, plasma and fecal metabolites were analyzed using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and targeted metabolomic technologies, respectively.Restricted maximum likelihood (REML) analyses showed that microbiota composition and fecal metabolites were associated with neither subscale nor full-scale IQ (P: 0.059-0.500). However, plasma metabolites were significantly correlated with the processing speed (P=0.008). In multiple regression analysis after adjusting for confounders and multiple test correction, benzoic acid, azelaic acid, adipic acid, suberic acid and malonic acid selected by the multivariate methods with unbiased variable selection were positively associated with processing speed index (PSI) [Pfalse discovery rate (FDR): 0.006-0.024], whereas pyruvic acid was negatively associated with the PSI and full-scale IQ (PFDR: 0.014-0.030).In normal school-age children, certain plasma metabolites concentrations but not the gut microbiota composition nor fecal metabolites are correlated with intelligence.2023 Translational Pediatrics.

,37601094,Post-translational modifications and protein quality control of mitochondrial channels and transporters.,Front Cell Dev Biol,"Mitochondria play a critical role in energy metabolism and signal transduction, which is tightly regulated by proteins, metabolites, and ion fluxes. Metabolites and ion homeostasis are mainly mediated by channels and transporters present on mitochondrial membranes. Mitochondria comprise two distinct compartments, the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) and the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM), which have differing permeabilities to ions and metabolites. The OMM is semipermeable due to the presence of non-selective molecular pores, while the IMM is highly selective and impermeable due to the presence of specialized channels and transporters which regulate ion and metabolite fluxes. These channels and transporters are modulated by various post-translational modifications (PTMs), including phosphorylation, oxidative modifications, ions, and metabolites binding, glycosylation, acetylation, and others. Additionally, the mitochondrial protein quality control (MPQC) system plays a crucial role in ensuring efficient molecular flux through the mitochondrial membranes by selectively removing mistargeted or defective proteins. Inefficient functioning of the transporters and channels in mitochondria can disrupt cellular homeostasis, leading to the onset of various pathological conditions. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the current understanding of mitochondrial channels and transporters in terms of their functions, PTMs, and quality control mechanisms.Copyright © 2023 Kadam, Jadiya and Tomar."
,37591949,NA,NA,"LINE-1s are the major clade of retrotransposons with autonomous retrotransposition activity. Despite the potential genotoxicity, LINE-1s are highly activated in early embryos. Here we show that a subset of young LINE-1s, L1Md_Ts, are marked by the RNA polymerase II elongation factor ELL3, and function as enhancers in mouse embryonic stem cells. ELL3 depletion dislodges the DNA hydroxymethylase TET1 and the co-repressor SIN3A from L1Md_Ts, but increases the enrichment of the Bromodomain protein BRD4, leading to loss of 5hmC, gain of H3K27ac, and upregulation of the L1Md_T nearby genes. Specifically, ELL3 occupies and represses the L1Md_T-based enhancer located within Akt3, which encodes a key regulator of AKT pathway. ELL3 is required for proper ERK activation and efficient shutdown of naïve pluripotency through inhibiting Akt3 during naïve-primed transition. Our study reveals that the enhancer function of a subset of young LINE-1s controlled by ELL3 in transcription regulation and mouse early embryo development.© 2023.

,37645713,Dissecting tumor transcriptional heterogeneity from single-cell RNA-seq data by generalized binary covariance decomposition.,bioRxiv,"Profiling tumors with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has the potential to identify recurrent patterns of transcription variation related to cancer progression, and so produce new therapeutically-relevant insights. However, the presence of strong inter-tumor heterogeneity often obscures more subtle patterns that are shared across tumors, some of which may characterize clinically-relevant disease subtypes. Here we introduce a new statistical method to address this problem. We show that this method can help decompose transcriptional heterogeneity into interpretable components - including patient-specific, dataset-specific and shared components relevant to disease subtypes - and that, in the presence of strong inter-tumor heterogeneity, our method can produce more interpretable results than existing widely-used methods. Applied to data from three studies on pancreatic cancer adenocarcinoma (PDAC), our method produces a refined characterization of existing tumor subtypes (e.g. classical vs basal), and identifies a new gene expression program (GEP) that is prognostic of poor survival independent of established prognostic factors such as tumor stage and subtype. The new GEP is enriched for genes involved in a variety of stress responses, and suggests a potentially important role for the integrated stress response in PDAC development and prognosis."

The Euclidean distance used in most distance-based methods is not optimal. The batch effect, i.e., the variability among samples gathered from different times, tissues, and patients, introduces large between-group distance and obscures the true identities of cells. To solve this problem, we introduce Batch-Corrected Distance (BCD), a metric using temporal/spatial locality of the batch effect to control for such factors. We validate BCD on simulated data as well as applied it to a mouse retina development dataset and a lung dataset. We also found the utility of our approach in understanding the progression of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). BCD achieves more accurate clusters and better visualizations than state-of-the-art batch correction methods on longitudinal datasets.

In this study, we explored the underlying molecular mechanism that is dysregulated in both diseases.Weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) was executed with the SLE and BRCA datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) website and identified the potential role of membrane metalloendopeptidase (MME) in both diseases. Then, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses of related proteins and miRNAs were performed to investigate the potential molecular pathways.WGCNA revealed that MME was positively related to SLE but negatively related to BRCA. In BRCA, MME expression was significantly decreased in tumor tissues, especially in luminal B and infiltrating ductal carcinoma subtypes. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis identified MME as a valuable diagnostic biomarker of BRCA, with an area under the curve (AUC) value equal to 0.984 (95% confidence interval = 0.976-0.992). KEGG enrichment analysis suggested that MME-related proteins and targeted miRNAs may reduce the incidence of BRCA in SLE patients via the PI3K/AKT/FOXO signaling pathway. Low MME expression was associated with favorable relapse-free survival (RFS) but no other clinical outcomes and may contribute to resistance to chemotherapy in BRCA, with an AUC equal to 0.527 (P value < 0.05).In summary, MME expression was significantly decreased in BRCA but positively correlated with SLE, and it might reduce the incidence of BRCA in SLE patients via the PI3K/AKT/FOXO signaling pathway.Copyright: © 2023 Ding et al.

Accordingly, there is an urgent need to discover and identify novel molecular targets for the treatment and diagnosis of this disease. In this study, we analyzed the correlation of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) methylation status with TERT expression, prognosis, and immune infiltration in TNBC and identified the role of TERT methylation in the regulation TNBC prognosis and immunotherapy.Data relating to the transcriptome, clinicopathological characteristics and methylation of TNBC patients were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. TERT expression levels and differential methylation sites (DMSs) were detected. The correlations between TERT expression and DMSs were calculated. Kaplan-Meier curves was plotted to analyze the relationship between the survival of TNBC patients and the DMSs. The correlations of DMSs and TERT expression with several immunological characteristics of immune microenvironment (immune cell infiltration, immunomodulators, immune-related biological pathways, and immune checkpoints) were assessed. The results were validated using 40 TNBC patients from Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center (SYSUCC).Six DMSs were identified. Among them, four sites (cg11625005, cg07380026, cg17166338, and cg26006951) were within the TERT promoter, in which two sites (cg07380026 and cg26006951) were significantly related to the prognosis of patients with TNBC. Further validation using 40 TNBC samples from SYSUCC showed that the high methylation of the cg26006951 CpG site was associated with poor survival prognosis (P=0.0022). TERT expression was significantly correlated with pathological N stage and clinical stage, and cg07380026 were significantly associated with pathological T and N stages in the TCGA cohort. Moreover, the methylation site cg26006951, cg07380026 and TERT expression were significantly correlated with immune cell infiltration, common immunomodulators, and the level of the immune checkpoint receptor lymphocyte activation gene 3 (LAG-3) in TNBC patients.TERT promotertypermethylation plays an important role in TERT expression regulation and tumor microenvironment in TNBC. It is associated with overall survival and LAG-3 expression. TERT promoter hypermethylation may be a potential molecular biomarker for predicting response to the TERT inhibitors and immune checkpoint inhibitors in TNBC.Copyright © 2023 Lin, Huang, Zhu, Jiang, Guo, Xia, Chen, Guo, Deng and Lin."
,37527019,USNAP: fast unique dense region detection and its application to lung cancer.,Bioinformatics,"Many real-world problems can be modeled as annotated graphs. Scalable graph algorithms that extract actionable information from such data are in demand since these graphs are large, varying in topology, and have diverse node/edge annotations. When these graphs change over time they create dynamic graphs, and open the possibility to find patterns across different time points. In this article, we introduce a scalable algorithm that finds unique dense regions across time points in dynamic graphs. Such algorithms have applications in many different areas, including the biological, financial, and social domains.There are three important contributions to this manuscript. First, we designed a scalable algorithm, USNAP, to effectively identify dense subgraphs that are unique to a time stamp given a dynamic graph. Importantly, USNAP provides a lower bound of the density measure in each step of the greedy algorithm. Second, insights and understanding obtained from validating USNAP on real data show its effectiveness. While USNAP is domain independent, we applied it to four non-small cell lung cancer gene expression datasets. Stages in non-small cell lung cancer were modeled as dynamic graphs, and input to USNAP. Pathway enrichment analyses and comprehensive interpretations from literature show that USNAP identified biologically relevant mechanisms for different stages of cancer progression. Third, USNAP is scalable, and has a time complexity of O(m+mc log nc+nc log nc), where m is the number of edges, and n is the number of vertices in the dynamic graph; mc is the number of edges, and nc is the number of vertices in the collapsed graph.The code of USNAP is available at https://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~juris/data/USNAP22.© The Author(s) 2023.

,37607190,Inferring gene regulatory networks using transcriptional profiles as dynamical attractors.,PLoS Comput Biol,"Genetic regulatory networks (GRNs) regulate the flow of genetic information from the genome to expressed messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and thus are critical to controlling the phenotypic characteristics of cells. Numerous methods exist for profiling mRNA transcript levels and identifying protein-DNA binding interactions at the genome-wide scale. These enable researchers to determine the structure and output of transcriptional regulatory networks, but uncovering the complete structure and regulatory logic of GRNs remains a challenge. The field of GRN inference aims to meet this challenge using computational modeling to derive the structure and logic of GRNs from experimental data and to encode this knowledge in Boolean networks, Bayesian networks, ordinary differential equation (ODE) models, or other modeling frameworks. However, most existing models do not incorporate dynamic transcriptional data since it has historically been less widely available in comparison to ""static"" transcriptional data. We report the development of an evolutionary algorithm-based ODE modeling approach (named EA) that integrates kinetic transcription data and the theory of attractor matching to infer GRN architecture and regulatory logic. Our method outperformed six leading GRN inference methods, none of which incorporate kinetic transcriptional data, in predicting regulatory connections among TFs when applied to a small-scale engineered synthetic GRN in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Moreover, we demonstrate the potential of our method to predict unknown transcriptional profiles that would be produced upon genetic perturbation of the GRN governing a two-state cellular phenotypic switch in Candida albicans. We established an iterative refinement strategy to facilitate candidate selection for experimentation; the experimental results in turn provide validation or improvement for the model. In this way, our GRN inference approach can expedite the development of a sophisticated mathematical model that can accurately describe the structure and dynamics of the in vivo GRN.Copyright: © 2023 Li et al.

,37614425,NA,NA,"Asthma is a complex disease, often with evident genetic predisposition; for example, the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs7130588 was significantly associated with asthma by genome-wide association study (GWAS). Analysis of 1000 Genomes Project data suggests that there is another SNP, rs6592645, in complete linkage disequilibrium with rs7130588 and should present the same signal in GWAS. However, the causal SNP and the mechanism for the association between rs7130588 and asthma remain to be elucidated. In the presents study, results from dual-luciferase assays indicated that the A/G alleles of rs7130588 failed to present significantly different reporter gene expression. By contrast, A allele of rs6592645 presented a significant increase in relative luciferase activity than G allele, thus suggesting that rs6592645 may be a causal SNP. Using chromosome conformation capture, the enhancer region containing rs6592645 was observed to interact with promoter region of leucine-rich repeat-containing 32 (LRRC32). Gene expression quantification suggested thatLRRC32expression is significantly increased in lung tissue of patients with asthma and is dependent on the genotype of this locus, thus verifying thatLRRC32may be involved in asthma onset and that rs6592645 can regulateLRRC32expression. Through chromatin immunoprecipitation, transcription factor 3 (TCF3) was identified to bind to rs6592645 surrounding region and the interaction between TCF3 and rs6592645 surrounding region was investigated. Results from the present study may improve our understanding of the mechanism by which the genetic variation in this locus might influence asthma susceptibility.Copyright © 2020, Spandidos Publications."
,37669931,Cis P-tau is a central circulating and placental etiologic driver and therapeutic target of preeclampsia.,Nat Commun,"Preeclampsia (PE) is the leading cause of maternal and fetal mortality globally and may trigger dementia later in life in mothers and their offspring. However, the etiological drivers remain elusive. Cis P-tau is an early etiological driver and blood biomarker in pre-clinical Alzheimer's and after vascular or traumatic brain injury, which can be targeted by stereo-specific antibody, with clinical trials ongoing. Here we find significant cis P-tau in the placenta and serum of PE patients, and in primary human trophoblasts exposed to hypoxia or sera from PE patients due to Pin1 inactivation. Depletion of cis P-tau from PE patient sera by the antibody prevents their ability to disrupt trophoblast invasion and endovascular activity and to cause the PE-like pathological and clinical features in pregnant humanized tau mice. Our studies uncover that cis P-tau is a central circulating etiological driver and its stereo-specific antibody is valuable for early PE diagnosis and treatment.© 2023. Springer Nature Limited."
,37667186,NA,NA,"A relevant part of the genetic architecture of complex traits is still unknown; despite the discovery of many disease-associated common variants. Polygenic risk score (PRS) models are based on the evaluation of the additive effects attributable to common variants and have been successfully implemented to assess the genetic susceptibility for many phenotypes. In contrast, burden tests are often used to identify an enrichment of rare deleterious variants in specific genes. Both kinds of genetic contributions are typically analyzed independently. Many studies suggest that complex phenotypes are influenced by both low effect common variants and high effect rare deleterious variants. The aim of this paper is to integrate the effect of both common and rare functional variants for a more comprehensive genetic risk modeling.We developed a framework combining gene-based scores based on the enrichment of rare functionally relevant variants with genome-wide PRS based on common variants for association analysis and prediction models. We applied our framework on UK Biobank dataset with genotyping and exome data and considered 28 blood biomarkers levels as target phenotypes. For each biomarker, an association analysis was performed on full cohort using gene-based scores (GBS). The cohort was then split into 3 subsets for PRS construction and feature selection, predictive model training, and independent evaluation, respectively. Prediction models were generated including either PRS, GBS or both (combined).Association analyses of the cohort were able to detect significant genes that were previously known to be associated with different biomarkers. Interestingly, the analyses also revealed heterogeneous effect sizes and directionality highlighting the complexity of the blood biomarkers regulation. However, the combined models for many biomarkers show little or no improvement in prediction accuracy compared to the PRS models.This study shows that rare variants play an important role in the genetic architecture of complex multifactorial traits such as blood biomarkers. However, while rare deleterious variants play a strong role at an individual level, our results indicate that classical common variant based PRS might be more informative to predict the genetic susceptibility at the population level.© 2023.

,37644440,NA,NA,"Understanding the impact of gene interactions on disease phenotypes is increasingly recognised as a crucial aspect of genetic disease research. This trend is reflected by the growing amount of clinical research on oligogenic diseases, where disease manifestations are influenced by combinations of variants on a few specific genes. Although statistical machine-learning methods have been developed to identify relevant genetic variant or gene combinations associated with oligogenic diseases, they rely on abstract features and black-box models, posing challenges to interpretability for medical experts and impeding their ability to comprehend and validate predictions. In this work, we present a novel, interpretable predictive approach based on a knowledge graph that not only provides accurate predictions of disease-causing gene interactions but also offers explanations for these results.We introduce BOCK, a knowledge graph constructed to explore disease-causing genetic interactions, integrating curated information on oligogenic diseases from clinical cases with relevant biomedical networks and ontologies. Using this graph, we developed a novel predictive framework based on heterogenous paths connecting gene pairs. This method trains an interpretable decision set model that not only accurately predicts pathogenic gene interactions, but also unveils the patterns associated with these diseases. A unique aspect of our approach is its ability to offer, along with each positive prediction, explanations in the form of subgraphs, revealing the specific entities and relationships that led to each pathogenic prediction.Our method, built with interpretability in mind, leverages heterogenous path information in knowledge graphs to predict pathogenic gene interactions and generate meaningful explanations. This not only broadens our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying oligogenic diseases, but also presents a novel application of knowledge graphs in creating more transparent and insightful predictors for genetic research.© 2023.

Steady-state, standard expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) explain only a limited portion of GWAS signals2-6, while eQTLs involved in gene-by-environment (GxE) interactions have rarely been characterized in humans due to experimental challenges. Here, we characterized gene-by-diet effects in a baboon model system. By analyzing three tissue types obtained from 99 captive baboons, we identify hundreds of diet-responsive eQTLs with high tissue specificity. Diet-responsive eQTLs exhibit genomic localization and genic features that are distinct from steady-state eQTLs. Furthermore, the human orthologs of genes associated with diet-responsive eQTLs are enriched for GWAS genes associated with human metabolic traits, suggesting that context-responsive eQTLs with more complex regulatory effects are likely to explain GWAS hits that do not seem to overlap with standard eQTLs. Our results highlight the dynamic complexity of genetic regulatory effects and the potential of eQTLs with disease-relevant GxE interactions in enhancing the understanding of GWAS signals for human complex disease using the baboon model."
,37554308,Functional genomics in stem cell models: considerations and applications.,Front Cell Dev Biol,"Protocols to differentiate human pluripotent stem cells have advanced in terms of cell type specificity and tissue-level complexity over the past 2 decades, which has facilitated human disease modeling in the most relevant cell types. The ability to generate induced PSCs (iPSCs) from patients further enables the study of disease mutations in an appropriate cellular context to reveal the mechanisms that underlie disease etiology and progression. As iPSC-derived disease models have improved in robustness and scale, they have also been adopted more widely for use in drug screens to discover new therapies and therapeutic targets. Advancement in genome editing technologies, in particular the discovery of CRISPR-Cas9, has further allowed for rapid development of iPSCs containing disease-causing mutations. CRISPR-Cas9 technologies have now evolved beyond creating single gene edits, aided by the fusion of inhibitory (CRISPRi) or activation (CRISPRa) domains to a catalytically dead Cas9 protein, enabling inhibition or activation of endogenous gene loci. These tools have been used in CRISPR knockout, CRISPRi, or CRISPRa screens to identify genetic modifiers that synergize or antagonize with disease mutations in a systematic and unbiased manner, resulting in identification of disease mechanisms and discovery of new therapeutic targets to accelerate drug discovery research. However, many technical challenges remain when applying large-scale functional genomics approaches to differentiated PSC populations. Here we review current technologies in the field of iPSC disease modeling and CRISPR-based functional genomics screens and practical considerations for implementation across a range of modalities, applications, and disease areas, as well as explore CRISPR screens that have been performed in iPSC models to-date and the insights and therapies these screens have produced.Copyright © 2023 Shevade, Peddada, Mader and Przybyla."
,37478860,Platform-agnostic CellNet enables cross-study analysis of cell fate engineering protocols.,Stem Cell Reports,"Optimization of cell engineering protocols requires standard, comprehensive quality metrics. We previously developed CellNet, a computational tool to quantitatively assess the transcriptional fidelity of engineered cells compared with their natural counterparts, based on bulk-derived expression profiles. However, this platform and others were limited in their ability to compare data from different sources, and no current tool makes it easy to compare new protocols with existing state-of-the-art protocols in a standardized manner. Here, we utilized our prior application of the top-scoring pair transformation to build a computational platform, platform-agnostic CellNet (PACNet), to address both shortcomings. To demonstrate the utility of PACNet, we applied it to thousands of samples from over 100 studies that describe dozens of protocols designed to produce seven distinct cell types. We performed an in-depth examination of hepatocyte and cardiomyocyte protocols to identify the best-performing methods, characterize the extent of intra-protocol and inter-lab variation, and identify common off-target signatures, including a surprising neural/neuroendocrine signature in primary liver-derived organoids. We have made PACNet available as an easy-to-use web application, allowing users to assess their protocols relative to our database of reference engineered samples, and as open-source, extensible code.Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).

The two main types of lung cancer are non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC). More than 85% of lung cancers are NSCLC. Genetic factors play a significant role in the risk of NSCLC. Growing studies focus on studying risk factors at the molecular level. The aim of the study is to build a pipeline to integrate Genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) and transcriptomics data with machine learning to effectively identify genetic risk factors of NSCLC. GWAS datasets and GWAS summary data were downloaded from GWAS catalog, which include lung carcinoma genetic variants among the European population. Then, with the GWAS summary, data functional analysis of significant SNPs was performed using a webserver called FUMAGWAS. The transcriptomics data of NSCLC and non-NSCLC people were used to build a machine learning model to identify the key genes that help predict the NSCLC. The top up-regulation and down-regulation genes were identified by the BART cancer webserver, and the mechanistic roles of the genes were validated by literature review. By performing integrative analysis of GWAS and transcriptomics analysis using machine learning, we identified multiple SNPs and genes that related to NSCLC. The computational pipeline may facilitate the biomarker discovery for NSCLC and other diseases.© 2023.

Existing single-cell bisulfite sequencing methods cannot resolve 5mC and 5hmC, leaving the cell-type-specific regulatory mechanisms of TET and 5hmC largely unknown. Here, we present joint single-nucleus (hydroxy)methylcytosine sequencing (Joint-snhmC-seq), a scalable and quantitative approach that simultaneously profiles 5hmC and true 5mC in single cells by harnessing differential deaminase activity of APOBEC3A toward 5mC and chemically protected 5hmC. Joint-snhmC-seq profiling of single nuclei from mouse brains reveals an unprecedented level of epigenetic heterogeneity of both 5hmC and true 5mC at single-cell resolution. We show that cell-type-specific profiles of 5hmC or true 5mC improve multimodal single-cell data integration, enable accurate identification of neuronal subtypes and uncover context-specific regulatory effects on cell-type-specific genes by TET enzymes.© 2023.

However, given the heterogeneity in single-cell chromatin architecture and transcription, the regulatory relationship between the three-dimensional chromatin structure and gene expression is difficult to explain based on bulk cell populations. Here we develop a single-cell, multimodal, omics method allowing the simultaneous detection of chromatin architecture and messenger RNA expression by sequencing (single-cell transcriptome sequencing (scCARE-seq)). Applying scCARE-seq to examine chromatin architecture and transcription from 2i to serum single mouse embryonic stem cells, we observe improved separation of cell clusters compared with single-cell chromatin conformation capture. In addition, after defining the cell-cycle phase of each cell through chromatin architecture extracted by scCARE-seq, we find that periodic changes in chromatin architecture occur in parallel with transcription during the cell cycle. These findings highlight the potential of scCARE-seq to facilitate comprehensive analyses that may boost our understanding of chromatin architecture and transcription in the same single cell.© 2023.

Therefore, the study of epigenetic changes is very important to understand the regulatory mechanism of genes at the molecular, cellular, tissue and organ levels. DNA methylation is one of the most studied epigenetic modifications, which plays an important role in maintaining genome stability and ensuring normal growth and development. Studies have shown that methylation levels in bovine primordial germ cells, the rearrangement of methylation during embryonic development and abnormal methylation during placental development are all closely related to their reproductive processes. In addition, the application of bovine male sterility and assisted reproductive technology is also related to DNA methylation. This review introduces the principle, development of detection methods and application conditions of DNA methylation, with emphasis on the relationship between DNA methylation dynamics and bovine spermatogenesis, embryonic development, disease resistance and muscle and fat development, in order to provide theoretical basis for the application of DNA methylation in cattle breeding in the future."

In contrast to evidence-based medicine, precision medicine will allow doctors and scientists to tailor the treatment of different subpopulations of patients who differ in their susceptibility to specific diseases or responsiveness to specific therapies. The current precision medicine model was proposed to precisely classify patients into subgroups sharing a common biological basis of diseases for more effective tailored treatment to achieve improved outcomes. Precision medicine has become a term that symbolizes the new age of medicine. In this review, we examine the history, development, and future perspective of precision medicine. We also discuss the concepts, principles, tools, and applications of precision medicine and related fields. In our view, for precision medicine to work, two essential objectives need to be achieved. First, diseases need to be classified into various subtypes. Second, targeted therapies must be available for each specific disease subtype. Therefore, we focused this review on the progress in meeting these two objectives."

The functional significance of these 3D genome features, however, remains largely elusive due to limited single-cell technologies that can concurrently profile genome organization and transcriptional activities. Here, we report GAGE-seq, a highly scalable, robust single-cell co-assay that simultaneously measures 3D genome structure and transcriptome within the same cell. Employing GAGE-seq on mouse brain cortex and human bone marrow CD34+ cells, we comprehensively characterized the intricate relationships between 3D genome and gene expression. We found that these multiscale 3D genome features collectively inform cell type-specific gene expressions, hence contributing to defining cell identity at the single-cell level. Integration of GAGE-seq data with spatial transcriptomic data revealedin situvariations of the 3D genome in mouse cortex. Moreover, our observations of lineage commitment in normal human hematopoiesis unveiled notable discordant changes between 3D genome organization and gene expression, underscoring a complex, temporal interplay at the single-cell level that is more nuanced than previously appreciated.

Conventional sperm separation approaches include the swim-up method and density gradient centrifugation. However, the quality of isolated sperm obtained from both approaches can still be improved by improving sorted sperm motility, minimizing the DNA fragmentation rate, and removing abnormal phenotypes. Here, we report a Progressive Sperm Sorting Chip (PSSC) for high-quality sperm isolation. Based on the rheotaxis behavior of sperm, a gradient flow field is created in the chip for progressive sperm sorting. Clinical experiment results for 10 volunteers showed that greater than 90% of isolated sperm exhibit high motility (> 25 μm/s), high linearity (0.8), and a very low DNA fragmentation rate (< 5%). In addition, the whole process is label and chemical free. These features aid in gentle sperm sorting to obtain healthy sperm.

This study identifies potential biomarkers of KTCN based on the characterization of autophagy-related genes (ARGs) and the construction of a diagnostic model; and explores their relevance to immune infiltrating cells in KTCN.Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) data were downloaded and ARGs were acquired from GeneCards and Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB). Autophagy-related differential expression genes (ARDEGs) were discovered through the integration of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with ARGs, while hub genes of KTCN were discovered by protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis. The probable biological roles of these hub ARDEGs were examined using functional enrichment analysis, and a KTCN diagnostic model was generated using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analysis. We also employed the CIBERSORTx and ssGSEA algorithms to identify potential regulatory pathways to compare the abundance of immune cell infiltrates and their association with hub genes. Finally, the hub gene expression levels were confirmed using validation datasets as well as blood samples from KTCN and healthy individuals.In this study, we identified 12 hub ARDEGs, of which 9 genes were substantially distinct between KTCN patients and normal groups. The LASSO risk score was used to generate the nomogram, and the calibration curve evaluated the model's effective diagnostic performance (C index of 0.961). Patients with KTCN had greater percentages of M2 Macrophages and Gamma delta T cells, according to CIBERSORTx and ssGSEA.

For this reason, this investigation sought to identify the key genes relevant to cancer stemness and M2 macrophages, explore the relationship between these genes and clinical characteristics, and determine the potential mechanism.LUAD transcriptomic data was analyzed from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) as well as the Gene Expression Omnibus databases. Differential expression analysis was performed to discern abnormally expressed genes between LUAD and control samples in TCGA cohort. The Cell type Identification by Estimating Relative Subsets of RNA Transcripts (CIBERSORT) algorithm was applied to determine varyingly infiltrated immune cells in LUAD compared with the control samples in TCGA cohort. Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) was performed to identify genes associated with mRNA expression-based stemness index (mRNAsi) and M2 macrophages. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), RandomForest (RF) and support vector machine-recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) machine learning methods were conducted to detect gene signatures. Global survival evaluation (Kaplan-Meier curve) was applied to investigate the relationship between gene signatures and the survival time of LUAD patients. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were produced to define biomarkers relevant to diagnosis. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was performed to probe the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways related to diagnostic biomarkers. The public single-cell dataset of LUAD (GSE123902) was used to investigate the expression differences of diagnostic biomarkers in various cell types in LUAD. Real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed to confirm key genes in lung adenocarcinoma cells.A total of 5,410 differentialy expressed genes (DEGs) as well as 15 differentially infiltrated immune cells were identified between LUAD and control sepcimens in TCGA cohort. Thirty-seven DEGs were associated with both M2 macrophages and mRNAsi according to the WGCNA analysis. Sixteen common gene signatures were obtained using three diverse algorithms. CBFA2T3, DENND3 and FCAMR were correlated to overall and disease-free survival of LUAD patients. ROC curves revealed that CBFA2T3 and DENND3 expression accurately classified LUAD and control samples. The results of single cell related analysis showed that two diagnostic biomarkers expressions were differed between the different tissue sources in M2-like macrophages. QRT-PCR demonstrated the mRNA expressions of CBFA2T3 and DENND3 were upregulated in lung adenocarcinoma cells A549 and H2122.Our study identified CBFA2T3 and DENND3 as key genes associated with mRNAsi and M2 macrophages in LUAD and investigated the potential molecular mechanisms underlying this relationship.© 2023 Published by Elsevier Ltd."

Hypoxia- and lactate metabolism-related genes (HLMRGs) are fundamentally dysregulated in sepsis and have great predictive potential. Therefore, we attempted to build an HLMRG signature to predict the prognosis of patients with sepsis.Three publicly available transcriptomic profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with sepsis (GSE65682, E-MTAB-4421 and E-MTAB-4451, total n = 850) were included in this study. An HLMRG signature was created by employing Cox regression and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator estimation. The CIBERSORT method was used to analyze the abundances of 22 immune cell subtypes based on transcriptomic data. Metascape was used to investigate pathways related to the HLMRG signature.We developed a prognostic signature based on five HLMRGs (ERO1L, SIAH2, TGFA, TGFBI, and THBS1). This classifier successfully discriminated patients with disparate 28-day mortality in the discovery cohort (GSE65682, n = 479), and consistent results were observed in the validation cohort (E-MTAB-4421 plus E-MTAB-4451, n = 371). Estimation of immune infiltration revealed significant associations between the risk score and a subset of immune cells. Enrichment analysis revealed that pathways related to antimicrobial immune responses, leukocyte activation, and cell adhesion and migration were significantly associated with the HLMRG signature.Identification of a prognostic signature suggests the critical role of hypoxia and lactate metabolism in the pathophysiology of sepsis. The HLMRG signature can be used as an efficient tool for the risk stratification of patients with sepsis.© 2023. BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature."

In this regard, the discovery of novel early biomarkers holds substantial promise for ameliorating HCC-associated mortality. Efferocytosis, a vital immunological process, assumes a central position in the elimination of apoptotic cells. However, comprehensive investigations exploring the role of efferocytosis-related genes (EFRGs) in HCC are sparse, and their regulatory influence on HCC immunotherapy and targeted drug interventions remain poorly understood.RNA sequencing data and clinical characteristics of HCC patients were acquired from the TCGA database. To identify prognostically significant genes in HCC, we performed the limma package and conducted univariate Cox regression analysis. Subsequently, machine learning algorithms were employed to identify hub genes. To assess the immunological landscape of different HCC subtypes, we employed the CIBERSORT algorithm. Furthermore, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was utilized to investigate the expression levels of ERFGs in immune cells and to explore intercellular communication within HCC tissues. The migratory capacity of HCC cells was evaluated using CCK-8 assays, while drug sensitivity prediction reliability was determined through wound-healing assays.We have successfully identified a set of nine genes, termed EFRGs, that hold significant potential for the establishment of a hepatocellular carcinoma-specific prognostic model. Furthermore, leveraging the individual risk scores derived from this model, we were able to stratify patients into two distinct risk groups, unveiling notable disparities in terms of immune infiltration patterns and response to immunotherapy. Notably, the model's capacity to accurately predict drug responses was substantiated through comprehensive experimental investigations, encompassing wound-healing assay, and CCK8 experiments conducted on the HepG2 and Huh7 cell lines.We constructed an EFRGs model that serves as valuable tools for prognostic assessment and decision-making support in the context of immunotherapy and chemotherapy.Copyright © 2023 Liu, Li, Zhang, Hu and Li."

Ferritinophagy is a type of autophagy and a key factor in ferroptosis that could influence tumor onset and progression. Although, the potential role of ferritinophagy-related genes (FRGs) in liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) is unknown.Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data of LIHC were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) dataset. In addition, transcriptome and clinical follow-up outcome data of individuals with LIHC were extracted from the The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset. FRGs were collected through the GeneCards database. Differential cell subpopulations were distinguished, and differentially expressed FRGs (DEFRGs) were obtained. Differential expression of FRGs and prognosis were observed according to the TCGA database. An FRG-related risk model was constructed to predict patient prognosis by absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and COX regression analyses, and its prognosis predictive power was validated. Ultimately, the association between risk score and tumor microenvironment (TME), immune cell infiltration, immune checkpoints, drug sensitivity, and tumor mutation burden (TMB) was analyzed. We also used quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to validate the expression of key genes in normal liver cells and liver cancer cells.We ultimately identified 8 cell types, and 7 differentially expressed FRGs genes (ZFP36, NCOA4, FTH1, FTL, TNF, PCBP1, CYB561A3) were found among immune cells, and we found that Monocytes and Macrophages were closely related to FRGs genes. Subsequently, COX regression analysis showed that patients with high expression of FTH1, FTL, and PCBP1 had significantly worse prognosis than those with low expression, and our survival prediction model, constructed based on age, stage, and risk score, showed better prognostic prediction ability. Our risk model based on 3 FRGs genes ultimately revealed significant differences between high-risk and low-risk groups in terms of immune infiltration and immune checkpoint correlation, drug sensitivity, and somatic mutation risk. Finally, we validated the key prognostic genes FTH1, FTL, using qRT-PCR, and found that the expression of FTH1 and FTL was significantly higher in various liver cancer cells than in normal liver cells. At the same time, immunohistochemistry showed that the expression of FTH1, FTL in tumor tissues was significantly higher than that in para-tumor tissues.This study identifies a considerable impact of FRGs on immunity and prognosis in individuals with LIHC. The collective findings of this research provide new ideas for personalized treatment of LIHC and a more targeted therapy approach for individuals with LIHC to improve their prognosis.© 2023.

We present Guided Topic Model for deconvolution (GTM-decon) to automatically infer cell-type-specific gene topic distributions from single-cell RNA-seq data for deconvolving bulk transcriptomes. GTM-decon performs competitively on deconvolving simulated and real bulk data compared with the state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, as demonstrated in deconvolving disease transcriptomes, GTM-decon can infer multiple cell-type-specific gene topic distributions per cell type, which captures sub-cell-type variations. GTM-decon can also use phenotype labels from single-cell or bulk data to infer phenotype-specific gene distributions. In a nested-guided design, GTM-decon identified cell-type-specific differentially expressed genes from bulk breast cancer transcriptomes.© 2023. BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature."

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying PARP inhibitors function beyond DNA damage repair pathways remain elusive, and identifying novel predictive targets that favorably respond to PARP inhibitors in PCa is an active area of research.The expression of GSDME in PCa cell lines and human PCa samples was determined by western blotting. Targeted bisulfite sequencing, gene enrichment analysis (GSEA), clone formation, construction of the stably transfected cell lines, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay, western blotting as well as a mouse model of subcutaneous xenografts were used to investigate the role of GSDME in PCa. The combinational therapeutic effect of olaparib and decitabine was determined using both in vitro and in vivo experiments.We have found low expression of GSDME in PCa. Interestingly, we demonstrated that GSDME activity is robustly induced in olaparib-treated cells undergoing pyroptosis, and that high methylation of the GSDME promoter dampens its activity in PCa cells. Intriguingly, genetically overexpressing GSDME does not inhibit tumor cell proliferation but instead confers sensitivity to olaparib. Furthermore, pharmacological treatment with the combination of olaparib and decitabine synergistically induces GSDME expression and cleavage through caspase-3 activation, thus promoting pyroptosis and enhancing anti-tumor response, ultimately resulting in tumor remission.Our findings highlight a novel therapeutic strategy for enhancing the long-term response to olaparib beyond HRR-deficient tumors in PCa, underscoring the critical role of GSDME in regulating tumorigenesis.© 2023.

,37645746,Genetic evidence for serum amyloid P component as a drug target for treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.,medRxiv,"The direct causes of neurodegeneration underlying Alzheimer's disease (AD) and many other dementias, are not known. Here we identify serum amyloid P component (SAP), a constitutive plasma protein normally excluded from the brain, as a potential drug target. After meta-analysis of three genome-wide association studies, comprising 44,288 participants,cis-Mendelian randomization showed that genes responsible for higher plasma SAP values are significantly associated with AD, Lewy body dementia and plasma tau concentration. These genetic findings are consistent with experimental evidence of SAP neurotoxicity and the strong, independent association of neocortex SAP content with dementia at death. Depletion of SAP from the blood and from the brain, as is provided by the safe, well tolerated, experimental drug, miridesap, may therefore contribute to treatment of neurodegeneration."

There is perhaps no greater example of disease pathogenesis resulting from the dysregulation of BDNF signaling than Huntington's disease (HD)-an inherited neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor, psychiatric, and cognitive impairments associated with basal ganglia dysfunction and the ultimate death of striatal projection neurons. Investigation of the collection of mechanisms leading to BDNF loss in HD highlights this neurotrophin's importance to neuronal viability and calls attention to opportunities for therapeutic interventions. Using electronic database searches of existing and forthcoming research, we constructed a literature review with the overarching goal of exploring the diverse set of molecular events that trigger BDNF dysregulation within HD. We highlighted research that investigated these major mechanisms in preclinical models of HD and connected these studies to those evaluating similar endpoints in human HD subjects. We also included a special focus on the growing body of literature detailing key transcriptomic and epigenetic alterations that affect BDNF abundance in HD. Finally, we offer critical evaluation of proposed neurotrophin-directed therapies and assessed clinical trials seeking to correct BDNF expression in HD individuals."

Questionnaires and interviews were used to collect information on general characteristics of the children, socio-economic characteristics of the family, maternal pregnancy history, and maternal disease exposure during pregnancy. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to investigate the association between maternal GDM exposure and the development of ASD in offspring. The potential interaction between offspring gender and maternal GDM exposure on the development of ASD in offspring was explored.The proportion of maternal GDM was significantly higher in the ASD group compared to the control group (16.3% vs 9.4%,P=0.014). After adjusting for variables such as gender, gestational age, mode of delivery, parity, and maternal education level, maternal GDM exposure was a risk factor for ASD in offspring (OR=2.18, 95%CI: 1.04-4.54,P=0.038). On the basis of adjusting the above variables, after further adjusting the variables including prenatal intake of multivitamins, folic acid intake in the first three months of pregnancy, and assisted reproduction the result trend did not change, but no statistical significance was observed (OR=1.94, 95%CI: 0.74-5.11,P=0.183). There was an interaction between maternal GDM exposure and offspring gender on the development of ASD in offspring (P<0.001). Gender stratified analysis showed that only in male offspring of mothers with GDM, the risk of ASD was significantly increased (OR=3.67, 95%CI: 1.16-11.65,P=0.027).Maternal GDM exposure might increase the risk of ASD in offspring.

,37577575,MousiPLIER: A Mouse Pathway-Level Information Extractor Model.,bioRxiv,"High throughput gene expression profiling is a powerful approach to generate hypotheses on the underlying causes of biological function and disease. Yet this approach is limited by its ability to infer underlying biological pathways and burden of testing tens of thousands of individual genes. Machine learning models that incorporate prior biological knowledge are necessary to extract meaningful pathways and generate rational hypothesis from the vast amount of gene expression data generated to date. We adopted an unsupervised machine learning method, Pathway-level information extractor (PLIER), to train the first mouse PLIER model on 190,111 mouse brain RNA-sequencing samples, the greatest amount of training data ever used by PLIER. mousiPLER converted gene expression data into a latent variables that align to known pathway or cell maker gene sets, substantially reducing data dimensionality and improving interpretability. To determine the utility of mousiPLIER, we applied it to a mouse brain aging study of microglia and astrocyte transcriptomic profiling. We found a specific set of latent variables that are significantly associated with aging, including one latent variable (LV41) corresponding to striatal signal. We next performed k-means clustering on the training data to identify studies that respond strongly to LV41, finding that the variable is relevant to striatum and aging across the scientific literature. Finally, we built a web server ( http://mousiplier.greenelab.com/ ) for users to easily explore the learned latent variables. Taken together this study provides proof of concept that mousiPLIER can uncover meaningful biological processes in mouse transcriptomic studies.Analysis of RNA-sequencing data commonly generates differential expression of individual genes across conditions. However, genes are regulated in complex networks, not as individual entities. Machine learning models that incorporate prior biological information are a powerful tool to analyze human gene expression. However, such models are lacking for mouse despite the vast number of mouse RNA-seq datasets. We trained a mouse pathway-level information extractor model (mousiPLIER). The model reduced the data dimensionality from over 10,000 genes to 196 latent variables that map to prior pathway and cell marker gene sets. We demonstrated the utility of mousiPLIER by applying it to mouse brain aging data and developed a web server to facilitate the use of the model by the scientific community."
,37606762,Radiomics-guided prognostic assessment of early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence post-radical resection.,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,"The prognosis of early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients after radical resection has received widespread attention, but reliable prediction methods are lacking. Radiomics derived from enhanced computed tomography (CT) imaging offers a potential avenue for practical prognostication in HCC patients.We recruited early-stage HCC patients undergoing radical resection. Statistical analyses were performed to identify clinicopathological and radiomic features linked to recurrence. Clinical, radiomic, and combined models (incorporating clinicopathological and radiomic features) were built using four algorithms. The performance of these models was scrutinized via fivefold cross-validation, with evaluation metrics including the area under the curve (AUC), accuracy (ACC), sensitivity (SEN), and specificity (SPE) being calculated and compared. Ultimately, an integrated nomogram was devised by combining independent clinicopathological predictors with the Radscore.From January 2016 through December 2020, HCC recurrence was observed in 167 cases (64.5%), with a median time to recurrence of 26.7 months following initial resection. Combined models outperformed those solely relying on clinicopathological or radiomic features. Notably, among the combined models, those employing support vector machine (SVM) algorithms exhibited the most promising predictive outcomes (AUC: 0.840 (95% Confidence interval (CI): [0.696, 0.984]), ACC: 0.805, SEN: 0.849, SPE: 0.733). Hepatitis B infection, tumour size > 5 cm, and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) > 400 ng/mL were identified as independent recurrence predictors and were subsequently amalgamated with the Radscore to create a visually intuitive nomogram, delivering robust and reliable predictive performance.Machine learning models amalgamating clinicopathological and radiomic features provide a valuable tool for clinicians to predict postoperative HCC recurrence, thereby informing early preventative strategies.© 2023.

,37526884,NA,NA,"α-Synucleinopathies are a group of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by alterations in α-synuclein (α-syn), a protein associated with membrane phospholipids, whose precise function in normal cells is still unknown. These kinds of diseases are caused by multiple factors, but the regulation of the α-syn gene is believed to play a central role in the pathology of these disorders; therefore, the α-syn gene is one of the most studied genes. α-Synucleinopathies are complex disorders that derive from the interaction between genetic and environmental factors. Here, we offer an update on the landscape of the epigenetic regulation of α-syn gene expression that has been linked with α-synucleinopathies. We also delve into the reciprocal influence between epigenetic modifications and other factors related to these disorders, such as posttranslational modifications, microbiota participation, interactions with lipids, neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, to promote α-syn aggregation by acting on the transcription and/or translation of the α-syn gene.© 2023.

However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, through an unbiased survey, we show that the binding motif of Bmal1, a central transcription factor of the circadian clock, is enriched in differentially hydroxymethylated regions (DhMRs) of mouse DRG after peripheral lesion. By applying conditional deletion of Bmal1 in neurons, in vitro and in vivo neurite outgrowth assays, as well as transcriptomic profiling, we demonstrate that Bmal1 inhibits axon regeneration, in part through a functional link with the epigenetic factor Tet3. Mechanistically, we reveal that Bmal1 acts as a gatekeeper of neuroepigenetic responses to axonal injury by limiting Tet3 expression and restricting 5hmC modifications. Bmal1-regulated genes not only concern axon growth, but also stress responses and energy homeostasis. Furthermore, we uncover an epigenetic rhythm of diurnal oscillation of Tet3 and 5hmC levels in DRG neurons, corresponding to time-of-day effect on axon growth potential. Collectively, our studies demonstrate that targeting Bmal1 enhances axon regeneration.© 2023. Springer Nature Limited."

Although well-annotated coding and non-coding transcripts in blood are readily detectable and can serve as biomarkers of disease, the overall diagnostic utility of the cell-free transcriptome remains unclear. Here we show that RNAs derived from transposable elements and other repeat elements are enriched in the cell-free transcriptome of patients with cancer, and that they serve as signatures for the accurate classification of the disease. We used repeat-element-aware liquid-biopsy technology and single-molecule nanopore sequencing to profile the cell-free transcriptome in plasma from patients with cancer and to examine millions of genomic features comprising all annotated genes and repeat elements throughout the genome. By aggregating individual repeat elements to the subfamily level, we found that samples with pancreatic cancer are enriched with specific Alu subfamilies, whereas other cancers have their own characteristic cell-free RNA profile. Our findings show that repetitive RNA sequences are abundant in blood and can be used as disease-specific diagnostic biomarkers.© 2023. The Author(s)."
,37463106,SMYD3 represses tumor-intrinsic interferon response in HPV-negative squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.,Cell Rep,"Cancers often display immune escape, but the mechanisms are incompletely understood. Herein, we identify SMYD3 as a mediator of immune escape in human papilloma virus (HPV)-negative head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), an aggressive disease with poor response to immunotherapy with pembrolizumab. SMYD3 depletion induces upregulation of multiple type I interferon (IFN) response and antigen presentation machinery genes in HNSCC cells. Mechanistically, SMYD3 binds to and regulates the transcription of UHRF1, encoding for a reader of H3K9me3, which binds to H3K9me3-enriched promoters of key immune-related genes, recruits DNMT1, and silences their expression. SMYD3 further maintains the repression of immune-related genes through intragenic deposition of H4K20me3. In vivo, Smyd3 depletion induces influx of CD8+T cells and increases sensitivity to anti-programmed death 1 (PD-1) therapy. SMYD3 overexpression is associated with decreased CD8 T cell infiltration and poor response to neoadjuvant pembrolizumab. These data support combining SMYD3 depletion strategies with checkpoint blockade to overcome anti-PD-1 resistance in HPV-negative HNSCC.Published by Elsevier Inc."

The past two decades have witnessed tremendous attention in long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), which are a new hope for the development of targeted drug therapy for metastatic cancers; however, the underlying mechanism of lncRNAs involved in BLCa hematogenous metastasis remains to be elucidated. Here, we identified BLCa-associated transcript 3 (BLACAT3), a lncRNA, which was aberrantly upregulated in BLCa and corelated with poor prognosis of patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer. Methodologically, m6A epitranscriptomic microarray, RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry (MS) were used to screen the key molecules of the regulatory axis. Functional assays, animal models and clinical samples were used to explore the roles of BLACAT3 in BLCa in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, m6A modification contributes to BLACAT3 upregulation by stabilizing RNA structure. BLACAT3 recruits YBX3 to shuttle into the nucleus, synergistically enhances NCF2 transcription, and promotes BLCa angiogenesis and hematogenous metastasis by activating downstream NF-κB signaling. Our findings will develop prognosis prediction tools for BLCa patients and discover novel therapeutic biological targets for metastatic BLCa.© 2023. The Author(s)."
,37571393,Underlying Mechanisms of Brain Aging and Neurodegenerative Diseases as Potential Targets for Preventive or Therapeutic Strategies Using Phytochemicals.,Nutrients,"During aging, several tissues and biological systems undergo a progressive decline in function, leading to age-associated diseases such as neurodegenerative, inflammatory, metabolic, and cardiovascular diseases and cancer. In this review, we focus on the molecular underpinning of senescence and neurodegeneration related to age-associated brain diseases, in particular, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, along with introducing nutrients or phytochemicals that modulate age-associated molecular dysfunctions, potentially offering preventive or therapeutic benefits. Based on current knowledge, the dysregulation of microglia genes and neuroinflammation, telomere attrition, neuronal stem cell degradation, vascular system dysfunction, reactive oxygen species, loss of chromosome X inactivation in females, and gut microbiome dysbiosis have been seen to play pivotal roles in neurodegeneration in an interactive manner. There are several phytochemicals (e.g., curcumin, EGCG, fucoidan, galangin, astin C, apigenin, resveratrol, phytic acid, acacetin, daucosterol, silibinin, sulforaphane, withaferin A, and betulinic acid) that modulate the dysfunction of one or several key genes (e.g., TREM2, C3, C3aR1, TNFA, NF-kb, TGFB1&2, SIRT1&6, HMGB1, and STING) affected in the aged brain. Although phytochemicals have shown promise in slowing down the progression of age-related brain diseases, more studies to identify their efficacy, alone or in combinations, in preclinical systems can help to design novel nutritional strategies for the management of neurodegenerative diseases in humans."
,37622096,Calibrating epigenetic clocks with training data error.,Evol Appl,"Animal age data are valuable for management of wildlife populations. Yet, for most species, there is no practical method for determining the age of unknown individuals. However, epigenetic clocks, a molecular-based method, are capable of age prediction by sampling specific tissue types and measuring DNA methylation levels at specific loci. Developing an epigenetic clock requires a large number of samples from animals of known ages. For most species, there are no individuals whose exact ages are known, making epigenetic clock calibration inaccurate or impossible. For many epigenetic clocks, calibration samples with inaccurate age estimates introduce a degree of error to epigenetic clock calibration. In this study, we investigated how much error in the training data set of an epigenetic clock can be tolerated before it resulted in an unacceptable increase in error for age prediction. Using four publicly available data sets, we artificially increased the training data age error by iterations of 1% and then tested the model against an independent set of known ages. A small effect size increase (Cohen's d >0.2) was detected when the error in age was higher than 22%. The effect size increased linearly with age error. This threshold was independent of sample size. Downstream applications for age data may have a more important role in deciding how much error can be tolerated for age prediction. If highly precise age estimates are required, then it may be futile to embark on the development of an epigenetic clock when there is no accurately aged calibration population to work with. However, for other problems, such as determining the relative age order of pairs of individuals, a lower-quality calibration data set may be adequate.© 2023 The Authors.

,37614226,CRISPR interference to evaluate modifiers of C9ORF72-mediated toxicity in FTD.,Front Cell Dev Biol,"Treatments for neurodegenerative disease, including Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), remain rather limited, underscoring the need for greater mechanistic insight and disease-relevant models. Our ability to develop novel disease models of genetic risk factors, disease modifiers, and other FTD/ALS-relevant targets is impeded by the significant amount of time and capital required to develop conventional knockout and transgenic mice. To overcome these limitations, we have generated a novel CRISPRi interference (CRISPRi) knockin mouse. CRISPRi uses a catalytically dead form of Cas9, fused to a transcriptional repressor to knockdown protein expression, following the introduction of single guide RNA against the gene of interest. To validate the utility of this model we have selected the TAR DNA binding protein (TDP-43) splicing target, stathmin-2 (STMN2).STMN2RNA is downregulated in FTD/ALS due to loss of TDP-43 activity and STMN2 loss is suggested to play a role in ALS pathogenesis. The involvement of STMN2 loss of function in FTD has yet to be determined. We find that STMN2 protein levels in familial FTD cases are significantly reduced compared to controls, supporting that STMN2 depletion may be involved in the pathogenesis of FTD. Here, we provide proof-of-concept that we can simultaneously knock down Stmn2 and express the expanded repeat in the Chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9ORF72) gene, successfully replicating features of C9-associated pathology. Of interest, depletion of Stmn2 had no effect on expression or deposition of dipeptide repeat proteins (DPRs), but significantly decreased the number of phosphorylated Tdp-43 (pTdp-43) inclusions. We submit that our novel CRISPRi mouse provides a versatile and rapid method to silence gene expressionin vivoand propose this model will be useful to understand gene function in isolation or in the context of other neurodegenerative disease models.Copyright © 2023 Pickles, Zanetti Alepuz, Koike, Yue, Tong, Liu, Zhou, Jansen-West, Daughrity, Song, DeTure, Oskarsson, Graff-Radford, Boeve, Petersen, Josephs, Dickson, Ward, Dong, Prudencio, Cook and Petrucelli."

This model recapitulates the phenomenon of hematopoietic mosaic loss of Y chromosome (mLOY), which is frequently observed in the blood of aged men. To construct mice with hematopoietic Y chromosome loss, lineage-negative cells are isolated from the bone marrow of ROSA26-Cas9 knock-in mice. These cells are transduced with a lentivirus vector encoding a guide RNA (gRNA) that targets multiple repeats of the Y chromosome centromere, effectively removing the Y chromosome. These cells are then transplanted into lethally irradiated wildtype C57BL6 mice. Control gRNAs are designed to target either no specific region or the fourth intron ofActingene. Transduced cells are tracked by measuring the fraction of blood cells expressing the virally encoded reporter gene tRFP. This model represents a clinically relevant model of hematopoietic mosaic loss of Y chromosome, which can be used to study the impact of mLOY on various age-related diseases.

We used binary logistic regression to analyze associations between LOY, determined by DNA microarray intensity data, and poor 3-month functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale score, >2) in each cohort separately and combined. Patients who received recanalization therapy were excluded from sensitivity analyses.LOY was associated with about 2.5-fold increased risk of poor outcome in univariable analyses (P<0.001). This association withstood separate adjustment for stroke severity and diabetes in both cohorts but not age. In sensitivity analyses restricted to the nonrecanalization group (n=987 in the combined cohort), the association was significant also after separate adjustment for age (odds ratio, 1.6 [95% CI, 1.1-2.4]) and when additionally adjusting for stroke severity and diabetes (odds ratio, 1.6 [95% CI, 1.1-2.5]).We observed an association between LOY and poor outcome after ischemic stroke in patients not receiving recanalization therapy.

,37576439,Investigating the Relationship Between Body Shape and Life History Traits in Toothed Whales: Can Body Shape Predict Fast-Slow Life Histories?,Evol Biol,"A widespread pattern in vertebrate life-history evolution is for species to evolve towards either fast or slow life histories; however, the underlying causes of this pattern remain unclear. Toothed whales (Odontoceti) are a diverse group with a range of body sizes and life histories, making them an ideal model to investigate potential drivers of this dichotomy. Using ancestral reconstruction, we identified that certain groups of odontocetes evolved more-streamlined, presumably faster, body shapes around the same time that killer whales (Orcinus orca) evolved into whale predators approximately 1 Mya during the Pleistocene. This suggests that the evolution of a streamlined body shape may have been an adaptation to escape killer whale predation, leading to longer life-history events. To test this hypothesis, we performed a cluster analysis of odontocete whales and confirmed the dual pattern of life-history traits, with one group referred to as 'reproducers' characterized by early age of maturity, short gestation, short interbirth interval, and short lifespan, and the other group referred to as 'bet-hedgers' exhibiting the opposite pattern. However, we found that life history grouping was relatively unrelated to whale shape (i.e., more streamlined or less streamlined). Therefore, we incorporated principal component results into mixed effects models, and the model results indicated that body shape was positively related to neonate length (a measure of investment in progeny), but not significantly related to the temporal life-history traits. Thus, whale body shape is not a sufficient explanation for the evolution of fast-slow life histories in odontocete whales.The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s11692-023-09605-4.© Crown 2023."

To date, most anti-MUC16 antibodies are directed towards the extracellular domain of MUC16 (CA125), which is usually cleaved and shed in the circulation hence obscuring antibody accessibility to the cancer cells. Herein, we establish the utility of targeting a post-cleavage generated, surface-tethered oncogenic MUC16 carboxy-terminal (MUC16-Cter) domain by using a novel chimeric antibody in human IgG1 format, ch5E6, whose epitope expression directly correlates with disease severity in both cancers. ch5E6 binds and interferes with MUC16-associated oncogenesis, suppresses the downstream signaling pFAK(Y397)/p-p70S6K(T389)/N-cadherin axis and exert antiproliferative effects in cancer cells, 3D organoids, and tumor xenografts of both PC and NSCLC. The robust clinical correlations observed between MUC16 and N-cadherin in patient tumors and metastatic samples imply ch5E6 potential in targeting a complex and significantly occurring phenomenon of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) associated with disease aggressiveness. Our study supports evaluating ch5E6 with standard-of-care drugs, to potentially augment treatment outcomes in malignancies inflicted with MUC16-associated poor prognosis.© 2023.

,37606673,Evaluation of Large-Scale Proteomics for Prediction of Cardiovascular Events.,JAMA,"Whether protein risk scores derived from a single plasma sample could be useful for risk assessment for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), in conjunction with clinical risk factors and polygenic risk scores, is uncertain.To develop protein risk scores for ASCVD risk prediction and compare them to clinical risk factors and polygenic risk scores in primary and secondary event populations.The primary analysis was a retrospective study of primary events among 13 540 individuals in Iceland (aged 40-75 years) with proteomics data and no history of major ASCVD events at recruitment (study duration, August 23, 2000 until October 26, 2006; follow-up through 2018). We also analyzed a secondary event population from a randomized, double-blind lipid-lowering clinical trial (2013-2016), consisting of individuals with stable ASCVD receiving statin therapy and for whom proteomic data were available for 6791 individuals.Protein risk scores (based on 4963 plasma protein levels and developed in a training set in the primary event population); polygenic risk scores for coronary artery disease and stroke; and clinical risk factors that included age, sex, statin use, hypertension treatment, type 2 diabetes, body mass index, and smoking status at the time of plasma sampling.Outcomes were composites of myocardial infarction, stroke, and coronary heart disease death or cardiovascular death. Performance was evaluated using Cox survival models and measures of discrimination and reclassification that accounted for the competing risk of non-ASCVD death.In the primary event population test set (4018 individuals [59.0% women]; 465 events; median follow-up, 15.8 years), the protein risk score had a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.93 per SD (95% CI, 1.75 to 2.13). Addition of protein risk score and polygenic risk scores significantly increased the C index when added to a clinical risk factor model (C index change, 0.022 [95% CI, 0.007 to 0.038]). Addition of the protein risk score alone to a clinical risk factor model also led to a significantly increased C index (difference, 0.014 [95% CI, 0.002 to 0.028]). Among White individuals in the secondary event population (6307 participants; 432 events; median follow-up, 2.2 years), the protein risk score had an HR of 1.62 per SD (95% CI, 1.48 to 1.79) and significantly increased C index when added to a clinical risk factor model (C index change, 0.026 [95% CI, 0.011 to 0.042]). The protein risk score was significantly associated with major adverse cardiovascular events among individuals of African and Asian ancestries in the secondary event population.A protein risk score was significantly associated with ASCVD events in primary and secondary event populations. When added to clinical risk factors, the protein risk score and polygenic risk score both provided statistically significant but modest improvement in discrimination."
,37626895,Loss of the Novel Myelin Protein CMTM5 in Multiple Sclerosis Lesions and Its Involvement in Oligodendroglial Stress Responses.,Cells,"This study comprehensively addresses the involvement of the protein CKLF-like Marvel transmembrane domain-containing family member 5 (CMTM5) in the context of demyelination and cytodegenerative autoimmune diseases, particularly multiple Sclerosis (MS). An observed reduction in CMTM5 expression in post-mortem MS lesions prompted further investigations in both in vitro and in vivo animal models. In the cuprizone animal model, we detected a decrease in CMTM5 expression in oligodendrocytes that is absent in other members of the CMTM protein family. Our findings also confirm these results in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model with decreased CMTM5 expression in both cerebellum and spinal cord white matter. We also examined the effects of aCmtm5knockdown in vitro in the oligodendroglial Oli-neu mouse cell line using the CRISPR interference technique. Interestingly, we found no effects on cell response to thapsigargin-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress as determined byAtf4activity, an indicator of cellular stress responses. Overall, these results substantiate previous findings suggesting that CMTM5, rather than contributing to myelin biogenesis, is involved in maintaining axonal integrity. Our study further demonstrates that the knockdown ofCmtm5in vitro does not modulate oligodendroglial responses to ER stress. These results warrant further investigation into the functional role of CMTM5 during axonal degeneration in the context of demyelinating conditions."
,37621717,Retinal astrocyte morphology predicts integration of vascular and neuronal architecture.,Front Neurosci,"Astrocytes are important regulators of blood flow and play a key role in the response to injury and disease in the central nervous system (CNS). Despite having an understanding that structural changes to these cells have consequences for local neurovascular physiology, individual astrocyte morphology remains largely unexplored in the retina. Here, we used MORF3 mice to capture full membranous morphology for over fifteen hundred individual astrocytes in the mouse retina, a highly metabolically active component of the CNS. We demonstrate that retinal astrocytes have been misrepresented as stellate in morphology due to marker use like GFAP and S100β which underestimates cell complexity. We also find that astrocytes contain recurring morphological motifs which are predictive of the underlying neurovascular architecture of the inner retina and suggestive of function. These motifs predict fine sampling and integration of retinal ganglion cell electrical activity with consequences for blood flow regulation. Additionally, our data shows that astrocytes participate in neurovascular interactions to a much greater degree than currently reported. 100% of cells contact the vasculature through one of three mutually exclusive classes of connections. Similarly, 100% of cells contact some neuronal element, be it an RGC axon or soma. Finally, we report that astrocyte morphology depends on retinal eccentricity, with cells appearing compressed near the nerve head and in the periphery. These results reveal a large degree of astrocyte morphological complexity that informs their contribution to neurovascular coupling in the retina.Copyright © 2023 Holden, Wareham and Calkins."
,37558878,NA,NA,"Dendritic cells (DCs) have a role in the development and activation of self-reactive pathogenic T cells1,2. Genetic variants that are associated with the function of DCs have been linked to autoimmune disorders3,4, and DCs are therefore attractive therapeutic targets for such diseases. However, developing DC-targeted therapies for autoimmunity requires identification of the mechanisms that regulate DC function. Here, using single-cell and bulk transcriptional and metabolic analyses in combination with cell-specific gene perturbation studies, we identify a regulatory loop of negative feedback that operates in DCs to limit immunopathology. Specifically, we find that lactate, produced by activated DCs and other immune cells, boosts the expression of NDUFA4L2 through a mechanism mediated by hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α). NDUFA4L2 limits the production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species that activate XBP1-driven transcriptional modules in DCs that are involved in the control of pathogenic autoimmune T cells. We also engineer a probiotic that produces lactate and suppresses T cell autoimmunity through the activation of HIF-1α-NDUFA4L2 signalling in DCs. In summary, we identify an immunometabolic pathway that regulates DC function, and develop a synthetic probiotic for its therapeutic activation.© 2023.

Using a tailored, sensitive, label-free mass spectrometry-based secretome approach, not previously applied to nonimmune cells, we identified 119 MMP-9 and 21 MMP-2 potential substrates at the cell surface of primary astrocytes, including known substrates (β-dystroglycan) and a broad spectrum of previously unknown MMP-dependent events involved in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. Using neuroinflammation as a model of assessing compromised astroglial barrier function, a selection of the potential MMP substrates were confirmed in vivo and verified in human samples, including vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 and neuronal cell adhesion molecule. We provide a unique resource of potential MMP-2/MMP-9 substrates specific for the astroglia barrier. Our data support a role for the gelatinases in the formation and maintenance of this barrier but also in astrocyte-neuron interactions."
,37630850,NA,NA,"Aging is characterized by alterations in the inflammatory microenvironment, which is tightly regulated by a complex network of inflammatory mediators. Excessive calorie consumption contributes to age- and lifestyle-associated diseases like obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disorders, and cancer, while limited nutrient availability may lead to systemic health-promoting adaptations. Geroprotective effects of short-term caloric restriction (CR) can beneficially regulate innate immune receptors and interferon signaling in the liver of aged mice, but how CR impacts the hepatic release of immunomodulatory mediators like cytokines and lipid mediators (LM) is elusive. Here, we investigated the impact of aging on the inflammatory microenvironment in the liver and its linkage to calorie consumption. The livers of female young and aged C57BL/6JRj mice, as well as of aged mice after caloric restriction (CR) up to 28 days, with and without subsequent re-feeding (2 days), were evaluated. Surprisingly, despite differences in the hepatic proteome of young and old mice, aging did not promote a pro-inflammatory environment in the liver, but it reduced lipoxygenase-mediated formation of LM from polyunsaturated fatty acids without affecting the expression of the involved lipoxygenases and related oxygenases. Moreover, CR failed to ameliorate the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines but shifted the LM production to the formation of monohydroxylated LM with inflammation-resolving features. Unexpectedly, re-feeding after CR even further decreased the inflammatory response as LM species were markedly downregulated. Our findings raise the question of how short-term CR is indeed beneficial as a nutritional intervention for healthy elderly subjects and further stress the necessity to address tissue-specific inflammatory states."
,37608128,Reconstructing the immunosenescence core pathway reveals global characteristics in pan-cancer.,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Immunosenescence has been demonstrated to play an important role in tumor progression. However, there is lacking comprehensive analyses of immunosenescence-related pathways. Meanwhile, the sex disparities of immunosenescence in cancer are still poorly understood. In this study, we analyzed the multi-omics data of 12,836 tumor samples, including genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, proteomics, and metabolomics. We systematically identified immunosenescence pathways that were disordered across cancer types. The mutations and copy number variations of immunosenescence pathways were found to be more active in pan-cancer. We reconstructed the immunosenescence core pathways (ISC-pathways) to improve the ability of prognostic stratification in 33 cancer types. We also found the head and neck squamous carcinoma (HNSC) contained abundant sex-specific immunosenescence features and showed sex differences in survival. We found that OSI-027 was a potential sex-specific drug in HNSC tumors, which tended to be more effective in male HNSC by targeting the MTOR gene in the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. In conclusion, our study provided a systematic understanding of immunosenescence pathways and revealed the global characteristics of immunosenescence in pan-cancer. We highlighted MTOR gene could be a powerful immunosenescence biomarker of HNSC that helps to develop sex-specific immunosenescence drugs.© 2023.

,37604983,The sex gap in bladder cancer survival - a missing link in bladder cancer care?,Nat Rev Urol,"The differences in bladder cancer outcomes between the sexes has again been highlighted. Uncommon among cancers, bladder cancer outcomes are notably worse for women than for men. Furthermore, bladder cancer is three to four times more common among men than among women. Factors that might explain these sex differences include understanding the importance of haematuria as a symptom of bladder cancer by both clinicians and patients, the resultant delays in diagnosis and referral of women with haematuria, and health-care access. Notably, these factors seem to have geographical variation and are not consistent across all health-care systems. Likewise, data relating to sex-specific treatment responses for patients with non-muscle-invasive or muscle-invasive bladder cancer are inconsistent. The influence of differences in the microbiome, bladder wall thickness and urine dwell times remain to be elucidated. The interplay of hormone signalling, gene expression, immunology and the tumour microenvironment remains complex but probably underpins the sexual dimorphism in disease incidence and stage and histology at presentation. The contribution of these biological phenomena to sex-specific outcome differences is probable, albeit potentially treatment-specific, and further understanding is required. Notwithstanding these aspects, we identify opportunities to harness biological differences to improve treatment outcomes, as well as areas of fundamental and translational research to pursue. At the level of policy and health-care delivery, improvements can be made across the domains of patient awareness, clinician education, referral pathways and guideline-based care. Together, we aim to highlight opportunities to close the sex gap in bladder cancer outcomes.© 2023. Springer Nature Limited."
,37666996,Inflammation across tissues: can shared cell biology help design smarter trials?,Nat Rev Rheumatol,"Immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) are responsible for substantial global disease burden and associated health-care costs. Traditional models of research and service delivery silo their management within organ-based medical disciplines. Very often patients with disease in one organ have comorbid involvement in another, suggesting shared pathogenic pathways. Moreover, different IMIDs are often treated with the same drugs (including glucocorticoids, immunoregulators and biologics). Unlocking the cellular basis of these diseases remains a major challenge, leading us to ask why, if these diseases have so much in common, they are not investigated in a common manner. A tissue-based, cellular understanding of inflammation might pave the way for cross-disease, cross-discipline basket trials (testing one drug across two or more diseases) to reduce the risk of failure of early-phase drug development in IMIDs. This new approach will enable rapid assessment of the efficacy of new therapeutic agents in cross-disease translational research in humans.© 2023. Springer Nature Limited."

Abnormal spermatogenesis can lead to azoospermia, testicular tumors, and other diseases related to male infertility. The application of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology in male reproduction is gradually increasing with its unique insight into deep mining and analysis. The data cover different periods of neonatal, prepubertal, pubertal, and adult stages. Different types of male infertility diseases including obstructive and non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA), Klinefelter Syndrome (KS), Sertoli Cell Only Syndrome (SCOS), and testicular tumors are also covered. We briefly review the principles and application of scRNA-seq and summarize the research results and application directions in spermatogenesis in different periods and pathological states. Moreover, we discuss the challenges of applying this technology in male reproduction and the prospects of combining it with other technologies.© 2023.

,37629071,CXCR4 Expressed by Tumor-Infiltrating B Cells in Gastric Cancer Related to Survival in the Tumor Microenvironment: An Analysis Combining Single-Cell RNA Sequencing with Bulk RNA Sequencing.,Int J Mol Sci,"According to the World Health Organization (WHO), gastric cancer (GC) is the fourth leading cause of tumor-related mortality globally and one of the most prevalent malignant tumors. To better understand the role of tumor-infiltrating B cells (TIBs) in GC, this work used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) and bulk RNA sequencing (bulk RNA-Seq) data to identify candidate hub genes. Both scRNA-Seq and bulk RNA-Seq data for stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) were obtained from the GEO and TCGA databases, respectively. Using scRNA-seq data, the FindNeighbors and FindClusters tools were used to group the cells into distinct groups. Immune cell clusters were sought in the massive RNA-seq expression matrix using the single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA). The expression profiles were used in Weighted Gene Coexpression Network Analysis (WGCNA) to build TCGA's gene coexpression networks. Next, univariate Cox regression, LASSO regression, and Kaplan-Meier analyses were used to identify hub genes in scRNA-seq data from sequential B-cell analyses. Finally, we examined the correlation between the hub genes and TIBs utilizing the TISIDB database. We confirmed the immune-related markers in clinical validation samples using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC). 15 cell clusters were classified in the scRNA-seq database. According to the WGCNA findings, the green module is most associated with cancer and B cells. The intersection of 12 genes in two separate datasets (scRNA and bulk) was attained for further analysis. However, survival studies revealed that increasedC-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4(CXCR4) expression was linked to worse overall survival.CXCR4expression is correlated with active, immature, and memory B cells in STAD were identified. Finally, RT-PCR and IHC assays verified that in GC,CXCR4is overexpressed, and its expression level correlates with TIBs. We used scRNA-Seq and bulk RNA-Seq to study STAD's cellular composition. We found thatCXCR4is highly expressed by TIBs in GC, suggesting that it may serve as a hub gene for these cells and a starting point for future research into the molecular mechanisms by which these immune cells gain access to tumors and potentially identify therapeutic targets."

This review offers an in-depth assessment of the molecular profiling undertaken to understand this heterogeneity, focusing on multi-omics strategies applied both in traditional bulk and single-cell levels. Genomic investigations have profoundly informed our comprehension of breast cancer, enabling its categorization into six intrinsic molecular subtypes. Beyond genomics, transcriptomics has rendered deeper insights into the gene expression landscape of breast cancer cells. It has also facilitated the formulation of more precise predictive and prognostic models, thereby enriching the field of personalized medicine in breast cancer. The comparison between traditional and single-cell transcriptomics has identified unique gene expression patterns and facilitated the understanding of cell-to-cell variability. Proteomics provides further insights into breast cancer subtypes by illuminating intricate protein expression patterns and their post-translational modifications. The adoption of single-cell proteomics has been instrumental in this regard, revealing the complex dynamics of protein regulation and interaction. Despite these advancements, this review underscores the need for a holistic integration of multiple 'omics' strategies to fully decipher breast cancer heterogeneity. Such integration not only ensures a comprehensive understanding of breast cancer's molecular complexities, but also promotes the development of personalized treatment strategies."
,37609075,Immune cell type signature discovery and random forest classification for analysis of single cell gene expression datasets.,Front Immunol,"Robust immune cell gene expression signatures are central to the analysis of single cell studies. Nearly all known sets of immune cell signatures have been derived by making use of only single gene expression datasets. Utilizing the power of multiple integrated datasets could lead to high-quality immune cell signatures which could be used as superior inputs to machine learning-based cell type classification approaches.We established a novel workflow for the discovery of immune cell type signatures based primarily on gene-versus-gene expression similarity. It leverages multiple datasets, here seven single cell expression datasets from six different cancer types and resulted in eleven immune cell type-specific gene expression signatures. We used these to train random forest classifiers for immune cell type assignment for single-cell RNA-seq datasets. We obtained similar or better prediction results compared to commonly used methods for cell type assignment in independent benchmarking datasets. Our gene signature set yields higher prediction scores than other published immune cell type gene sets in random forest-based cell type classification. We further demonstrate how our approach helps to avoid bias in downstream statistical analyses by re-analysis of a published IFN stimulation experiment.We demonstrated the quality of our immune cell signatures and their strong performance in a random forest-based cell typing approach. We argue that classifying cells based on our comparably slim sets of genes accompanied by a random forest-based approach not only matches or outperforms widely used published approaches. It also facilitates unbiased downstream statistical analyses of differential gene expression between cell types for significantly more genes compared to previous cell classification algorithms.Copyright © 2023 Aybey, Zhao, Brors and Staub."
,37603589,STREAK: A supervised cell surface receptor abundance estimation strategy for single cell RNA-sequencing data using feature selection and thresholded gene set scoring.,PLoS Comput Biol,"The accurate estimation of cell surface receptor abundance for single cell transcriptomics data is important for the tasks of cell type and phenotype categorization and cell-cell interaction quantification. We previously developed an unsupervised receptor abundance estimation technique named SPECK (Surface Protein abundance Estimation using CKmeans-based clustered thresholding) to address the challenges associated with accurate abundance estimation. In that paper, we concluded that SPECK results in improved concordance with Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by Sequencing (CITE-seq) data relative to comparative unsupervised abundance estimation techniques using only single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. In this paper, we outline a new supervised receptor abundance estimation method called STREAK (gene Set Testing-based Receptor abundance Estimation using Adjusted distances and cKmeans thresholding) that leverages associations learned from joint scRNA-seq/CITE-seq training data and a thresholded gene set scoring mechanism to estimate receptor abundance for scRNA-seq target data. We evaluate STREAK relative to both unsupervised and supervised receptor abundance estimation techniques using two evaluation approaches on six joint scRNA-seq/CITE-seq datasets that represent four human and mouse tissue types. We conclude that STREAK outperforms other abundance estimation strategies and provides a more biologically interpretable and transparent statistical model.Copyright: © 2023 Javaid, Frost.

Currently, the common practice in scRNA-seq is to determine cell type labels through unsupervised clustering and the examination of cluster-specific genes. However, even small differences in analysis and parameter choosing can greatly alter clustering results and thus impose great influence on which cell types are identified. Existing methods largely focus on determining the optimal number of robust clusters, which can be problematic for identifying cells of extremely low abundance due to their subtle contributions toward overall patterns of gene expression.Here, we present a carefully designed framework, SCISSORS, which accurately profiles subclusters within broad cluster(s) for the identification of rare cell types in scRNA-seq data. SCISSORS employs silhouette scoring for the estimation of heterogeneity of clusters and reveals rare cells in heterogenous clusters by a multi-step semi-supervised reclustering process. Additionally, SCISSORS provides a method for the identification of marker genes of high specificity to the cell type. SCISSORS is wrapped around the popular Seurat R package and can be easily integrated into existing Seurat pipelines.SCISSORS, including source code and vignettes, are freely available at https://github.com/jr-leary7/SCISSORS.© The Author(s) 2023.

,37569389,Mitochondrial Dysfunction Associated with mtDNA in Metabolic Syndrome and Obesity.,Int J Mol Sci,"Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a precursor to the major health diseases associated with high mortality in industrialized countries: cardiovascular disease and diabetes. An important component of the pathogenesis of the metabolic syndrome is mitochondrial dysfunction, which is associated with tissue hypoxia, disruption of mitochondrial integrity, increased production of reactive oxygen species, and a decrease in ATP, leading to a chronic inflammatory state that affects tissues and organ systems. The mitochondrial AAA + protease Lon (Lonp1) has a broad spectrum of activities. In addition to its classical function (degradation of misfolded or damaged proteins), enzymatic activity (proteolysis, chaperone activity, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)binding) has been demonstrated. At the same time, the spectrum of Lonp1 activity extends to the regulation of cellular processes inside mitochondria, as well as outside mitochondria (nuclear localization). This mitochondrial protease with enzymatic activity may be a promising molecular target for the development of targeted therapy for MetS and its components. The aim of this review is to elucidate the role of mtDNA in the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome and its components as a key component of mitochondrial dysfunction and to describe the promising and little-studied AAA + LonP1 protease as a potential target in metabolic disorders."

In the current absence of studies to probe the impact of candidate causal variants in the cornea, we aimed to fill some of this knowledge gap by leveraging tissue-shared genetic effects.Methods:181 CRF signals were examined for evidence of colocalization with genetic signals affecting steady-state gene transcription and splicing in adult, non-eye, tissues of the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. Expression of candidate causal genes thus nominated was evaluated in single cell transcriptomes from adult cornea, limbus and conjunctiva. Fine-mapping and colocalization of CRF and keratoconus GWAS signals was also deployed to support their sharing causal variants.Results and discussion:26.5% of CRF causal signals colocalized with GTEx v8 signals and nominated genes enriched in genes with high and specific expression in corneal stromal cells amongst tissues examined. Enrichment analyses carried out with nearest genes to all 181 CRF GWAS signals indicated that stromal cells of the limbus could be susceptible to signals that did not colocalize with GTEx's. These cells might not be well represented in GTEx and/or the genetic associations might have context specific effects. The causal signals shared with GTEx provide new insights into mediation of CRF genetic effects, including modulation of splicing events. Functionally relevant roles for several implicated genes' products in providing tensile strength, mechano-sensing and signaling make the corresponding genes and regulatory variants prime candidates to be validated and their roles and effects across tissues elucidated. Colocalization of CRF and keratoconus GWAS signals strengthened support for shared causal variants but also highlighted many ways into which likely true shared signals could be missed when using readily available GWAS summary statistics.Copyright © 2023 Jiang, Boutin and Vitart."

,37667220,TET2 inhibits the proliferation and metastasis of lung adenocarcinoma cells via activation of the cGAS-STING signalling pathway.,BMC Cancer,"Effective identification and development of new molecular methods for the diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) remains an urgent clinical need. DNA methylation patterns at cytosine bases in the genome are closely related to gene expression, and abnormal DNA methylation is frequently observed in various cancers. The ten-eleven translocation (TET) enzymes oxidize 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and promote locus-specific DNA methylation reversal. This study aimed to explore the role of the TET2 protein and its downstream effector, 5-hmC/5-mC DNA modification, in LUAD progression.The expression of TET2 was analysed by real-time PCR, Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. The 5-hmC DNA content was determined by a colorimetric kit. Activation of the cGAS-STING signalling pathway was evaluated by Western blotting. CCK-8, wound healing and Transwell assays were performed to evaluate the effect of TET2 on cell proliferation, migration and invasion abilities. A xenograft model was used to analyse the effect of TET2 on the tumorigenic ability of A549 cells.TET2 overexpression decreased proliferation and metastasis of A549 and H1975 cells in vitro and in vivo. However, TET2 knockdown dramatically enhanced the proliferation, migration and invasion of A549 and H1975 cells. Mechanistically, activation of the cGAS-STING signalling pathway is critical for the TET2-mediated suppression of LUAD cell tumorigenesis and metastasis.In this study, we demonstrate a tumour suppressor role of TET2 in LUAD, providing new potential molecular therapeutic targets and clinical therapies for patients with non-small cell lung cancer.© 2023.

,37580596,NA,NA,"Cellular differentiation requires extensive alterations in chromatin structure and function, which is elicited by the coordinated action of chromatin and transcription factors. By contrast with transcription factors, the roles of chromatin factors in differentiation have not been systematically characterized. Here, we combine bulk ex vivo and single-cell in vivo CRISPR screens to characterize the role of chromatin factor families in hematopoiesis. We uncover marked lineage specificities for 142 chromatin factors, revealing functional diversity among related chromatin factors (i.e. barrier-to-autointegration factor subcomplexes) as well as shared roles for unrelated repressive complexes that restrain excessive myeloid differentiation. Using epigenetic profiling, we identify functional interactions between lineage-determining transcription factors and several chromatin factors that explain their lineage dependencies. Studying chromatin factor functions in leukemia, we show that leukemia cells engage homeostatic chromatin factor functions to block differentiation, generating specific chromatin factor-transcription factor interactions that might be therapeutically targeted.

Then we evaluated co-expressed genes of ESYT3 by cBioPortal online tools and performed enrichment analysis using Metascape. Moreover, the relationship between ESYT3 and immune infiltrating cells was explored via TIMER2, and MethSurv database was used to conduct methylation analysis. We found ESYT3 was downregulated in LUAD tissues based on TCGA and GEPIA databases. Low expression of ESYT3 mRNA was observed to be significantly correlated with N classification and stage classification. GEPIA2, UALCAN databases and KM Plotter showed that low expression levels of ESYT3 was associated with poor survival in LUAD patients. The enrichment analysis indicated that co-expressed genes of ESYT3 were highly enriched in cell division. Then, our study showed ESYT3 was correlated with immune infiltration and immune checkpoints. Additionally, hypomethylation was associated with low ESYT3 expression and poor prognosis in LUAD. In conclusion, this study suggested ESYT3 could be a potential prognostic marker and a promising therapeutic target in LUAD.Copyright © 2023 the Author(s). Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc."
,37628587,NA,NA,"Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is a small fraction of our hereditary material. However, this molecule has had an overwhelming presence in scientific research for decades until the arrival of high-throughput studies. Several appealing properties justify the application of mtDNA to understand how human populations are-from a genetic perspective-and how individuals exhibit phenotypes of biomedical importance. Here, I review the basics of mitochondrial studies with a focus on the dawn of the field, analysis methods and the connection between two sides of mitochondrial genetics: anthropological and biomedical. The particularities of mtDNA, with respect to inheritance pattern, evolutionary rate and dependence on the nuclear genome, explain the challenges of associating mtDNA composition and diseases. Finally, I consider the relevance of this single locus in the context of omics research. The present work may serve as a tribute to a tool that has provided important insights into the past and present of humankind."

In this study, we integrated gene expression, DNA methylation, and genome variants from the iMETHYL database using the recently proposed kernel tensor decomposition-based unsupervised feature extraction method with limited computational resources (i.e., short CPU time and small memory requirements). Our methods do not require prior knowledge of the subjects because they are fully unsupervised in that unsupervised tensor decomposition is used. The selected genes and genomic variants were significantly targeted by transcription factors that were biologically enriched in KEGG pathway terms as well as in the intra-related regulatory network. The proposed method is promising for integrated analyses of gene expression, methylation, and genomic variants with limited computational resources.Copyright: © 2023 Taguchi et al.

It is critical to detect and accurately diagnose the disease early to improve survival rates. Tumor markers have emerged as valuable tools in the diagnosis and management of OC, offering non-invasive and cost-effective options for screening, monitoring, and prognosis.This paper explores the diagnostic importance of various tumor markers including CA-125, CA15-3, CA 19-9, HE4,hCG, inhibin, AFP, and LDH, and their impact on disease monitoring and treatment response assessment.Article searches were performed on PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar. Keywords used for the searching process were ""Ovarian cancer"", ""Cancer biomarkers"", ""Early detection"", ""Cancer diagnosis"", ""CA-125"",""CA 15-3"",""CA 19-9"", ""HE4"",""hCG"", ""inhibin"", ""AFP"", ""LDH"", and others.HE4, when combined with CA-125, shows improved sensitivity and specificity, particularly in early-stage detection. Additionally, hCG holds promise as a prognostic marker, aiding treatment response prediction and outcome assessment. Novel markers like microRNAs, DNA methylation patterns, and circulating tumor cells offer potential for enhanced diagnostic accuracy and personalized management. Integrating these markers into a comprehensive panel may improve sensitivity and specificity in ovarian cancer diagnosis. However, careful interpretation of tumor marker results is necessary, considering factors such as age, menopausal status, and comorbidities. Further research is needed to validate and refine diagnostic algorithms, optimizing the clinical significance of tumor markers in ovarian cancer management. In conclusion, tumor markers such as CA-125, CA15-3, CA 19-9, HE4, and hCG provide valuable insights into ovarian cancer diagnosis, monitoring, and prognosis, with the potential to enhance early detection."
,37628794,The Future of Precision Oncology.,Int J Mol Sci,"Our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying cancer development and evolution have evolved rapidly over recent years, and the variation from one patient to another is now widely recognized. Consequently, one-size-fits-all approaches to the treatment of cancer have been superseded by precision medicines that target specific disease characteristics, promising maximum clinical efficacy, minimal safety concerns, and reduced economic burden. While precision oncology has been very successful in the treatment of some tumors with specific characteristics, a large number of patients do not yet have access to precision medicines for their disease. The success of next-generation precision oncology depends on the discovery of new actionable disease characteristics, rapid, accurate, and comprehensive diagnosis of complex phenotypes within each patient, novel clinical trial designs with improved response rates, and worldwide access to novel targeted anticancer therapies for all patients. This review outlines some of the current technological trends, and highlights some of the complex multidisciplinary efforts that are underway to ensure that many more patients with cancer will be able to benefit from precision oncology in the near future."
,37608214,Early detection of lung cancer using artificial intelligence-enhanced optical nanosensing of chromatin alterations in field carcinogenesis.,Sci Rep,"Supranucleosomal chromatin structure, including chromatin domain conformation, is involved in the regulation of gene expression and its dysregulation has been associated with carcinogenesis. Prior studies have shown that cells in the buccal mucosa carry a molecular signature of lung cancer among the cigarette-smoking population, the phenomenon known as field carcinogenesis or field of injury. Thus, we hypothesized that chromatin structural changes in buccal mucosa can be predictive of lung cancer. However, the small size of the chromatin chain (approximately 20 nm) folded into chromatin packing domains, themselves typically below 300 nm in diameter, preclude the detection of alterations in intradomain chromatin conformation using diffraction-limited optical microscopy. In this study, we developed an optical spectroscopic statistical nanosensing technique to detect chromatin packing domain changes in buccal mucosa as a lung cancer biomarker: chromatin-sensitive partial wave spectroscopic microscopy (csPWS). Artificial intelligence (AI) was applied to csPWS measurements of chromatin alterations to enhance diagnostic performance. Our AI-enhanced buccal csPWS nanocytology of 179 patients at two clinical sites distinguished Stage-I lung cancer versus cancer-free controls with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.92 ± 0.06 for Site 1 (in-state location) and 0.82 ± 0.11 for Site 2 (out-of-state location).© 2023.

However, high-quality DNA methylation sequencing has been challenging because poor sequence diversity of the bisulfite-converted libraries severely impairs sequencing quality and yield. In this study, we tested MGISEQ-2000 Sequencer's capability of DNA methylation sequencing with a published non-invasive pancreatic cancer detection assay, using NovaSeq6000 as the benchmark.We sequenced a series of synthetic cell-free DNA (cfDNA) samples with different tumor fractions and found MGISEQ-2000 yielded data with similar quality as NovaSeq6000. The methylation levels measured by MGISEQ-2000 demonstrated high consistency with NovaSeq6000. Moreover, MGISEQ-2000 showed a comparable analytic sensitivity with NovaSeq6000, suggesting its potential for clinical detection. As to evaluate the clinical performance of MGISEQ-2000, we sequenced 24 clinical samples and predicted the pathology of the samples with a clinical diagnosis model, PDACatch classifier. The clinical model performance of MGISEQ-2000's data was highly consistent with that of NovaSeq6000's data, with the area under the curve of 1. We also tested the model's robustness with MGISEQ-2000's data when reducing the sequencing depth. The results showed that MGISEQ-2000's data showed matching robustness of the PDACatch classifier with NovaSeq6000's data.Taken together, MGISEQ-2000 demonstrated similar data quality, consistency of the methylation levels, comparable analytic sensitivity, and matching clinical performance, supporting its application in future non-invasive early cancer detection investigations by detecting distinct methylation patterns of cfDNAs.© 2023.

,37560387,"An overview of DNA methylation markers for early detection of gastric cancer: current status, challenges, and prospects.",Front Genet,"Background:Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common malignancies, with a low 5-year survival rate. However, if diagnosed at an early stage, it can be cured by endoscopic treatment and has a good prognosis. While gastrointestinal X-ray and upper endoscopy are used as national GC screening methods in some GC high-risk countries, such as Japan and Korea, their radiation exposure, invasiveness, and high cost suggest that they are not the optimal tools for early detection of GC in many countries. Therefore, a cost-effective, and highly accurate method for GC early detection is urgently needed in clinical settings. DNA methylation plays a key role in cancer progression and metastasis and has been demonstrated as a promising marker for cancer early detection.Aims and methods:This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current status of DNA methylation markers associated with GC, the assays developed for GC early detection, challenges in methylation marker discovery and application, and the future prospects of utilizing methylation markers for early detection of GC. Through our analysis, we found that the currently reported DNA methylation markers related to GC are mainly in the early discovery stage. Most of them have only been evaluated in tissue samples. The majority of non-invasive assays developed based on blood lack standardized sampling protocols, pre-analytical procedures, and multicenter validation, and they exhibit insufficient sensitivity for early-stage GC detection. Meanwhile, the reported GC DNA methylation markers are generally considered pan-cancer markers.Conclusion:Therefore, future endeavors should focus on identifying additional methylation markers specific to GC and establishing non-invasive diagnostic assays that rely on these markers. These assays should undergo multicenter, large-scale prospective validation in diverse populations.Copyright © 2023 Xue, Huang, Pei, Wang and Dai."

Leveraging advancements in mass spectrometry, it provides a detailed perspective on cellular dynamics, interactions, and responses to environmental stimuli and their impacts on human health. This work delves into this innovative realm, highlighting the nuanced interplay between environmental stressors and biological responses at cellular and subcellular levels. The application of spatial mass spectrometry in single-cell exposomics is discussed, revealing the intricate spatial organization and molecular composition within individual cells. Cell-type-specific exposomics, shedding light on distinct susceptibilities and adaptive strategies of various cell types to environmental exposures, is also examined. The Perspective further emphasizes the integration with molecular and cellular biology approaches to validate hypotheses derived from single-cell exposomics in a comprehensive biological context. Looking toward the future, we anticipate continued technological advancements and convergence with other -omics approaches and discuss implications for environmental health research, disease progression studies, and precision medicine. The final emphasis is on the need for robust computational tools and interdisciplinary collaboration to fully leverage the potential of single-cell exposomics, acknowledging the complexities inherent to this paradigm."
,37602215,Inferring CTCF-binding patterns and anchored loops across human tissues and cell types.,Patterns (N Y),"CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) is a transcription regulator with a complex role in gene regulation. The recognition and effects of CTCF on DNA sequences, chromosome barriers, and enhancer blocking are not well understood. Existing computational tools struggle to assess the regulatory potential of CTCF-binding sites and their impact on chromatin loop formation. Here we have developed a deep-learning model, DeepAnchor, to accurately characterize CTCF binding using high-resolution genomic/epigenomic features. This has revealed distinct chromatin and sequence patterns for CTCF-mediated insulation and looping. An optimized implementation of a previous loop model based on DeepAnchor score excels in predicting CTCF-anchored loops. We have established a compendium of CTCF-anchored loops across 52 human tissue/cell types, and this suggests that genomic disruption of these loops could be a general mechanism of disease pathogenesis. These computational models and resources can help investigate how CTCF-mediatedcis-regulatory elements shape context-specific gene regulation in cell development and disease progression.© 2023 The Authors."
,37589026,Integrative Identification by Hi-C Revealed Distinct Advanced Structural Variations in Lung Adenocarcinoma Tissue.,Phenomics,"Advanced three-dimensional structure variations of chromatin in large genome fragments, such as conversion of A/B compartment, topologically associated domains (TADs) and chromatin loops are related closely to occurrence of malignant tumors. However, the structural characteristics of lung cancer still remain uncovered. In this study, we used high-throughput chromosome (Hi-C) conformation capture technology to detect the advanced structural variations in chromatin of two non-smoking lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) tumor and paired normal tissues. The results indicate that significant chromatin variations are detected in tumor tissues compared with normal tissues. At compartment scale, the main conversion type of compartment is A → B in tumor tissues, which are concentrated mainly on chromosome 3 (Chr3) (33.6%). A total of 216 tumor-specific TADs are identified in tumor tissues, which are distributed mainly in Chr1 (19), Chr2 (15) and Chr3 (17). Forty-one distinct enhancer-promoter loops are observed in tumor tissue, which are associated closely to tumor-related pathways including mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase-Protein kinase B (PI3K-AKT), Ras, Wnt and Ras1. The most important observation in this study is that we identify five important genes (SYT16,NCEH1,NXPE3,MB21D2, andDZIP1L), which are detected in both A → B compartment, TADs and chromatin loops in tumor samples, and four of these genes (NCEH1,NXPE3,MB21D2, andDZIP1L) locate on q arm of Chr3. Further gene expression and invasion experiment analysis show thatNCEH1,MB21D2andSYT16are involved in the tumor development. Thus, we provide a comprehensive overview of advanced structures in LUAD for the first time and provide a basis for further research on the genetic variation of this tumor.© International Human Phenome Institutes (Shanghai) 2023.

,37546906,NA,NA,"The identification of cell-type-specific 3D chromatin interactions between regulatory elements can help to decipher gene regulation and to interpret the function of disease-associated non-coding variants. However, current chromosome conformation capture (3C) technologies are unable to resolve interactions at this resolution when only small numbers of cells are available as input. We therefore present ChromaFold, a deep learning model that predicts 3D contact maps and regulatory interactions from single-cell ATAC sequencing (scATAC-seq) data alone. ChromaFold uses pseudobulk chromatin accessibility, co-accessibility profiles across metacells, and predicted CTCF motif tracks as input features and employs a lightweight architecture to enable training on standard GPUs. Once trained on paired scATAC-seq and Hi-C data in human cell lines and tissues, ChromaFold can accurately predict both the 3D contact map and peak-level interactions across diverse human and mouse test cell types. In benchmarking against a recent deep learning method that uses bulk ATAC-seq, DNA sequence, and CTCF ChIP-seq to make cell-type-specific predictions, ChromaFold yields superior prediction performance when including CTCF ChIP-seq data as an input and comparable performance without. Finally, fine-tuning ChromaFold on paired scATAC-seq and Hi-C in a complex tissue enables deconvolution of chromatin interactions across cell subpopulations. ChromaFold thus achieves state-of-the-art prediction of 3D contact maps and regulatory interactions using scATAC-seq alone as input data, enabling accurate inference of cell-type-specific interactions in settings where 3C-based assays are infeasible."

We aimed to characterize and analyze the temporal trends of sepsis-related mortality in China, by population groups, underlying causes of death, geographic regions, and sociodemographic index (SDI) levels.Sepsis-related deaths were identified from the National Mortality Surveillance System (NMSS) of China from 2006 to 2020. Trends of sepsis-related mortality and years of life lost (YLLs), stratified by age, sex, underlying diseases, and regions were analyzed using the Jointpoint regression analysis. We investigated the association of SDI with trends of sepsis-related mortality.In 2020, sepsis was estimated to be responsible for 986,929 deaths and 17.1 million YLLs in China. Age-standardized sepsis-related mortality significantly declined from 130.2 (95%CI, 129.4-131) per 100,000 population in 2006 to 76.6 (76.3-76.9) in 2020. Age-standardized YLLs decreased from 2172.7 (2169.4-2176) per 100,000 population in 2006 to 1271 (1269.8-1272.2) in 2020. Substantial variations of sepsis-related mortality and YLLs were observed between population groups and regions, with higher burden in males, the elderly, and western China. An inverse relation was noted between SDI and sepsis-related mortality or YLLs.Despite declining trends of age-standardized mortality and YLLs of sepsis in China, significant disparities between population groups and regions highlight a need for targeted policies and measures to close the gaps and improve the outcome of sepsis.© 2023.

While this technique is effective, non-invasive methods such as radiomics have gained popularity for extracting imaging features to develop predictive models for clinical tasks. The aim is to minimize invasive processes for improved management of prostate cancer (PCa). This study reviews recent research progress in MRI-based radiomics for PCa, including the radiomics pipeline and potential factors affecting personalized diagnosis. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) with medical imaging is also discussed, in line with the development trend of radiogenomics and multi-omics.

,37627121,A Comprehensive Benchmark of Transcriptomic Biomarkers for Immune Checkpoint Blockades.,Cancers (Basel),"Immune checkpoint blockades (ICBs) have revolutionized cancer therapy by inducing durable clinical responses, but only a small percentage of patients can benefit from ICB treatments. Many studies have established various biomarkers to predict ICB responses. However, different biomarkers were found with diverse performances in practice, and a timely and unbiased assessment has yet to be conducted due to the complexity of ICB-related studies and trials. In this study, we manually curated 29 published datasets with matched transcriptome and clinical data from more than 1400 patients, and uniformly preprocessed these datasets for further analyses. In addition, we collected 39 sets of transcriptomic biomarkers, and based on the nature of the corresponding computational methods, we categorized them into the gene-set-like group (with the self-contained design and the competitive design, respectively) and the deconvolution-like group. Next, we investigated the correlations and patterns of these biomarkers and utilized a standardized workflow to systematically evaluate their performance in predicting ICB responses and survival statuses across different datasets, cancer types, antibodies, biopsy times, and combinatory treatments. In our benchmark, most biomarkers showed poor performance in terms of stability and robustness across different datasets. Two scores (TIDE and CYT) had a competitive performance for ICB response prediction, and two others (PASS-ON and EIGS_ssGSEA) showed the best association with clinical outcome. Finally, we developed ICB-Portal to host the datasets, biomarkers, and benchmark results and to implement the computational methods for researchers to test their custom biomarkers. Our work provided valuable resources and a one-stop solution to facilitate ICB-related research."
,37583573,Defining cardiac functional recovery in end-stage heart failure at single-cell resolution.,Nat Cardiovasc Res,"Recovery of cardiac function is the holy grail of heart failure therapy yet is infrequently observed and remains poorly understood. In this study, we performed single-nucleus RNA sequencing from patients with heart failure who recovered left ventricular systolic function after left ventricular assist device implantation, patients who did not recover and non-diseased donors. We identified cell-specific transcriptional signatures of recovery, most prominently in macrophages and fibroblasts. Within these cell types, inflammatory signatures were negative predictors of recovery, and downregulation of RUNX1 was associated with recovery. In silico perturbation of RUNX1 in macrophages and fibroblasts recapitulated the transcriptional state of recovery. Cardiac recovery mediated by BET inhibition in mice led to decreased macrophage and fibroblast Runx1 expression and diminished chromatin accessibility within a Runx1 intronic peak and acquisition of human recovery signatures. These findings suggest that cardiac recovery is a unique biological state and identify RUNX1 as a possible therapeutic target to facilitate cardiac recovery."
,37596694,Jdp2 is a spatiotemporal transcriptional activator of the AhR via the Nrf2 gene battery.,Inflamm Regen,"Crosstalk between the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) signaling is called the ""AhR-Nrf2 gene battery"", which works synergistically in detoxification to support cell survival. Nrf2-dependent phase II gene promoters are controlled by coordinated recruitment of the AhR to adjacent dioxin responsive element (DRE) and Nrf2 recruitment to the antioxidative response element (ARE). The molecular interaction between AhR and Nrf2 members, and the regulation of each target, including phase I and II gene complexes, and their mediators are poorly understood.Knockdown and forced expression of AhR-Nrf2 battery members were used to examine the molecular interactions between the AhR-Nrf2 axis and AhR promoter activation. Sequential immunoprecipitation, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and histology were used to identify each protein complex recruited to their respective cis-elements in the AhR promoter. Actin fiber distribution, cell spreading, and invasion were examined to identify functional differences in the AhR-Jdp2 axis between wild-type and Jdp2 knockout cells. The possible tumorigenic role of Jdp2 in the AhR-Nrf2 axis was examined in mutant Kras-Trp53-driven pancreatic tumors.Crosstalk between AhR and Nrf2 was evident at the transcriptional level. The AhR promoter was activated by phase I ligands such as 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) through the AhR-Jdp2-Nrf2 axis in a time- and spatial transcription-dependent manner. Jdp2 was a bifunctional activator of DRE- and ARE-mediated transcription in response to TCDD. After TCDD exposure, Jdp2 activated the AhR promoter at the DRE and then moved to the ARE where it activated the promoter to increase reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated functions such as cell spreading and invasion in normal cells, and cancer regression in mutant Kras-Trp53-driven pancreatic tumor cells.Jdp2 plays a critical role in AhR promoter activation through the AhR-Jdp2-Nrf2 axis in a spatiotemporal manner. The AhR functions to maintain ROS balance and cell spreading, invasion, and cancer regression in a mouse model of mutant Kras-Trp53 pancreatic cancer. These findings provide new insights into the roles of Jdp2 in the homeostatic regulation of oxidative stress and in the antioxidation response in detoxification, inflammation, and cancer progression.© 2023.

FCD is classified into three categories based on structural and cellular abnormalities, with FCD type II being the most common and characterized by disrupted organization of the cortex and abnormal neuronal development. In this study, we employed cell-type deconvolution and single-cell signatures to analyze bulk RNA-seq from multiple transcriptomic studies, aiming to characterize the cellular composition of brain lesions in patients with FCD IIa and IIb subtypes. Our deconvolution analyses revealed specific cellular changes in FCD IIb, including neuronal loss and an increase in reactive astrocytes (astrogliosis) when compared to FCD IIa. Astrogliosis in FCD IIb was further supported by a gene signature analysis and histologically confirmed by glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunostaining. Overall, our findings demonstrate that FCD II subtypes exhibit differential neuronal and glial compositions, with astrogliosis emerging as a hallmark of FCD IIb.

Thus, prenatal development may predict aging trajectories in humans. The study aimed to verify if body size at birth is related to biological age in adult men. The study sample consisted of 159 healthy, non-smoking men with a mean age of 35.24 (SD 3.44) years. Birth weight and length were taken from medical records. The ponderal index at birth was calculated. Biological age was evaluated based on serum levels of s-Klotho, hsCRP, DHEA/S, and oxidative stress markers. Pregnancy age at birth, lifestyle, weight, cortisol, and testosterone levels were controlled. The results showed no relationship between birth size and s-Klotho, DHEA/S level, inflammation, or oxidative stress. Also, men born as small-for-gestational-age (N = 49) and men born as appropriate-for-gestational-age (N = 110) did not differ in terms of biological age markers levels. The results were similar when controlled for pregnancy week at birth, chronological age, BMI, testosterone, or cortisol level. The results suggest that there is no relationship between intrauterine growth and biomarkers of aging in men aged 30-45 years from the affluent population.© 2023. Springer Nature Limited."
,37560445,Artificial intelligence vs. evolving super-complex tumor intelligence: critical viewpoints.,Front Artif Intell,"Recent developments in various domains have led to a growing interest in the potential of artificial intelligence to enhance our lives and environments. In particular, the application of artificial intelligence in the management of complex human diseases, such as cancer, has garnered significant attention. The evolution of artificial intelligence is thought to be influenced by multiple factors, including human intervention and environmental factors. Similarly, tumors, being heterogeneous and complex diseases, continue to evolve due to changes in the physical, chemical, and biological environment. Additionally, the concept of cellular intelligence within biological systems has been recognized as a potential attribute of biological entities. Therefore, it is plausible that the tumor intelligence present in cancer cells of affected individuals could undergo super-evolution due to changes in the pro-tumor environment. Thus, a comparative analysis of the evolution of artificial intelligence and super-complex tumor intelligence could yield valuable insights to develop better artificial intelligence-based tools for cancer management.Copyright © 2023 Sharma and Sarode."
,37627102,"Variant Characterization of a Representative Large Pedigree Suggests ""Variant Risk Clusters"" Convey Varying Predisposition of Risk to Lynch Syndrome.",Cancers (Basel),"Recently, worldwide incidences of young adult aggressive colorectal cancer (CRC) have rapidly increased. Of these incidences diagnosed as familial Lynch syndrome (LS) CRC, outcomes are extremely poor. In this study, we seek novel familial germline variants from a large pedigree Tunisian family with 12 LS-affected individuals to identify putative germline variants associated with varying risk of LS. Whole-genome sequencing analysis was performed to identify known and novel germline variants shared between affected and non-affected pedigree members. SNPs, indels, and structural variants (SVs) were computationally identified, and their oncological influence was predicted using the Genetic Association of Complex Diseases and Disorders, OncoKB, and My Cancer Genome databases. Of 94 germline familial variants identified with predicted functional impact, 37 SNPs/indels were detected in 28 genes, 2 of which (MLH1 and PRH1-TAS2R14) have known association with CRC and 4 others (PPP1R13B, LAMA5, FTO, and NLRP14) have known association with non-CRC cancers. In addition, 48 of 57 identified SVs overlap with 43 genes. Three of these genes (RELN, IRS2, and FOXP1) have a known association with non-CRC digestive cancers and one (RRAS2) has a known association with non-CRC cancer. Our study identified 83 novel, predicted functionally impactful germline variants grouped in three ""variant risk clusters"" shared in three familiarly associated LS groups (high, intermediate and low risk). This variant characterization study demonstrates that large pedigree investigations provide important evidence supporting the hypothesis that different ""variant risk clusters"" can convey different mechanisms of risk and oncogenesis of LS-CRC even within the same pedigree."

Covariates included age, sex, and educational level.Performance on cognitive tests assessing memory, language, attention, processing speed, and executive functioning; measures included the Spanish-English Verbal Learning Test (SEVLT) Learning and Delayed Recall subscales; Wechsler Memory Scale, third edition (WMS-III) Digit Span Forward, Digit Span Backward, and Logical Memory 1 and 2 subscales; Trail Making Test (TMT) parts A and B; Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST); Letter Fluency; and Animal Naming. Raw scores were used for analyses. Associations between neighborhood disadvantage and neuropsychological performance were examined via demographically adjusted linear regression models stratified by ethnic group.Among 1614 older adults (mean [SD] age, 66.3 [8.7] years; 980 women [60.7%]), 853 were Mexican American (mean [SD] age, 63.9 [7.9] years; 566 women [66.4%]), and 761 were non-Hispanic White (mean [SD] age, 69.1 [8.7] years; 414 women [54.4%]). Older Mexican American adults were more likely to reside in the most disadvantaged areas (ADI quintiles 3-5), with 280 individuals (32.8%) living in ADI quintile 5, whereas a large proportion of older non-Hispanic White adults resided in ADI quintile 1 (296 individuals [38.9%]). Mexican American individuals living in more disadvantaged areas had worse performance than those living in ADI quintile 1 on 7 of 11 cognitive tests, including SEVLT Learning (ADI quintile 5: β = -2.50; 95% CI, -4.46 to -0.54), SEVLT Delayed Recall (eg, ADI quintile 3: β = -1.11; 95% CI, -1.97 to -0.24), WMS-III Digit Span Forward (eg, ADI quintile 4: β = -1.14; 95% CI, -1.60 to -0.67), TMT part A (ADI quintile 5: β = 7.85; 95% CI, 1.28-14.42), TMT part B (eg, ADI quintile 5: β = 31.5; 95% CI, 12.16-51.35), Letter Fluency (ADI quintile 4: β = -2.91; 95% CI, -5.39 to -0.43), and DSST (eg, ADI quintile 5: β = -4.45; 95% CI, -6.77 to -2.14). In contrast, only non-Hispanic White individuals living in ADI quintile 4 had worse performance than those living in ADI quintile 1 on 4 of 11 cognitive tests, including SEVLT Learning (β = -2.35; 95% CI, -4.40 to -0.30), SEVLT Delayed Recall (β = -0.95; 95% CI, -1.73 to -0.17), TMT part B (β = 15.95; 95% CI, 2.47-29.44), and DSST (β = -3.96; 95% CI, -6.49 to -1.43).In this cross-sectional study, aging in a disadvantaged area was associated with worse cognitive functioning, particularly for older Mexican American adults. Future studies examining the implications of exposure to neighborhood disadvantage across the life span will be important for improving cognitive outcomes in diverse populations."
,37652986,Multiplexed transcriptomic profiling of the fate of human CAR T cells in vivo via genetic barcoding with shielded small nucleotides.,Nat Biomed Eng,"The design of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells would benefit from knowledge of the fate of the cells in vivo. This requires the permanent labelling of CAR T cell products and their pooling in the same microenvironment. Here, we report a cell-barcoding method for the multiplexed longitudinal profiling of cells in vivo using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). The method, which we named shielded-small-nucleotide-based scRNA-seq (SSN-seq), is compatible with both 3' and 5' single-cell profiling, and enables the recording of cell identity, from cell infusion to isolation, by leveraging the ubiquitous Pol III U6 promoters to robustly express small-RNA barcodes modified with direct-capture sequences. By using SSN-seq to track the dynamics of the states of CAR T cells in a tumour-rechallenge mouse model of leukaemia, we found that a combination of cytokines and small-molecule inhibitors that are used in the ex vivo manufacturing of CAR T cells promotes the in vivo expansion of persistent populations of CD4+memory T cells. By facilitating the probing of cell-state dynamics in vivo, SSN-seq may aid the development of adoptive cell therapies.© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited."
,37590228,The specious art of single-cell genomics.,PLoS Comput Biol,"Dimensionality reduction is standard practice for filtering noise and identifying relevant features in large-scale data analyses. In biology, single-cell genomics studies typically begin with reduction to 2 or 3 dimensions to produce ""all-in-one"" visuals of the data that are amenable to the human eye, and these are subsequently used for qualitative and quantitative exploratory analysis. However, there is little theoretical support for this practice, and we show that extreme dimension reduction, from hundreds or thousands of dimensions to 2, inevitably induces significant distortion of high-dimensional datasets. We therefore examine the practical implications of low-dimensional embedding of single-cell data and find that extensive distortions and inconsistent practices make such embeddings counter-productive for exploratory, biological analyses. In lieu of this, we discuss alternative approaches for conducting targeted embedding and feature exploration to enable hypothesis-driven biological discovery.Copyright: © 2023 Chari, Pachter.

,37523521,Quantifying common and distinct information in single-cell multimodal data with Tilted Canonical Correlation Analysis.,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,"Multimodal single-cell technologies profile multiple modalities for each cell simultaneously, enabling a more thorough characterization of cell populations. Existing dimension-reduction methods for multimodal data capture the ""union of information,"" producing a lower-dimensional embedding that combines the information across modalities. While these tools are useful, we focus on a fundamentally different task of separating and quantifying the information among cells that is shared between the two modalities as well as unique to only one modality. Hence, we develop Tilted Canonical Correlation Analysis (Tilted-CCA), a method that decomposes a paired multimodal dataset into three lower-dimensional embeddings-one embedding captures the ""intersection of information,"" representing the geometric relations among the cells that is common to both modalities, while the remaining two embeddings capture the ""distinct information for a modality,"" representing the modality-specific geometric relations. We analyze single-cell multimodal datasets sequencing RNA along surface antibodies (i.e., CITE-seq) as well as RNA alongside chromatin accessibility (i.e., 10x) for blood cells and developing neurons via Tilted-CCA. These analyses show that Tilted-CCA enables meaningful visualization and quantification of the cross-modal information. Finally, Tilted-CCA's framework allows us to perform two specific downstream analyses. First, for single-cell datasets that simultaneously profile transcriptome and surface antibody markers, we show that Tilted-CCA helps design the target antibody panel to complement the transcriptome best. Second, for developmental single-cell datasets that simultaneously profile transcriptome and chromatin accessibility, we show that Tilted-CCA helps identify development-informative genes and distinguish between transient versus terminal cell types."
,37600846,Cobind: quantitative analysis of the genomic overlaps.,Bioinform Adv,"Analyzing the overlap between two sets of genomic intervals is a frequent task in the field of bioinformatics. Typically, this is accomplished by counting the number (or proportion) of overlapped regions, which applies an arbitrary threshold to determine if two genomic intervals are overlapped. By making binary calls but disregarding the magnitude of the overlap, such an approach often leads to biased, non-reproducible, and incomparable results.We developed the cobind package, which incorporates six statistical measures: the Jaccard coefficient, Sørensen-Dice coefficient, Szymkiewicz-Simpson coefficient, collocation coefficient, pointwise mutual information (PMI), and normalized PMI. These measures allow for a quantitative assessment of the collocation strength between two sets of genomic intervals. To demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods, we applied them to analyze CTCF's binding sites identified from ChIP-seq, cancer-specific open-chromatin regions (OCRs) identified from ATAC-seq of 17 cancer types, and oligodendrocytes-specific OCRs identified from scATAC-seq. Our results indicated that these new approaches effectively re-discover CTCF's cofactors, as well as cancer-specific and oligodendrocytes-specific master regulators implicated in disease and cell type development.The cobind package is implemented in Python and freely available at https://cobind.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.© The Author(s) 2023.

However, bulk sequencing entangles information from different cell types and obscures cellular heterogeneity. To address this, we developed Cellformer, a deep learning method that deconvolutes bulk ATAC-seq into cell type-specific expression across the whole genome. Cellformer enables cost-effective cell type-specific open chromatin profiling in large cohorts. Applied to 191 bulk samples from 3 brain regions, Cellformer identifies cell type-specific gene regulatory mechanisms involved in resilience to Alzheimer's disease, an uncommon group of cognitively healthy individuals that harbor a high pathological load of Alzheimer's disease. Cell type-resolved chromatin profiling unveils cell type-specific pathways and nominates potential epigenetic mediators underlying resilience that may illuminate therapeutic opportunities to limit the cognitive impact of the disease.

,37580817,Dissection of transcriptomic and epigenetic heterogeneity of grade 4 gliomas: implications for prognosis.,Acta Neuropathol Commun,"Grade 4 glioma is the most aggressive and currently incurable brain tumor with a median survival of one year in adult patients. Elucidating novel transcriptomic and epigenetic contributors to the molecular heterogeneity underlying its aggressiveness may lead to improved clinical outcomes.To identify grade 4 glioma -associated 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) and transcriptomic features as well as their cross-talks, genome-wide 5hmC and transcriptomic profiles of tissue samples from 61 patients with grade 4 gliomas and 9 normal controls were obtained for differential and co-regulation/co-modification analyses. Prognostic models on overall survival based on transcriptomic features and the 5hmC modifications summarized over genic regions (promoters, gene bodies) and brain-derived histone marks were developed using machine learning algorithms.Despite global reduction, the majority of differential 5hmC features showed higher modification levels in grade 4 gliomas as compared to normal controls. In addition, the bi-directional correlations between 5hmC modifications over promoter regions or gene bodies and gene expression were greatly disturbed in grade 4 gliomas regardless of IDH1 mutation status. Phenotype-associated co-regulated 5hmC-5hmC modules and 5hmC-mRNA modules not only are enriched with different molecular pathways that are indicative of the pathogenesis of grade 4 gliomas, but also are of prognostic significance comparable to IDH1 mutation status. Lastly, the best-performing 5hmC model can predict patient survival at a much higher accuracy (c-index = 74%) when compared to conventional prognostic factor IDH1 (c-index = 57%), capturing the molecular characteristics of tumors that are independent of IDH1 mutation status and gene expression-based molecular subtypes.The 5hmC-based prognostic model could offer a robust tool to predict survival in patients with grade 4 gliomas, potentially outperforming existing prognostic factors such as IDH1 mutations. The crosstalk between 5hmC and gene expression revealed another layer of complexity underlying the molecular heterogeneity in grade 4 gliomas, offering opportunities for identifying novel therapeutic targets.© 2023.

,37629335,NA,NA,"The need to improve health outcomes, as well as disease prognosis, has led clinicians and researchers to propose new ways of identifying COPD in its earliest forms. This initiative is based on the hypothesis that an earlier intervention would have a greater prognostic impact. However, the operational definition of a patient in the initial stages of the disease is complex, and there is still no unanimously accepted definition. GOLD has recently proposed different concepts to identify COPD in its early stages, such as COPD in young people or COPD with mild functional impairment. In addition, GOLD proposes two other concepts, called pre-COPD (symptomatic non-obstructive patients) and PRISm (preserved ratio with impaired spirometry), which aim to identify the patient at risk of developing this chronic airflow obstruction. However, despite the attractiveness of these concepts, none have been taken up universally by the medical community. A universally accepted identification of how to define COPD in its early stages is necessary as a preliminary step in order to design clinical trials to find out the best way to treat these patients. This review deals with these concepts of COPD at the onset of the disease, highlighting their importance and the problems involved in identifying them as therapeutic targets in real clinical practice."
,37653545,NA,NA,"Variant transthyretin amyloidosis (A-ATTRv) is an autosomal dominant disease caused by a range of TTR gene variants which entail great phenotypical heterogeneity and penetrance. In Majorca, the A-ATTRv caused by the V30M gene variant (A-ATTRV30M) is the most common. Since asymptomatic carriers are at risk of developing the disease, estimating age of onset is vital for proper management and follow-up. Thus, the aim of this study was to estimate age-related penetrance in ATTRV30M variant carriers from Majorca.The disease risk among carriers from ATTRV30M families from Majorca was estimated by Non-parametric survival estimation. Factors potentially involved in the disease expression, namely gender and parent of origin were also analysed.A total of 48 heterozygous ATTRV30M families (147 affected patients and 123 were asymptomatic carriers) were included in the analysis. Penetrance progressively increased from 6% at 30 years to 75% at 90 years of age. In contrast to other European populations, we observe a similar risk for both males and females, and no difference of risk according to the parent of origin.In this first study assessing the age-related penetrance of ATTRV30M variant in Majorcan families, no effect of gender or parent of origin was observed. These findings will be helpful for improving management and follow-up of TTR variant carrier individuals.© 2023. Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale (INSERM)."
,37612512,The complete sequence of a human Y chromosome.,Nature,"The human Y chromosome has been notoriously difficult to sequence and assemble because of its complex repeat structure that includes long palindromes, tandem repeats and segmental duplications1-3. As a result, more than half of the Y chromosome is missing from the GRCh38 reference sequence and it remains the last human chromosome to be finished4,5. Here, the Telomere-to-Telomere (T2T) consortium presents the complete 62,460,029-base-pair sequence of a human Y chromosome from the HG002 genome (T2T-Y) that corrects multiple errors in GRCh38-Y and adds over 30 million base pairs of sequence to the reference, showing the complete ampliconic structures of gene families TSPY, DAZ and RBMY; 41 additional protein-coding genes, mostly from the TSPY family; and an alternating pattern of human satellite 1 and 3 blocks in the heterochromatic Yq12 region.

,37599304,"Single-molecule targeted accessibility and methylation sequencing of centromeres, telomeres and rDNAs in Arabidopsis.",Nat Plants,"The short read-length of next-generation sequencing makes it challenging to characterize highly repetitive regions (HRRs) such as centromeres, telomeres and ribosomal DNAs. Based on recent strategies that combined long-read sequencing and exogenous enzymatic labelling of open chromatin, we developed single-molecule targeted accessibility and methylation sequencing (STAM-seq) in plants by further integrating nanopore adaptive sampling to investigate the HRRs in wild-type Arabidopsis and DNA methylation mutants that are defective in CG- or non-CG methylation. We found that CEN180 repeats show higher chromatin accessibility and lower DNA methylation on their forward strand, individual rDNA units show a negative correlation between their DNA methylation and accessibility, and both accessibility and CHH methylation levels are lower at telomere compared to adjacent subtelomeric region. Moreover, DNA methylation-deficient mutants showed increased chromatin accessibility at HRRs, consistent with the role of DNA methylation in maintaining heterochromatic status in plants. STAM-seq can be applied to study accessibility and methylation of repetitive sequences across diverse plant species.© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited."
,37640747,Knockdown of Porf-2 restores visual function after optic nerve crush injury.,Cell Death Dis,"Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), the sole output neurons in the eyes, are vulnerable to diverse insults in many pathological conditions, which can lead to permanent vision dysfunction. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms that contribute to protecting RGCs and their axons from injuries are not completely known. Here, we identify that Porf-2, a member of the Rho GTPase activating protein gene group, is upregulated in RGCs after optic nerve crush. Knockdown of Porf-2 protects RGCs from apoptosis and promotes long-distance optic nerve regeneration after crush injury in both young and aged mice in vivo. In vitro, we find that inhibition of Porf-2 induces axon growth and growth cone formation in retinal explants. Inhibition of Porf-2 provides long-term and post-injury protection to RGCs and eventually promotes the recovery of visual function after crush injury in mice. These findings reveal a neuroprotective impact of the inhibition of Porf-2 on RGC survival and axon regeneration after optic nerve injury, providing a potential therapeutic strategy for vision restoration in patients with traumatic optic neuropathy.© 2023.

,37634152,Chaotic aging: intrinsically disordered proteins in aging-related processes.,Cell Mol Life Sci,"The development of aging is associated with the disruption of key cellular processes manifested as well-established hallmarks of aging. Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) have no stable tertiary structure that provide them a power to be configurable hubs in signaling cascades and regulate many processes, potentially including those related to aging. There is a need to clarify the roles of IDPs/IDRs in aging. The dataset of 1702 aging-related proteins was collected from established aging databases and experimental studies. There is a noticeable presence of IDPs/IDRs, accounting for about 36% of the aging-related dataset, which is however less than the disorder content of the whole human proteome (about 40%). A Gene Ontology analysis of the used here aging proteome reveals an abundance of IDPs/IDRs in one-third of aging-associated processes, especially in genome regulation. Signaling pathways associated with aging also contain IDPs/IDRs on different hierarchical levels, revealing the importance of ""structure-function continuum"" in aging. Protein-protein interaction network analysis showed that IDPs present in different clusters associated with different aging hallmarks. Protein cluster with IDPs enrichment has simultaneously high liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) probability, ""nuclear"" localization and DNA-associated functions, related to aging hallmarks: genomic instability, telomere attrition, epigenetic alterations, and stem cells exhaustion. Intrinsic disorder, LLPS, and aggregation propensity should be considered as features that could be markers of pathogenic proteins. Overall, our analyses indicate that IDPs/IDRs play significant roles in aging-associated processes, particularly in the regulation of DNA functioning. IDP aggregation, which can lead to loss of function and toxicity, could be critically harmful to the cell. A structure-based analysis of aging and the identification of proteins that are particularly susceptible to disturbances can enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of aging and open up new avenues for slowing it down.© 2023.

,37649721,Inflammatory biomarkers and delirium: a Mendelian randomization study.,Front Aging Neurosci,"The association between inflammatory biomarkers and individual delirium symptoms remains controversial in observational studies. We investigated the relationship between inflammatory biomarkers and the risk of developing delirium.A bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) was performed. Genetic instruments associated with peripheral tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin (IL)-1α, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-8, IL-6, soluble IL-6 receptor alpha (sIL-6Rα), and soluble gp130 were identified in three different large summary genome-wide association studies (GWAS) conducted in the European population. Summary-level statistics for delirium not induced by alcohol and other psychoactive substances were obtained from the FinnGen consortium (2,612 cases and 325,306 controls). The estimated causal effects were performed using instruments' variants at the genome-wide significant level (P< 5e-8 andP< 5e-6), applying a linkage disequilibrium clumping approach with a threshold ofr2< 0.001 for each of the exposures. Reverse causation was also performed. The inverse-variance weighted method (IVW), MR-Egger method, weighted median method, MR-Egger regression, and MR Pleiotropy RESidual Sum were used for MR analyses.At the genome-wide significant level (P< 5e-8,r2< 0.001), genetically predicted sIL-6Rα was significantly associated with a decreased risk of delirium with less than three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in all three GWAS data sources (ORWaldratio= 0.89, 95% CI: 0.79-0.96,PWaldratio= 0.0016; ORIVW= 0.88, 95% CI: 0.79-0.97,PIVW= 0.008; ORIVW= 0.88, 95% CI: 0.80-0.96,PIVW= 0.004). The causal relationship between sIL-6Rα and delirium became non-significant when a more liberal threshold ofPof < 5e-6 was applied (allPIVW> 0.05). At the two genome-wide significance levels (P< 5e-8 andP< 5e-6), we found no evidence for the causal effects of peripheral TNF-α, CRP, IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, and soluble gp130 on delirium (allP> 0.05). The MR-Egger intercept and MR-PRESSO results indicated that no SNP had possible pleiotropy (allP> 0.05). Regarding the reverse, no evidence for an effect of delirium on these inflammatory biomarkers could be found (allP> 0.05).The results of this MR analysis did not support that peripheral TNF-α, CRP, IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, sIL-6Rα, soluble gp130, and IL-8 were causally associated with delirium. More research is needed to explore the role of inflammatory factors in the pathogenesis of delirium.Copyright © 2023 Yu, Li, Li and Ge."

At present, many studies are still disputing whether air pollution is associated with primary liver cancer incidence, and it is difficult to draw causal inferences. Therefore, in this study, we used two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) to assess the causal relationship between air pollution (including PM2.5, PM2.5-10, PM10, nitrogen dioxide and nitrogen oxides) and primary liver cancer risk and its related biomarkers (Alpha-fetoprotein, Osteopontin, Glypican-3 and Arginase-1).We used large-scale publicly available genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary data to conduct MR analyses of European and East Asian populations. Inverse variance weighted (IVW) method was used as the main analysis method, and weighted median model, MR-Egger, simple model and weighted model methods were selected for quality control. Heterogeneity was checked by the Cochran's Q test. The MR-Egger regression and the MR-PRESSO global test detect pleiotropy. The sensitivity analysis was performed using the leave-one-out method.Between air pollution and primary liver cancer in either European (PM2.5:p = 0.993; PM2.5-10:p = 0.833; PM10:p = 0.257; nitrogen dioxide:p = 0.215; nitrogen oxides:p = 0.614) or East Asian (PM2.5:p = 0.718; PM2.5-10:p = 0.362; PM10:p = 0.720; nitrogen dioxide:p = 0.101; nitrogen oxides:p = 0.760) populations were found no statistical association. Notably, there was a causal relationship between nitrogen oxides and Arginase-1, a biomarker associated with hepatocellular differentiation, statistically significant associations remained after deletion for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with alcohol intake frequency, Body mass index (BMI) and cancers (Beta: 4.46; 95%CI: 0.83-8.08;p = 0.015). There was no heterogeneity or pleiotropy in the results.This MR study found no evidence to support a causality between air pollution and primary liver cancer in European and East Asian populations, but nitrogen oxides may affect hepatocellular differentiation.Copyright © 2023 Sun, Gao, Luo, Wang, Zhong and Qin."

Here, we investigated the genetic variation underlying aspects of pregnancy-associated bleeding and identified five loci associated with PPH through a meta-analysis of 21,512 cases and 259,500 controls. Functional annotation analysis indicated candidate genes,HAND2,TBX3, andRAP2C/FRMD7,at three loci and showed that at each locus, associated variants were located within binding sites for progesterone receptors (PGR). Furthermore, there were strong genetic correlations with birth weight, gestational duration, and uterine fibroids. Early bleeding during pregnancy (28,898 cases and 302,894 controls) yielded no genome-wide association signals, but showed strong genetic correlation with a variety of human traits, indicative of polygenic and pleiotropic effects. Our results suggest that postpartum bleeding is related to myometrium dysregulation, whereas early bleeding is a complex trait related to underlying health and possibly socioeconomic status."

Mutations and rearrangements on RUNX1 are key drivers of hematological malignancies. In humans, this gene is localized to the 'Down syndrome critical region' of chromosome 21, triplication of which is necessary and sufficient for most phenotypes that characterize Trisomy 21.Individuals with Down syndrome show a higher predisposition to leukemias. Hence, RUNX1 overexpression was initially proposed as a critical player on Down syndrome-associated leukemogenesis. Less is known about the functions of RUNX1 in other tissues and organs, although growing reports show important implications in development or homeostasis of neural tissues, muscle, heart, bone, ovary, or the endothelium, among others. Even less is understood about the consequences on these tissues of RUNX1 gene dosage alterations in the context of Down syndrome. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on RUNX1 activities outside blood/leukemia, while suggesting for the first time their potential relation to specific Trisomy 21 co-occurring conditions.Our concise review on the emerging RUNX1 roles in different tissues outside the hematopoietic context provides a number of well-funded hypotheses that will open new research avenues toward a better understanding of RUNX1-mediated transcription in health and disease, contributing to novel potential diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for Down syndrome-associated conditions.© 2023.

,37601646,Mechanism and clinical evidence of immunotherapy in allergic rhinitis.,Front Allergy,"Allergic rhinitis is a common upper airway disease caused by hypersensitivity to various aeroallergens. It causes increased inflammation throughout the body and may be complicated by other otolaryngological pathologies such as chronic hyperplastic eosinophilic sinusitis, nasal polyposis, and serous otitis media. Allergic rhinitis is an IgE-mediated disease and immunotherapy can be a possible approach for patients to limit the use of antihistamines and corticosteroids. There is evidence that allergen immunotherapy can prevent the development of new sensitizations and reduce the risk of later development of asthma in patients with allergic rhinitis. However, some patients do not benefit from this approach and the efficacy of immunotherapy in reducing the severity and relapse of symptoms is still a matter of debate.

,37601647,"Immunologic, genetic, and ecological interplay of factors involved in allergic diseases.",Front Allergy,"An allergic or type I hypersensitivity reaction involves a misdirected immune overreaction to innocuous environmental and dietary antigens called allergens. The genetic predisposition to allergic disease, referred to as atopy, can be expressed as a variety of manifestations-e.g., allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, atopic dermatitis, allergic asthma, anaphylaxis. Globally, allergic diseases are one the most common types of chronic conditions. Several factors have been identified to contribute to the pathogenesis and progression of the disease, leading to distinctively variable clinical symptoms. The factors which can attenuate or exacerbate allergic reactions can range from genetic heterozygosity, the prominence of various comorbid infections, and other factors such as pollution, climate, and interactions with other organisms and organism-derived products, and the surrounding environment. As a result, the effective prevention and control of allergies remains to be one of the most prominent public health problems. Therefore, to contextualize the current knowledge about allergic reactions, this review paper attempts to synthesize different aspects of an allergic response to describe its significance in the global health scheme. Specifically, the review shall characterize the biomolecular mechanisms of the pathophysiology of the disease based on underlying disease theories and current findings on ecologic interactions and describe prevention and control strategies being utilized. An integrated perspective that considers the underlying genetic, immunologic, and ecologic aspects of the disease would enable the development of more effective and targeted diagnostic tools and therapeutic strategies for the management and control of allergic diseases.© 2023 Falcon and Caoili."
,37627214,NA,NA,"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a hematological disease characterized by the dysfunction of the hematopoietic system that leads to arrest at a specific stage of stem cells development, suppressing the average production of cellular hematologic components. BCP-ALL is a neoplasm of the B-cell lineage progenitor. BCP-ALL is caused and perpetuated by several mechanisms that provide the disease with its tumor potential and genetic and cytological characteristics. These pathological features are used for diagnosis and the prognostication of BCP-ALL. However, most of these paraclinical tools can only be obtained by bone marrow aspiration, which, as it is an invasive study, can delay the diagnosis and follow-up of the disease, in addition to the anesthetic risk it entails for pediatric patients. For this reason, it is crucial to find noninvasive and accessible ways to supply information concerning diagnosis, prognosis, and the monitoring of the disease, such as circulating biomarkers. In oncology, a biomarker is any measurable indicator that demonstrates the presence of malignancy, tumoral behavior, prognosis, or responses to treatments.

,37627481,The Evolution and Ecology of Oxidative and Antioxidant Status: A Comparative Approach in African Mole-Rats.,Antioxidants (Basel),"The naked mole-rat of the family Bathyergidae has been the showpiece for ageing research as they contradict the traditional understanding of the oxidative stress theory of ageing. Some other bathyergids also possess increased lifespans, but there has been a remarkable lack of comparison between species within the family Bathyergidae. This study set out to investigate how plasma oxidative markers (total oxidant status (TOS), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and the oxidative stress index (OSI)) differ between five species and three subspecies of bathyergids, differing in their maximum lifespan potential (MLSP), resting metabolic rate, aridity index (AI), and sociality. We also investigated how oxidative markers may differ between captive and wild-caught mole-rats. Our results reveal that increased TOS, TAC, and OSI are associated with increased MLSP. This pattern is more prevalent in the social-living species than the solitary-living species. We also found that oxidative variables decreased with an increasing AI and that wild-caught individuals typically have higher antioxidants. We speculate that the correlation between higher oxidative markers and MLSP is due to the hypoxia-tolerance of the mole-rats investigated. Hormesis (the biphasic response to oxidative stress promoting protection) is a likely mechanism behind the increased oxidative markers observed and promotes longevity in some members of the Bathyergidae family."
,37628641,NA,NA,"Environmental heat stress triggers a series of compensatory mechanisms in sheep that are dependent on their genetic regulation of thermotolerance. Our objective was to identify genes and regulatory pathways associated with thermotolerance in ewes exposed to heat stress. We performed next-generation RNA sequencing on blood collected from 16 pregnant ewes, which were grouped as tolerant and non-tolerant to heat stress according to a physiological indicator. Additional samples were collected to measure complete blood count. A total of 358 differentially expressed genes were identified after applying selection criteria. Gene expression analysis detected 46 GO terms and 52 KEGG functional pathways. The top-three signaling pathways were p53, RIG-I-like receptor and FoxO, which suggested gene participation in biological processes such as apoptosis, cell signaling and immune response to external stressors. Network analysis revealedATM,ISG15,IRF7,MDM4,DHX58andTGFβR1as over-expressed genes with high regulatory potential. A co-expression network involving the immune-related genesISG15,IRF7andDXH58was detected in lymphocytes and monocytes, which was consistent with hematological findings. In conclusion, transcriptomic analysis revealed a non-viral immune mechanism involving apoptosis, which is induced by external stressors and appears to play an important role in the molecular regulation of heat stress tolerance in ewes."
,37644045,Next generation synthetic memory via intercepting recombinase function.,Nat Commun,"Here we present a technology to facilitate synthetic memory in a living system via repurposing Transcriptional Programming (i.e., our decision-making technology) parts, to regulate (intercept) recombinase function post-translation. We show that interception synthetic memory can facilitate programmable loss-of-function via site-specific deletion, programmable gain-of-function by way of site-specific inversion, and synthetic memory operations with nested Boolean logical operations. We can expand interception synthetic memory capacity more than 5-fold for a single recombinase, with reconfiguration specificity for multiple sites in parallel. Interception synthetic memory is ~10-times faster than previous generations of recombinase-based memory. We posit that the faster recombination speed of our next-generation memory technology is due to the post-translational regulation of recombinase function. This iteration of synthetic memory is complementary to decision-making via Transcriptional Programming - thus can be used to develop intelligent synthetic biological systems for myriad applications.© 2023.

,37575184,CRISPR interference provides increased cell type-specificity compared to the Cre-loxP system.,iScience,"Cre-mediated recombination is frequently used for cell type-specific loss of function (LOF) studies. A major limitation of this system is recombination in unwanted cell types. CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) has been used effectively for global LOF in mice. However, cell type-specific CRISPRi, independent of recombination-based systems, has not been reported. To test the feasibility of cell type-specific CRISPRi, we produced two novel knock-in mouse models that achieve gene suppression when used together: one expressing dCas9::KRAB under the control of a cell type-specific promoter and the other expressing a single guide RNA from a safe harbor locus. We then compared the phenotypes of mice in which the same gene was targeted by either CRISPRi or the Cre-loxP system, with cell specificity conferred byDmp1regulatory elements in both cases. We demonstrate that CRISPRi is effective for cell type-specific LOF and that it provides improved cell type-specificity compared to the Cre-loxP system.© 2023 The Author(s)."
,37573356,The APC/C E3 ligase subunit ANAPC11 mediates FOXO3 protein degradation to promote cell proliferation and lymph node metastasis in urothelial bladder cancer.,Cell Death Dis,"Urothelial bladder cancer (UBC) is one of the most prevalent malignancies worldwide, with striking tumor heterogeneity. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms that can be exploited for the treatment of aggressive UBC is a particularly relevant goal. Protein ubiquitination is a critical post-translational modification (PTM) that mediates the degradation of target protein via the proteasome. However, the roles of aberrant protein ubiquitination in UBC development and the underlying mechanisms by which it drives tumor progression remain unclear. In this study, taking advantage of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated protein (Cas) 9 technology, we identified the ubiquitin E3 ligase ANAPC11, a critical subunit of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), as a potential oncogenic molecule in UBC cells. Our clinical analysis showed that elevated expression of ANAPC11 was significantly correlated with high T stage, positive lymph node (LN) metastasis, and poor outcomes in UBC patients. By employing a series of in vitro experiments, we demonstrated that ANAPC11 enhanced the proliferation and invasiveness of UBC cells, while knockout of ANAPC11 inhibited the growth and LN metastasis of UBC cells in vivo. By conducting immunoprecipitation coupled with mass spectrometry, we confirmed that ANAPC11 increased the ubiquitination level of the Forkhead transcription factor FOXO3. The resulting decrease in FOXO3 protein stability led to the downregulation of the cell cycle regulator p21 and decreased expression of GULP1, a downstream effector of androgen receptor signaling. Taken together, these findings indicated that ANAPC11 plays an oncogenic role in UBC by modulating FOXO3 protein degradation. The ANAPC11-FOXO3 regulatory axis might serve as a novel therapeutic target for UBC.© 2023. The Author(s)."
,37612510,NA,NA,"The prevalence of highly repetitive sequences within the human Y chromosome has prevented its complete assembly to date1and led to its systematic omission from genomic analyses. Here we present de novo assemblies of 43 Y chromosomes spanning 182,900 years of human evolution and report considerable diversity in size and structure. Half of the male-specific euchromatic region is subject to large inversions with a greater than twofold higher recurrence rate compared with all other chromosomes2. Ampliconic sequences associated with these inversions show differing mutation rates that are sequence context dependent, and some ampliconic genes exhibit evidence for concerted evolution with the acquisition and purging of lineage-specific pseudogenes. The largest heterochromatic region in the human genome, Yq12, is composed of alternating repeat arrays that show extensive variation in the number, size and distribution, but retain a 1:1 copy-number ratio. Finally, our data suggest that the boundary between the recombining pseudoautosomal region 1 and the non-recombining portions of the X and Y chromosomes lies 500 kb away from the currently established1boundary. The availability of fully sequence-resolved Y chromosomes from multiple individuals provides a unique opportunity for identifying new associations of traits with specific Y-chromosomal variants and garnering insights into the evolution and function of complex regions of the human genome.© 2023.

,37580559,UniAligner: a parameter-free framework for fast sequence alignment.,Nat Methods,"Even though the recent advances in 'complete genomics' revealed the previously inaccessible genomic regions, analysis of variations in centromeres and other extra-long tandem repeats (ETRs) faces an algorithmic challenge since there are currently no tools for accurate sequence comparison of ETRs. Counterintuitively, the classical alignment approaches, such as the Smith-Waterman algorithm, fail to construct biologically adequate alignments of ETRs. We present UniAligner-the parameter-free sequence alignment algorithm with sequence-dependent alignment scoring that automatically changes for any pair of compared sequences. UniAligner prioritizes matches of rare substrings that are more likely to be relevant to the evolutionary relationship between two sequences. We apply UniAligner to estimate the mutation rates in human centromeres, and quantify the extremely high rate of large duplications and deletions in centromeres. This high rate suggests that centromeres may represent some of the most rapidly evolving regions of the human genome with respect to their structural organization.© 2023.

Their biological functions in innate immunity, as well as their structure and activity relationships, along with their mechanisms of action and therapeutic potential, have been of great interest in recent years. To highlight the key research into the role of defensins in human and animal health, we first describe their research history, structural features, evolution, and antimicrobial mechanisms. Next, we cover the role of defensins in immune homeostasis, chemotaxis, mucosal barrier function, gut microbiota regulation, intestinal development and regulation of cell death. Further, we discuss their clinical relevance and therapeutic potential in various diseases, including infectious disease, inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes and obesity, chronic inflammatory lung disease, periodontitis and cancer. Finally, we summarize the current knowledge regarding the nutrient-dependent regulation of defensins, including fatty acids, amino acids, microelements, plant extracts, and probiotics, while considering the clinical application of such regulation. Together, the review summarizes the various biological functions, mechanism of actions and potential clinical significance of defensins, along with the challenges in developing defensins-based therapy, thus providing crucial insights into their biology and potential clinical utility.© 2023.

,37546784,Efficient Formation of Single-copy Human Artificial Chromosomes.,bioRxiv,"Large DNA assembly methodologies underlie milestone achievements in synthetic prokaryotic and budding yeast chromosomes. While budding yeast control chromosome inheritance through ∼125 bp DNA sequence-defined centromeres, mammals and many other eukaryotes use large, epigenetic centromeres. Harnessing centromere epigenetics permits human artificial chromosome (HAC) formation but is not sufficient to avoid rampant multimerization of the initial DNA molecule upon introduction to cells. Here, we describe an approach that efficiently forms single-copy HACs. It employs a ∼750 kb construct that is sufficiently large to house the distinct chromatin types present at the inner and outer centromere, obviating the need to multimerize. Delivery to mammalian cells is streamlined by employing yeast spheroplast fusion. These developments permit faithful chromosome engineering in the context of metazoan cells.A quarter century after the first human artificial chromosomes, a solution to their uncontrolled multimerization is achieved."
,37541261,Centromere Plasticity With Evolutionary Conservation and Divergence Uncovered by Wheat 10+ Genomes.,Mol Biol Evol,"Centromeres (CEN) are the chromosomal regions that play a crucial role in maintaining genomic stability. The underlying highly repetitive DNA sequences can evolve quickly in most eukaryotes, and promote karyotype evolution. Despite their variability, it is not fully understood how these widely variable sequences ensure the homeostasis of centromere function. In this study, we investigated the genetics and epigenetics of CEN in a population of wheat lines from global breeding programs. We captured a high degree of sequences, positioning, and epigenetic variations in the large and complex wheat CEN. We found that most CENH3-associated repeats are Cereba element of retrotransposons and exhibit phylogenetic homogenization across different wheat lines, but the less-associated repeat sequences diverge on their own way in each wheat line, implying specific mechanisms for selecting certain repeat types as functional core CEN. Furthermore, we observed that CENH3 nucleosome structures display looser wrapping of DNA termini on complex centromeric repeats, including the repositioned CEN. We also found that strict CENH3 nucleosome positioning and intrinsic DNA features play a role in determining centromere identity among different lines. Specific non-B form DNAs were substantially associated with CENH3 nucleosomes for the repositioned centromeres. These findings suggest that multiple mechanisms were involved in the adaptation of CENH3 nucleosomes that can stabilize CEN. Ultimately, we proposed a remarkable epigenetic plasticity of centromere chromatin within the diverse genomic context, and the high robustness is crucial for maintaining centromere function and genome stability in wheat 10+ lines as a result of past breeding selections.© The Author(s) 2023.

,37660182,NA,NA,"Tumour progression and therapy tolerance are highly regulated and complex processes largely dependent on the plasticity of cancer cells and their capacity to respond to stress. The higher plasticity of cancer cells highlights the need for identifying targetable molecular pathways that challenge cancer cell survival. Here, we show that N7-guanosine methylation (m7G) of tRNAs, mediated by METTL1, regulates survival to stress conditions in cancer cells. Mechanistically, we find that m7G in tRNAs protects them from stress-induced cleavage and processing into 5' tRNA fragments. Our analyses reveal that the loss of tRNA m7G methylation activates stress response pathways, sensitising cancer cells to stress. Furthermore, we find that the loss of METTL1 reduces tumour growth and increases cytotoxic stress in vivo. Our study uncovers the role of m7G methylation of tRNAs in stress responses and highlights the potential of targeting METTL1 to sensitise cancer cells to chemotherapy.© 2023. The Author(s)."
,37644165,Aged hematopoietic stem cells entrap regulatory T cells to create a prosurvival microenvironment.,Cell Mol Immunol,"Although DNA mutation drives stem cell aging, how mutation-accumulated stem cells obtain clonal advantage during aging remains poorly understood. Here, using a mouse model of irradiation-induced premature aging and middle-aged mice, we show that DNA mutation accumulation in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) during aging upregulates their surface expression of major histocompatibility complex class II (MHCII). MHCII upregulation increases the chance for recognition by bone marrow (BM)-resident regulatory T cells (Tregs), resulting in their clonal expansion and accumulation in the HSC niche. On the basis of the establishment of connexin 43 (Cx43)-mediated gap junctions, BM Tregs transfer cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) to aged HSCs to diminish apoptotic priming and promote their survival via activation of protein kinase A (PKA) signaling. Importantly, targeting the HSC-Treg interaction or depleting Tregs effectively prevents the premature/physiological aging of HSCs. These findings show that aged HSCs use an active self-protective mechanism by entrapping local Tregs to construct a prosurvival niche and obtain a clonal advantage.© 2023.

,37626896,NA,NA,"Since Joseph Altman published his pioneering work demonstrating neurogenesis in the hippocampus of adult rats, the number of publications in this field increased exponentially. Today, we know that the adult hippocampus harbors a pool of adult neural stem cells (NSCs) that are the source of life-long neurogenesis and plasticity. The functions of these NSCs are regulated by extrinsic cues arising from neighboring cells and the systemic environment. However, this tight regulation is subject to imbalance with age, resulting in a decline in adult NSCs and neurogenesis, which contributes to the progressive deterioration of hippocampus-related cognitive functions. Despite extensive investigation, the mechanisms underlying this age-related decline in neurogenesis are only incompletely understood, but appear to include an increase in NSC quiescence, changes in differentiation patterns, and NSC exhaustion. In this review, we summarize recent work that has improved our knowledge of hippocampal NSC aging, focusing on NSC-intrinsic mechanisms as well as cellular and molecular changes in the niche and systemic environment that might be involved in the age-related decline in NSC functions. Additionally, we identify future directions that may advance our understanding of NSC aging and the concomitant loss of hippocampal neurogenesis and plasticity."
,37621775,Lessons in aging from Myc knockout mouse models.,Front Cell Dev Biol,"DespiteMYCbeing among the most intensively studied oncogenes, its role in normal development has not been determined asMyc-/-mice do not survival beyond mid-gestation.Myc± mice live longer than their wild-type counterparts and are slower to accumulate many age-related phenotypes. However,Mychaplo-insufficiency likely conceals other important phenotypes as many high-affinity Myc targets genes continue to be regulated normally. By delayingMycinactivation until after birth it has recently been possible to study the consequences of its near-complete total body loss and thus to infer its normal function. Against expectation, these""MycKO"" mice lived significantly longer than control wild-type mice but manifested a marked premature aging phenotype. This seemingly paradoxical behavior was potentially explained by a >3-fold lower lifetime incidence of cancer, normally the most common cause of death in mice and often Myc-driven.Mycloss accelerated the accumulation of numerous ""Aging Hallmarks"", including the loss of mitochondrial and ribosomal structural and functional integrity, the generation of reactive oxygen species, the acquisition of genotoxic damage, the detrimental rewiring of metabolism and the onset of senescence. In both mice and humans, normal aging in many tissues was accompaniued by the downregulation of Myc and the loss of Myc target gene regulation. Unlike most mouse models of premature aging, which are based on monogenic disorders of DNA damage recognition and repair, theMycKO mouse model directly impacts most Aging Hallmarks and may therefore more faithfully replicate the normal aging process of both mice and humans. It further establishes that the strong association between aging and cancer can be genetically separated and is maintained by a single gene.Copyright © 2023 Prochownik and Wang."

IL-6 receptor blockade by tocilizumab (anti-IL6R; Actemra) is used globally for the treatment of severe COVID-19, yet a molecular understanding of the therapeutic benefit remains unclear. We characterized the immune profile and identified cellular and molecular pathways modified by tocilizumab in peripheral blood samples from patients enrolled in the COVACTA study, a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19. We identified markers of inflammation, lymphopenia, myeloid dysregulation, and organ injury that predict disease severity and clinical outcomes. Proteomic analysis confirmed a pharmacodynamic effect for tocilizumab and identified novel pharmacodynamic biomarkers. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that tocilizumab treatment leads to faster resolution of lymphopenia and myeloid dysregulation associated with severe COVID-19, indicating greater anti-inflammatory activity relative to placebo and potentially leading to faster recovery in patients hospitalized with COVID-19.© 2023 The Authors."

,37559109,The specific DNA methylation landscape in focal cortical dysplasia ILAE type 3D.,Acta Neuropathol Commun,"Focal Cortical Dysplasia (FCD) is a frequent cause of drug-resistant focal epilepsy in children and young adults. The international FCD classifications of 2011 and 2022 have identified several clinico-pathological subtypes, either occurring isolated, i.e., FCD ILAE Type 1 or 2, or in association with a principal cortical lesion, i.e., FCD Type 3. Here, we addressed the DNA methylation signature of a previously described new subtype of FCD 3D occurring in the occipital lobe of very young children and microscopically defined by neuronal cell loss in cortical layer 4. We studied the DNA methylation profile using 850 K BeadChip arrays in a retrospective cohort of 104 patients with FCD 1 A, 2 A, 2B, 3D, TLE without FCD, and 16 postmortem specimens without neurological disorders as controls, operated in China or Germany. DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue blocks with microscopically confirmed lesions, and DNA methylation profiles were bioinformatically analyzed with a recently developed deep learning algorithm. Our results revealed a distinct position of FCD 3D in the DNA methylation map of common FCD subtypes, also different from non-FCD epilepsy surgery controls or non-epileptic postmortem controls. Within the FCD 3D cohort, the DNA methylation signature separated three histopathology subtypes, i.e., glial scarring around porencephalic cysts, loss of layer 4, and Rasmussen encephalitis. Differential methylation in FCD 3D with loss of layer 4 mapped explicitly to biological pathways related to neurodegeneration, biogenesis of the extracellular matrix (ECM) components, axon guidance, and regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. Our data suggest that DNA methylation signatures in cortical malformations are not only of diagnostic value but also phenotypically relevant, providing the molecular underpinnings of structural and histopathological features associated with epilepsy. Further studies will be necessary to confirm these results and clarify their functional relevance and epileptogenic potential in these difficult-to-treat children.© 2023.

Though the mechanisms behind how fibroblasts participate in homeostasis and pathology are just beginning to be understood, these cells are believed to be highly dynamic and play key roles in fibrosis and remodeling. Focusing primarily on fibroblasts within the skin and during wound healing, we describe the field's current understanding of fibroblast heterogeneity in form and function. From differences due to embryonic origins to anatomical variations, we explore the diverse contributions that fibroblasts have in fibrosis and plasticity. Following this, we describe molecular techniques used in the field to provide deeper insights into subpopulations of fibroblasts and their varied roles in complex processes such as wound healing. Limitations to current work are also discussed, with a focus on future directions that investigators are recommended to take in order to gain a deeper understanding of fibroblast biology and to develop potential targets for translational applications in a clinical setting."

Research in this field over the past 30 years has greatly improved our understanding of this disease and formed the basis of improved strategies to improve the health of mothers and their babies. Despite this progress, gestational and preexisting diabetes continue to have significant effects on both short- and long-term health of mothers and their offspring. In this article, I provide an overview of the work that my colleagues and I have done to advance the knowledge base around diabetes and pregnancy in four areas: 1) diabetes risk after gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), including racial and ethnic disparities; 2) the pathophysiology of GDM and subsequent diabetes in Hispanic women; 3) diabetes prevention and β-cell preservation following GDM; and 4) evidence for multiple potential developmental effects in offspring that vary according to the timing of exposure and severity of maternal diabetes during pregnancy. This research continues the legacy of Norbert Freinkel and the concepts that he contributed to the field of diabetes and pregnancy.

,37612705,"Emergence and influence of sequence bias in evolutionarily malleable, mammalian tandem arrays.",BMC Biol,"The radiation of mammals at the extinction of the dinosaurs produced a plethora of new forms-as diverse as bats, dolphins, and elephants-in only 10-20 million years. Behind the scenes, adaptation to new niches is accompanied by extensive innovation in large families of genes that allow animals to contact the environment, including chemosensors, xenobiotic enzymes, and immune and barrier proteins. Genes in these ""outward-looking"" families are allelically diverse among humans and exhibit tissue-specific and sometimes stochastic expression.Here, we show that these tandem arrays of outward-looking genes occupy AT-biased isochores and comprise the ""tissue-specific"" gene class that lack CpG islands in their promoters. Models of mammalian genome evolution have not incorporated the sharply different functions and transcriptional patterns of genes in AT- versus GC-biased regions. To examine the relationship between gene family expansion, sequence content, and allelic diversity, we use population genetic data and comparative analysis. First, we find that AT bias can emerge during evolutionary expansion of gene families in cis. Second, human genes in AT-biased isochores or with GC-poor promoters experience relatively low rates of de novo point mutation today but are enriched for non-synonymous variants. Finally, we find that isochores containing gene clusters exhibit low rates of recombination.Our analyses suggest that tolerance of non-synonymous variation and low recombination are two forces that have produced the depletion of GC bases in outward-facing gene arrays. In turn, high AT content exerts a profound effect on their chromatin organization and transcriptional regulation.© 2023. BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature."
,37488355,NA,NA,"In mammals, only the zygote and blastomeres of the early embryo are totipotent. This totipotency is mirrored in vitro by mouse '2-cell-like cells' (2CLCs), which appear at low frequency in cultures of embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Because totipotency is not completely understood, we carried out a genome-wide CRISPR knockout screen in mouse ESCs, searching for mutants that reactivate the expression of Dazl, a gene expressed in 2CLCs. Here we report the identification of four mutants that reactivate Dazl and a broader 2-cell-like signature: the E3 ubiquitin ligase adaptor SPOP, the Zinc-Finger transcription factor ZBTB14, MCM3AP, a component of the RNA processing complex TREX-2, and the lysine demethylase KDM5C. All four factors function upstream of DPPA2 and DUX, but not via p53. In addition, SPOP binds DPPA2, and KDM5C interacts with ncPRC1.6 and inhibits 2CLC gene expression in a catalytic-independent manner.

,37466164,NA,NA,"In recent years, quantitative mass spectrometry-based interaction proteomics technology has proven very useful in identifying specific DNA-protein interactions using single pull-downs from crude lysates. Here, we applied a SILAC/TMT-based higher-order multiplexing approach to develop an interaction proteomics workflow called Protein-nucleic acid Affinity and Specificity quantification by MAss spectrometry in Nuclear extracts or PASMAN. In PASMAN, DNA pull-downs using a concentration range of specific and control DNA baits are performed in SILAC-labeled nuclear extracts. MS1-based quantification to determine specific DNA-protein interactions is then combined with sequential TMT-based quantification of fragmented SILAC peptides, allowing the generation of Hill-like curves and determination of apparent binding affinities. We benchmarked PASMAN using the SP/KLF motif and further applied it to gain insights into two CGCG-containing consensus DNA motifs. These motifs are recognized by two BEN domain-containing proteins, BANP and BEND3, which we find to interact with these motifs with distinct affinities. Finally, we profiled the BEND3 proximal proteome, revealing the NuRD complex as the major BEND3 proximal protein complex in vivo. In summary, PASMAN represents, to our knowledge, the first higher-order multiplexing-based interaction proteomics method that can be used to decipher specific DNA-protein interactions and their apparent affinities in various biological and pathological contexts."

Here, a single-cell transcriptome dataset of chondrocytes is used to explore the synergistic and communicative patterns of different chondrocyte subtypes. We collected 1600 chondrocytes from 10 patients with osteoarthritis and analyzed the active communication patterns for the first time based on network analysis and pattern recognition at the single-cell level. Manifold learning and quantitative contrasts were performed to analyze conserved and specific communication pathways. We found that ProCs (Proliferative chondrocytes), ECs (Effector chondrocytes), preHTCs (Prehypertrophic chondrocytes), HTCs (Hypertrophic chondrocytes), and FCs (Fibrocartilage chondrocytes) are more active in incoming and outgoing signaling patterns, which is consistent with studies on their close functional cooperation. Among them, preHTCs play multiple roles in chondrocyte communication, and ProCs and preHTCs have many overlapping pathways. These two subtypes are the most active among all chondrocyte subtypes. Interestingly, ECs and FCs are a pair of ""mutually exclusive"" subtypes, of which ECs are predominant in incoming patterns and FCs in outgoing patterns. The active signaling pathways of ECs and FCs largely do not overlap. COLLAGEN and LAMININ are the main pivotal pathways, which means they are very important in the repair and expansion of joint homeostasis. Notably, only preHTCs assume multiple roles (including sender, receiver, mediator, and influencer) and are involved in multiple communication pathways. We have examined their communication patterns from the perspective of cellular interactions, revealed the relationships among different chondrocyte subtypes, and, in particular, identified a number of active subtypes and pathways that are important for targeted therapy in the osteoarthritic microenvironment. Our findings provide a new research paradigm and new insights into understanding chondrocyte activity patterns in the osteoarthritic microenvironment.© 2023. Springer Nature Limited."

In addition, current snATAC-seq data present statistical difficulties due to their sparsity and variations in individual sequence capture. To address these problems, we present a zero-adjusted statistical model, PACS, that can allow complex hypothesis testing of factors that affect accessibility while accounting for sparse and incomplete data. For differential accessibility analysis, PACS controls the false positive rate and achieves on average a 17% to 122% higher power than existing tools.

,37574486,Analysis of Copy Number Variation of DNA Repair/Damage Response Genes in Tumor Tissues.,Methods Mol Biol,"Cells experience increased genome instability through the course of disease development including cancer initiation and progression. Point mutations, insertion/deletions, translocations, and amplifications of both coding and noncoding regions all contribute to cancer phenotypes. Copy number variation (CNV), i.e., changes of the number of copies of nuclear DNA, occurs in the genome of even normal somatic cells. Studies to understand the effects of CNV on tumor development, especially aspects concerning tumor aggressiveness and the influence on outcomes of therapeutic modalities, have been reignited by the breakthrough technologies of the molecular genomics. This section discusses the significance of analyzing CNVs that cause simultaneous increase/decrease of clusters of genes, using the expression profile of XRCC1 with its neighbor genes LIG1, PNKP, and POLD1 as an example. Methods for CNV assay at the individual gene level on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues using the NanoString nCounter technology will then be described.© 2023.

Detailed data from questionnaires and physical measurements were collected at baseline, with additional measurements at three resurveys involving ∼5% of surviving participants. Analyses of genome-wide genotyping, for >100,000 participants using custom-designed Axiom arrays, reveal extensive relatedness, recent consanguinity, and signatures reflecting large-scale population movements from recent Chinese history. Systematic genome-wide association studies of incident disease, captured through electronic linkage to death and disease registries and to the national health insurance system, replicate established disease loci and identify 14 novel disease associations. Together with studies of candidate drug targets and disease risk factors and contributions to international genetics consortia, these demonstrate the breadth, depth, and quality of the CKB data. Ongoing high-throughput omics assays of collected biosamples and planned whole-genome sequencing will further enhance the scientific value of this biobank.© 2023 The Authors."

Emerging evidence points to the importance of LLPS in human health and diseases. Nevertheless, despite recent advancements, our knowledge of the molecular relationship between LLPS and diseases is frequently incomplete. In this review, we outline our current understanding about how aberrant LLPS affects developmental disorders, tandem repeat disorders, cancers and viral infection. We also examine disease mechanisms driven by aberrant condensates, and highlight potential treatment approaches. This study seeks to expand our understanding of LLPS by providing a valuable new paradigm for understanding phase separation and human disorders, as well as to further translate our current knowledge regarding LLPS into therapeutic discoveries."
,37464880,Sequence variations of phase-separating proteins and resources for studying biomolecular condensates.,Acta Biochim Biophys Sin (Shanghai),"Phase separation (PS) is an important mechanism underlying the formation of biomolecular condensates. Physiological condensates are associated with numerous biological processes, such as transcription, immunity, signaling, and synaptic transmission. Changes in particular amino acids or segments can disturb the protein's phase behavior and interactions with other biomolecules in condensates. It is thus presumed that variations in the phase-separating-prone domains can significantly impact the properties and functions of condensates. The dysfunction of condensates contributes to a number of pathological processes. Pharmacological perturbation of these condensates is proposed as a promising way to restore physiological states. In this review, we characterize the variations observed in PS proteins that lead to aberrant biomolecular compartmentalization. We also showcase recent advancements in bioinformatics of membraneless organelles (MLOs), focusing on available databases useful for screening PS proteins and describing endogenous condensates, guiding researchers to seek the underlying pathogenic mechanisms of biomolecular condensates."
,37428142,Accelerating bioinformatics implementation in public health.,Microb Genom,"We have adopted an open bioinformatics ecosystem to address the challenges of bioinformatics implementation in public health laboratories (PHLs). Bioinformatics implementation for public health requires practitioners to undertake standardized bioinformatic analyses and generate reproducible, validated and auditable results. It is essential that data storage and analysis are scalable, portable and secure, and that implementation of bioinformatics fits within the operational constraints of the laboratory. We address these requirements using Terra, a web-based data analysis platform with a graphical user interface connecting users to bioinformatics analyses without the use of code. We have developed bioinformatics workflows for use with Terra that specifically meet the needs of public health practitioners. These Theiagen workflows perform genome assembly, quality control, and characterization, as well as construction of phylogeny for insights into genomic epidemiology. Additonally, these workflows use open-source containerized software and the WDL workflow language to ensure standardization and interoperability with other bioinformatics solutions, whilst being adaptable by the user. They are all open source and publicly available in Dockstore with the version-controlled code available in public GitHub repositories. They have been written to generate outputs in standardized file formats to allow for further downstream analysis and visualization with separate genomic epidemiology software. Testament to this solution meeting the requirements for bioinformatic implementation in public health, Theiagen workflows have collectively been used for over 5 million sample analyses in the last 2 years by over 90 public health laboratories in at least 40 different countries. Continued adoption of technological innovations and development of further workflows will ensure that this ecosystem continues to benefit PHLs."
,37639434,Prediction of DNA Methylation based on Multi-dimensional feature encoding and double convolutional fully connected convolutional neural network.,PLoS Comput Biol,"DNA methylation takes on critical significance to the regulation of gene expression by affecting the stability of DNA and changing the structure of chromosomes. DNA methylation modification sites should be identified, which lays a solid basis for gaining more insights into their biological functions. Existing machine learning-based methods of predicting DNA methylation have not fully exploited the hidden multidimensional information in DNA gene sequences, such that the prediction accuracy of models is significantly limited. Besides, most models have been built in terms of a single methylation type. To address the above-mentioned issues, a deep learning-based method was proposed in this study for DNA methylation site prediction, termed the MEDCNN model. The MEDCNN model is capable of extracting feature information from gene sequences in three dimensions (i.e., positional information, biological information, and chemical information). Moreover, the proposed method employs a convolutional neural network model with double convolutional layers and double fully connected layers while iteratively updating the gradient descent algorithm using the cross-entropy loss function to increase the prediction accuracy of the model. Besides, the MEDCNN model can predict different types of DNA methylation sites. As indicated by the experimental results,the deep learning method based on coding from multiple dimensions outperformed single coding methods, and the MEDCNN model was highly applicable and outperformed existing models in predicting DNA methylation between different species. As revealed by the above-described findings, the MEDCNN model can be effective in predicting DNA methylation sites.Copyright: © 2023 Hu et al.

,37664640,Machine learning reveals genetic modifiers of the immune microenvironment of cancer.,iScience,"Heritability in the immune tumor microenvironment (iTME) has been widely observed yet remains largely uncharacterized. Here, we developed a machine learning approach to map iTME modifiers within loci from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) for breast cancer (BrCa) incidence. A random forest model was trained on a positive set of immune-oncology (I-O) targets, and then used to assign I-O target probability scores to 1,362 candidate genes in linkage disequilibrium with 155 BrCa GWAS loci. Cluster analysis of the most probable candidates revealed two subfamilies of genes related to effector functions and adaptive immune responses, suggesting that iTME modifiers impact multiple aspects of anticancer immunity. Two of the top ranking BrCa candidates,LSP1andTLR1, were orthogonally validated as iTME modifiers using BrCa patient biopsies and comparative mapping studies, respectively. Collectively, these data demonstrate a robust and flexible framework for functionally fine-mapping GWAS risk loci to identify translatable therapeutic targets.© 2023 The Author(s)."
,37655340,Mendelian randomization supports causality between gut microbiota and chronic hepatitis B.,Front Microbiol,"Observational studies have provided evidence of a close association between gut microbiota and the progression of chronic hepatitis B (CHB). However, establishing a causal relationship between gut microbiota and CHB remains a subject of investigation.Genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary data of gut microbiota came from the MiBioGen consortium, while the GWAS summary data of CHB came from the Medical Research Council Integrative Epidemiology Unit (IEU) Open GWAS project. Based on the maximum likelihood (ML), Mendelian randomization (MR)-Egger regression, inverse variance weighted (IVW), MR Pleiotropy RESidual Sum and Outlier (MR-PRESSO), and weighted-mode and weighted-median methods, we conducted a bidirectional, two-sample, MR analysis to explore the causal relationship between the gut microbiota and CHB. Additionally, we evaluated the genetic associations between individual gut microbes and CHB using the Linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC) program.According to the IVW method estimates, genetically predicted class Alphaproteobacteria (odds ratio [OR] = 0.57; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.34-0.96; false discovery rate [FDR] = 0.046), genusFamily XIII AD3011group (OR = 0.60; 95% CI, 0.39-0.91; FDR = 0.026), genusPrevotella 7(OR = 0.73; 95% CI, 0.56-0.94; FDR = 0.022) exhibited a protective effect against CHB. On the other hand, family Family XIII (OR = 1.79; 95% CI, 1.03-3.12; FDR = 0.061), genusEggerthellagroup (OR = 1.34; 95% CI, 1.04-1.74; FDR = 0.043), genusEubacterium ventriosumgroup (OR = 1.59; 95% CI, 1.01-2.51; FDR = 0.056), genusHoldemania(OR = 1.35; 95% CI, 1.00-1.82; FDR = 0.049), and genusRuminococcus gauvreauiigroup (OR = 1.69; 95% CI, 1.10-2.61; FDR = 0.076) were associated with an increased risk of CHB. The results from LDSC also indicated a significant genetic correlation between most of the aforementioned gut microbiota and CHB. Our reverse MR analysis demonstrated no causal relationship between genetically predicted CHB and gut microbiota, and we observed no significant horizontal pleiotropy or heterogeneity of instrumental variables (IVs).In this study, we identified three types of gut microbiota with a protective effect on CHB and five types with an adverse impact on CHB. We postulate that this information will facilitate the clinical prevention and treatment of CHB through fecal microbiota transplantation.Copyright © 2023 Zhang, Zhou, Zhang, Mao and Zhang."
,37612393,NA,NA,"The substantial investments in human genetics and genomics made over the past three decades were anticipated to result in many innovative therapies. Here we investigate the extent to which these expectations have been met, excluding cancer treatments. In our search, we identified 40 germline genetic observations that led directly to new targets and subsequently to novel approved therapies for 36 rare and 4 common conditions. The median time between genetic target discovery and drug approval was 25 years. Most of the genetically driven therapies for rare diseases compensate for disease-causing loss-of-function mutations. The therapies approved for common conditions are all inhibitors designed to pharmacologically mimic the natural, disease-protective effects of rare loss-of-function variants. Large biobank-based genetic studies have the power to identify and validate a large number of new drug targets. Genetics can also assist in the clinical development phase of drugs-for example, by selecting individuals who are most likely to respond to investigational therapies. This approach to drug development requires investments into large, diverse cohorts of deeply phenotyped individuals with appropriate consent for genetically assisted trials. A robust framework that facilitates responsible, sustainable benefit sharing will be required to capture the full potential of human genetics and genomics and bring effective and safe innovative therapies to patients quickly.© 2023.

,37601974,NA,NA,"Stroke is the second leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Stroke prevalence varies by sex and ancestry, possibly due to genetic heterogeneity between subgroups. We performed a genome-wide meta-analysis of 16 biobanks across multiple ancestries to study the genetics of ischemic stroke (60,176 cases, 1,310,725 controls) as part of the Global Biobank Meta-analysis Initiative (GBMI) and further combined the results with previously published MegaStroke. Five novel loci for ischemic stroke (LAMC1,CALCRL,PLSCR1,CDKN1A, andSWAP70) were identified after replication in four additional datasets. One previously reported locus showed significant ancestry heterogeneity (ABO), and one showed significant sex heterogeneity (ALDH2). TheALDH2association was male specific (males p = 1.67e-24, females p = 0.126) and was additionally observed only in the East Asian ancestry (male) samples. These findings emphasize the need for more diverse datasets with large sample sizes to further understand the genetic predisposition of stroke in different ancestry and sex groups.© 2023 The Authors."
,37596272,LINC02015 modulates the cell proliferation and apoptosis of aortic vascular smooth muscle cells by transcriptional regulation and protein interaction network.,Cell Death Discov,"Long intergenic nonprotein coding RNA 2015 (LINC02015) is a long non-coding RNA that has been found elevated in various cell proliferation-related diseases. However, the functions and interactive mechanism of LINC02015 remain unknown. This study aimed to explore the role of LINC02015 in the cell proliferation and apoptosis of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) to explain the pathogenesis of aortic diseases. Ascending aorta samples and angiotensin-II (AT-II) treated primary human aortic VSMCs (HAVSMCs) were used to evaluate the LINC02015 expression. RNA sequencing, chromatin isolation by RNA purification sequencing, RNA pull-down, and mass spectrometry (MS) were applied to explore the potential interacting mechanisms. LINC02015 expression was found elevated in aortic dissection and AT-II-treated HAVSMCs. Cell proliferation and cell cycle were activated in HAVSMCs with LINC02015 knockdown. The cyclins family and caspase family were found to participate in regulating the cell cycle and apoptosis via the NF-κB signaling pathway. RXRA was discovered as a possible hub gene for LINC02015 transcriptional regulating networks. Besides, the protein interaction network of LINC02015 was revealed with candidate regulating molecules. It was concluded that the knockdown of LINC02015 could promote cell proliferation and inhibit the apoptosis of HAVSMCs through an RXRA-related transcriptional regulation network, which could provide a potential therapeutic target for aortic diseases.© 2023.

,37546732,Association study of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) variants and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.,medRxiv,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic interstitial pneumonia marked by progressive lung fibrosis and a poor prognosis. Recent studies have highlighted the potential role of infection in the pathogenesis of IPF and a prior association of theHLA-DQB1gene with idiopathic fibrotic interstitial pneumonia (including IPF) has been reported. Due to the important role that the Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) region plays in the immune response, here we evaluated if HLA genetic variation was associated specifically with IPF risk.We performed a meta-analysis of associations of the HLA region with IPF risk in individuals of European ancestry from seven independent case-control studies of IPF (comprising a total of 5,159 cases and 27,459 controls, including the prior study of fibrotic interstitial pneumonia). Single nucleotide polymorphisms, classical HLA alleles and amino acids were analysed and signals meeting a region-wide association thresholdp<4.5×10-4and a posterior probability of replication >90% were considered significant. We sought to replicate the previously reportedHLA-DQB1association in the subset of studies independent of the original report.The meta-analysis of all seven studies identified four significant independent single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with IPF risk. However, none met the posterior probability for replication criterion. TheHLA-DQB1association was not replicated in the independent IPF studies.Variation in the HLA region was not consistently associated with risk in studies of IPF. However, this does not preclude the possibility that other genomic regions linked to the immune response may be involved in the aetiology of IPF."

Pathology reports are routinely generated, more nuanced than structured data, and contain added insight from pathologists. However, there are no publicly-available datasets for benchmarking report-based models. Two recent advances suggest the urgent need for a benchmark dataset. First, improved optical character recognition (OCR) techniques will make it possible to access older pathology reports in an automated way, increasing data available for analysis. Second, recent improvements in natural language processing (NLP) techniques using AI allow more accurate prediction of clinical targets from text. We apply state-of-the-art OCR and customized post- processing to publicly available report PDFs from The Cancer Genome Atlas, generating a machine-readable corpus of 9,523 reports. We perform a proof-of-principle cancer-type classification across 32 tissues, achieving 0.992 average AU-ROC.

,37603131,Magnetic resonance-based imaging biopsy with signatures including topological Betti number features for prediction of primary brain metastatic sites.,Phys Eng Sci Med,"This study incorporated topology Betti number (BN) features into the prediction of primary sites of brain metastases and the construction of magnetic resonance-based imaging biopsy (MRB) models. The significant features of the MRB model were selected from those obtained from gray-scale and three-dimensional wavelet-filtered images, BN and inverted BN (iBN) maps, and clinical variables (age and gender). The primary sites were predicted as either lung cancer or other cancers using MRB models, which were built using seven machine learning methods with significant features chosen by three feature selection methods followed by a combination strategy. Our study dealt with a dataset with relatively smaller brain metastases, which included effective diameters greater than 2 mm, with metastases ranging from 2 to 9 mm accounting for 17% of the dataset. The MRB models were trained by T1-weighted contrast-enhanced images of 494 metastases chosen from 247 patients and applied to 115 metastases from 62 test patients. The most feasible model attained an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.763 for the test patients when using a signature including features of BN and iBN maps, gray-scale and wavelet-filtered images, and clinical variables. The AUCs of the model were 0.744 for non-small cell lung cancer and 0.861 for small cell lung cancer. The results suggest that the BN signature boosted the performance of MRB for the identification of primary sites of brain metastases including small tumors.© 2023.

,37588985,Identification of fibroblast-related genes based on single-cell and machine learning to predict the prognosis and endocrine metabolism of pancreatic cancer.,Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),"Single-cell sequencing technology has become an indispensable tool in tumor mechanism and heterogeneity studies. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) lacks early specific symptoms, and comprehensive bioinformatics analysis for PAAD contributes to the developmental mechanisms.We performed dimensionality reduction analysis on the single-cell sequencing data GSE165399 of PAAD to obtain the specific cell clusters. We then obtained cell cluster-associated gene modules by weighted co-expression network analysis and identified tumorigenesis-associated cell clusters and gene modules in PAAD by trajectory analysis. Tumor-associated genes of PAAD were intersected with cell cluster marker genes and within the signature module to obtain genes associated with PAAD occurrence to construct a prognostic risk assessment tool by the COX model. The performance of the model was assessed by the Kaplan-Meier (K-M) curve and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The score of endocrine pathways was assessed by ssGSEA analysis.The PAAD single-cell dataset GSE165399 was filtered and downscaled, and finally, 17 cell subgroups were filtered and 17 cell clusters were labeled. WGCNA analysis revealed that the brown module was most associated with tumorigenesis. Among them, the brown module was significantly associated with C11 and C14 cell clusters. C11 and C14 cell clusters belonged to fibroblast and circulating fetal cells, respectively, and trajectory analysis showed low heterogeneity for fibroblast and extremely high heterogeneity for circulating fetal cells. Next, through differential analysis, we found that genes within the C11 cluster were highly associated with tumorigenesis. Finally, we constructed the RiskScore system, and K-M curves and ROC curves revealed that RiskScore possessed objective clinical prognostic potential and demonstrated consistent robustness in multiple datasets. The low-risk group presented a higher endocrine metabolism and lower immune infiltrate state.We identified prognostic models consisting of APOL1, BHLHE40, CLMP, GNG12, LOX, LY6E, MYL12B, RND3, SOX4, and RiskScore showed promising clinical value.

First, the filtered data were randomized into the test and verification groups. Second, in the test group, specific variables were screened using logistic regression analysis, Lasso regression analysis, support vector machine, and random forest. Specific variables obtained using the four methods were intersected, and a dynamic model was constructed. ROC and calibration curves were constructed to assess model performance. Finally, internal model performance was verified in the verification group using ROC and calibration curves.The data from 4019 patients were collected. In total, 1327 eligible cases were selected. By combining logistic regression analysis with three machine learning algorithms, this study identified four predictors associated with SSI, namely Modic changes, sebum thickness, hemoglobin, and glucose. Using this information, a prediction model was developed and visually represented. Then, we constructed ROC and calibration curves using the test group; the area under the ROC curve was 0.988. Further, calibration curve analysis revealed favorable consistency of nomogram-predicted values compared with real measurements. The C-index of our model was 0.986 (95% CI 0.981-0.994). Finally, we used the validation group to validate the model internally; the AUC was 0.987. Calibration curve analysis revealed favorable consistency of nomogram-predicted values compared with real measurements. The C-index was 0.982 (95% CI 0.974-0.999).Logistic regression analysis and machine learning were employed to select four risk factors: Modic changes, sebum thickness, hemoglobin, and glucose.

However, CAPRI-3 uses text mining (an artificial intelligence (AI) technology) for patient identification and data collection. The aim of this study is to demonstrate the reliability and efficiency of this AI-driven approach.CAPRI-3 is an observational retrospective multicenter cohort registry on metastatic prostate cancer. We tested the patient-identification algorithm and automated data extraction through manual validation of the same patients in two pilots in 2019 and 2022.Pilot one identified 2030 patients and pilot two 9464 patients. The negative predictive value of the algorithm was maximized to prevent false exclusions and reached 94.8%. The completeness and accuracy of the automated data extraction were 92.3% or higher, except for date fields and inaccessible data (images/pdf) (10-88.9%). Additional manual quality control took over 3 h less time per patient than the original fully manual CAPRI registry (105 vs. 300 min).The CAPRI-3 patient-identification algorithm is a sound replacement for excluding ineligible candidates. The AI-driven data extraction is largely accurate and complete, but manual quality control is needed for less reliable and inaccessible data. Overall, the AI-driven approach of the CAPRI-3 registry is reliable and timesaving."
,37568612,"Modelling the Tumour Microenvironment, but What Exactly Do We Mean by ""Model""?",Cancers (Basel),"The Oxford English Dictionary includes 17 definitions for the word ""model"" as a noun and another 11 as a verb. Therefore, context is necessary to understand the meaning of the word model. For instance, ""model railways"" refer to replicas of railways and trains at a smaller scale and a ""model student"" refers to an exemplary individual. In some cases, a specific context, like cancer research, may not be sufficient to provide one specific meaning for model. Even if the context is narrowed, specifically, to research related to the tumour microenvironment, ""model"" can be understood in a wide variety of ways, from an animal model to a mathematical expression. This paper presents a review of different ""models"" of the tumour microenvironment, as grouped by different definitions of the word into four categories: model organisms, in vitro models, mathematical models and computational models. Then, the frequencies of different meanings of the word ""model"" related to the tumour microenvironment are measured from numbers of entries in the MEDLINE database of the United States National Library of Medicine at the National Institutes of Health. The frequencies of the main components of the microenvironment and the organ-related cancers modelled are also assessed quantitatively with specific keywords. Whilst animal models, particularly xenografts and mouse models, are the most commonly used ""models"", the number of these entries has been slowly decreasing. Mathematical models, as well as prognostic and risk models, follow in frequency, and these have been growing in use."

However, the molecular and pathophysiological mechanisms of P. aeruginosa respiratory infection are largely unknown. Here, we performed assays for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq), transcriptomics, and quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics and ubiquitin-proteomics in P. aeruginosa-infected lung tissues for multi-omics analysis, while ATAC-seq and transcriptomics were also examined in P. aeruginosa-infected mouse macrophages. To identify the pivotal factors that are involved in host immune defense, we integrated chromatin accessibility and gene expression to investigate molecular changes in P. aeruginosa-infected lung tissues combined with proteomics and ubiquitin-proteomics. Our multi-omics investigation discovered a significant concordance for innate immunological and inflammatory responses following P. aeruginosa infection between hosts and alveolar macrophages. Furthermore, we discovered that multi-omics changes in pioneer factors Stat1 and Stat3 play a crucial role in the immunological regulation of P. aeruginosa infection and that their downstream molecules (e.g., Fas) may be implicated in both immunosuppressive and inflammation-promoting processes. Taken together, these findings indicate that transcription factors and their downstream signaling molecules play a critical role in the mobilization and rebalancing of the host immune response against P. aeruginosa infection and may serve as potential targets for bacterial infections and inflammatory diseases, providing insights and resources for omics analyses.Copyright: © 2023 Yang et al.

We conducted a systematic review to synthesize evidence on the associations of attributes of urban built environment (e.g. residential density, land use mix, greenness and walkability) with cardiovascular risk factors (e.g. hypertension and arterial stiffness) and major CVD events including mortality. A total of 63 studies, including 31 of cross-sectional design and 32 of longitudinal design conducted across 21 geographical locations and published between 2012 and 2023 were extracted for review. Overall, we report moderately consistent evidence of protective associations of greenness with cardiovascular risks and major CVD events (cross-sectional studies: 12 of 15 on hypertension/blood pressure (BP) and 2 of 3 on arterial stiffness; and longitudinal studies: 6 of 8 on hypertension/BP, 7 of 8 on CVD mortality, 3 of 3 on ischemic heart disease mortality and 5 of 8 studies on stroke hospitalization or mortality reporting significant inverse associations). Consistently, walkability was associated with lower risks of hypertension, arterial stiffness and major CVD events (cross-sectional studies: 11 of 12 on hypertension/BP and 1 of 1 on arterial stiffness; and longitudinal studies: 3 of 6 on hypertension/BP and 1 of 2 studies on CVD events being protective). Sixty-seven percent of the studies were rated as ""probably high"" risk of confounding bias because of inability to adjust for underlying comorbidities/family history of diseases in their statistical models. Forty-six percent and 14% of the studies were rated as ""probably high"" risk of bias for exposure and outcome measurements, respectively. Future studies with robust design will further help elucidate the linkages between urban built environment and cardiovascular health, thereby informing planning policies for creating healthy cities.© 2023.

IAV replication can affect the expression of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), and the subsequent changes in DNA methylation regulate gene expression and may lead to abnormal gene transcription and translation, yet the underlying mechanisms of virus-induced epigenetic changes from DNA methylation and its role in virus-host interactions remain elusive. Here in this paper, we showed that DNMT1 expression could be suppressed following the inhibition of miR-142-5p or the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway during IAV infection, resulting in demethylation of the promotor region of the 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase-like (OASL) protein and promotion of its expression in A549 cells. OASL expression enhanced RIG-I-mediated interferon induction and then suppressed replication of IAV. Our study elucidated an innate immunity mechanism by which up-regulation of OASL contributes to host antiviral responses via epigenetic modifications in IAV infection, which could provide important insights into the understanding of viral pathogenesis and host antiviral defense."
,37591855,"A tool for rapid, automated characterization of population epigenomics in plants.",Sci Rep,"Epigenetic variation in plant populations is an important factor in determining phenotype and adaptation to the environment. However, while advances have been made in the molecular and computational methods to analyze the methylation status of a given sample of DNA, tools to profile and compare the methylomes of multiple individual plants or groups of plants at high resolution and low cost are lacking. Here, we describe a computational approach and R package (sounDMR) that leverages the benefits of long read nanopore sequencing to enable robust identification of differential methylation from complex experimental designs, as well as assess the variability within treatment groups and identify individual plants of interest. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by profiling a population of Arabidopsis thaliana exposed to a demethylating agent and identify genomic regions of high epigenetic variability between individuals. Given the low cost of nanopore sequencing devices and the ease of sample preparation, these results show that high resolution epigenetic profiling of plant populations can be made more broadly accessible in plant breeding and biotechnology.© 2023.

However, the structures and biological impacts of such abnormalities have seldomly been analyzed at the molecular level. Previously, we reported a Japanese female patient with severe developmental defects. The patient had an extra dicentric chromosome 21 (chr21) consisting of two partial chr21 copies fused together within their long arms along with two centromeres and many copy number changes. In this study, we performed whole-genome, transcriptional, and DNA methylation analyses, coupled with novel bioinformatic approaches, to reveal the complex structure of the extra chromosome and its transcriptional and epigenetic changes. Long-read sequencing accurately identified the structures of junctions related to the copy number changes in extra chr21 and suggested the mechanism of the structural changes. Our transcriptome analysis showed the overexpression of genes in extra chr21. Additionally, an allele-specific DNA methylation analysis of the long-read sequencing data suggested that the centromeric region of extra chr21 was hypermethylated, a property associated with the inactivation of one centromere in the extra chromosome. Our comprehensive analysis provides insights into the molecular mechanism underlying the generation of the extra chromosome and its pathogenic roles.© 2023. The Author(s)."
,37591874,Cell-specific and shared regulatory elements control a multigene locus active in mammary and salivary glands.,Nat Commun,"Regulation of high-density loci harboring genes with different cell-specificities remains a puzzle. Here we investigate a locus that evolved through gene duplication and contains eight genes and 20 candidate regulatory elements, including one super-enhancer. Casein genes (Csn1s1, Csn2, Csn1s2a, Csn1s2b, Csn3) are expressed in mammary glands, induced 10,000-fold during pregnancy and account for 50% of mRNAs during lactation, Prr27 and Fdcsp are salivary-specific and Odam has dual specificity. We probed the function of 12 candidate regulatory elements, individually and in combination, in the mouse genome. The super-enhancer is essential for the expression of Csn3, Csn1s2b, Odam and Fdcsp but largely dispensable for Csn1s1, Csn2 and Csn1s2a. Csn3 activation also requires its own local enhancer. Synergism between local enhancers and cytokine-responsive promoter elements facilitates activation of Csn2 during pregnancy. Our work identifies the regulatory complexity of a multigene locus with an ancestral super-enhancer active in mammary and salivary tissue and local enhancers and promoter elements unique to mammary tissue.© 2023.

,37564646,RSV replication modifies the XBP1s binding complex on the IRF1 upstream enhancer to potentiate the mucosal anti-viral response.,Front Immunol,"The unfolded protein response (UPR) has emerged as an important signaling pathway mediating anti-viral defenses to Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) infection. Earlier we found that RSV replication predominantly activates the evolutionarily conserved Inositol Requiring Enzyme 1α (IRE1α)-X-Box Binding Protein 1 spliced (XBP1s) arm of the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) producing inflammation, metabolic adaptation and cellular plasticity, yet the mechanisms how the UPR potentiates inflammation are not well understood.To understand this process better, we examined the genomic response integrating RNA-seq and Cleavage Under Targets and Release Using Nuclease (CUT&RUN) analyses. These data were integrated with an RNA-seq analysis conducted on RSV-infected small airway cells ± an IRE1α RNAse inhibitor.We identified RSV induced expression changes in ~3.2K genes; of these, 279 required IRE1α and were enriched in IL-10/cytokine signaling pathways. From this data set, we identify those genes directly under XBP1s control by CUT&RUN. Although XBP1s binds to ~4.2 K high-confidence genomic binding sites, surprisingly only a small subset of IL10/cytokine signaling genes are directly bound. We further apply CUT&RUN to find that RSV infection enhances XBP1s loading on 786 genomic sites enriched in AP1/Fra-1, RELA and SP1 binding sites. These control a subset of cytokine regulatory factor genes including IFN response factor 1 (IRF1), CSF2, NFKB1A and DUSP10. Focusing on the downstream role of IRF1, selective knockdown (KD) and overexpression experiments demonstrate IRF1 induction controls type I and -III interferon (IFN) and IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) expression, demonstrating that ISG are indirectly regulated by XBP1 through IRF1 transactivation. Examining the mechanism of IRF1 activation, we observe that XBP1s directly binds a 5' enhancer sequence whose XBP1s loading is increased by RSV. The functional requirement for the enhancer is demonstrated by targeting a dCas9-KRAB silencer, reducing IRF1 activation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation shows that XBP1 is required, but not sufficient, for RSV-induced recruitment of activated phospho-Ser2 Pol II to the enhancer.We conclude that XBP1s is a direct activator of a core subset of IFN and cytokine regulatory genes in response to RSV. Of these IRF1 is upstream of the type III IFN and ISG response. We find that RSV modulates the XBP1s binding complex on the IRF1 5' enhancer whose activation is required for IRF1 expression. These findings provide novel insight into how the IRE1α-XBP1s pathway potentiates airway mucosal anti-viral responses.Copyright © 2023 Qiao, Xu, Zhang, Yang and Brasier."
,37591842,A deep learning method for replicate-based analysis of chromosome conformation contacts using Siamese neural networks.,Nat Commun,"The organisation of the genome in nuclear space is an important frontier of biology. Chromosome conformation capture methods such as Hi-C and Micro-C produce genome-wide chromatin contact maps that provide rich data containing quantitative and qualitative information about genome architecture. Most conventional approaches to genome-wide chromosome conformation capture data are limited to the analysis of pre-defined features, and may therefore miss important biological information. One constraint is that biologically important features can be masked by high levels of technical noise in the data. Here we introduce a replicate-based method for deep learning from chromatin conformation contact maps. Using a Siamese network configuration our approach learns to distinguish technical noise from biological variation and outperforms image similarity metrics across a range of biological systems. The features extracted from Hi-C maps after perturbation of cohesin and CTCF reflect the distinct biological functions of cohesin and CTCF in the formation of domains and boundaries, respectively. The learnt distance metrics are biologically meaningful, as they mirror the density of cohesin and CTCF binding. These properties make our method a powerful tool for the exploration of chromosome conformation capture data, such as Hi-C capture Hi-C, and Micro-C.© 2023. Springer Nature Limited."

Challenges include no effective therapeutic target, intra- and intertumoral heterogeneity, inadequate effective drugs, and an immunosuppressive microenvironment, etc. Deciphering the pathogenesis of gliomas and finding out the working mechanisms are urgent and necessary for glioma treatment. Identification of prognostic biomarkers and targeting the biomarker genes will be a promising therapy.From our RNA-sequencing data of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS)-inhibition sensitive and OXPHOS-resistant cell lines, we found that the scaffolding protein caveolin 1 (CAV1) is highly expressed in the resistant group but not in the sensitive group. By comprehensive analysis of our RNA sequencing data, Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS) data and public databases, we found that CAV1 is highly expressed in gliomas and its expression is positively related with pathological processes, higher CAV1 predicts shorter overall survival.Further analysis indicated that (1) the differentiated genes in CAV1-high groups are enriched in immune infiltration and immune response; (2) CAV1 is positively correlated with tumor metastasis markers; (3) the methylation level of CAV1 promoters in glioma group is lower in higher stage than that in lower stage; (4) CAV1 is positively correlated with glioma stemness; (5) higher expression of CAV1 renders the glioma cells' resistant to oxidative phosphorylation inhibitors.Therefore, we identified a key gene CAV1 and deciphered its function in glioma progression and prognosis, proposing that CAV1 may be a therapeutic target for gliomas.© 2023.

,37667001,Comparative single-cell transcriptomic analysis of primate brains highlights human-specific regulatory evolution.,Nat Ecol Evol,"Enhanced cognitive function in humans is hypothesized to result from cortical expansion and increased cellular diversity. However, the mechanisms that drive these phenotypic innovations remain poorly understood, in part because of the lack of high-quality cellular resolution data in human and non-human primates. Here, we take advantage of single-cell expression data from the middle temporal gyrus of five primates (human, chimp, gorilla, macaque and marmoset) to identify 57 homologous cell types and generate cell type-specific gene co-expression networks for comparative analysis. Although orthologue expression patterns are generally well conserved, we find 24% of genes with extensive differences between human and non-human primates (3,383 out of 14,131), which are also associated with multiple brain disorders. To assess the functional significance of gene expression differences in an evolutionary context, we evaluate changes in network connectivity across meta-analytic co-expression networks from 19 animals. We find that a subset of these genes has deeply conserved co-expression across all non-human animals, and strongly divergent co-expression relationships in humans (139 out of 3,383, <1% of primate orthologues). Genes with human-specific cellular expression and co-expression profiles (such as NHEJ1, GTF2H2, C2 and BBS5) typically evolve under relaxed selective constraints and may drive rapid evolutionary change in brain function.© 2023.

,37576401,Diagnostic value of aberrant decreased 5-Methylcytosine RNA modification in leukocytes for non-small cell lung cancer.,J Cancer,"Background:Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was a disease with poor outcomes, partly because there were no high-efficiency non-invasive diagnostic biomarkers. The RNA modification status of 5-Methylcytosine (m5C) has been shown to be a biomarker for various diseases, but its potentiality to be a diagnostic biomarker for NSCLC remained inconclusive.Methods:In this research, we collected peripheral leukocyte samples from 141 patients with NSCLC and 90 normal people as controls to evaluate the extent of m5C RNA modification.Results:We found that the m5C modification levels in leukocytes of NSCLC patients were decreased dramatically, which were compared to the normal controls, and levels of m5C modification decreased progressively with tumor stage. Importantly, m5C modification exhibited superior diagnostic value compared to carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCC), cytokeratin 19 fragment (Cyfra21-1), and carbohydrate antigen 125 (CA125), which demonstrated area under the curves (AUCs) of 0.912, 0.773, 0.669, 0.754, and 0.732, respectively. The combination of m5C modification with these serum tumor biomarkers further improved the AUC to 0.960. A nomogram model incorporating m5C modification also provided an effectively diagnostic tool for NSCLC.Conclusion:Collectively, our findings suggested that m5C modification in leukocytes held promise as a prospective biomarker for NSCLC diagnosis.© The author(s)."
,37550793,Long-term environmental metal exposure is associated with hypomethylation of CpG sites in NFKB1 and other genes related to oncogenesis.,Clin Epigenetics,"Long-term environmental exposure to metals leads to epigenetic changes and may increase risks to human health. The relationship between the type and level of metal exposure and epigenetic changes in subjects exposed to high concentrations of metals in the environment is not yet clear. The aim of our study is to find the possible association of environmental long-term exposure to metals with DNA methylation changes of genes related to immune response and carcinogenesis. We investigated the association of plasma levels of 21 essential and non-essential metals detected by ICP-MS and the methylation level of 654 CpG sites located on NFKB1, CDKN2A, ESR1, APOA5, IGF2 and H19 genes assessed by targeted bisulfite sequencing in a cohort of 40 subjects living near metal mining area and 40 unexposed subjects. Linear regression was conducted to find differentially methylated positions with adjustment for gender, age, BMI class, smoking and metal concentration.In the metal-exposed group, five CpGs in the NFKB1 promoter region were hypomethylated compared to unexposed group. Four differentially methylated positions (DMPs) were associated with multiple metals, two of them are located on NFKB1 gene, and one each on CDKN2A gene and ESR1 gene. Two DMPs located on NFKB1 (chr4:102500951, associated with Be) and IGF2 (chr11:2134198, associated with U) are associated with specific metal levels. The methylation status of the seven CpGs located on NFKB1 (3), ESR1 (2) and CDKN2A (2) positively correlated with plasma levels of seven metals (As, Sb, Zn, Ni, U, I and Mn).Our study revealed methylation changes in NFKB1, CDKN2A, IGF2 and ESR1 genes in individuals with long-term human exposure to metals. Further studies are needed to clarify the effect of environmental metal exposure on epigenetic mechanisms and pathways involved.© 2023. BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature."
,37645044,Unraveling the Link between Periodontitis and Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Challenges and Outlook.,ArXiv,"Periodontitis and Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) are chronic inflammatory conditions, characterized by microbial dysbiosis and hyper-immunoinflammatory responses. Growing evidence suggest an interconnection between periodontitis and IBD, implying a shift from the traditional concept of independent diseases to a complex, reciprocal cycle. This review outlines the evidence supporting an Oral-Gut axis, marked by a higher prevalence of periodontitis in IBD patients and vice versa. The specific mechanisms linking periodontitis and IBD remain to be fully elucidated, but emerging evidence points to the ectopic colonization of the gut by oral bacteria, which promote intestinal inflammation by activating host immune responses. This review presents an in-depth examination of the interconnection between periodontitis and IBD, highlighting the shared microbiological and immunological pathways, and proposing a multi-hit hypothesis in the pathogenesis of periodontitis-mediated intestinal inflammation. Furthermore, the review underscores the critical need for a collaborative approach between dentists and gastroenterologists to provide holistic oral-systemic healthcare."
,37607912,Bile acid-dependent transcription factors and chromatin accessibility determine regional heterogeneity of intestinal antimicrobial peptides.,Nat Commun,"Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are important mediators of intestinal immune surveillance. However, the regional heterogeneity of AMPs and its regulatory mechanisms remain obscure. Here, we clarified the regional heterogeneity of intestinal AMPs at the single-cell level, and revealed a cross-lineages AMP regulation mechanism that bile acid dependent transcription factors (BATFs), NR1H4, NR1H3 and VDR, regulate AMPs through a ligand-independent manner. Bile acids regulate AMPs by perturbing cell differentiation rather than activating BATFs signaling. Chromatin accessibility determines the potential of BATFs to regulate AMPs at the pre-transcriptional level, thus shaping the regional heterogeneity of AMPs. The BATFs-AMPs axis also participates in the establishment of intestinal antimicrobial barriers of fetuses and the defects of antibacterial ability during Crohn's disease. Overall, BATFs and chromatin accessibility play essential roles in shaping the regional heterogeneity of AMPs at pre- and postnatal stages, as well as in maintenance of antimicrobial immunity during homeostasis and disease.© 2023.

,37580713,Global serum profiling: an opportunity for earlier cancer detection.,J Exp Clin Cancer Res,"The advances in cancer research achieved in the last 50 years have been remarkable and have provided a deeper knowledge of this disease in many of its conceptual and biochemical aspects. From viewing a tumor as a 'simple' aggregate of mutant cells and focusing on detecting key cell changes leading to the tumorigenesis, the understanding of cancer has broadened to consider it as a complex organ interacting with its close and far surroundings through tumor and non-tumor cells, metabolic mechanisms, and immune processes. Metabolism and the immune system have been linked to tumorigenesis and malignancy progression along with cancer-specific genetic mutations. However, most technologies developed to overcome the barriers to earlier detection are focused solely on genetic information. The concept of cancer as a complex organ has led to research on other analytical techniques, with the quest of finding a more sensitive and cost-effective comprehensive approach. Furthermore, artificial intelligence has gained broader consensus in the oncology community as a powerful tool with the potential to revolutionize cancer diagnosis for physicians. We herein explore the relevance of the concept of cancer as a complex organ interacting with the bodily surroundings, and focus on promising emerging technologies seeking to diagnose cancer earlier, such as liquid biopsies. We highlight the importance of a comprehensive approach to encompass all the tumor and non-tumor derived information salient to earlier cancer detection.© 2023.

We followed a birth cohort in tropical Ecuador to understand how early viral respiratory disease, in the context of exposures affecting airway inflammation including ascariasis, affect wheezing illness, asthma, and rhinoconjunctivitis in later childhood.A surveillance cohort nested within a birth cohort was monitored for respiratory infections during the first 2 years in rural Ecuador and followed for 8 years for the development of wheeze and rhinoconjunctivitis. Nasal swabs were examined for viruses by polymerase chain reaction and respiratory symptom data on recent wheeze and rhinoconjunctivitis were collected by periodic questionnaires at 3, 5, and 8 years. Stools from pregnant mothers and periodically from children aged 2 years were examined microscopically for soil-transmitted helminths. Atopy was measured by allergen skin prick testing at 2 years. Spirometry, fractional exhaled nitric oxide measurement, and nasal washes were performed at 8 years. Associations between clinically significant respiratory disease (CSRD) and wheezing or rhinoconjunctivitis at 3, 5, and 8 years were estimated using multivariable logistic regression.Four hundred and twenty six children were followed of which 67.7% had at least one CSRD episode; 12% had respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)+CSRD and 36% had rhinovirus (RHV)+CSRD. All-cause CSRD was associated with increased wheeze at 3 (OR 2.33 [95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.23-4.40]) and 5 (OR: 2.12 [95% CI 1.12-4.01]) years. RHV+CSRD was more strongly associated with wheeze at 3 years in STH-infected (STH-infected [OR 13.41, 95% CI 1.56-115.64] vs. uninfected [OR 1.68, 95% CI 0.73-3.84]) and SPT+ (SPT+ [OR 9.42, 95% CI 1.88-47.15] versus SPT- [OR 1.92, 95% CI 0.84-4.38]) children.

Diosgenin is a steroidal sapogenin with known neuroprotective and antioxidant properties. This study aimed to assess the pharmacological potential of diosgenin in a single prolonged stress (SPS) model of PTSD, plus other behavioral models along with any consequent alterations in brain neurochemistry in male mice.Methodology:SPS was induced by restraining animals for 2 h, followed by 20 min of forced swim, recuperation for 15 min, and finally, exposure to ether to induce anesthesia. The SPS-exposed animals were treated with diosgenin (20, 40, and 60 mg/kg) and compared with the positive controls, fluoxetine or donepezil, then they were observed for any changes in anxiety/depression-like behaviors, and cognitive impairment. After behavioral screening, postmortem serotonin, noradrenaline, dopamine, vitamin C, adenosine and its metabolites inosine and hypoxanthine were quantified in the frontal cortex, hippocampus, and striatum by high-performance liquid chromatography. Additionally, animal serum was screened for changes in corticosterone levels.Results:The results showed that diosgenin reversed anxiety- and depression-like behaviors, and ameliorated cognitive impairment in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, diosgenin restored monoamine and vitamin C levels dose-dependently and modulated adenosine and its metabolites in the brain regions. Diosgenin also reinstated otherwise increased serum corticosterone levels in SPS mice.Conclusion:The findings suggest that diosgenin may be a potential candidate for improving symptoms of PTSD.Copyright © 2023 Malik, Usman, Arif, Ahmed, Ali, Rauf and Sewell."

Nodes A-21, A-20, A-23 and A-24, and depressive symptoms D-6 showed greater lagged effect values.Our findings suggest that there is a lagged and mutually causal interaction between negative life events and depressive symptoms in medical cadets over 4 years of college, but that the predictability of negative life events is more important. However, more attention needs to be paid to the predictive role of depressive symptoms, especially those in early life which are often overlooked. Our study provides new insights into the relationship between negative life events and depressive symptoms in university students and helps to refine strategies for prevention and intervention of depression.© 2023 Li et al."

,37596405,NA,NA,"The TNM system is used to assess prognosis after colorectal cancer (CRC) diagnosis. Other prognostic factors reported include histopathological assessments of the tumour, tumour mutations and proteins in the blood. As some of these factors are strongly correlated, it is important to evaluate the independent effects they may have on survival.Tumour samples from 2162 CRC patients were visually assessed for amount of tumour stroma, severity of lymphocytic infiltrate at the tumour margins and the presence of lymphoid follicles. Somatic mutations in the tumour were assessed for 2134 individuals. Pre-surgical levels of 4963 plasma proteins were measured in 128 individuals. The associations between these features and prognosis were inspected by a Cox Proportional Hazards Model (CPH).Levels of stroma, lymphocytic infiltration and presence of lymphoid follicles all associate with prognosis, along with high tumour mutation burden, high microsatellite instability and TP53 and BRAF mutations. The somatic mutations are correlated with the histopathology and none of the somatic mutations associate with survival in a multivariate analysis. Amount of stroma and lymphocytic infiltration associate with local invasion of tumours. Elevated levels of two plasma proteins, CA-125 and PPP1R1A, associate with a worse prognosis.Tumour stroma and lymphocytic infiltration variables are strongly associated with prognosis of CRC and capture the prognostic effects of tumour mutation status.

In the laboratory, haploid S. cerevisiae cells of a single mating type can acquire an amyloid prion in one of two ways (i) spontaneous nucleation of the prion within the yeast cell, and (ii) receipt via mother-to-daughter transmission during the cell division cycle. Similarly, prions can be lost due to (i) dissolution of the prion amyloid by its breakage into non-amyloid monomeric units, or (ii) preferential donation/retention of prions between the mother and daughter during cell division. Here we present a computational tool (Monitoring Induction and Loss of prions in Cells; MIL-CELL) for modelling these four general processes using a multiscale approach describing both spatial and kinetic aspects of the yeast life cycle and the amyloid-prion behavior. We describe the workings of the model, assumptions upon which it is based and some interesting simulation results pertaining to the wave-like spread of the epigenetic prion elements through the yeast population. MIL-CELL is provided as a stand-alone GUI executable program for free download with the paper. MIL-CELL is equipped with a relational database allowing all simulated properties to be searched, collated and graphed. Its ability to incorporate variation in heritable properties means MIL-CELL is also capable of simulating loss of the isogenic nature of a cell population over time.

Accumulating evidence has begun to elucidate the multifaceted ways in which H2S influences the epigenetic landscape and, subsequently, the progression of various neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's disease. H2S can modulate key components of the epigenetic machinery, such as DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNAs, impacting gene expression and cellular functions relevant to neuronal survival, inflammation, and synaptic plasticity. We synthesize recent research that positions H2S as an essential player within this intricate network, with the potential to open new therapeutic avenues for these currently incurable conditions. Despite significant progress, there remains a considerable gap in our understanding of the precise molecular mechanisms and the potential therapeutic implications of modulating H2S levels or its downstream targets. We conclude by identifying future directions for research aimed at exploiting the therapeutic potential of H2S in neurodegenerative diseases."
,37566041,The Promise of Epigenetics Research in the Treatment of Appendiceal Neoplasms.,Cells,"Appendiceal cancers (AC) are a rare and heterogeneous group of malignancies. Historically, appendiceal neoplasms have been grouped with colorectal cancers (CRC), and treatment strategies have been modeled after CRC management guidelines due to their structural similarities and anatomical proximity. However, the two have marked differences in biological behavior and treatment response, and evidence suggests significant discrepancies in their respective genetic profiles. In addition, while the WHO classification for appendiceal cancers is currently based on traditional histopathological criteria, studies have demonstrated that histomorphology does not correlate with survival or treatment response in AC. Due to their rarity, appendiceal cancers have not been studied as extensively as other gastrointestinal cancers. However, their incidence has been increasing steadily over the past decade, making it crucial to identify new and more effective strategies for detection and treatment. Recent efforts to map and understand the molecular landscape of appendiceal cancers have unearthed a wealth of information that has made it evident that appendiceal cancers possess a unique molecular profile, distinct from other gastrointestinal cancers. This review focuses on the epigenetic landscape of epithelial appendiceal cancers and aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of knowledge of epigenetic changes across different appendiceal cancer subtypes, highlighting the challenges as well as the promise of employing epigenetics in the quest for the detection of biomarkers, therapeutic targets, surveillance markers, and predictors of treatment response and survival in epithelial appendiceal neoplasms."
,37577516,Neuron-specific chromatin disruption at CpG islands and aging-related regions in Kabuki syndrome mice.,bioRxiv,"Many Mendelian developmental disorders caused by coding variants in epigenetic regulators have now been discovered. Epigenetic regulators are broadly expressed, and each of these disorders typically exhibits phenotypic manifestations from many different organ systems. An open question is whether the chromatin disruption - the root of the pathogenesis - is similar in the different disease-relevant cell types. This is possible in principle, since all these cell-types are subject to effects from the same causative gene, that has the same kind of function (e.g. methylates histones) and is disrupted by the same germline variant. We focus on mouse models for Kabuki syndrome types 1 and 2, and find that the chromatin accessibility abnormalities in neurons are mostly distinct from those in B or T cells. This is not because the neuronal abnormalities occur at regulatory elements that are only active in neurons. Neurons, but not B or T cells, show preferential chromatin disruption at CpG islands and at regulatory elements linked to aging. A sensitive analysis reveals that the regions disrupted in B/T cells do exhibit chromatin accessibility changes in neurons, but these are very subtle and of uncertain functional significance. Finally, we are able to identify a small set of regulatory elements disrupted in all three cell types. Our findings reveal the cellular-context-specific effect of variants in epigenetic regulators, and suggest that blood-derived ""episignatures"" may not be well-suited for understanding the mechanistic basis of neurodevelopment in Mendelian disorders of the epigenetic machinery."
,37559624,Analysis of the role of glucose metabolism-related genes in dilated cardiomyopathy based on bioinformatics.,J Thorac Dis,"Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a prevalent condition with diverse etiologies, including viral infection, autoimmune response, and genetic factors. Despite the crucial role of energy metabolism in cardiac function, therapeutic targets for key genes in DCM's energy metabolism remain scarce.Our study employed the GSE79962 and GSE42955 datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database for myocardial tissue sample collection and target gene identification via differential gene expression screening. Using various R packages, GSEA software, and the STRING database, we conducted data analysis, gene set enrichment, and protein-protein interaction predictions. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms aided in feature gene selection, while the predictive model's efficiency was evaluated via the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. We used the non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) method for molecular typing and the cell-type identification by estimating relative subsets of RNA transcripts (CIBERSORT) algorithm for predicting immune cell infiltration.TheDLATandLDHAgenes may regulate the immune microenvironment of DCM by influencing activated dendritic cells, activated mast cells, and M0 macrophages, respectively. TheBPGM, DLAT, PGM2, ADH1A, ADH1C, LDHA, andPFKMgenes may regulate m6A methylation in DCM by affecting theZC3H13, ALKBH5, RBMX, HNRNPC, METTL3, andYTHDC1genes. Further regulatory mechanism analysis suggested thatPFKM, DLAT, PKLR, PGM2, LDHA, BPGM, ADH1A, andADH1Ccould be involved in the development of cardiomyopathy by regulating the Toll-like receptor signaling pathway.PFKM, DLAT, PKLR, PGM2, LDHA, BPGM, ADH1A, andADH1Cmay serve as potential targets for guiding the diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of DCM.2023 Journal of Thoracic Disease.

,37665382,Predicting neurologic recovery after severe acute brain injury using resting-state networks.,J Neurol,"There is a lack of reliable tools used to predict functional recovery in unresponsive patients following a severe brain injury. The objective of the study is to evaluate the prognostic utility of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging for predicting good neurologic recovery in unresponsive patients with severe brain injury in the intensive-care unit.Each patient underwent a 5.5-min resting-state scan and ten resting-state networks were extracted via independent component analysis. The Glasgow Outcome Scale was used to classify patients into good and poor outcome groups. The Nearest Centroid classifier used each patient's ten resting-state network values to predict best neurologic outcome within 6 months post-injury.Of the 25 patients enrolled (mean age = 43.68, range = [19-69]; GCS ≤ 9; 6 females), 10 had good and 15 had poor outcome. The classifier correctly and confidently predicted 8/10 patients with good and 12/15 patients with poor outcome (mean = 0.793, CI = [0.700, 0.886], Z = 2.843, p = 0.002). The prediction performance was largely determined by three visual (medial: Z = 3.11, p = 0.002; occipital pole: Z = 2.44, p = 0.015; lateral: Z = 2.85, p = 0.004) and the left frontoparietal network (Z = 2.179, p = 0.029).Our approach correctly identified good functional outcome with higher sensitivity (80%) than traditional prognostic measures. By revealing preserved networks in the absence of discernible behavioral signs, functional connectivity may aid in the prognostic process and affect the outcome of discussions surrounding withdrawal of life-sustaining measures.© 2023.

,37640858,Cell-free DNA methylome analysis for early preeclampsia prediction.,Nat Med,"Preeclampsia (PE) is a leading cause for peripartal morbidity, especially if developing early in gestation. To enable prophylaxis in the prevention of PE, pregnancies at risk of PE must be identified early-in the first trimester. To identify at-risk pregnancies we profiled methylomes of plasma-derived, cell-free DNA from 498 pregnant women, of whom about one-third developed early-onset PE. We detected DNA methylation differences between control and PE pregnancies that enabled risk stratification at PE diagnosis but also presymptomatically, at around 12 weeks of gestation (range 9-14 weeks). The first-trimester risk prediction model was validated in an external cohort collected from two centers (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.75) and integrated with routinely available maternal risk factors (AUC = 0.85). The combined risk score correctly predicted 72% of patients with early-onset PE at 80% specificity. These preliminary results suggest that cell-free DNA methylation profiling is a promising tool for presymptomatic PE risk assessment, and has the potential to improve treatment and follow-up in the obstetric clinic.© 2023.

,37654976,Elevated Maternal Testosterone Levels Alter PFOA Elimination and Tissue Distribution in Pregnant Rats.,J Environ Sci Public Health,"Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is an enduring synthetic chemical that harms human health. Recent studies indicate heightened bioaccumulation of PFOA, particularly in pregnant women experiencing preeclampsia. Since plasma testosterone levels are elevated in pregnant women with preeclampsia, we hypothesized that hyperandrogenic conditions during pregnancy may hinder PFOA elimination and contribute to their higher body burden. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were s/c injected with vehicle or testosterone propionate from gestational day (GD) 15 to 20 to increase plasma testosterone levels by 2-fold, similar to levels in preeclampsia. On GD 16, [14C]-PFOA (9.4 pmol/kg) was given intravenously, and subsequently,14C radioactivity was measured in maternal blood, urine, feces, and tissues. PFOA was primarily eliminated through urine; however, less PFOA was excreted in urine of pregnant rats with elevated testosterone levels than controls. Fecal excretion of PFOA was minimal and did not significantly differ between groups. The total elimination of PFOA (urine plus feces) was significantly reduced by 12% in pregnant rats with elevated testosterone levels. In controls, PFOA distribution was highest in placenta, followed by the kidneys, liver, brain, heart, lungs, and spleen. Pregnant rats with elevated testosterone levels displayed 12% higher concentrations of PFOA in these tissues than controls. Furthermore, the renal expression ofOat2andOat3was significantly decreased, whileOatp1andOat-kexpression was significantly increased in pregnant rats with elevated testosterone levels than controls. In conclusion, elevated maternal testosterone levels decrease urinary elimination of PFOA, possibly through altered expression of renal transporters leading to increased tissue concentrations of PFOA in pregnant rats."
,37620817,Association of mitochondrial DNA copy number with chronic kidney disease in older adults.,BMC Geriatr,"Mitochondrial dysfunction in kidney cells has been implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Estimation of mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNA-CN) is considered a convenient method for representing mitochondrial function in large samples. However, no study has investigated the association between mtDNA-CN and CKD in older adults with the highest prevalence. The objective is to examine cross-sectional and prospective associations between mtDNA-CN values and CKD risk in older adults to determine whether mtDNA-CN represents a novel potential biomarker for the recognition of CKD risk.In a Chinese community-based cohort of over 65-year-olds, we included 14,467 participants (52.6% females). CKD was defined by eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2or ICD-10 codes (patients = 3831 (26.5%)). Participants had peripheral blood levels of mtDNA-CN calculated from probe intensities of the Axiom CAS Array.The risk of CKD prevalence decreased with mtDNA-CN per 1-SD increment, independent of established risk factors for older CKD (odds ratio [OR] per SD 0.90, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.86, 0.93, P < 0.001), and has comparable strength of association with these established risk factors. Furthermore, the progression of kidney function was stratified according to the worsening of eGFR categories. The risk of kidney function progression to a more severe stage gradually decreased as the mtDNA-CN increased (P trend < 0.001). Non-CKD participants in the highest quartile of mtDNA-CN had a lower risk of developing CKD compared to the lowest quartile within 2 years of follow-up, reducing the risk of CKD by 36% (95% CI 0.42, 0.97; P = 0.037).Based on the analysis of the largest sample to date investigating the association between mtDNA-CN and CKD in older adults, higher levels of mtDNA-CN were found to be associated with a lower risk of CKD, suggesting that a reduced level of mtDNA-CN is a potential risk factor for CKD.© 2023.

Therefore, it is time-consuming, costly, and often lacks objectivity. Analysis of intraoperative data by artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential for automated technical skill assessment. The aim of this systematic review was to analyze the performance, external validity, and generalizability of AI models for technical skill assessment in minimally invasive surgery.A systematic search of Medline, Embase, Web of Science, and IEEE Xplore was performed to identify original articles reporting the use of AI in the assessment of technical skill in minimally invasive surgery. Risk of bias (RoB) and quality of the included studies were analyzed according to Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies criteria and the modified Joanna Briggs Institute checklists, respectively. Findings were reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement.In total, 1958 articles were identified, 50 articles met eligibility criteria and were analyzed. Motion data extracted from surgical videos (n = 25) or kinematic data from robotic systems or sensors (n = 22) were the most frequent input data for AI. Most studies used deep learning (n = 34) and predicted technical skills using an ordinal assessment scale (n = 36) with good accuracies in simulated settings. However, all proposed models were in development stage, only 4 studies were externally validated and 8 showed a low RoB.AI showed good performance in technical skill assessment in minimally invasive surgery. However, models often lacked external validity and generalizability. Therefore, models should be benchmarked using predefined performance metrics and tested in clinical implementation studies.© 2023.

Here, we perform whole genome sequencing of 323 haematopoietic colonies from 10 individuals with the inherited ribosomopathy Shwachman-Diamond syndrome to reconstruct haematopoietic phylogenies. In ~30% of colonies, we identify mutually exclusive mutations in TP53, EIF6, RPL5, RPL22, PRPF8, plus chromosome 7 and 15 aberrations that increase SBDS and EFL1 gene dosage, respectively. Target gene mutations commence in utero, resulting in a profusion of clonal expansions, with only a few haematopoietic stem cell lineages (mean 8, range 1-24) contributing ~50% of haematopoietic colonies across 8 individuals (range 4-100% clonality) by young adulthood. Rapid clonal expansion during disease transformation is associated with biallelic TP53 mutations and increased mutation burden. Our study highlights how convergent somatic mutation of the p53-dependent nucleolar surveillance pathway offsets the deleterious effects of germline ribosomopathy but increases opportunity for TP53-mutated cancer evolution.© 2023.

The morbidity and mortality rates in Western countries have decreased, but they are still on the rise in China.C10orf90is associated with a variety of cancers, but the correlation betweenC10orf90and CRC is not yet known.A total of 1,339 subjects were randomly enrolled in our study. After extracting their DNA, three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) ofC10orf90were genotyped to analyze the potential relationship between these variants and CRC risk. PLINK software packages (version 1.07) were used to evaluate multiple genetic models by calculating the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI). The best SNP-SNP interaction model was defined by the multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) analysis.C10orf90rs12412320 was significantly associated with CRC risk (p= 0.006) and might be associated with the lower CRC risk (OR: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.65-0.93). The relationship of rs12412320 with lower CRC risk was found in people aged >60 years and ≤60 years, women, non-smokers, or non-drinkers. Rs11245008 in people aged ≤60 years and rs11245007 among men had a higher CRC susceptibility. Rs12412320 was related to the lower risk of advanced stages (III/IV stage), while rs11245007 might be associated with the higher risk of advanced stages (III/IV stage). Moreover, rs12412320 had the most significant relationship with the susceptibility to rectal cancer.This study is the first to report betweenC10orf90gene polymorphisms and CRC risk in Chinese people, which suggests thatC10orf90rs12412320 might play a crucial role in preventing CRC occurrence.Copyright © 2023 Song, Wang, Chen, Zhong, Li, Guo and Yu."

While the main causes of disease progression were first sought in the motor neurons, more recent studies highlight the gliocentric theory demonstrating the pivotal role of microglia and astrocyte, but also of infiltrating immune cells, in the pathological processes that take place in the central nervous system microenvironment. From this point of view, microglia-astrocytes-lymphocytes crosstalk is fundamental to shape the microenvironment toward a pro-inflammatory one, enhancing neuronal damage. In this review, we dissect the current state-of-the-art knowledge of the microglial dialogue with other cell populations as one of the principal hallmarks of ALS progression. Particularly, we deeply investigate the microglia crosstalk with astrocytes and immune cells reportingin vitroandin vivostudies related to ALS mouse models and human patients. At last, we highlight the current experimental therapeutic approaches that aim to modulate microglial phenotype to revert the microenvironment, thus counteracting ALS progression.Copyright © 2023 Calafatti, Cocozza, Limatola and Garofalo."
,37592121,NA,NA,"Circulatory shock is defined syndromically as hypotension associated with tissue hypoperfusion and often subcategorized according to hemodynamic profile (e.g., distributive, cardiogenic, hypovolemic) and etiology (e.g., infection, myocardial infarction, trauma, among others). These shock subgroups are generally considered homogeneous entities in research and clinical practice. This current definition fails to consider the complex pathophysiology of shock and the influence of patient heterogeneity. Recent translational evidence highlights previously under-appreciated heterogeneity regarding the underlying pathways with distinct host-response patterns in circulatory shock syndromes. This heterogeneity may confound the interpretation of trial results as a given treatment may preferentially impact distinct subgroups. Re-analyzing results of major 'neutral' treatment trials from the perspective of biological mechanisms (i.e., host-response signatures) may reveal treatment effects in subgroups of patients that share treatable traits (i.e., specific biological signatures that portend a predictable response to a given treatment). In this review, we discuss the emerging literature suggesting the existence of distinct biomarker-based host-response patterns of circulatory shock syndrome independent of etiology or hemodynamic profile. We further review responses to newly prescribed treatments in the intensive care unit designed to personalize treatments (biomarker-driven or endotype-driven patient selection in support of future clinical trials).© 2023.

,37649712,Computational approaches in rheumatic diseases - Deciphering complex spatio-temporal cell interactions.,Comput Struct Biotechnol J,"Inflammatory arthritis, including rheumatoid (RA), and psoriatic (PsA) arthritis, are clinically and immunologically heterogeneous diseases with no identified cure. Chronic inflammation of the synovial tissue ushers loss of function of the joint that severely impacts the patient's quality of life, eventually leading to disability and life-threatening comorbidities. The pathogenesis of synovial inflammation is the consequence of compounded immune and stromal cell interactions influenced by genetic and environmental factors. Deciphering the complexity of the synovial cellular landscape has accelerated primarily due to the utilisation of bulk and single cell RNA sequencing. Particularly the capacity to generate cell-cell interaction networks could reveal evidence of previously unappreciated processes leading to disease. However, there is currently a lack of universal nomenclature as a result of varied experimental and technological approaches that discombobulates the study of synovial inflammation. While spatial transcriptomic analysis that combines anatomical information with transcriptomic data of synovial tissue biopsies promises to provide more insights into disease pathogenesis, in vitro functional assays with single-cell resolution will be required to validate current bioinformatic applications. In order to provide a comprehensive approach and translate experimental data to clinical practice, a combination of clinical and molecular data with machine learning has the potential to enhance patient stratification and identify individuals at risk of arthritis that would benefit from early therapeutic intervention. This review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the effect of computational approaches in deciphering synovial inflammation pathogenesis and discuss the impact that further experimental and novel computational tools may have on therapeutic target identification and drug development.© 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of Research Network of Computational and Structural Biotechnology."
,37480402,Single-cell multi-omics profiling reveals key regulatory mechanisms that poise germinal vesicle oocytes for maturation in pigs.,Cell Mol Life Sci,"The molecular mechanisms controlling the transition from meiotic arrest to meiotic resumption in mammalian oocytes have not been fully elucidated. Single-cell omics technology provides a new opportunity to decipher the early molecular events of oocyte growth in mammals. Here we focused on analyzing oocytes that were collected from antral follicles in different diameters of porcine pubertal ovaries, and used single-cell M&T-seq technology to analyze the nuclear DNA methylome and cytoplasmic transcriptome in parallel for 62 oocytes. 10× Genomics single-cell transcriptomic analyses were also performed to explore the bi-directional cell-cell communications within antral follicles. A new pipeline, methyConcerto, was developed to specifically and comprehensively characterize the methylation profile and allele-specific methylation events for a single-cell methylome. We characterized the gene expressions and DNA methylations of individual oocyte in porcine antral follicle, and both active and inactive gene's bodies displayed high methylation levels, thereby enabled defining two distinct types of oocytes. Although the methylation levels of Type II were higher than that of Type I, Type II contained nearly two times more of cytoplasmic transcripts than Type I. Moreover, the imprinting methylation patterns of Type II were more dramatically divergent than Type I, and the gene expressions and DNA methylations of Type II were more similar with that of MII oocytes. The crosstalk between granulosa cells and Type II oocytes was active, and these observations revealed that Type II was more poised for maturation. We further confirmed Insulin Receptor Substrate-1 in insulin signaling pathway is a key regulator on maturation by in vitro maturation experiments. Our study provides new insights into the regulatory mechanisms between meiotic arrest and meiotic resumption in mammalian oocytes. We also provide a new analytical package for future single-cell methylomics study.© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
,37442235,Spontaneous histone exchange between nucleosomes.,J Biol Chem,"The nucleosome is the fundamental gene-packing unit in eukaryotes. Nucleosomes comprise ∼147 bp DNA wrapped around an octameric histone protein core composed of two H2A-H2B dimers and one (H3-H4)2tetramer. The strong yet flexible DNA-histone interactions are the physical basis of the dynamic regulation of genes packaged in chromatin. The dynamic nature of DNA-histone interactions also implies that nucleosomes dissociate DNA-histone contacts both transiently and repeatedly. This kinetic instability may lead to spontaneous nucleosome disassembly or histone exchange between nucleosomes. At high nucleosome concentrations, nucleosome-nucleosome collisions and subsequent histone exchange would be a more likely event, where nucleosomes could act as their own histone chaperone. This spontaneous histone exchange could serve as a mechanism for maintaining overall chromatin stability, although it has never been reported. Here we employed three-color single-molecule FRET (smFRET) to demonstrate that histone H2A-H2B dimers are exchanged spontaneously between nucleosomes on a time scale of a few tens of seconds at a physiological nucleosome concentration. We show that the rate of histone exchange increases at a higher monovalent salt concentration, with histone-acetylated nucleosomes, and in the presence of histone chaperone Nap1, while it remains unchanged at a higher temperature, and decreases upon DNA methylation. These results support the notion of histone exchange via transient and repetitive partial disassembly of the nucleosome and corroborate spontaneous histone diffusion in a compact chromatin context, modulating the local concentrations of histone modifications and variants.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

,37649077,A DNA adenine demethylase impairs PRC2-mediated repression of genes marked by a specific chromatin signature.,Genome Biol,"The Fe (II)- and α-ketoglutarate-dependent AlkB family dioxygenases are implicated in nucleotide demethylation. AlkB homolog1 (ALKBH1) is shown to demethylate DNA adenine methylation (6mA) preferentially from single-stranded or unpaired DNA, while its demethylase activity and function in the chromatin context are unclear.Here, we find that loss-of-function of the rice ALKBH1 gene leads to increased 6mA in the R-loop regions of the genome but has a limited effect on the overall 6mA level. However, in the context of mixed tissues, rather than on individual loci, the ALKBH1 mutation or overexpression mainly affects the expression of genes with a specific combination of chromatin modifications in the body region marked with H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 but depleted of DNA CG methylation. In the similar context of mixed tissues, further analysis reveals that the ALKBH1 protein preferentially binds to genes marked by the chromatin signature and has a function to maintain a high H3K4me3/H3K27me3 ratio by impairing the binding of Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) to the targets, which is required for both the basal and stress-induced expression of the genes.Our findings unravel a function of ALKBH1 to control the balance between the antagonistic histone methylations for gene activity and provide insight into the regulatory mechanism of PRC2-mediated H3K27me3 deposition within the gene body region.© 2023.

,37644049,NA,NA,"Mobility of transposable elements (TEs) frequently leads to insertional mutations in functional DNA regions. In the potentially immortal germline, TEs are effectively suppressed by the Piwi-piRNA pathway. However, in the genomes of ageing somatic cells lacking the effects of the pathway, TEs become increasingly mobile during the adult lifespan, and their activity is associated with genomic instability. Whether the progressively increasing mobilization of TEs is a cause or a consequence of ageing remains a fundamental problem in biology. Here we show that in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, the downregulation of active TE families extends lifespan. Ectopic activation of Piwi proteins in the soma also promotes longevity. Furthermore, DNA N6-adenine methylation at TE stretches gradually rises with age, and this epigenetic modification elevates their transcription as the animal ages. These results indicate that TEs represent a novel genetic determinant of ageing, and that N6-adenine methylation plays a pivotal role in ageing control.© 2023. Springer Nature Limited."
,37554202,Functions and mechanisms of protein lysine butyrylation (Kbu): Therapeutic implications in human diseases.,Genes Dis,"Post-translational modifications (PTM) are covalent modifications of proteins or peptides caused by proteolytic cleavage or the attachment of moieties to one or more amino acids. PTMs play essential roles in biological function and regulation and have been linked with several diseases. Modifications of protein acylation (Kac), a type of PTM, are known to induce epigenetic regulatory processes that promote various diseases. Thus, an increasing number of studies focusing on acylation modifications are being undertaken. Butyrylation (Kbu) is a new acylation process found in animals and plants. Kbu has been recently linked to the onset and progression of several diseases, such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and vascular dementia. Moreover, the mode of action of certain drugs used in the treatment of lymphoma and colon cancer is based on the regulation of butyrylation levels, suggesting that butyrylation may play a therapeutic role in these diseases. In addition, butyrylation is also commonly involved in rice gene expression and thus plays an important role in the growth, development, and metabolism of rice. The tools and analytical methods that could be utilized for the prediction and detection of lysine butyrylation have also been investigated. This study reviews the potential role of histone Kbu, as well as the mechanisms underlying this process. It also summarizes various enzymes and analytical methods associated with Kbu, with the goal of providing new insights into the role of Kbu in gene regulation and diseases.© 2022 The Authors.

,37670250,Impact of media compositions and culture systems on the immunophenotypes of patient-derived breast cancer cells.,BMC Cancer,"Heterogeneous tumor cells are thought to be a significant factor in the failure of endocrine therapy in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) cancers. Culturing patient-derived breast cancer cells (PDBCCs) provides an invaluable tool in pre-clinical and translational research for the heterogeneity of cancer cells. This study aimed to investigate the effects of different media components and culture methods on the BCSC-associated immunophenotypes and gene expression in ER + PDBCCs.Ten patients with ER + breast cancer were employed in this study, six of whom had neoadjuvant chemotherapy and four of whom did not. PDBCCs were isolated by enzymatic methods using collagen I and hyaluronidase. PDBCCs were grown as monolayers in mediums with different compositions and as multicellular spheroid in a suspended condition. Collagen I-coated plate and ultralow attachment plate coated with polymer-X were used for monolayer and spheroid culture. Flow cytometry, immunofluorescent staining, RT-PCR, and RNA-sequencing were employed to examine the immunophenotype and genetic profile of PDBCCs.More than 95% of PDBCCs sustain EpCAM high/+/fibroblast marker- phenotypes in monolayer conditions by subculturing 3-4 times. A83-01 removal induced senescent cells with high β-galactosidase activity. PDBCCs grown as monolayers were characterized by the majority of cells having an EpCAM+/CD49f + phenotype. Compared to full media in monolayer culture, EGF removal increased EpCAM+/CD49f - phenotype (13.8-fold, p = 0.028), whereas R-spondin removal reduced it (0.8-fold, p = 0.02). A83-01 removal increased EpCAM+/CD24 + phenotype (1.82-fold, p = 0.023) and decreased EpCAM low/-/CD44+/CD24- phenotype (0.45-fold, p = 0.026). Compared to monolayer, spheroid resulted in a significant increase in the population with EpCAM-/CD49+ (14.6-fold, p = 0.006) and EpCAM low/-/CD44+/CD24- phenotypes (4.16-fold, p = 0.022) and ALDH high activity (9.66-fold, p = 0.037). ALDH1A and EMT-related genes were upregulated. In RNA-sequencing analysis between spheroids and monolayers, a total of 561 differentially expressed genes (2-fold change, p < 0.05) were enriched in 27 KEGG pathways including signaling pathways regulating pluripotency of stem cells. In a recurrence-free survival analysis based on the Kaplan-Meier Plotter database of the up-and down-regulated genes identified in spheroids, 15 up-, and 14 down-regulated genes were associated with poor prognosis of breast cancer patients.The media composition and spheroid culture method change in the BCSCs and EMT markers of PDBCCs, implying the importance of defining the media composition and culture method for studying PDBCCs in vitro.© 2023.

However, which inflammatory markers are the best predictors of DLBCL prognosis is still unclear. In this study, we aimed to create a nomogram based on the best inflammatory markers and clinical indicators to predict the overall survival of patients with DLBCL.Patients and methods:We analyzed data from 423 DLBCL patients from two institutions and divided them into a training set, an internal validation set, and an external validation set (n = 228, 97, and 98, respectively). The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator and Cox regression analysis were used to develop nomograms. We assessed model fit using the Akaike information criterion and Bayesian information criterion. The concordance index (C-index), calibration curve, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and decision curve analysis (DCA) were used to assess the nomogram's predictive performance and clinical net benefit and compared with the International Prognostic Index (IPI) and National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)-IPI.Results:The inclusion variables for the nomogram model were age, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, lactate dehydrogenase level, the systemic immune-inflammation index (SII), the prognostic nutritional index (PNI), and β-2 microglobulin (β-2 MG) level. In the training cohort, the nomogram showed better goodness of fit than the IPI and NCCN-IPI. The C-index of the nomogram (0.804, 95% CI: 0.751-0.857) outperformed the IPI (0.690, 95% CI: 0.629-0.751) and NCCN-IPI (0.691, 95% CI: 0.632-0.750). The calibration curve, ROC curve, and DCA curve analysis showed that the nomogram has satisfactory predictive power and clinical utility. Similar results were found in the validation cohort.Conclusion:The nomogram integrated with the clinical characteristics and inflammatory markers is beneficial to predict the prognosis of patients with DLBCL."

This disease is featured by a progressive dilation of the abdominal aorta, boosted by atherosclerosis, ageing, and smoking as major risk factors. Aneurysm growth increases the risk of aortic rupture, a life-threatening emergency with high mortality rates. Despite the increasing progress in our knowledge about the etiopathology of AAA, an effective pharmacological treatment against this disorder remains elusive and surgical repair is still the unique available therapeutic approach for high-risk patients. Meanwhile, there is no medical alternative for patients with small aneurysms but close surveillance. Clinical trials assessing the efficacy of antihypertensive agents, statins, doxycycline, or anti-platelet drugs, among others, failed to demonstrate a clear benefit limiting AAA growth, while data from ongoing clinical trials addressing the benefit of metformin on aneurysm progression are eagerly awaited.

However, the biological processes underlying FAP expression in tumor progression and tumor immunity have not been fully elucidated.We utilized RNA-seq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) to perform differential analysis of FAP expression in tumor tissues and matched-normal tissues. The relationship between FAP expression and clinical prognosis, DNA methylation, and tumor-infiltrating immune cells in pan-cancer was assessed using R Studio (version 4.2.1). Additionally, we employed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and gene set variation analysis (GSVA) to investigate the biological functions and pathways associated with FAP expression.FAP exhibits high expression in most malignancies, albeit to a lesser extent in CESC, KICH, UCEC, SKCM, THCA, and UCS. Furthermore, FAP is either positively or negatively associated with the prognosis of several malignancies. In seven types of cancer, FAP expression is positively correlated with DNA methylation. CIBERSORT analysis revealed an inverse correlation between FAP expression and T cells, B cells, monocytes, and NK cells, while it exhibited a positive correlation with M0, M1, and M2 macrophages. Enrichment analysis further demonstrated that FAP modulates the cell cycle, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process, angiogenesis, and immune-related functions and pathways.Our findings indicate a close relationship between FAP expression and tumorigenesis as well as tumor immunity. FAP has the potential to serve as a diagnostic, prognostic, and immunotherapy marker."
,37564640,NA,NA,"C-reactive protein (CRP) is well-recognized as a sensitive biomarker of inflammation. Association of elevations in plasma/serum CRP level with disease state has received considerable attention, even though CRP is not a specific indicator of a single disease state. Circulating CRP levels have been monitored with a varying degree of success to gauge disease severity or to predict disease progression and outcome. Elevations in CRP level have been implicated as a useful marker to identify patients at risk for cardiovascular disease and certain cancers, and to guide therapy in a context-dependent manner. Since even strong associations do not establish causality, the pathogenic role of CRP has often been over-interpreted. CRP functions as an important modulator of host defense against bacterial infection, tissue injury and autoimmunity. CRP exists in conformationally distinct forms, which exhibit distinct functional properties and help explaining the diverse, often contradictory effects attributed to CRP. In particular, dissociation of native pentameric CRP into its subunits, monomeric CRP, unmasks ""hidden"" pro-inflammatory activities in pentameric CRP. Here, we review recent advances in CRP targeting strategies, therapeutic lowering of circulating CRP level and development of CRP antagonists, and a conformation change inhibitor in particular. We will also discuss their therapeutic potential in mitigating the deleterious actions attributed to CRP under various pathologies, including cardiovascular, pulmonary and autoimmune diseases and cancer.Copyright © 2023 Rizo-Téllez, Sekheri and Filep."

Linear or polynomial regression models were simulated to determine the best fitted age-related function. The metrics were compared with human equivalents in published reports.Macaques exhibited a postnatal eye growth pattern similar to humans, characterized by continuous eye extension coordinated with dramatic reshaping of the lens but not the cornea. The age-related growth of lens thickness (LT), anterior chamber depth (ACD), and axis length (AL) exhibited nonlinear and bipolar patterns. The inflection points were 10 to 12 years old for LT and ACD and 13 to 15 years old for AL in macaques, which were comparable in chronological age at a ratio of ∼1: ratio with that in humans. In contrast, the speed of aging, including the increase in lens density and the decrease in retinal nerve fiber layer thickness, was comparable in relative age at a ratio of ∼1:3 according to the differences in lifespan between macaques and humans. Lens density was a robust indicator for the aging process.Macaque eyes recapitulated the age-related process of human eyes to varying extents with different growth and aging rates. Chronological age or relative age should be considered in different scenarios when macaques are included in preclinical studies."

Comprehensive study requires single-cell whole genome amplification, with several methods available, prior to sequencing. We compared PicoPLEX with two recent adaptations of multiple displacement amplification (MDA): primary template-directed amplification (PTA) and droplet MDA, across 93 human brain cortical nuclei. We demonstrated different properties for each, with PTA providing the broadest amplification, PicoPLEX the most even, and distinct chimeric profiles. Furthermore, we performed CNV calling on two brains with multiple system atrophy and one control brain using different reference genomes. We found that 38% of brain cells have at least one Mb-scale CNV, with some supported by bulk sequencing or single-cells from other brain regions. Our study highlights the importance of selecting whole genome amplification method and reference genome for CNV calling, while supporting the existence of somatic CNVs in healthy and diseased human brain."
,37584660,scNCL: transferring labels from scRNA-seq to scATAC-seq data with neighborhood contrastive regularization.,Bioinformatics,"scATAC-seq has enabled chromatin accessibility landscape profiling at the single-cell level, providing opportunities for determining cell-type-specific regulation codes. However, high dimension, extreme sparsity, and large scale of scATAC-seq data have posed great challenges to cell-type identification. Thus, there has been a growing interest in leveraging the well-annotated scRNA-seq data to help annotate scATAC-seq data. However, substantial computational obstacles remain to transfer information from scRNA-seq to scATAC-seq, especially for their heterogeneous features.We propose a new transfer learning method, scNCL, which utilizes prior knowledge and contrastive learning to tackle the problem of heterogeneous features. Briefly, scNCL transforms scATAC-seq features into gene activity matrix based on prior knowledge. Since feature transformation can cause information loss, scNCL introduces neighborhood contrastive learning to preserve the neighborhood structure of scATAC-seq cells in raw feature space. To learn transferable latent features, scNCL uses a feature projection loss and an alignment loss to harmonize embeddings between scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq. Experiments on various datasets demonstrated that scNCL not only realizes accurate and robust label transfer for common types, but also achieves reliable detection of novel types. scNCL is also computationally efficient and scalable to million-scale datasets. Moreover, we prove scNCL can help refine cell-type annotations in existing scATAC-seq atlases.The source code and data used in this paper can be found in https://github.com/CSUBioGroup/scNCL-release.© The Author(s) 2023.

Understanding principles of multiscale dynamics requires simultaneous monitoring of signals in multiple, distributed network nodes. Combining optical and electrical recordings of brain activity is promising for collecting data across multiple scales and can reveal aspects of coordinated dynamics invisible to standard, single-modality approaches. We review recent progress in combining opto- and electrophysiology, focusing on mouse studies that shed new light on the function of single neurons by embedding their activity in the context of brain-wide activity patterns. Optical and electrical readouts can be tailored to desired scales to tackle specific questions. For example, fast dynamics in single cells or local populations recorded with multi-electrode arrays can be related to simultaneously acquired optical signals that report activity in specified subpopulations of neurons, in non-neuronal cells, or in neuromodulatory pathways. Conversely, two-photon imaging can be used to densely monitor activity in local circuits while sampling electrical activity in distant brain areas at the same time. The refinement of combined approaches will continue to reveal previously inaccessible and under-appreciated aspects of coordinated brain activity.© 2023 The Authors."

In particular, geospatial analyses, which have been developed and refined for decades, have yet to be fully adapted and applied to spatial single-cell analysis. We introduce the Voyager platform, which systematically brings the geospatial ESDA tradition to (spatial) -omics, with local, bivariate, and multivariate spatial methods not yet commonly applied to spatial -omics, united by a uniform user interface. Using Voyager, we showcase biological insights that can be derived with its methods, such as biologically relevant negative spatial autocorrelation. Underlying Voyager is the SpatialFeatureExperiment data structure, which combines Simple Feature with SingleCellExperiment and AnnData to represent and operate on geometries bundled with gene expression data.

By leveraging the natural anisotropy, we present a deep self-learning method termed Self-Net that significantly improves the resolution of axial images by using the lateral images from the same raw dataset as rational targets. By incorporating unsupervised learning for realistic anisotropic degradation and supervised learning for high-fidelity isotropic recovery, our method can effectively suppress the hallucination with substantially enhanced image quality compared to previously reported methods. In the experiments, we show that Self-Net can reconstruct high-fidelity isotropic 3D images from organelle to tissue levels via raw images from various microscopy platforms, e.g., wide-field, laser-scanning, or super-resolution microscopy. For the first time, Self-Net enables isotropic whole-brain imaging at a voxel resolution of 0.2 × 0.2 × 0.2 μm3, which addresses the last-mile problem of data quality in single-neuron morphology visualization and reconstruction with minimal effort and cost. Overall, Self-Net is a promising approach to overcoming the inherent resolution anisotropy for all classes of 3D fluorescence microscopy.© 2023.

,37664036,New insights into molecular signaling pathways and current advancements in prostate cancer diagnostics & therapeutics.,Front Oncol,"Prostate adenocarcinoma accounts for more than 20% of deaths among males due to cancer. It is the fifth-leading cancer diagnosed in males across the globe. The mortality rate is quite high due to prostate cancer. Despite the fact that advancements in diagnostics and therapeutics have been made, there is a lack of effective drugs. Metabolic pathways are altered due to the triggering of androgen receptor (AR) signaling pathways, and elevated levels of dihydrotestosterone are produced due to defects in AR signaling that accelerate the growth of prostate cancer cells. Further, PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways interact with AR signaling pathway and act as precursors to promote prostate cancer. Prostate cancer therapy has been classified into luminal A, luminal B, and basal subtypes. Therapeutic drugs inhibiting dihydrotestosterone and PI3K have shown to give promising results to combat prostate cancer. Many second-generation Androgen receptor signaling antagonists are given either as single agent or with the combination of other drugs. In order to develop a cure for metastasized prostate cancer cells, Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is applied by using surgical or chemical methods. In many cases, Prostatectomy or local radiotherapy are used to control metastasized prostate cancer. However, it has been observed that after 1.5 years to 2 years of Prostatectomy or castration, there is reoccurrence of prostate cancer and high incidence of castration resistant prostate cancer is seen in population undergone ADT. It has been observed that Androgen derivation therapy combined with drugs like abiraterone acetate or docetaxel improve overall survival rate in metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) patients. Scientific investigations have revealed that drugs inhibiting poly ADP Ribose polymerase (PARP) are showing promising results in clinical trials in the prostate cancer population with mCRPC and DNA repair abnormalities. Recently, RISUG adv (reversible inhibition of sperm under guidance) has shown significant results against prostate cancer cell lines and MTT assay has validated substantial effects of this drug against PC3 cell lines. Current review paper highlights the advancements in prostate cancer therapeutics and new drug molecules against prostate cancer.

As a result, this study aimed to explore the clinicopathological and prognostic values of RACK1 expression in patients with cancer.PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Scopus were comprehensively explored from their inception to April 20, 2023, for selecting studies on the clinicopathological and prognostic role of RACK1 in patients with cancer that met the criteria for inclusion in this review. Pooled hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to assess the prognosis-predictive value of RACK1 expression, while pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs were used to evaluate the correlation between RACK1 expression and the clinicopathological characteristics of patients with cancer. The quality of the included studies was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale.Twenty-two studies (13 on prognosis and 20 on clinicopathological characteristics) were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. The findings indicated that high RACK1 expression was significantly associated with poor overall survival (HR = 1.62; 95% CI, 1.13-2.33;P = 0.009; I2= 89%) and reversely correlated with disease-free survival/recurrence-free survival (HR = 1.87; 95% CI, 1.22-2.88;P = 0.004; I2= 0%). Furthermore, increased RACK1 expression was significantly associated with lymphatic invasion/N+ stage (OR = 1.74; 95% CI, 1.04-2.90;P = 0.04; I2= 79%) of tumors.RACK1 may be a global predictive marker of poor prognosis in patients with cancer and unfavorable clinicopathological characteristics.

,37628978,"Prostate Cancer: Genetics, Epigenetics and the Need for Immunological Biomarkers.",Int J Mol Sci,"Epidemiological data highlight prostate cancer as a significant global health issue, with high incidence and substantial impact on patients' quality of life. The prevalence of this disease is associated with various factors, including age, heredity, and race. Recent research in prostate cancer genetics has identified several genetic variants that may be associated with an increased risk of developing the disease. However, despite the significance of these findings, genetic markers for prostate cancer are not currently utilized in clinical practice as reliable indicators of the disease. In addition to genetics, epigenetic alterations also play a crucial role in prostate cancer development. Aberrant DNA methylation, changes in chromatin structure, and microRNA (miRNA) expression are major epigenetic events that influence oncogenesis. Existing markers for prostate cancer, such as prostate-specific antigen (PSA), have limitations in terms of sensitivity and specificity. The cost of testing, follow-up procedures, and treatment for false-positive results and overdiagnosis contributes to the overall healthcare expenditure. Improving the effectiveness of prostate cancer diagnosis and prognosis requires either narrowing the risk group by identifying new genetic factors or enhancing the sensitivity and specificity of existing markers. Immunological biomarkers (both circulating and intra-tumoral), including markers of immune response and immune dysfunction, represent a potentially useful area of research for enhancing the diagnosis and prognosis of prostate cancer. Our review emphasizes the need for developing novel immunological biomarkers to improve the diagnosis, prognosis, and management of prostate cancer. We highlight the most recent achievements in the identification of biomarkers provided by circulating monocytes and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). We highlight that monocyte-derived and TAM-derived biomarkers can enable to establish the missing links between genetic predisposition, hormonal metabolism and immune responses in prostate cancer."

Most cancers are refractory to conventional diagnostic and chemotherapeutics due to their limited targetability, specificity, solubility, and side effects. The inherent ability of each cancer to evolve through various genetic and epigenetic transformations and metabolic reprogramming underlies therapeutic limitations. Though tumor microenvironments (TMEs) are quite well understood in some cancers, each microenvironment differs from the other in internal perturbations and metabolic skew thereby impeding the development of appropriate diagnostics, drugs, vaccines, and therapies. Cancer associated bioenergetics modulations regulate TME, angiogenesis, immune evasion, generation of resistant niches and tumor progression, and a thorough understanding is crucial to the development of metabolic therapies. However, this remains a missing element in cancer theranostics, necessitating the development of modalities that can be adapted for targetability, diagnostics and therapeutics. In this challenging scenario, nanomaterials are modular platforms for understanding TME and achieving successful theranostics. Several nanoscale particles have been successfully researched in animal models, quite a few have reached clinical trials, and some have achieved clinical success. Nanoparticles exhibit an intrinsic capability to interact with diverse biomolecules and modulate their functions. Furthermore, nanoparticles can be functionalized with receptors, modulators, and drugs to facilitate specific targeting with reduced toxicity. This review discusses the current understanding of different theranostic nanosystems, their synthesis, functionalization, and targetability for therapeutic modulation of bioenergetics, and metabolic reprogramming of the cancer microenvironment.

Observational studies cannot recognize whether thyroid cancer is independently associated with kidney disease. We performed the Mendelian randomization (MR) approach to genetically investigate the causality of thyroid cancer on immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN).We explored the causal effect of thyroid cancer on IgAN by MR analysis. Fifty-two genetic loci and single nucleotide polymorphisms were related to thyroid cancer. The primary approach in this MR analysis was the inverse variance weighted (IVW) method, and MR‒Egger was the secondary method. Weighted mode and penalized weighted median were used to analyze the sensitivity. In this study, the random-effect IVW models showed the causal impact of genetically predicted thyroid cancer across the IgAN risk (OR, 1.191; 95% CI, 1.131-1.253, P < 0.001). Similar results were also obtained in the weighted mode method (OR, 1.048; 95% CI, 0.980-1.120, P = 0.179) and penalized weighted median (OR, 1.185; 95% CI, 1.110-1.264, P < 0.001). However, the MR‒Egger method revealed that thyroid cancer decreased the risk of IgAN, but this difference was not significant (OR, 0.948; 95% CI, 0.855-1.051, P = 0.316). The leave-one-out sensitivity analysis did not reveal the driving influence of any individual SNP on the association between thyroid cancer and IgAN.The IVW model indicated a significant causality of thyroid cancer with IgAN. However, MR‒Egger had a point estimation in the opposite direction. According to the MR principle, the evidence of this study did not support a stable significant causal association between thyroid cancer and IgAN.

,37666988,NA,NA,"Modified parental histones are segregated symmetrically to daughter DNA strands during replication and can be inherited through mitosis. How this may sustain the epigenome and cell identity remains unknown. Here we show that transmission of histone-based information during DNA replication maintains epigenome fidelity and embryonic stem cell plasticity. Asymmetric segregation of parental histones H3-H4 in MCM2-2A mutants compromised mitotic inheritance of histone modifications and globally altered the epigenome. This included widespread spurious deposition of repressive modifications, suggesting elevated epigenetic noise. Moreover, H3K9me3 loss at repeats caused derepression and H3K27me3 redistribution across bivalent promoters correlated with misexpression of developmental genes. MCM2-2A mutation challenged dynamic transitions in cellular states across the cell cycle, enhancing naïve pluripotency and reducing lineage priming in G1. Furthermore, developmental competence was diminished, correlating with impaired exit from pluripotency. Collectively, this argues that epigenetic inheritance of histone modifications maintains a correctly balanced and dynamic chromatin landscape able to support mammalian cell differentiation.© 2023.

We hypothesized that UCNEs have unique dinucleotide (DN) composition and arrangements compared to the rest of the genome. A total of 4272 human UCNE sequences were analyzed computationally and compared with the whole genomes of human, chicken, zebrafish, and fly. Statistical analysis was performed to assess the non-randomness in DN spacing arrangements within the entire human genome and within UCNEs. Significant non-randomness in DN spacing arrangements was observed in the entire human genome. Additionally, UCNEs exhibited distinct patterns in DN arrangements compared to the rest of the genome. Approximately 83% of all DN pairs within UCNEs showed significant (>10%) non-random genomic arrangements at short distances (2-6 nucleotides) relative to each other. At the extremes, non-randomness in DN spacing distances deviated up to 40% from expected values and were frequently associated with GpC, CpG, ApT, and GpG/CpC dinucleotides. The described peculiarities in DN arrangements have persisted for hundreds of millions of years in vertebrates. These distinctive patterns may suggest that UCNEs have specific DNA conformations."

Most findings of aberrant DNA methylation in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) are array based with limited coverage and resolution, and mainly explored by human papillomavirus (HPV) status, ignoring the high heterogeneity of this disease. In this study, we performed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing on a well-studied HNSCC cohort (n= 36) and investigated the methylation changes between fine-scaled HNSCC subtypes in relation to genomic instability, repetitive elements, gene expression, and key carcinogenic pathways. The previously observed hypermethylation phenotype in HPV-positive (HPV+) tumors compared with HPV-negative tumors was robustly present in the immune-strong (IMU) HPV+ subtype but absent in the highly keratinized (KRT) HPV+ subtype. Methylation levels of IMU tumors were significantly higher in repetitive elements, and methylation showed a significant correlation with genomic stability, consistent with the IMU subtype having more genomic stability and better prognosis. Expression quantitative trait methylation (cis-eQTM) analysis revealed extensive functionally-relevant differences, and differential methylation pathway analysis recapitulated gene expression pathway differences between subtypes. Consistent with their characteristics, KRT and HPV-negative tumors had high regulatory potential for multiple regulators of keratinocyte differentiation, which positively correlated with an expression-based keratinization score. Together, our findings revealed distinct mechanisms of carcinogenesis between subtypes in HPV+ HNSCC and uncovered previously ignored epigenomic differences and clinical implications, illustrating the importance of fine-scale subtype analysis in cancer.This study revealed that the previously observed hypermethylation of HPV(+) HNSCC is due solely to the IMU subtype, illustrating the importance of fine-scale subtype analysis in such a heterogeneous disease.

Individual CpG site-based TOO deconvolution resulted in a significantly increased proportion of undetermined TOO with the double-stranded method (urine: 32.3% vs. 1.9%; plasma: 5.9% vs. 0.04%;p≤ 0.0001), but no major differences in proportions of individual cell types. In contrast, fragment-level deconvolution led to multiple cell types, with significantly different TOO proportions between the two methods. This study thus outlines potential limitations of double-stranded library preparation for methylation analysis of cfDNA especially for urinary cfDNA. While the double-stranded method allows jagged end analysis in addition to TOO analysis, it leads to significant methylation bias in urinary cfDNA, which single-stranded methods can overcome."
,37569861,Exploring Molecular Targets for Mitochondrial Therapies in Neurodegenerative Diseases.,Int J Mol Sci,"The progressive deterioration of function and structure of brain cells in neurodegenerative diseases is accompanied by mitochondrial dysfunction, affecting cellular metabolism, intracellular signaling, cell differentiation, morphogenesis, and the activation of programmed cell death. However, most of the efforts to develop therapies for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease have focused on restoring or maintaining the neurotransmitters in affected neurons, removing abnormal protein aggregates through immunotherapies, or simply treating symptomatology. However, none of these approaches to treating neurodegeneration can stop or reverse the disease other than by helping to maintain mental function and manage behavioral symptoms. Here, we discuss alternative molecular targets for neurodegeneration treatments that focus on mitochondrial functions, including regulation of calcium ion (Ca2+) transport, protein modification, regulation of glucose metabolism, antioxidants, metal chelators, vitamin supplementation, and mitochondrial transference to compromised neurons. After pre-clinical evaluation and studies in animal models, some of these therapeutic compounds have advanced to clinical trials and are expected to have positive outcomes in subjects with neurodegeneration. These mitochondria-targeted therapeutic agents are an alternative to established or conventional molecular targets that have shown limited effectiveness in treating neurodegenerative diseases."
,37624788,Univariable and multivariable mendelian randomization study revealed the modifiable risk factors of urolithiasis.,PLoS One,"Urolithiasis is a common urological disease with increasing incidence worldwide, and preventing its risk poses significant challenges. Here, we used Mendelian randomization (MR) framework to genetically assess the causal nature of multifaceted risk factors on urolithiasis.17 potential risk factors associated with urolithiasis were collected from recently published observational studies, which can be categorized basically into lifestyle factors and circulating biomarkers. The instrumental variables of risk factors were selected from large-scale genome-wide association studies (N ≤ 607,291). Summary-level data on urolithiasis were obtained from UK Biobank (UKB) (3,625 cases and 459,308 noncases) and the FinnGen consortium (5,347 cases and 213,445 noncases). The univariable and multivariable MR analyses were applied to evaluate the causal, independent effect of these potential risk factors upon urolithiasis. Effects from the two consortia were combined by the meta-analysis methods.Higher genetically predicted sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG, OR, 0.708; 95% CI, 0.555 to 0.903), estradiol (OR, 0.179; 95% CI, 0.042 to 0.751), tea intake (OR, 0.550; 95% CI, 0.345 to 0.878), alcoholic drinks per week (OR, 0.992; 95% CI, 0.987 to 0.997), and some physical activity (e.g., swimming, cycling, keeping fit, and bowling, OR, 0.054; 95% CI, 0.008 to 0.363) were significantly associated with a lower risk of urolithiasis. In the Multivariate Mendelian Randomization (MVMR) analyses, the significant causal associations between estradiol, SHBG, tea intake, and alcoholic drinks per week with urolithiasis were robust even after adjusting for potential confounding variables. However, the previously observed causal association between other exercises and urolithiasis was no longer significant after adjusting for these factors.The univariable and multivariable MR findings highlight the independent and significant roles of estradiol, SHBG, tea intake, and alcoholic drinks per week in the development of urolithiasis, which might provide a deeper insight into urolithiasis risk factors and supply potential preventative strategies.Copyright: © 2023 Fang et al.

,37419091,Multi-response Mendelian randomization: Identification of shared and distinct exposures for multimorbidity and multiple related disease outcomes.,Am J Hum Genet,"The existing framework of Mendelian randomization (MR) infers the causal effect of one or multiple exposures on one single outcome. It is not designed to jointly model multiple outcomes, as would be necessary to detect causes of more than one outcome and would be relevant to model multimorbidity or other related disease outcomes. Here, we introduce multi-response Mendelian randomization (MR2), an MR method specifically designed for multiple outcomes to identify exposures that cause more than one outcome or, conversely, exposures that exert their effect on distinct responses. MR2uses a sparse Bayesian Gaussian copula regression framework to detect causal effects while estimating the residual correlation between summary-level outcomes, i.e., the correlation that cannot be explained by the exposures, and vice versa. We show both theoretically and in a comprehensive simulation study how unmeasured shared pleiotropy induces residual correlation between outcomes irrespective of sample overlap. We also reveal how non-genetic factors that affect more than one outcome contribute to their correlation. We demonstrate that by accounting for residual correlation, MR2has higher power to detect shared exposures causing more than one outcome. It also provides more accurate causal effect estimates than existing methods that ignore the dependence between related responses. Finally, we illustrate how MR2detects shared and distinct causal exposures for five cardiovascular diseases in two applications considering cardiometabolic and lipidomic exposures and uncovers residual correlation between summary-level outcomes reflecting known relationships between cardiovascular diseases.Crown Copyright © 2023.

,37627332,High-Throughput Antibody Profiling Identifies Targets of Protective Immunity against P. falciparum Malaria in Thailand.,Biomolecules,"Malaria poses a significant global health challenge, resulting in approximately 600,000 deaths each year. Individuals living in regions with endemic malaria have the potential to develop partial immunity, thanks in part to the presence of anti-plasmodium antibodies. As efforts are made to optimize and implement strategies to reduce malaria transmission and ultimately eliminate the disease, it is crucial to understand how these interventions impact naturally acquired protective immunity. To shed light on this, our study focused on assessing antibody responses to a carefully curated library ofP. falciparumrecombinant proteins (n = 691) using samples collected from individuals residing in a low-malaria-transmission region of Thailand. We conducted the antibody assays using the AlphaScreen system, a high-throughput homogeneous proximity-based bead assay that detects protein interactions. We observed that out of the 691 variable surface and merozoite stage proteins included in the library, antibodies to 268 antigens significantly correlated with the absence of symptomatic malaria in an univariate analysis. Notably, the most prominent antigens identified wereP. falciparumerythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) domains. These results align with our previous research conducted in Uganda, suggesting that similar antigens like PfEMP1s might play a pivotal role in determining infection outcomes in diverse populations. To further our understanding, it remains critical to conduct functional characterization of these identified proteins, exploring their potential as correlates of protection or as targets for vaccine development."
,37451260,NA,NA,"Human gliogenesis remains poorly understood, and derivation of astrocytes from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) is inefficient and cumbersome. Here, we report controlled glial differentiation from hPSCs that bypasses neurogenesis, which otherwise precedes astrogliogenesis during brain development and in vitro differentiation. hPSCs were first differentiated into radial glial cells (RGCs) resembling resident RGCs of the fetal telencephalon, and modulation of specific cell signaling pathways resulted in direct and stepwise induction of key astroglial markers (NFIA, NFIB, SOX9, CD44, S100B, glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP]). Transcriptomic and genome-wide epigenetic mapping and single-cell analysis confirmed RGC-to-astrocyte differentiation, obviating neurogenesis and the gliogenic switch. Detailed molecular and cellular characterization experiments uncovered new mechanisms and markers for human RGCs and astrocytes. In summary, establishment of a glia-exclusive neural lineage progression model serves as a unique serum-free platform of manufacturing large numbers of RGCs and astrocytes for neuroscience, disease modeling (e.g., Alexander disease), and regenerative medicine.Published by Elsevier Inc."

Current approaches, such as Multiple Displacement Amplification (MDA), offer high genome coverage but limited multiplexing, which hinders large-scale spatial genomic studies. Here, we introduce barcoded MDA (bMDA), a technique that achieves high-coverage genomic analysis of low-input DNA while enhancing the multiplexing capabilities. By incorporating cell barcodes during MDA, bMDA streamlines library preparation in one pot, thereby overcoming a key bottleneck in spatial genomics. We apply bMDA to the integrative spatial analysis of triple-negative breast cancer tissues by examining copy number alterations, single nucleotide variations, structural variations, and kataegis signatures for each spatial microniche. This enables the assessment of subclonal evolutionary relationships within a spatial context. Therefore, bMDA has emerged as a scalable technology with the potential to advance the field of spatial genomics significantly.© 2023. Springer Nature Limited."

A variety of spatial technologies have been developed and/or commercialized, differing in spatial resolution, sensitivity, multiplexing capability, throughput and coverage. In this paper, we review key enabling spatial transcriptomic technologies and their applications as well as the perspective of the techniques and new emerging technologies that are developed to address current limitations of spatial methodologies.

,37577665,SpaRx: Elucidate single-cell spatial heterogeneity of drug responses for personalized treatment.,bioRxiv,"Spatial cellular heterogeneity contributes to differential drug responses in a tumor lesion and potential therapeutic resistance. Recent emerging spatial technologies such as CosMx SMI, MERSCOPE, and Xenium delineate the spatial gene expression patterns at the single cell resolution. This provides unprecedented opportunities to identify spatially localized cellular resistance and to optimize the treatment for individual patients. In this work, we present a graph-based domain adaptation model, SpaRx, to reveal the heterogeneity of spatial cellular response to drugs. SpaRx transfers the knowledge from pharmacogenomics profiles to single-cell spatial transcriptomics data, through hybrid learning with dynamic adversarial adaption. Comprehensive benchmarking demonstrates the superior and robust performance of SpaRx at different dropout rates, noise levels, and transcriptomics coverage. Further application of SpaRx to the state-of-art single-cell spatial transcriptomics data reveals that tumor cells in different locations of a tumor lesion present heterogenous sensitivity or resistance to drugs. Moreover, resistant tumor cells interact with themselves or the surrounding constituents to form an ecosystem for drug resistance. Collectively, SpaRx characterizes the spatial therapeutic variability, unveils the molecular mechanisms underpinning drug resistance, and identifies personalized drug targets and effective drug combinations.We have developed a novel graph-based domain adaption model named SpaRx, to reveal the heterogeneity of spatial cellular response to different types of drugs, which bridges the gap between pharmacogenomics knowledgebase and single-cell spatial transcriptomics data.SpaRx is developed tailored for single-cell spatial transcriptomics data and is provided available as a ready-to-use open-source software, which demonstrates high accuracy and robust performance.SpaRx uncovers that tumor cells located in different areas within tumor lesion exhibit varying levels of sensitivity or resistance to drugs. Moreover, SpaRx reveals that tumor cells interact with themselves and the surrounding microenvironment to form an ecosystem capable of drug resistance."
,37630804,Potential Epigenetic Effects of Human Milk on Infants' Neurodevelopment.,Nutrients,"The advantages of human milk feeding, especially in preterm babies, are well recognized. Infants' feeding with breast milk lowers the likelihood of developing a diverse range of non-communicable diseases later in life and it is also associated with improved neurodevelopmental outcomes. Although the precise mechanisms through which human milk feeding is linked with infants' neurodevelopment are still unknown, potential epigenetic effects of breast milk through its bioactive components, including non-coding RNAs, stem cells and microbiome, could at least partly explain this association. Micro- and long-non-coding RNAs, enclosed in milk exosomes, as well as breast milk stem cells, survive digestion, reach the circulation and can cross the blood-brain barrier. Certain non-coding RNAs potentially regulate genes implicated in brain development and function, whereas nestin-positive stem cells can possibly differentiate into neural cells or/and act as epigenetic regulators in the brain. Furthermore, breast milk microbiota contributes to the establishment of infant's gut microbiome, which is implicated in brain development via epigenetic modifications and key molecules' regulation. This narrative review provides an updated analysis of the relationship between breast milk feeding and infants' neurodevelopment via epigenetics, pointing out how breast milk's bioactive components could have an impact on the neurodevelopment of both full-term and preterm babies."
,37503007,ScreenDMT reveals linoleic acid diols replicably associate with BMI and stimulate adipocyte calcium fluxes.,bioRxiv,"Activating brown adipose tissue (BAT) improves systemic metabolism, making it a promising target for metabolic syndrome. An activator of BAT is 12,13-dihydroxy-9Z-octadecenoic acid (12,13-diHOME), which we previously identified to be inversely associated with body mass index (BMI) and which directly improves metabolism in other tissues. Here we profile plasma lipidomics from a cohort of 83 people and test which lipids' association with BMI replicates in a concordant direction using our novel tool ScreenDMT, whose power and validity we demonstrate via mathematical proofs and simulations. We find that the linoleic acid diols 12,13-diHOME and 9,10-diHOME both replicably inversely associate with BMI and mechanistically activate calcium fluxes in mouse brown and white adipocytes in vitro. ScreenDMT can be applied to test directional replication, directional mediation, and qualitative interactions, and our results identify 9,10-diHOME and the pathway stimulated by linoleic acid diols as candidate therapeutic targets to improve systemic metabolism."
,37559907,MOCSS: Multi-omics data clustering and cancer subtyping via shared and specific representation learning.,iScience,"Cancer is an extremely complex disease and each type of cancer usually has several different subtypes. Multi-omics data can provide more comprehensive biological information for identifying and discovering cancer subtypes. However, existing unsupervised cancer subtyping methods cannot effectively learn comprehensive shared and specific information of multi-omics data. Therefore, a novel method is proposed based on shared and specific representation learning. For each omics data, two autoencoders are applied to extract shared and specific information, respectively. To reduce redundancy and mutual interference, orthogonality constraint is introduced to separate shared and specific information. In addition, contrastive learning is applied to align the shared information and strengthen their consistency. Finally, the obtained shared and specific information for all samples are used for clustering tasks to achieve cancer subtyping. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively capture shared and specific information of multi-omics data and outperform other state-of-the-art methods on cancer subtyping.© 2023 The Author(s)."
,37660099,Themes and variations on piRNA-guided transposon control.,Mob DNA,"PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are responsible for preventing the movement of transposable elements in germ cells and protect the integrity of germline genomes. In this review, we examine the common elements of piRNA-guided silencing as well as the differences observed between species. We have categorized the mechanisms of piRNA biogenesis and function into modules. Individual PIWI proteins combine these modules in various ways to produce unique PIWI-piRNA pathways, which nevertheless possess the ability to perform conserved functions. This modular model incorporates conserved core mechanisms and accommodates variable co-factors. Adaptability is a hallmark of this RNA-based immune system. We believe that considering the differences in germ cell biology and resident transposons in different organisms is essential for placing the variations observed in piRNA biology into context, while still highlighting the conserved themes that underpin this process.© 2023.

,37610667,From parasites to partners: exploring the intricacies of host-transposon dynamics and coevolution.,Funct Integr Genomics,"Transposable elements, often referred to as ""jumping genes,"" have long been recognized as genomic parasites due to their ability to integrate and disrupt normal gene function and induce extensive genomic alterations, thereby compromising the host's fitness. To counteract this, the host has evolved a plethora of mechanisms to suppress the activity of the transposons. Recent research has unveiled the host-transposon relationships to be nuanced and complex phenomena, resulting in the coevolution of both entities. Transposition increases the mutational rate in the host genome, often triggering physiological pathways such as immune and stress responses. Current gene transfer technologies utilizing transposable elements have potential drawbacks, including off-target integration, induction of mutations, and modifications of cellular machinery, which makes an in-depth understanding of the host-transposon relationship imperative. This review highlights the dynamic interplay between the host and transposable elements, encompassing various factors and components of the cellular machinery. We provide a comprehensive discussion of the strategies employed by transposable elements for their propagation, as well as the mechanisms utilized by the host to mitigate their parasitic effects. Additionally, we present an overview of recent research identifying host proteins that act as facilitators or inhibitors of transposition. We further discuss the evolutionary outcomes resulting from the genetic interactions between the host and the transposable elements. Finally, we pose open questions in this field and suggest potential avenues for future research.© 2023.

,37651425,Backup transcription factor binding sites protect human genes from mutations in the promoter.,PLoS One,"This study was designed to test the idea that the regulatory regions of human genes have evolved to be resistant to the effects of mutations in their primary function, the control of gene expression. It is proposed that the transcription factor/transcription factor binding site (TF/TFBS) pair having the greatest effect on control of a gene is the one with the highest abundance among the regulatory elements. Other pairs would have the same effect on gene expression and would predominate in the event of a mutation in the most abundant pair. It is expected that the overall regulatory design proposed here will be highly resistant to mutagenic change that would otherwise affect expression of the gene. The idea was tested beginning with a database of 42 human genes highly specific for expression in brain. For each gene, the five most abundant TF/TFBS pairs were identified and compared in their TFBS occupancy as measured by their ChIP-seq signal. A similar signal was observed and interpreted as evidence that the TF/TFBS pairs can substitute for one another. TF/TFBS pairs were also compared in their ability to substitute for one another in their effect on the level of gene expression. The study of brain specific genes was complemented with the same analysis performed with 31 human liver specific genes. Like the study of brain genes, the liver results supported the view that TF/TFBS pairs in liver specific genes can substitute for one another in the event of mutagenic damage. Finally, the TFBSs in the brain specific and liver specific gene populations were compared with each other with the goal of identifying any brain selective or liver selective TFBSs. Of the 89 TFBSs in the pooled population, 58 were found only in brain specific but not liver specific genes, 8 only in liver specific but not brain specific genes and 23 were found in both brain and liver specific genes. The results were interpreted to emphasize the large number of TFBS in brain specific genes.Copyright: © 2023 Jay C. Brown.

Current machine learning tools often provide limited predictive performance and model interpretation in these settings. In the present study, we extend the application of REFINED-CNN from regression tasks to making survival predictions, by mapping high-dimensional RNA sequencing data into REFINED images which are conducive to CNN modeling. We show that the REFINED-CNN survival model can be easily adapted to new tasks of a similar nature (e.g., predicting on new cancer types) using transfer learning with a low number of patients. Furthermore, the model can also be interpreted both locally and globally through risk score back propagation that quantifies each feature (e.g., gene) importance in survival prediction task for the patient or cancer type of interest.© 2023 The Author(s)."
,37627927,NA,NA,"Radiomics refers to the acquisition of traces of quantitative features that are usually non-perceptible to human vision and are obtained from different imaging techniques and subsequently transformed into high-dimensional data. Diffuse midline gliomas (DMG) represent approximately 20% of pediatric CNS tumors, with a median survival of less than one year after diagnosis. We aimed to identify which radiomics can discriminate DMG tumor regions (viable tumor and peritumoral edema) from equivalent midline normal tissue (EMNT) in patients with the positive H3.F3K27M mutation, which is associated with a worse prognosis.This was a retrospective study. From a database of 126 DMG patients (children, adolescents, and young adults), only 12 had H3.3K27M mutation and available brain magnetic resonance DICOM file. The MRI T1 post-gadolinium and T2 sequences were uploaded to LIFEx software to post-process and extract radiomic features. Statistical analysis included normal distribution tests and the Mann-Whitney U test performed using IBM SPSS®(Version 27.0.0.1, International Business Machines Corp., Armonk, NY, USA), considering a significant statisticalp-value ≤ 0.05.EMNT vs. Tumor: From the T1 sequence 10 radiomics were identified, and 14 radiomics from the T2 sequence, but only one radiomic identified viable tumors in both sequences (p< 0.05) (DISCRETIZED_Q1). Peritumoral edema vs. EMNT: From the T1 sequence, five radiomics were identified, and four radiomics from the T2 sequence. However, four radiomics could discriminate peritumoral edema in both sequences (p< 0.05) (CONVENTIONAL_Kurtosis, CONVENTIONAL_ExcessKurtosis, DISCRETIZED_Kurtosis, and DISCRETIZED_ExcessKurtosis). There were no radiomics useful for distinguishing tumor tissue from peritumoral edema in both sequences.Less than 5% of the radiomic characteristics identified tumor regions of medical-clinical interest in T1 and T2 sequences of conventional magnetic resonance imaging.

,37546924,Multiscale modelling of chromatin 4D organization in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells.,bioRxiv,"SARS-CoV-2 is able to re-structure chromatin organization and alters the epigenomic landscape of the host genome, though the mechanisms that produce such changes are still poorly understood. Here, we investigate with polymer physics chromatin re-organization of the host genome, in space and time upon SARS-CoV-2 viral infection. We show that re-structuring of A/B compartments is well explained by a re-modulation of intra-compartment homotypic affinities, which leads to the weakening of A-A interactions and enhances A-B mixing. At TAD level, re-arrangements are physically described by a general reduction of the loop extrusion activity coupled with an alteration of chromatin phase-separation properties, resulting in more intermingling between different TADs and spread in space of TADs themselves. In addition, the architecture of loci relevant to the antiviral interferon (IFN) response, such as DDX58 or IFIT, results more variable within the 3D single-molecule population of the infected model, suggesting that viral infection leads to a loss of chromatin structural specificity. Analysis of time trajectories of pairwise gene-enhancer and higher-order contacts reveals that such variability derives from a more fluctuating dynamics in infected case, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 alters gene regulation by impacting the stability of the contact network in time. Overall, our study provides the first polymer-physics based 4D reconstruction of SARS-CoV-2 infected genome with mechanistic insights on the consequent gene mis-regulation."
,37577525,Continuous lifelong learning for modeling of gene regulation from single cell multiome data by leveraging atlas-scale external data.,bioRxiv,"Accurate context-specific Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) inference from genomics data is a crucial task in computational biology. However, existing methods face limitations, such as reliance on gene expression data alone, lower resolution from bulk data, and data scarcity for specific cellular systems. Despite recent technological advancements, including single-cell sequencing and the integration of ATAC-seq and RNA-seq data, learning such complex mechanisms from limited independent data points still presents a daunting challenge, impeding GRN inference accuracy. To overcome this challenge, we present LINGER (LIfelong neural Network for GEne Regulation), a novel deep learning-based method to infer GRNs from single-cell multiome data with paired gene expression and chromatin accessibility data from the same cell. LINGER incorporates both 1) atlas-scale external bulk data across diverse cellular contexts and 2) the knowledge of transcription factor (TF) motif matching tocis-regulatory elements as a manifold regularization to address the challenge of limited data and extensive parameter space in GRN inference. Our results demonstrate that LINGER achieves 2-3 fold higher accuracy over existing methods. LINGER reveals a complex regulatory landscape of genome-wide association studies, enabling enhanced interpretation of disease-associated variants and genes. Additionally, following the GRN inference from a reference sc-multiome data, LINGER allows for the estimation of TF activity solely from bulk or single-cell gene expression data, leveraging the abundance of available gene expression data to identify driver regulators from case-control studies. Overall, LINGER provides a comprehensive tool for robust gene regulation inference from genomics data, empowering deeper insights into cellular mechanisms."
,37614671,Day-night fluctuations in choroid plexus transcriptomics and cerebrospinal fluid metabolomics.,PNAS Nexus,"The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) provides mechanical protection for the brain and serves as a brain dispersion route for nutrients, hormones, and metabolic waste. The CSF secretion rate is elevated in the dark phase in both humans and rats, which could support the CSF flow along the paravascular spaces that may be implicated in waste clearance. The similar diurnal CSF dynamics pattern observed in the day-active human and the nocturnal rat suggests a circadian regulation of this physiological variable, rather than sleep itself. To obtain a catalog of potential molecular drivers that could provide the day-night-associated modulation of the CSF secretion rate, we determined the diurnal fluctuation in the rat choroid plexus transcriptomic profile with RNA-seq and in the CSF metabolomics with ultraperformance liquid chromatography combined with mass spectrometry. We detected significant fluctuation of 19 CSF metabolites and differential expression of 2,778 choroid plexus genes between the light and the dark phase, the latter of which encompassed circadian rhythm-related genes and several choroid plexus transport mechanisms. The fluctuating components were organized with joint pathway analysis, of which several pathways demonstrated diurnal regulation. Our results illustrate substantial transcriptional and metabolic light-dark phase-mediated changes taking place in the rat choroid plexus and its encircling CSF. The combined data provide directions toward future identification of the molecular pathways governing the fluctuation of this physiological process and could potentially be harnessed to modulate the CSF dynamics in pathology.© The Author(s) 2023.

,37648906,"The relationship between klotho, testosterone, and sexual health parameters among US adult men.",J Endocrinol Invest,"Klotho is a pleotropic hormone involved in a multitude of biological processes necessary for healthy aging, and affords protection from adverse events such as cardiovascular disease, inflammation, and various cancers. Emerging evidence suggests that klotho is also an important component of biochemical pathways that regulate hormone balance, which may include those pathways governing testosterone production and men's sexual health, though data are limited and results are mixed.Using a cohort of 767 men from the NHANES 2015-2016 survey cycle, we set out to quantify the association between serum klotho levels and serum testosterone levels, as well as clinical markers of men's sexual health (e.g., testosterone:estrogen ratio, bioavailable testosterone, and free testosterone).Multivariable linear and logistic regression models while controlling for potential confounders were constructed to quantify the relationship between serum klotho and testosterone, as well as between serum klotho and odds of low testosterone (serum testosterone < 300 ng/dL).A positive association was observed between serum klotho and testosterone (β = 0.18, p = 0.04). Serum klotho levels were also stratified into quartiles, and we observed statistically significant increases in testosterone for increasing quartile level of klotho using the first quartile as the reference group (β = 90.51, p = 0.001, β = 106.93, p = 0.002, β = 95.33, p = 0.03 for quartiles 2, 3, and 4, respectively). The average testosterone values by quartiles of klotho were 306.9 ng/dL, 390 ng/dL, 409.3 ng/dL, and 436.6 ng/dL, respectively. We modeled important proxies for sexual health including bioavailable and free testosterone, the testosterone:estradiol ratio, and C-reactive protein. Men in the second quartile of klotho had a significantly lower odds of an abnormal testosterone:estradiol ratio compared to the first quartile [OR = 0.18, 95% CI = (0.03, 0.98)].We observed null associations between continuous serum klotho and odds of low testosterone [OR = 1.0, 95% CI = (1.0, 1.0)], and when stratified by quartile, we observed a significant decrease in the odds of low testosterone for individuals in the second quartile of klotho compared to the first quartile [OR = 0.21, 95% CI = (0.05, 0.91)]. In addition, C-reactive protein was inversely associated with testosterone in men (β = - 4.65, p = 0.001), and inversely associated with quartiles of klotho (β = - 2.28, p = 0.04, β = - 2.22, p = 0.04, β = - 2.28, p = 0.03, for quartiles 2, 3, and 4, respectively).Our findings support previous studies suggesting a role for klotho in testosterone levels and sexual function among men. Future studies are warranted to corroborate these findings, determine clinical significance, and elucidate potential mechanisms underlying these associations.© 2023.

,37603743,NA,NA,"Metabolite levels shape cellular physiology and disease susceptibility, yet the general principles governing metabolome evolution are largely unknown. Here, we introduce a measure of conservation of individual metabolite levels among related species. By analyzing multispecies tissue metabolome datasets in phylogenetically diverse mammals and fruit flies, we show that conservation varies extensively across metabolites. Three major functional properties, metabolite abundance, essentiality, and association with human diseases predict conservation, highlighting a striking parallel between the evolutionary forces driving metabolome and protein sequence conservation. Metabolic network simulations recapitulated these general patterns and revealed that abundant metabolites are highly conserved due to their strong coupling to key metabolic fluxes in the network. Finally, we show that biomarkers of metabolic diseases can be distinguished from other metabolites simply based on evolutionary conservation, without requiring any prior clinical knowledge. Overall, this study uncovers simple rules that govern metabolic evolution in animals and implies that most tissue metabolome differences between species are permitted, rather than favored by natural selection. More broadly, our work paves the way toward using evolutionary information to identify biomarkers, as well as to detect pathogenic metabolome alterations in individual patients."
,37632661,Personalized Cancer Monitoring Assay for the Detection of ctDNA in Patients with Solid Tumors.,Mol Diagn Ther,"Highly sensitive molecular assays have been developed to detect plasma-based circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), and emerging evidence suggests their clinical utility for monitoring minimal residual disease and recurrent disease, providing prognostic information, and monitoring therapy responses in patients with solid tumors. The Invitae Personalized Cancer Monitoring™assay uses a patient-specific, tumor-informed variant signature identified through whole exome sequencing to detect ctDNA in peripheral blood of patients with solid tumors.The assay's tumor whole exome sequencing and ctDNA detection components were analytically validated using 250 unique human specimens and nine commercial reference samples that generated 1349 whole exome sequencing and cell-free DNA (cfDNA)-derived libraries. A comparison of tumor and germline whole exome sequencing was used to identify patient-specific tumor variant signatures and generate patient-specific panels, followed by targeted next-generation sequencing of plasma-derived cfDNA using the patient-specific panels with anchored multiplex polymerase chain reaction chemistry leveraging unique molecular identifiers.Whole exome sequencing resulted in overall sensitivity of 99.8% and specificity of > 99.9%. Patient-specific panels were successfully designed for all 63 samples (100%) with ≥ 20% tumor content and 24 (80%) of 30 samples with ≥ 10% tumor content. Limit of blank studies using 30 histologically normal, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens resulted in 100% expected panel design failure. The ctDNA detection component demonstrated specificity of > 99.9% and sensitivity of 96.3% for a combination of 10 ng of cfDNA input, 0.008% allele frequency, 50 variants on the patient-specific panels, and a baseline threshold. Limit of detection ranged from 0.008% allele frequency when utilizing 60 ng of cfDNA input with 18-50 variants in the patient-specific panels (> 99.9% sensitivity) with a baseline threshold, to 0.05% allele frequency when using 10 ng of cfDNA input with an 18-variant panel with a monitoring threshold (> 99.9% sensitivity).The Invitae Personalized Cancer Monitoring assay, featuring a flexible patient-specific panel design with 18-50 variants, demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity for detecting ctDNA at variant allele frequencies as low as 0.008%. This assay may support patient prognostic stratification, provide real-time data on therapy responses, and enable early detection of residual/recurrent disease.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Genome sequences are essential to biology, and assembly has been a central problem in bioinformatics for four decades. Until recently, genomes were typically assembled into fragments of a few megabases at best but technological advances in long-read sequencing now enable near complete chromosome-level assembly, also known as telomere-to-telomere assembly, for many organisms. Here we review recent progress on assembly algorithms and protocols. We focus on how to derive near telomere-to-telomere assemblies and discuss potential future developments."
,37527006,Short-read aligner performance in germline variant identification.,Bioinformatics,"Read alignment is an essential first step in the characterization of DNA sequence variation. The accuracy of variant-calling results depends not only on the quality of read alignment and variant-calling software but also on the interaction between these complex software tools.In this review, we evaluate short-read aligner performance with the goal of optimizing germline variant-calling accuracy. We examine the performance of three general-purpose short-read aligners-BWA-MEM, Bowtie 2, and Arioc-in conjunction with three germline variant callers: DeepVariant, FreeBayes, and GATK HaplotypeCaller. We discuss the behavior of the read aligners with regard to the data elements on which the variant callers rely, and illustrate how the runtime configurations of these software tools combine to affect variant-calling performance.The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.© The Author(s) 2023.

We examined the emergence and advancements of nanopore sequencing as a significant player in this field. We illustrate the challenges faced in diagnosing mixed infections and further scrutinize the use of nanopore sequencing in the identification of single pathogens, including viruses (with a focus on its use in epidemiology, outbreak investigation, and viral resistance), bacteria (emphasizing 16S targeted sequencing, rare bacterial lung infections, and antimicrobial resistance studies), fungi (employing internal transcribed spacer sequencing), tuberculosis, and atypical pathogens. Furthermore, we discuss the role of nanopore sequencing in metagenomics and its potential for unbiased detection of all pathogens in a clinical setting, emphasizing its advantages in sequencing genome repeat areas and structural variant regions. We discuss the limitations in dealing with host DNA removal, the inherent high error rate of nanopore sequencing technology, along with the complexity of operation and processing, while acknowledging the possibilities provided by recent technological improvements. We compared nanopore sequencing with the BioFire system, a rapid molecular diagnostic system based on polymerase chain reaction. Although the BioFire system serves well for the rapid screening of known and common pathogens, it falls short in the identification of unknown or rare pathogens and in providing comprehensive genome analysis. As technological advancements continue, it is anticipated that the role of nanopore sequencing technology in diagnosing and treating lung infections will become increasingly significant.© 2023.

,37612597,"Acute cigarette smoke exposure leads to higher viral infection in human bronchial epithelial cultures by altering interferon, glycolysis and GDF15-related pathways.",Respir Res,"Acute exacerbations of chronic inflammatory lung diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), are frequently associated with rhinovirus (RV) infections. Despite these associations, the pathogenesis of virus-induced exacerbations is incompletely understood. We aimed to investigate effects of cigarette smoke (CS), a primary risk factor for COPD, on RV infection in airway epithelium and identify novel mechanisms related to these effects.Primary bronchial epithelial cells (PBEC) from COPD patients and controls were differentiated by culture at the air-liquid interface (ALI) and exposed to CS and RV-A16. Bulk RNA sequencing was performed using samples collected at 6 and 24 h post infection (hpi), and viral load, mediator and L-lactate levels were measured at 6, 24 and 48hpi. To further delineate the effect of CS on RV-A16 infection, we performed growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) knockdown, L-lactate and interferon pre-treatment in ALI-PBEC. We performed deconvolution analysis to predict changes in the cell composition of ALI-PBEC after the various exposures. Finally, we compared transcriptional responses of ALI-PBEC to those in nasal epithelium after human RV-A16 challenge.CS exposure impaired antiviral responses at 6hpi and increased viral replication at 24 and 48hpi in ALI-PBEC. At 24hpi, CS exposure enhanced expression of RV-A16-induced epithelial interferons, inflammation-related genes and CXCL8. CS exposure increased expression of oxidative stress-related genes, of GDF15, and decreased mitochondrial membrane potential. GDF15 knockdown experiments suggested involvement of this pathway in the CS-induced increase in viral replication. Expression of glycolysis-related genes and L-lactate production were increased by CS exposure, and was demonstrated to contribute to higher viral replication. No major differences were demonstrated between COPD and non-COPD-derived cultures. However, cellular deconvolution analysis predicted higher secretory cells in COPD-derived cultures at baseline.Altogether, our findings demonstrate that CS exposure leads to higher viral infection in human bronchial epithelium by altering not only interferon responses, but likely also through a switch to glycolysis, and via GDF15-related pathways.© 2023.

,37546860,NA,NA,"Neurological impairment is the most common finding in patients with post-acute sequelae of COVID-19. Furthermore, survivors of pneumonia from any cause have an elevated risk of dementia1-4. Dysfunction in microglia, the primary immune cell in the brain, has been linked to cognitive impairment in murine models of dementia and in humans5. Here, we report a transcriptional response in human microglia collected from patients who died following COVID-19 suggestive of their activation by TNF-ɑ and other circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines. Consistent with these findings, the levels of 55 alveolar and plasma cytokines were elevated in a cohort of 341 patients with respiratory failure, including 93 unvaccinated patients with COVID-19 and 203 patients with other causes of pneumonia. While peak levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines were similar in patients with pneumonia irrespective of etiology, cumulative cytokine exposure was higher in patients with COVID-19. Corticosteroid treatment, which has been shown to be beneficial in patients with COVID-196, was associated with lower levels of CXCL10, CCL8, and CCL2-molecules that sustain inflammatory circuits between alveolar macrophages harboring SARS-CoV-2 and activated T cells7. These findings suggest that corticosteroids may break this cycle and decrease systemic exposure to lung-derived cytokines and inflammatory activation of microglia in patients with COVID-19."
,37535681,Block Aligner: an adaptive SIMD-accelerated aligner for sequences and position-specific scoring matrices.,Bioinformatics,"Efficiently aligning sequences is a fundamental problem in bioinformatics. Many recent algorithms for computing alignments through Smith-Waterman-Gotoh dynamic programming (DP) exploit Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) operations on modern CPUs for speed. However, these advances have largely ignored difficulties associated with efficiently handling complex scoring matrices or large gaps (insertions or deletions).We propose a new SIMD-accelerated algorithm called Block Aligner for aligning nucleotide and protein sequences against other sequences or position-specific scoring matrices. We introduce a new paradigm that uses blocks in the DP matrix that greedily shift, grow, and shrink. This approach allows regions of the DP matrix to be adaptively computed. Our algorithm reaches over 5-10 times faster than some previous methods while incurring an error rate of less than 3% on protein and long read datasets, despite large gaps and low sequence identities.Our algorithm is implemented for global, local, and X-drop alignments. It is available as a Rust library (with C bindings) at https://github.com/Daniel-Liu-c0deb0t/block-aligner.© The Author(s) 2023. Published by Oxford University Press."
,37580899,NA,NA,"A number types of extracellular DNA (eg, cell-free, cfDNA) circulate in human blood, including mitochondrial, transcriptome, and regulatory DNA, usually at low concentrations. Larger amounts of cfDNA appear in any inflammatory condition, including organ damage due to a variety of reasons. The role of cfDNA in solid organ transplantation is discussed in this review as a valuable additional tool in the standard of care of transplant patients. Post-transplant monitoring requires the use of high-quality biomarkers for early detection of graft damage or rejection to be able to apply early therapeutic intervention. CfDNA complements the traditional monitoring strategies, being a risk stratification tool and an important prognostic marker. However, improving the sensitivity and specificity of cfDNA detection is necessary to facilitate personalized patient management, warranting further research in terms of measurement, test standardization, and storage, processing, and shipping. A diagnostic test (Allosure, CareDx, Inc., Brisbane, CA) for kidney, heart and lung transplant patients is now commercially available, and validation for other organs (eg, liver) is pending. To date, donor-derived cfDNA in combination with other biomarkers appears to be a promising tool in graft rejection as it is minimally invasive, time-sensitive, and cost-effective. However, improvement of sensitivity and specificity is required to facilitate personalized patient management. Whether it could be an alternate to graft biopsy remains unclear."

However, the era of population genomics presents new challenges in analysing the massive amounts of genomes and variants. Deep learning has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance for numerous applications involving large-scale data. Recently, deep learning approaches have gained popularity in population genetics; facilitated by the advent of massive genomic data sets, powerful computational hardware and complex deep learning architectures, they have been used to identify population structure, infer demographic history and investigate natural selection. Here, we introduce common deep learning architectures and provide comprehensive guidelines for implementing deep learning models for population genetic inference. We also discuss current challenges and future directions for applying deep learning in population genetics, focusing on efficiency, robustness and interpretability.© 2023. Springer Nature Limited."
,37668698,Pilot study of relationship between prenatal stress during the COVID-19 pandemic and social-emotional development of 12-month-old children: the mediation effects of home environment.,Eur Child Adolesc Psychiatry,"There is increasing evidence that prenatal stress elevates the risk of children's social-emotional development, but the mechanisms underlying this association are unclear. Home environment provides learning opportunities and stimulation required for children's early development and can be influenced by prenatal maternal stress. This study aimed to examine whether home environment can mediate the association between prenatal stress during the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and their offspring's social-emotional problems thereafter. A pilot sample was derived from 2020 to 2021 Maternal and Child Health Cohort study (N = 82) with the pregnant women recruited during the COVID-19 lockdown period in 2020. Prenatal stress was assessed using the Perceived Stress Scale. Home environment was measured using the Child Home Nurture Environment Scales. Mother-reported toddler social-emotional problems were assessed at 12 months of age. The mediation model was used for data analysis. The mean scores of social-emotional problems, which include externalizing, internalizing, dysregulation, and competence, were 10.98 (5.08), 14.72 (6.49), 15.15 (6.31), and 36.73 (10.26), respectively. Prenatal stress, home environment, and social-emotional problems were significantly related (P < 0.05). Home environment significantly mediated the association between prenatal stress and social-emotional problems with the indirect effect [95% CI] of 0.06 [0.01, 0.14] for externalizing behaviors, 0.10 [0.00, 0.24] for internalizing behaviors, - 0.15 [- 0.31, - 0.01] for competence, 0.08 [0.01, 0.17] and 0.08 [0.01, 0.21] for dysregulation. These findings suggest that prenatal stress may affect offspring's social-emotional problems through the home environment. Screening for prenatal stress and promoting supportive home environment may be potential strategies for social-emotional problems interventions in children.© 2023.

,37569686,The Bladder Tumor Microenvironment Components That Modulate the Tumor and Impact Therapy.,Int J Mol Sci,"The tumor microenvironment (TME) is complex and involves many different cell types that seemingly work together in helping cancer cells evade immune monitoring and survive therapy. The advent of single-cell sequencing has greatly increased our knowledge of the cell types present in the tumor microenvironment and their role in the developing cancer. This, coupled with clinical data showing that cancer development and the response to therapy may be influenced by drugs that indirectly influence the tumor environment, highlights the need to better understand how the cells present in the TME work together. This review looks at the different cell types (cancer cells, cancer stem cells, endothelial cells, pericytes, adipose cells, cancer-associated fibroblasts, and neuronal cells) in the bladder tumor microenvironment. Their impact on immune activation and on shaping the microenvironment are discussed as well as the effects of hypertensive drugs and anesthetics on bladder cancer."
