x,37640946,Joint single-cell profiling resolves 5mC and 5hmC and reveals their distinct gene regulatory effects,Nat Biotechnol,"Oxidative modification of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) by ten-eleven translocation (TET) DNA dioxygenases generates 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), the most abundant form of oxidized 5mC. Existing single-cell bisulfite sequencing methods cannot resolve 5mC and 5hmC, leaving the cell-type-specific regulatory mechanisms of TET and 5hmC largely unknown. Here, we present joint single-nucleus (hydroxy)methylcytosine sequencing (Joint-snhmC-seq), a scalable and quantitative approach that simultaneously profiles 5hmC and true 5mC in single cells by harnessing differential deaminase activity of APOBEC3A toward 5mC and chemically protected 5hmC. Joint-snhmC-seq profiling of single nuclei from mouse brains reveals an unprecedented level of epigenetic heterogeneity of both 5hmC and true 5mC at single-cell resolution. We show that cell-type-specific profiles of 5hmC or true 5mC improve multimodal single-cell data integration, enable accurate identification of neuronal subtypes and uncover context-specific regulatory effects on cell-type-specific genes by TET enzymes.© 2023.

x,37622096,Calibrating epigenetic clocks with training data error.,Evol Appl,"Animal age data are valuable for management of wildlife populations. Yet, for most species, there is no practical method for determining the age of unknown individuals. However, epigenetic clocks, a molecular-based method, are capable of age prediction by sampling specific tissue types and measuring DNA methylation levels at specific loci. Developing an epigenetic clock requires a large number of samples from animals of known ages. For most species, there are no individuals whose exact ages are known, making epigenetic clock calibration inaccurate or impossible. For many epigenetic clocks, calibration samples with inaccurate age estimates introduce a degree of error to epigenetic clock calibration. In this study, we investigated how much error in the training data set of an epigenetic clock can be tolerated before it resulted in an unacceptable increase in error for age prediction. Using four publicly available data sets, we artificially increased the training data age error by iterations of 1% and then tested the model against an independent set of known ages. A small effect size increase (Cohen's d >0.2) was detected when the error in age was higher than 22%. The effect size increased linearly with age error. This threshold was independent of sample size. Downstream applications for age data may have a more important role in deciding how much error can be tolerated for age prediction. If highly precise age estimates are required, then it may be futile to embark on the development of an epigenetic clock when there is no accurately aged calibration population to work with. However, for other problems, such as determining the relative age order of pairs of individuals, a lower-quality calibration data set may be adequate.© 2023 The Authors.

x,37620601,Multiparameter prediction of myeloid neoplasia risk.,Nat Genet,"The myeloid neoplasms encompass acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes and myeloproliferative neoplasms. Most cases arise from the shared ancestor of clonal hematopoiesis (CH). Here we analyze data from 454,340 UK Biobank participants, of whom 1,808 developed a myeloid neoplasm 0-15 years after recruitment. We describe the differences in CH mutational landscapes and hematology/biochemistry test parameters among individuals that later develop myeloid neoplasms (pre-MN) versus controls, finding that disease-specific changes are detectable years before diagnosis. By analyzing differences between 'pre-MN' and controls, we develop and validate Cox regression models quantifying the risk of progression to each myeloid neoplasm subtype. We construct 'MN-predict', a web application that generates time-dependent predictions with the input of basic blood tests and genetic data. Our study demonstrates that many individuals that develop myeloid neoplasms can be identified years in advance and provides a framework for disease-specific prognostication that will be of substantial use to researchers and physicians.© 2023.

x,37606673,Evaluation of Large-Scale Proteomics for Prediction of Cardiovascular Events.,JAMA,"Whether protein risk scores derived from a single plasma sample could be useful for risk assessment for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), in conjunction with clinical risk factors and polygenic risk scores, is uncertain.To develop protein risk scores for ASCVD risk prediction and compare them to clinical risk factors and polygenic risk scores in primary and secondary event populations.The primary analysis was a retrospective study of primary events among 13 540 individuals in Iceland (aged 40-75 years) with proteomics data and no history of major ASCVD events at recruitment (study duration, August 23, 2000 until October 26, 2006; follow-up through 2018). We also analyzed a secondary event population from a randomized, double-blind lipid-lowering clinical trial (2013-2016), consisting of individuals with stable ASCVD receiving statin therapy and for whom proteomic data were available for 6791 individuals.Protein risk scores (based on 4963 plasma protein levels and developed in a training set in the primary event population); polygenic risk scores for coronary artery disease and stroke; and clinical risk factors that included age, sex, statin use, hypertension treatment, type 2 diabetes, body mass index, and smoking status at the time of plasma sampling.Outcomes were composites of myocardial infarction, stroke, and coronary heart disease death or cardiovascular death. Performance was evaluated using Cox survival models and measures of discrimination and reclassification that accounted for the competing risk of non-ASCVD death.In the primary event population test set (4018 individuals [59.0% women]; 465 events; median follow-up, 15.8 years), the protein risk score had a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.93 per SD (95% CI, 1.75 to 2.13). Addition of protein risk score and polygenic risk scores significantly increased the C index when added to a clinical risk factor model (C index change, 0.022 [95% CI, 0.007 to 0.038]). Addition of the protein risk score alone to a clinical risk factor model also led to a significantly increased C index (difference, 0.014 [95% CI, 0.002 to 0.028]). Among White individuals in the secondary event population (6307 participants; 432 events; median follow-up, 2.2 years), the protein risk score had an HR of 1.62 per SD (95% CI, 1.48 to 1.79) and significantly increased C index when added to a clinical risk factor model (C index change, 0.026 [95% CI, 0.011 to 0.042]). The protein risk score was significantly associated with major adverse cardiovascular events among individuals of African and Asian ancestries in the secondary event population.A protein risk score was significantly associated with ASCVD events in primary and secondary event populations. When added to clinical risk factors, the protein risk score and polygenic risk score both provided statistically significant but modest improvement in discrimination."
x,37580596,In vivo screening characterizes chromatin factor functions during normal and malignant hematopoiesis,Nat Genet,"Cellular differentiation requires extensive alterations in chromatin structure and function, which is elicited by the coordinated action of chromatin and transcription factors. By contrast with transcription factors, the roles of chromatin factors in differentiation have not been systematically characterized. Here, we combine bulk ex vivo and single-cell in vivo CRISPR screens to characterize the role of chromatin factor families in hematopoiesis. We uncover marked lineage specificities for 142 chromatin factors, revealing functional diversity among related chromatin factors (i.e. barrier-to-autointegration factor subcomplexes) as well as shared roles for unrelated repressive complexes that restrain excessive myeloid differentiation. Using epigenetic profiling, we identify functional interactions between lineage-determining transcription factors and several chromatin factors that explain their lineage dependencies. Studying chromatin factor functions in leukemia, we show that leukemia cells engage homeostatic chromatin factor functions to block differentiation, generating specific chromatin factor-transcription factor interactions that might be therapeutically targeted. Together, our work elucidates the lineage-determining properties of chromatin factors across normal and malignant hematopoiesis.© 2023. The Author(s)."
x,37608214,Early detection of lung cancer using artificial intelligence-enhanced optical nanosensing of chromatin alterations in field carcinogenesis.,Sci Rep,"Supranucleosomal chromatin structure, including chromatin domain conformation, is involved in the regulation of gene expression and its dysregulation has been associated with carcinogenesis. Prior studies have shown that cells in the buccal mucosa carry a molecular signature of lung cancer among the cigarette-smoking population, the phenomenon known as field carcinogenesis or field of injury. Thus, we hypothesized that chromatin structural changes in buccal mucosa can be predictive of lung cancer. However, the small size of the chromatin chain (approximately 20 nm) folded into chromatin packing domains, themselves typically below 300 nm in diameter, preclude the detection of alterations in intradomain chromatin conformation using diffraction-limited optical microscopy. In this study, we developed an optical spectroscopic statistical nanosensing technique to detect chromatin packing domain changes in buccal mucosa as a lung cancer biomarker: chromatin-sensitive partial wave spectroscopic microscopy (csPWS). Artificial intelligence (AI) was applied to csPWS measurements of chromatin alterations to enhance diagnostic performance. Our AI-enhanced buccal csPWS nanocytology of 179 patients at two clinical sites distinguished Stage-I lung cancer versus cancer-free controls with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.92 ± 0.06 for Site 1 (in-state location) and 0.82 ± 0.11 for Site 2 (out-of-state location).© 2023.

x,37582783,Cross-platform comparisons for targeted bisulfite sequencing of MGISEQ-2000 and NovaSeq6000.,Clin Epigenetics,"An accurate and reproducible next-generation sequencing platform is essential to identify malignancy-related abnormal DNA methylation changes and translate them into clinical applications including cancer detection, prognosis, and surveillance. However, high-quality DNA methylation sequencing has been challenging because poor sequence diversity of the bisulfite-converted libraries severely impairs sequencing quality and yield. In this study, we tested MGISEQ-2000 Sequencer's capability of DNA methylation sequencing with a published non-invasive pancreatic cancer detection assay, using NovaSeq6000 as the benchmark.We sequenced a series of synthetic cell-free DNA (cfDNA) samples with different tumor fractions and found MGISEQ-2000 yielded data with similar quality as NovaSeq6000. The methylation levels measured by MGISEQ-2000 demonstrated high consistency with NovaSeq6000. Moreover, MGISEQ-2000 showed a comparable analytic sensitivity with NovaSeq6000, suggesting its potential for clinical detection. As to evaluate the clinical performance of MGISEQ-2000, we sequenced 24 clinical samples and predicted the pathology of the samples with a clinical diagnosis model, PDACatch classifier. The clinical model performance of MGISEQ-2000's data was highly consistent with that of NovaSeq6000's data, with the area under the curve of 1. We also tested the model's robustness with MGISEQ-2000's data when reducing the sequencing depth. The results showed that MGISEQ-2000's data showed matching robustness of the PDACatch classifier with NovaSeq6000's data.Taken together, MGISEQ-2000 demonstrated similar data quality, consistency of the methylation levels, comparable analytic sensitivity, and matching clinical performance, supporting its application in future non-invasive early cancer detection investigations by detecting distinct methylation patterns of cfDNAs.© 2023.

x,37590228,The specious art of single-cell genomics.,PLoS Comput Biol,"Dimensionality reduction is standard practice for filtering noise and identifying relevant features in large-scale data analyses. In biology, single-cell genomics studies typically begin with reduction to 2 or 3 dimensions to produce ""all-in-one"" visuals of the data that are amenable to the human eye, and these are subsequently used for qualitative and quantitative exploratory analysis. However, there is little theoretical support for this practice, and we show that extreme dimension reduction, from hundreds or thousands of dimensions to 2, inevitably induces significant distortion of high-dimensional datasets. We therefore examine the practical implications of low-dimensional embedding of single-cell data and find that extensive distortions and inconsistent practices make such embeddings counter-productive for exploratory, biological analyses. In lieu of this, we discuss alternative approaches for conducting targeted embedding and feature exploration to enable hypothesis-driven biological discovery.Copyright: © 2023 Chari, Pachter.

x,37612512,The complete sequence of a human Y chromosome.,Nature,"The human Y chromosome has been notoriously difficult to sequence and assemble because of its complex repeat structure that includes long palindromes, tandem repeats and segmental duplications1-3. As a result, more than half of the Y chromosome is missing from the GRCh38 reference sequence and it remains the last human chromosome to be finished4,5. Here, the Telomere-to-Telomere (T2T) consortium presents the complete 62,460,029-base-pair sequence of a human Y chromosome from the HG002 genome (T2T-Y) that corrects multiple errors in GRCh38-Y and adds over 30 million base pairs of sequence to the reference, showing the complete ampliconic structures of gene families TSPY, DAZ and RBMY; 41 additional protein-coding genes, mostly from the TSPY family; and an alternating pattern of human satellite 1 and 3 blocks in the heterochromatic Yq12 region. We have combined T2T-Y with a previous assembly of the CHM13 genome4and mapped available population variation, clinical variants and functional genomics data to produce a complete and comprehensive reference sequence for all 24 human chromosomes.© 2023.

x,37612510,Assembly of 43 human Y chromosomes reveals extensive complexity and variation,Nature,"The prevalence of highly repetitive sequences within the human Y chromosome has prevented its complete assembly to date1and led to its systematic omission from genomic analyses. Here we present de novo assemblies of 43 Y chromosomes spanning 182,900 years of human evolution and report considerable diversity in size and structure. Half of the male-specific euchromatic region is subject to large inversions with a greater than twofold higher recurrence rate compared with all other chromosomes2. Ampliconic sequences associated with these inversions show differing mutation rates that are sequence context dependent, and some ampliconic genes exhibit evidence for concerted evolution with the acquisition and purging of lineage-specific pseudogenes. The largest heterochromatic region in the human genome, Yq12, is composed of alternating repeat arrays that show extensive variation in the number, size and distribution, but retain a 1:1 copy-number ratio. Finally, our data suggest that the boundary between the recombining pseudoautosomal region 1 and the non-recombining portions of the X and Y chromosomes lies 500 kb away from the currently established1boundary. The availability of fully sequence-resolved Y chromosomes from multiple individuals provides a unique opportunity for identifying new associations of traits with specific Y-chromosomal variants and garnering insights into the evolution and function of complex regions of the human genome.© 2023.

x,37639434,Prediction of DNA Methylation based on Multi-dimensional feature encoding and double convolutional fully connected convolutional neural network.,PLoS Comput Biol,"DNA methylation takes on critical significance to the regulation of gene expression by affecting the stability of DNA and changing the structure of chromosomes. DNA methylation modification sites should be identified, which lays a solid basis for gaining more insights into their biological functions. Existing machine learning-based methods of predicting DNA methylation have not fully exploited the hidden multidimensional information in DNA gene sequences, such that the prediction accuracy of models is significantly limited. Besides, most models have been built in terms of a single methylation type. To address the above-mentioned issues, a deep learning-based method was proposed in this study for DNA methylation site prediction, termed the MEDCNN model. The MEDCNN model is capable of extracting feature information from gene sequences in three dimensions (i.e., positional information, biological information, and chemical information). Moreover, the proposed method employs a convolutional neural network model with double convolutional layers and double fully connected layers while iteratively updating the gradient descent algorithm using the cross-entropy loss function to increase the prediction accuracy of the model. Besides, the MEDCNN model can predict different types of DNA methylation sites. As indicated by the experimental results,the deep learning method based on coding from multiple dimensions outperformed single coding methods, and the MEDCNN model was highly applicable and outperformed existing models in predicting DNA methylation between different species. As revealed by the above-described findings, the MEDCNN model can be effective in predicting DNA methylation sites.Copyright: © 2023 Hu et al.

x,37612393,From target discovery to clinical drug development with human genetics,Nature,"The substantial investments in human genetics and genomics made over the past three decades were anticipated to result in many innovative therapies. Here we investigate the extent to which these expectations have been met, excluding cancer treatments. In our search, we identified 40 germline genetic observations that led directly to new targets and subsequently to novel approved therapies for 36 rare and 4 common conditions. The median time between genetic target discovery and drug approval was 25 years. Most of the genetically driven therapies for rare diseases compensate for disease-causing loss-of-function mutations. The therapies approved for common conditions are all inhibitors designed to pharmacologically mimic the natural, disease-protective effects of rare loss-of-function variants. Large biobank-based genetic studies have the power to identify and validate a large number of new drug targets. Genetics can also assist in the clinical development phase of drugs-for example, by selecting individuals who are most likely to respond to investigational therapies. This approach to drug development requires investments into large, diverse cohorts of deeply phenotyped individuals with appropriate consent for genetically assisted trials. A robust framework that facilitates responsible, sustainable benefit sharing will be required to capture the full potential of human genetics and genomics and bring effective and safe innovative therapies to patients quickly.© 2023.

x,37563310,Genetics of circulating inflammatory proteins identifies drivers of immune-mediated disease risk and therapeutic targets,Nat Immunol,"Circulating proteins have important functions in inflammation and a broad range of diseases. To identify genetic influences on inflammation-related proteins, we conducted a genome-wide protein quantitative trait locus (pQTL) study of 91 plasma proteins measured using the Olink Target platform in 14,824 participants. We identified 180 pQTLs (59 cis, 121 trans). Integration of pQTL data with eQTL and disease genome-wide association studies provided insight into pathogenesis, implicating lymphotoxin-? in multiple sclerosis. Using Mendelian randomization (MR) to assess causality in disease etiology, we identified both shared and distinct effects of specific proteins across immune-mediated diseases, including directionally discordant effects of CD40 on risk of rheumatoid arthritis versus multiple sclerosis and inflammatory bowel disease. MR implicated CXCL5 in the etiology of ulcerative colitis (UC) and we show elevated gut CXCL5 transcript expression in patients with UC. These results identify targets of existing drugs and provide a powerful resource to facilitate future drug target prioritization."
x,37640858,Cell-free DNA methylome analysis for early preeclampsia prediction.,Nat Med,"Preeclampsia (PE) is a leading cause for peripartal morbidity, especially if developing early in gestation. To enable prophylaxis in the prevention of PE, pregnancies at risk of PE must be identified early-in the first trimester. To identify at-risk pregnancies we profiled methylomes of plasma-derived, cell-free DNA from 498 pregnant women, of whom about one-third developed early-onset PE. We detected DNA methylation differences between control and PE pregnancies that enabled risk stratification at PE diagnosis but also presymptomatically, at around 12 weeks of gestation (range 9-14 weeks). The first-trimester risk prediction model was validated in an external cohort collected from two centers (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.75) and integrated with routinely available maternal risk factors (AUC = 0.85). The combined risk score correctly predicted 72% of patients with early-onset PE at 80% specificity. These preliminary results suggest that cell-free DNA methylation profiling is a promising tool for presymptomatic PE risk assessment, and has the potential to improve treatment and follow-up in the obstetric clinic.© 2023.

x,37620817,Association of mitochondrial DNA copy number with chronic kidney disease in older adults.,BMC Geriatr,"Mitochondrial dysfunction in kidney cells has been implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Estimation of mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNA-CN) is considered a convenient method for representing mitochondrial function in large samples. However, no study has investigated the association between mtDNA-CN and CKD in older adults with the highest prevalence. The objective is to examine cross-sectional and prospective associations between mtDNA-CN values and CKD risk in older adults to determine whether mtDNA-CN represents a novel potential biomarker for the recognition of CKD risk.In a Chinese community-based cohort of over 65-year-olds, we included 14,467 participants (52.6% females). CKD was defined by eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2or ICD-10 codes (patients = 3831 (26.5%)). Participants had peripheral blood levels of mtDNA-CN calculated from probe intensities of the Axiom CAS Array.The risk of CKD prevalence decreased with mtDNA-CN per 1-SD increment, independent of established risk factors for older CKD (odds ratio [OR] per SD 0.90, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.86, 0.93, P < 0.001), and has comparable strength of association with these established risk factors. Furthermore, the progression of kidney function was stratified according to the worsening of eGFR categories. The risk of kidney function progression to a more severe stage gradually decreased as the mtDNA-CN increased (P trend < 0.001). Non-CKD participants in the highest quartile of mtDNA-CN had a lower risk of developing CKD compared to the lowest quartile within 2 years of follow-up, reducing the risk of CKD by 36% (95% CI 0.42, 0.97; P = 0.037).Based on the analysis of the largest sample to date investigating the association between mtDNA-CN and CKD in older adults, higher levels of mtDNA-CN were found to be associated with a lower risk of CKD, suggesting that a reduced level of mtDNA-CN is a potential risk factor for CKD.© 2023.

x,35301427,Convergence of case-specific epigenetic alterations identify a confluence of genetic vulnerabilities tied to opioid overdose,Mol Psychiatry,"Opioid use disorder is a highly heterogeneous disease driven by a variety of genetic and environmental risk factors which have yet to be fully elucidated. Opioid overdose, the most severe outcome of opioid use disorder, remains the leading cause of accidental death in the United States. We interrogated the effects of opioid overdose on the brain using ChIP-seq to quantify patterns of H3K27 acetylation in dorsolateral prefrontal cortical neurons isolated from 51 opioid-overdose cases and 51 accidental death controls. Among opioid cases, we observed global hypoacetylation and identified 388 putative enhancers consistently depleted for H3K27ac. Machine learning on H3K27ac patterns predicted case-control status with high accuracy. We focused on case-specific regulatory alterations, revealing 81,399 hypoacetylation events, uncovering vast inter-patient heterogeneity. We developed a strategy to decode this heterogeneity based on convergence analysis, which leveraged promoter-capture Hi-C to identify five genes over-burdened by alterations in their regulatory network or ""plexus"": ASTN2, KCNMA1, DUSP4, GABBR2, ENOX1. These convergent loci are enriched for opioid use disorder risk genes and heritability for generalized anxiety, number of sexual partners, and years of education. Overall, our multi-pronged approach uncovers neurobiological aspects of opioid use disorder and captures genetic and environmental factors perpetuating the opioid epidemic."
x,37628978,"Prostate Cancer: Genetics, Epigenetics and the Need for Immunological Biomarkers.",Int J Mol Sci,"Epidemiological data highlight prostate cancer as a significant global health issue, with high incidence and substantial impact on patients' quality of life. The prevalence of this disease is associated with various factors, including age, heredity, and race. Recent research in prostate cancer genetics has identified several genetic variants that may be associated with an increased risk of developing the disease. However, despite the significance of these findings, genetic markers for prostate cancer are not currently utilized in clinical practice as reliable indicators of the disease. In addition to genetics, epigenetic alterations also play a crucial role in prostate cancer development. Aberrant DNA methylation, changes in chromatin structure, and microRNA (miRNA) expression are major epigenetic events that influence oncogenesis. Existing markers for prostate cancer, such as prostate-specific antigen (PSA), have limitations in terms of sensitivity and specificity. The cost of testing, follow-up procedures, and treatment for false-positive results and overdiagnosis contributes to the overall healthcare expenditure. Improving the effectiveness of prostate cancer diagnosis and prognosis requires either narrowing the risk group by identifying new genetic factors or enhancing the sensitivity and specificity of existing markers. Immunological biomarkers (both circulating and intra-tumoral), including markers of immune response and immune dysfunction, represent a potentially useful area of research for enhancing the diagnosis and prognosis of prostate cancer. Our review emphasizes the need for developing novel immunological biomarkers to improve the diagnosis, prognosis, and management of prostate cancer. We highlight the most recent achievements in the identification of biomarkers provided by circulating monocytes and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). We highlight that monocyte-derived and TAM-derived biomarkers can enable to establish the missing links between genetic predisposition, hormonal metabolism and immune responses in prostate cancer."

Current machine learning tools often provide limited predictive performance and model interpretation in these settings. In the present study, we extend the application of REFINED-CNN from regression tasks to making survival predictions, by mapping high-dimensional RNA sequencing data into REFINED images which are conducive to CNN modeling. We show that the REFINED-CNN survival model can be easily adapted to new tasks of a similar nature (e.g., predicting on new cancer types) using transfer learning with a low number of patients. Furthermore, the model can also be interpreted both locally and globally through risk score back propagation that quantifies each feature (e.g., gene) importance in survival prediction task for the patient or cancer type of interest.© 2023 The Author(s)."
