Ryan,Yes,20230525,ewas,37216580,"Impact of tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana on genome-wide DNA methylation and its relationship with hypertension.",Epigenetics,"Tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana consumption is an important public health problem because of their high use worldwide and their association with the risk of mortality and many health conditions, such as hypertension, which is the commonest risk factor for death throughout the world. A likely pathway of action of substance consumption leading to persistent hypertension is DNA methylation. Here, we evaluated the effects of tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana on DNA methylation in the same cohort (N = 3,424). Three epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) were assessed in whole blood using the InfiniumHumanMethylationEPIC BeadChip. We also evaluated the mediation of the top CpG sites in the association between substance consumption and hypertension. Our analyses showed 2,569 CpG sites differentially methylated by alcohol drinking and 528 by tobacco smoking. We did not find significant associations with marijuana consumption after correcting for multiple comparisons. We found 61 genes overlapping between alcohol and tobacco that were enriched in biological processes involved in the nervous and cardiovascular systems. In the mediation analysis, we found 66 CpG sites that significantly mediated the effect of alcohol consumption on hypertension. The top alcohol-related CpG site (cg06690548, P-value = 5.9·10-83) mapped to SLC7A11 strongly mediated 70.5% of the effect of alcohol consumption on hypertension (P-value = 0.006). Our findings suggest that DNA methylation should be considered for new targets in hypertension prevention and management, particularly concerning alcohol consumption. Our data also encourage further research into the use of methylation in blood to study the neurological and cardiovascular effects of substance consumption."

Epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) results of individual cohorts were combined by random-effect meta-analysis. A three-stage selection procedure (discovery, n = 884; testing, n = 520; validation, n = 879) established an epigenetic risk score including 30 CpG sites. Epigenetic age was assessed by Horvath's multi-tissue clock and Shireby's cortical clock.EWAS meta-analysis revealed 149 CpG sites linked to 136 genes (P < 0.05 after Bonferroni correction) in blood and 23 CpG linked to 18 genes in brain (false discovery rate [FDR] < 5%). Gene-set analyses of blood EWAS results suggested enrichments in brain tissue types and in subunits of the kainate-selective glutamate receptor complex. Individual candidate genes of the brain EWAS could be assigned to neurodevelopmental or metabolic traits. The blood epigenetic risk score achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.70 (0.67-0.73) in the validation set, comparable to analogous scores in other neurobehavioral disorders. A significant difference in biological age in blood or brain of RLS patients was not detectable.DNA methylation supports the notion of altered neurodevelopment in RLS. Epigenetic risk scores are reliably associated with RLS but require even higher accuracy to be useful as biomarkers. © 2023 The Authors.

,Yes,20230525,ewas,37210443,Epigenome-wide association study of diabetic chronic kidney disease progression in the Korean population: the KNOW-CKD study.,Sci Rep,"Since the etiology of diabetic chronic kidney disease (CKD) is multifactorial, studies on DNA methylation for kidney function deterioration have rarely been performed despite the need for an epigenetic approach. Therefore, this study aimed to identify epigenetic markers associated with CKD progression based on the decline in the estimated glomerular filtration rate in diabetic CKD in Korea. An epigenome-wide association study was performed using whole blood samples from 180 CKD recruited from the KNOW-CKD cohort. Pyrosequencing was also performed on 133 CKD participants as an external replication analysis. Functional analyses, including the analysis of disease-gene networks, reactome pathways, and protein-protein interaction networks, were conducted to identify the biological mechanisms of CpG sites. A phenome-wide association study was performed to determine the associations between CpG sites and other phenotypes. Two epigenetic markers, cg10297223 on AGTR1 and cg02990553 on KRT28 indicated a potential association with diabetic CKD progression. Based on the functional analyses, other phenotypes (blood pressure and cardiac arrhythmia for AGTR1) and biological pathways (keratinization and cornified envelope for KRT28) related to CKD were also identified. This study suggests a potential association between the cg10297223 and cg02990553 and the progression of diabetic CKD in Koreans. Nevertheless, further validation is needed through additional studies.© 2023. The Author(s)."
,No,20230525,epigenetics,37205524,Combinatorial quantification of 5mC and 5hmC at individual CpG dyads and the transcriptome in single cells reveals modulators of DNA methylation maintenance fidelity.,bioRxiv,"Transmission of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) from one cell generation to the next plays a key role in regulating cellular identity in mammalian development and diseases. While recent work has shown that the activity of DNMT1, the protein responsible for the stable inheritance of 5mC from mother to daughter cells, is imprecise; it remains unclear how the fidelity of DNMT1 is tuned in different genomic and cell state contexts. Here we describe Dyad-seq, a method that combines enzymatic detection of modified cytosines with nucleobase conversion techniques to quantify the genome-wide methylation status of cytosines at the resolution of individual CpG dinucleotides. We find that the fidelity of DNMT1-mediated maintenance methylation is directly related to the local density of DNA methylation, and for genomic regions that are lowly methylated, histone modifications can dramatically alter the maintenance methylation activity. Further, to gain deeper insights into the methylation and demethylation turnover dynamics, we extended Dyad-seq to quantify all combinations of 5mC and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) at individual CpG dyads to show that TET proteins preferentially hydroxymethylate only one of the two 5mC sites in a symmetrically methylated CpG dyad rather than sequentially convert both 5mC to 5hmC. To understand how cell state transitions impact DNMT1-mediated maintenance methylation, we scaled the method down and combined it with the measurement of mRNA to simultaneously quantify genome-wide methylation levels, maintenance methylation fidelity and the transcriptome from the same cell (scDyad&T-seq). Applying scDyad&T-seq to mouse embryonic stem cells transitioning from serum to 2i conditions, we observe dramatic and heterogenous demethylation and the emergence of transcriptionally distinct subpopulations that are closely linked to the cell-to-cell variability in loss of DNMT1-mediated maintenance methylation activity, with regions of the genome that escape 5mC reprogramming retaining high levels of maintenance methylation fidelity. Overall, our results demonstrate that while distinct cell states can substantially impact the genome-wide activity of the DNA methylation maintenance machinery, locally there exists an intrinsic relationship between DNA methylation density, histone modifications and DNMT1-mediated maintenance methylation fidelity that is independent of cell state."

We systematically identified potentially modifiable targets of obesity at the onset and end of puberty in Hong Kong, the most economically developed major Chinese city.We conducted an environment-wide association study (EWAS) and an epigenome-wide association study of obesity to systematically assess associations with body mass index (BMI) and waist-hip ratio (WHR) in Hong Kong's population-representative 'Children of 1997' birth cohort. Univariable linear regression was used to select exposures related to obesity at ~11.5 years (BMI and obesity riskn≤ 7119, WHRn= 5691) and ~17.6 years (n= 3618) at Bonferroni-corrected significance, and multivariable regression to adjust for potential confounders followed by replicated multivariable regression (n= 308) and CpG by CpG analysis (n= 286) at ~23 years. Findings were compared with evidence from published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and Mendelian randomization (MR) studies.At ~11.5 and~17.6 years the EWAS identified 14 and 37 exposures associated with BMI, as well as 7 and 12 associated with WHR, respectively. Most exposures had directionally consistent associations at ~23 years. Maternal second-hand smoking, maternal weight, and birth weight were consistently associated with obesity. Diet (including dairy intake and artificially sweetened beverages), physical activity, snoring, binge eating, and earlier puberty were positively associated with BMI at ~17.6 years, while eating before sleep was inversely associated with BMI at ~17.6 years. Findings for birth weight, dairy intake, and binge eating are consistent with available evidence from RCTs or MR studies. We found 17 CpGs related to BMI and 17 to WHR.These novel insights into potentially modifiable factors associated with obesity at the outset and the end of puberty could, if causal, inform future interventions to improve population health in Hong Kong and similar Chinese settings.This study including the follow-up survey and epigenetics testing was supported by the Health and Medical Research Fund Research Fellowship, Food and Health Bureau, Hong Kong SAR Government (#04180097).

,No,20230525,MR,37202507,Investigating causality in the association between DNA methylation and type 2 diabetes using bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomisation.,Diabetologia,"Several studies have identified associations between type 2 diabetes and DNA methylation (DNAm). However, the causal role of these associations remains unclear. This study aimed to provide evidence for a causal relationship between DNAm and type 2 diabetes.We used bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomisation (2SMR) to evaluate causality at 58 CpG sites previously detected in a meta-analysis of epigenome-wide association studies (meta-EWAS) of prevalent type 2 diabetes in European populations. We retrieved genetic proxies for type 2 diabetes and DNAm from the largest genome-wide association study (GWAS) available. We also used data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC, UK) when associations of interest were not available in the larger datasets. We identified 62 independent SNPs as proxies for type 2 diabetes, and 39 methylation quantitative trait loci as proxies for 30 of the 58 type 2 diabetes-related CpGs. We applied the Bonferroni correction for multiple testing and inferred causality based on p<0.001 for the type 2 diabetes to DNAm direction and p<0.002 for the opposing DNAm to type 2 diabetes direction in the 2SMR analysis.We found strong evidence of a causal effect of DNAm at cg25536676 (DHCR24) on type 2 diabetes. An increase in transformed residuals of DNAm at this site was associated with a 43% (OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.15, 1.78, p=0.001) higher risk of type 2 diabetes. We inferred a likely causal direction for the remaining CpG sites assessed. In silico analyses showed that the CpGs analysed were enriched for expression quantitative trait methylation sites (eQTMs) and for specific traits, dependent on the direction of causality predicted by the 2SMR analysis.We identified one CpG mapping to a gene related to the metabolism of lipids (DHCR24) as a novel causal biomarker for risk of type 2 diabetes. CpGs within the same gene region have previously been associated with type 2 diabetes-related traits in observational studies (BMI, waist circumference, HDL-cholesterol, insulin) and in Mendelian randomisation analyses (LDL-cholesterol). Thus, we hypothesise that our candidate CpG in DHCR24 may be a causal mediator of the association between known modifiable risk factors and type 2 diabetes. Formal causal mediation analysis should be implemented to further validate this assumption.© 2023. The Author(s)."
,No,20230525,methods,37196182,A novel principal component based method for identifying differentially methylated regions in Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip data.,Epigenetics,"Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) are genomic regions with methylation patterns across multiple CpG sites that are associated with a phenotype. In this study, we proposed a Principal Component (PC) based DMR analysis method for use with data generated using the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip (EPIC) array. We obtained methylation residuals by regressing the M-values of CpGs within a region on covariates, extracted PCs of the residuals, and then combined association information across PCs to obtain regional significance. Simulation-based genome-wide false positive (GFP) rates and true positive rates were estimated under a variety of conditions before determining the final version of our method, which we have named DMRPC. Then, DMRPCand another DMR method, coMethDMR, were used to perform epigenome-wide analyses of several phenotypes known to have multiple associated methylation loci (age, sex, and smoking) in a discovery and a replication cohort. Among regions that were analysed by both methods, DMRPCidentified 50% more genome-wide significant age-associated DMRs than coMethDMR. The replication rate for the loci that were identified by only DMRPCwas higher than the rate for those that were identified by only coMethDMR (90% for DMRPC vs. 76% for coMethDMR). Furthermore, DMRPCidentified replicable associations in regions of moderate between-CpG correlation which are typically not analysed by coMethDMR. For the analyses of sex and smoking, the advantage of DMRPCwas less clear. In conclusion, DMRPCis a new powerful DMR discovery tool that retains power in genomic regions with moderate correlation across CpGs."

The parent-of-origin-effect (POE)-regulated methylome includes regions enriched for genetically controlled imprinting effects (the typical type of POE) and regions influenced by environmental effects associated with parents (the atypical POE). This part of the methylome is heavily influenced by early events, making it a potential route connecting early exposures, the epigenome, and aging. We aim to test the association of POE-CpGs with early and later exposures and subsequently with health-related phenotypes and adult aging.We perform a phenome-wide association analysis for the POE-influenced methylome using GS:SFHS (Ndiscovery = 5087, Nreplication = 4450). We identify and replicate 92 POE-CpG-phenotype associations. Most of the associations are contributed by the POE-CpGs belonging to the atypical class where the most strongly enriched associations are with aging (DNAmTL acceleration), intelligence, and parental (maternal) smoking exposure phenotypes. A proportion of the atypical POE-CpGs form co-methylation networks (modules) which are associated with these phenotypes, with one of the aging-associated modules displaying increased within-module methylation connectivity with age. The atypical POE-CpGs also display high levels of methylation heterogeneity, fast information loss with age, and a strong correlation with CpGs contained within epigenetic clocks.These results identify the association between the atypical POE-influenced methylome and aging and provide new evidence for the ""early development of origin"" hypothesis for aging in humans.© 2023.

,Yes,20230525,ewas,37188674,Integrative genomic analyses in adipocytes implicate DNA methylation in human obesity and diabetes.,Nat Commun,"DNA methylation variations are prevalent in human obesity but evidence of a causative role in disease pathogenesis is limited. Here, we combine epigenome-wide association and integrative genomics to investigate the impact of adipocyte DNA methylation variations in human obesity. We discover extensive DNA methylation changes that are robustly associated with obesity (N = 190 samples, 691 loci in subcutaneous and 173 loci in visceral adipocytes, P < 1 × 10-7). We connect obesity-associated methylation variations to transcriptomic changes at >500 target genes, and identify putative methylation-transcription factor interactions. Through Mendelian Randomisation, we infer causal effects of methylation on obesity and obesity-induced metabolic disturbances at 59 independent loci. Targeted methylation sequencing, CRISPR-activation and gene silencing in adipocytes, further identifies regional methylation variations, underlying regulatory elements and novel cellular metabolic effects. Our results indicate DNA methylation is an important determinant of human obesity and its metabolic complications, and reveal mechanisms through which altered methylation may impact adipocyte functions.© 2023.

Sam,Yes,20230525,ewas,37188670,DNA methylation markers for kidney function and progression of diabetic kidney disease.,Nat Commun,"Epigenetic markers are potential biomarkers for diabetes and related complications. Using a prospective cohort from the Hong Kong Diabetes Register, we perform two independent epigenome-wide association studies to identify methylation markers associated with baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and subsequent decline in kidney function (eGFR slope), respectively, in 1,271 type 2 diabetes subjects. Here we show 40 (30 previously unidentified) and eight (all previously unidentified) CpG sites individually reach epigenome-wide significance for baseline eGFR and eGFR slope, respectively. We also develop a multisite analysis method, which selects 64 and 37 CpG sites for baseline eGFR and eGFR slope, respectively. These models are validated in an independent cohort of Native Americans with type 2 diabetes. Our identified CpG sites are near genes enriched for functional roles in kidney diseases, and some show association with renal damage. This study highlights the potential of methylation markers in risk stratification of kidney disease among type 2 diabetes individuals.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Alterations in DNA methylations due to exposure towards environmental risk factors are widely sought markers for T2DM risk prediction. To identify such individual DNA methylation signatures and their effect on disease risk, we performed an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) in 844 Indian individuals of Indo-European origin. We identified and validated methylation alterations at 2 novel CpG sites in MIR1287 (cg01178710), and EDN2-SCMH1 (cg04673737) genes associated with T2DM risk at the epigenome-wide-significance-level (p < 1.2x10-7). Further, we also replicated the association of 2 known CpG sites in TXNIP, and CPT1A in the Indian population. With 535 EWAS significant CpGs (p < 1.2x10-7) identified in the discovery phase samples, we created a co-methylation network using weighted correlation network analysis and identified 4 modules among the CpGs. We observed that methylation of one of the module associates with T2DM risk factors (e.g. BMI, insulin, C-peptide) and can be used as markers to segregate T2DM patients with good glycemic control (e.g. low HbA1c) and dyslipidemia (low HDL and high TG) from the other patients. Additionally, an intronic SNP (rs6503650) in the JUP gene, a member of the same module, associated with methylation at all the 14 hub CpG sites of that module as methQTL. Our network-assisted epigenome-wide association study is the first to systematically explore DNA methylation variations conferring risks to T2DM in Indians and use the identified risk CpG sites for patient segregation with different clinical outcomes. These findings can be useful for better stratification of patients to improve the clinical management and treatment effects.© The Author(s) 2023. Published by Oxford University Press.

DNA methylation have been associated with kidney function in the general population, however, their relationships are unclear for PWH of African ancestry.We performed epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) among PWH of African ancestry in 2 subsets of the Veterans Aging Cohort Study cohort (N = 885), followed by a meta-analysis to combine the results. Replication was conducted among independent African American samples without HIV.DNA methylation sites cg17944885 near Zinc Finger Family Member 788 (ZNF788) and Zinc Finger Protein 20 (ZNF20), and cg06930757 inSHANK1were significantly associated with eGFR among PWH of African ancestry (false discovery rate < 0.05). DNA methylation site cg17944885 was also associated with eGFR among different populations including African Americans without HIV.Our study attempted to address an important gap in the literature and to understand the role of DNA methylation in renal diseases in PWH of African ancestry. Replication of cg17944885 among different populations suggests there may be a common pathway for renal diseases progression among PWH and people without HIV, and across different ancestral groups. Our results suggest that genesZNF788/ZNF20andSHANK1could be involved in a pathway linking DNA methylation to renal diseases among PWH and are worth further investigation."
,Yes,20230525,mqtl,37169753,meQTL mapping in the GENOA study reveals genetic determinants of DNA methylation in African Americans.,Nat Commun,"Identifying genetic variants that are associated with variation in DNA methylation, an analysis commonly referred to as methylation quantitative trait locus (meQTL) mapping, is an important first step towards understanding the genetic architecture underlying epigenetic variation. Most existing meQTL mapping studies have focused on individuals of European ancestry and are underrepresented in other populations, with a particular absence of large studies in populations with African ancestry. We fill this critical knowledge gap by performing a large-scale cis-meQTL mapping study in 961 African Americans from the Genetic Epidemiology Network of Arteriopathy (GENOA) study. We identify a total of 4,565,687 cis-acting meQTLs in 320,965 meCpGs. We find that 45% of meCpGs harbor multiple independent meQTLs, suggesting potential polygenic genetic architecture underlying methylation variation. A large percentage of the cis-meQTLs also colocalize with cis-expression QTLs (eQTLs) in the same population. Importantly, the identified cis-meQTLs explain a substantial proportion (median = 24.6%) of methylation variation. In addition, the cis-meQTL associated CpG sites mediate a substantial proportion (median = 24.9%) of SNP effects underlying gene expression. Overall, our results represent an important step toward revealing the co-regulation of methylation and gene expression, facilitating the functional interpretation of epigenetic and gene regulation underlying common diseases in African Americans.© 2023.

,Yes,20230525,ewas,37145884,Gene Set Based Integrated Methylome and Transcriptome Analysis Reveals Potential Molecular Mechanisms Linking Cigarette Smoking and Related Diseases.,OMICS,"Advanced integrative analysis of DNA methylation and transcriptomics data may provide deeper insights into smoke-induced epigenetic alterations, their effects on gene expression and related biological processes, linking cigarette smoking and related diseases. We hypothesize that accumulation of DNA methylation changes in CpG sites across genomic locations of different genes might have biological significance. We tested the hypothesis by performing gene set based integrative analysis of blood DNA methylation and transcriptomics data to identify potential transcriptomic consequences of smoking via changes in DNA methylation in the Young Finns Study (YFS) participants (n = 1114, aged 34-49 years, women: 54%, men: 46%). First, we performed epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of smoking. We then defined sets of genes based on DNA methylation status within their genomic regions, for example, sets of genes containing hyper- or hypomethylated CpG sites in their body or promoter regions. Gene set analysis was performed using transcriptomics data from the same participants. Two sets of genes, one containing 49 genes with hypomethylated CpG sites in their body region and the other containing 33 genes with hypomethylated CpG sites in their promoter region, were differentially expressed among the smokers. Genes in the two gene sets are involved in bone formation, metal ion transport, cell death, peptidyl-serine phosphorylation, and cerebral cortex development process, revealing epigenetic-transcriptomic pathways to smoking-related diseases such as osteoporosis, atherosclerosis, and cognitive impairment. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the pathophysiology of smoking-related diseases and may provide potential therapeutic targets."

DNA methylation (DNAm), an essential process for healthy neurodevelopment, is a key molecular system of interest. In this study, we conducted the first epigenome-wide association study of neonatal DNAm with childhood fine motor ability and further examined the replicability of epigenetic markers in an independent cohort. The discovery study was embedded in Generation R, a large population-based prospective cohort, including a subsample of 924 ~ 1026 European-ancestry singletons with available data on DNAm in cord blood and fine motor ability at a mean (SD) age of 9.8 (0.4) years. Fine motor ability was measured using a finger-tapping test (3 subtests including left-, right-hand and bimanual), one of the most frequently used neuropsychological instruments of fine motor function. The replication study comprised 326 children with a mean (SD) age of 6.8 (0.4) years from an independent cohort, the INfancia Medio Ambiente (INMA) study. Four CpG sites at birth were prospectively associated with childhood fine motor ability after genome-wide correction. Of these, one CpG (cg07783800 in GNG4) was replicated in INMA, showing that lower levels of methylation at this site were associated with lower fine motor performance in both cohorts. GNG4 is highly expressed in the brain and has been implicated in cognitive decline. Our findings support a prospective, reproducible association between DNAm at birth and fine motor ability in childhood, pointing to GNG4 methylation at birth as a potential biomarker of fine motor ability."
,No,20230525,dnamage,37163025,Decoding the role of transcriptomic clocks in the human prefrontal cortex.,medRxiv,"Aging is a complex process with interindividual variability, which can be measured by aging biological clocks. Aging clocks are machine-learning algorithms guided by biological information and associated with mortality risk and a wide range of health outcomes. One of these aging clocks are transcriptomic clocks, which uses gene expression data to predict biological age; however, their functional role is unknown. Here, we profiled two transcriptomic clocks (RNAAgeCalc and knowledge-based deep neural network clock) in a large dataset of human postmortem prefrontal cortex (PFC) samples. We identified that deep-learning transcriptomic clock outperforms RNAAgeCalc to predict transcriptomic age in the human PFC. We identified associations of transcriptomic clocks with psychiatric-related traits. Further, we applied system biology algorithms to identify common gene networks among both clocks and performed pathways enrichment analyses to assess its functionality and prioritize genes involved in the aging processes. Identified gene networks showed enrichment for diseases of signal transduction by growth factor receptors and second messenger pathways. We also observed enrichment of genome-wide signals of mental and physical health outcomes and identified genes previously associated with human brain aging. Our findings suggest a link between transcriptomic aging and health disorders, including psychiatric traits. Further, it reveals functional genes within the human PFC that may play an important role in aging and health risk."
Sarah,No,20230525,dnamage,36812475,DNAmFitAge: biological age indicator incorporating physical fitness,Aging (Albany NY),"Physical fitness is a well-known correlate of health and the aging process and DNA methylation (DNAm) data can capture aging via epigenetic clocks. However, current epigenetic clocks did not yet use measures of mobility, strength, lung, or endurance fitness in their construction. We develop blood-based DNAm biomarkers for fitness parameters gait speed (walking speed), maximum handgrip strength, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), and maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) which have modest correlation with fitness parameters in five large-scale validation datasets (average r between 0.16-0.48). We then use these DNAm fitness parameter biomarkers with DNAmGrimAge, a DNAm mortality risk estimate, to construct DNAmFitAge, a new biological age indicator that incorporates physical fitness. DNAmFitAge is associated with low-intermediate physical activity levels across validation datasets (p = 6.4E-13), and younger/fitter DNAmFitAge corresponds to stronger DNAm fitness parameters in both males and females. DNAmFitAge is lower (p = 0.046) and DNAmVO2max is higher (p = 0.023) in male body builders compared to controls. Physically fit people have a younger DNAmFitAge and experience better age-related outcomes: lower mortality risk (p = 7.2E-51), coronary heart disease risk (p = 2.6E-8), and increased disease-free status (p = 1.1E-7). These new DNAm biomarkers provide researchers a new method to incorporate physical fitness into epigenetic clocks."

Here, we examine the relationship between physical fitness and DNAm-based biomarkers in adults aged 33-88 with a wide range of physical fitness (including athletes with long-term training history). Higher levels of VO2max (ρ = 0.2, p = 6.4E - 4, r = 0.19, p = 1.2E - 3), Jumpmax (p = 0.11, p = 5.5E - 2, r = 0.13, p = 2.8E - 2), Gripmax (ρ = 0.17, p = 3.5E - 3, r = 0.16, p = 5.6E - 3), and HDL levels (ρ = 0.18, p = 1.95E - 3, r = 0.19, p = 1.1E - 3) are associated with better verbal short-term memory. In addition, verbal short-term memory is associated with decelerated aging assessed with the new DNAm biomarker FitAgeAcceleration (ρ: - 0.18, p = 0.0017). DNAmFitAge can distinguish high-fitness individuals from low/medium-fitness individuals better than existing DNAm biomarkers and estimates a younger biological age in the high-fit males and females (1.5 and 2.0 years younger, respectively). Our research shows that regular physical exercise contributes to observable physiological and methylation differences which are beneficial to the aging process. DNAmFitAge has now emerged as a new biological marker of quality of life.© 2023. The Author(s)."

This study aims to identify novel causal proteins in the brains of patients with ALS using an integrative analytical pipeline.Using the datasets of Protein Quantitative Trait Loci (pQTL) (NpQTL1 = 376, NpQTL2 = 152), expression QTL (eQTL) (N = 452), and the largest ALS GWAS (NALS=27,205, NControls = 110,881), we performed a systematic analytical pipeline including Proteome-Wide Association Study (PWAS), Mendelian Randomization (MR), Bayesian colocalization, and Transcriptome-Wide Association Study (TWAS) to identify novel causal proteins for ALS in the brain.Using PWAS, we found that the altered protein abundance of 12 genes in the brain was associated with ALS. Three genes (SCFD1, SARM1 and CAMLG) were identified as lead causal genes for ALS with solid evidence (False discovery rate < 0.05, in MR analysis; PPH4 > 80% for Bayesian colocalization). Specifically, an increased abundance of SCFD1 and CAMLG led to an increased risk of ALS, whereas a higher abundance of SARM1 led to a decreased risk of developing ALS. TWAS showed that SCFD1 and CAMLG were related to ALS at the transcriptional level.SCFD1, CAMLG, and SARM1 exhibited robust associations and causality with ALS. The study findings provide novel clues for identifying potential therapeutic targets in ALS. Further studies are required to explore the mechanisms underlying the identified genes.© 2023.

Matt,No,20230525,single-cell,37161089,Interpreting non-coding disease-associated human variants using single-cell epigenomics.,Nat Rev Genet,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have linked hundreds of thousands of sequence variants in the human genome to common traits and diseases. However, translating this knowledge into a mechanistic understanding of disease-relevant biology remains challenging, largely because such variants are predominantly in non-protein-coding sequences that still lack functional annotation at cell-type resolution. Recent advances in single-cell epigenomics assays have enabled the generation of cell type-, subtype- and state-resolved maps of the epigenome in heterogeneous human tissues. These maps have facilitated cell type-specific annotation of candidate cis-regulatory elements and their gene targets in the human genome, enhancing our ability to interpret the genetic basis of common traits and diseases.© 2023.

,No,20230525,cfdna,37075072,Fragmentation landscape of cell-free DNA revealed by deconvolutional analysis of end motifs.,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,"Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) fragmentation is nonrandom, at least partially mediated by various DNA nucleases, forming characteristic cfDNA end motifs. However, there is a paucity of tools for deciphering the relative contributions of cfDNA cleavage patterns related to underlying fragmentation factors. In this study, through non-negative matrix factorization algorithm, we used 256 5' 4-mer end motifs to identify distinct types of cfDNA cleavage patterns, referred to as ""founder"" end-motif profiles (F-profiles). F-profiles were associated with different DNA nucleases based on whether such patterns were disrupted in nuclease-knockout mouse models. Contributions of individual F-profiles in a cfDNA sample could be determined by deconvolutional analysis. We analyzed 93 murine cfDNA samples of different nuclease-deficient mice and identified six types of F-profiles. F-profiles I, II, and III were linked to deoxyribonuclease 1 like 3 (DNASE1L3), deoxyribonuclease 1 (DNASE1), and DNA fragmentation factor subunit beta (DFFB), respectively. We revealed that 42.9% of plasma cfDNA molecules were attributed to DNASE1L3-mediated fragmentation, whereas 43.4% of urinary cfDNA molecules involved DNASE1-mediated fragmentation. We further demonstrated that the relative contributions of F-profiles were useful to inform pathological states, such as autoimmune disorders and cancer. Among the six F-profiles, the use of F-profile I could inform the human patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. F-profile VI could be used to detect individuals with hepatocellular carcinoma, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.97. F-profile VI was more prominent in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma undergoing chemoradiotherapy. We proposed that this profile might be related to oxidative stress."

Datasets contained demographic information, environment stress factors, and the methylation levels of 38 methylated sites of tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2) genes in peripheral blood samples. Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) was employed to select features. Five classification algorithms (logistic regression, classification and regression trees, support vector machine, logitboost and random forests) were used to establish the models. Performance metrics (AUC, F-Measure, G-Mean, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value) were computed with 5-fold-cross-validation. Variable importance was evaluated by random forest algorithm.RF with RFE outperformed the other models in our samples based on the demographic information and clinical features (AUC = 61.2%, 95%CI: 60.1-62.4%) / TPH2 CpGs features (AUC = 66.6%, 95%CI: 65.4-67.8%) / both clinical and TPH2 CpGs features (AUC = 72.9%, 95%CI: 71.8-74.0%).The effects of TPH2 on the early-stage antidepressant response were explored by machine learning algorithms. On the basis of the baseline depression severity and TPH2 CpG sites, machine learning approaches can enhance our ability to predict the early-stage antidepressant response. Some potentially important predictors (e.g., TPH2-10-60 (rs2129575), TPH2-2-163 (rs11178998), age of first onset, age) in early-stage treatment response could be utilized in future fundamental research, drug development and clinical practice.© 2023.

Matt,No,20230525,transgenerational,37170330,Loss of CpG island immunity to DNA methylation induced by mutation.,Epigenetics Chromatin,"The inheritance of acquired traits in mammals is a highly controversial topic in biology. Recently, Takahashi et al. (Cell 186:715-731, 2023) have reported that insertion of CpG-free DNA into a CpG island (CGI) can induce DNA methylation of the CGI and that this aberrant methylation pattern can be transmitted across generations, even after removal of the foreign DNA. These results were interpreted as evidence for transgenerational inheritance of acquired DNA methylation patterns. Here, we discuss several interpretational issues raised by this study and consider alternative explanations.© 2023. The Author(s)."
,No,20230525,methods,37161088,Beyond assembly: the increasing flexibility of single-molecule sequencing technology.,Nat Rev Genet,"The maturation of high-throughput short-read sequencing technology over the past two decades has shaped the way genomes are studied. Recently, single-molecule, long-read sequencing has emerged as an essential tool in deciphering genome structure and function, including filling gaps in the human reference genome, measuring the epigenome and characterizing splicing variants in the transcriptome. With recent technological developments, these single-molecule technologies have moved beyond genome assembly and are being used in a variety of ways, including to selectively sequence specific loci with long reads, measure chromatin state and protein-DNA binding in order to investigate the dynamics of gene regulation, and rapidly determine copy number variation. These increasingly flexible uses of single-molecule technologies highlight a young and fast-moving part of the field that is leading to a more accessible era of nucleic acid sequencing.© 2023.

Matt,No,20230525,pangenome,37165242,A draft human pangenome reference.,Nature,"Here the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium presents a first draft of the human pangenome reference. The pangenome contains 47 phased, diploid assemblies from a cohort of genetically diverse individuals1. These assemblies cover more than 99% of the expected sequence in each genome and are more than 99% accurate at the structural and base pair levels. Based on alignments of the assemblies, we generate a draft pangenome that captures known variants and haplotypes and reveals new alleles at structurally complex loci. We also add 119 million base pairs of euchromatic polymorphic sequences and 1,115 gene duplications relative to the existing reference GRCh38. Roughly 90 million of the additional base pairs are derived from structural variation. Using our draft pangenome to analyse short-read data reduced small variant discovery errors by 34% and increased the number of structural variants detected per haplotype by 104% compared with GRCh38-based workflows, which enabled the typing of the vast majority of structural variant alleles per sample.© 2023.

,No,20230525,pangenome,37165241,Recombination between heterologous human acrocentric chromosomes.,Nature,"The short arms of the human acrocentric chromosomes 13, 14, 15, 21 and 22 (SAACs) share large homologous regions, including ribosomal DNA repeats and extended segmental duplications1,2. Although the resolution of these regions in the first complete assembly of a human genome-the Telomere-to-Telomere Consortium's CHM13 assembly (T2T-CHM13)-provided a model of their homology3, it remained unclear whether these patterns were ancestral or maintained by ongoing recombination exchange. Here we show that acrocentric chromosomes contain pseudo-homologous regions (PHRs) indicative of recombination between non-homologous sequences. Utilizing an all-to-all comparison of the human pangenome from the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium4(HPRC), we find that contigs from all of the SAACs form a community. A variation graph5constructed from centromere-spanning acrocentric contigs indicates the presence of regions in which most contigs appear nearly identical between heterologous acrocentric chromosomes in T2T-CHM13. Except on chromosome 15, we observe faster decay of linkage disequilibrium in the pseudo-homologous regions than in the corresponding short and long arms, indicating higher rates of recombination6,7. The pseudo-homologous regions include sequences that have previously been shown to lie at the breakpoint of Robertsonian translocations8, and their arrangement is compatible with crossover in inverted duplications on chromosomes 13, 14 and 21. The ubiquity of signals of recombination between heterologous acrocentric chromosomes seen in the HPRC draft pangenome suggests that these shared sequences form the basis for recurrent Robertsonian translocations, providing sequence and population-based confirmation of hypotheses first developed from cytogenetic studies 50 years ago9.© 2023.

,No,20230525,genetics,37165237,Increased mutation and gene conversion within human segmental duplications.,Nature,"Single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) in segmental duplications (SDs) have not been systematically assessed because of the limitations of mapping short-read sequencing data1,2. Here we constructed 1:1 unambiguous alignments spanning high-identity SDs across 102 human haplotypes and compared the pattern of SNVs between unique and duplicated regions3,4. We find that human SNVs are elevated 60% in SDs compared to unique regions and estimate that at least 23% of this increase is due to interlocus gene conversion (IGC) with up to 4.3 megabase pairs of SD sequence converted on average per human haplotype. We develop a genome-wide map of IGC donors and acceptors, including 498 acceptor and 454 donor hotspots affecting the exons of about 800 protein-coding genes. These include 171 genes that have 'relocated' on average 1.61 megabase pairs in a subset of human haplotypes. Using a coalescent framework, we show that SD regions are slightly evolutionarily older when compared to unique sequences, probably owing to IGC. SNVs in SDs, however, show a distinct mutational spectrum: a 27.1% increase in transversions that convert cytosine to guanine or the reverse across all triplet contexts and a 7.6% reduction in the frequency of CpG-associated mutations when compared to unique DNA. We reason that these distinct mutational properties help to maintain an overall higher GC content of SD DNA compared to that of unique DNA, probably driven by GC-biased conversion between paralogous sequences5,6.© 2023.

,No,20230525,nanopore,37217507,Linear time complexity de novo long read genome assembly with GoldRush.,Nat Commun,"Current state-of-the-art de novo long read genome assemblers follow the Overlap-Layout-Consensus paradigm. While read-to-read overlap - its most costly step - was improved in modern long read genome assemblers, these tools still often require excessive RAM when assembling a typical human dataset. Our work departs from this paradigm, foregoing all-vs-all sequence alignments in favor of a dynamic data structure implemented in GoldRush, a de novo long read genome assembly algorithm with linear time complexity. We tested GoldRush on Oxford Nanopore Technologies long sequencing read datasets with different base error profiles sourced from three human cell lines, rice, and tomato. Here, we show that GoldRush achieves assembly scaffold NGA50 lengths of 18.3-22.2, 0.3 and 2.6 Mbp, for the genomes of human, rice, and tomato, respectively, and assembles each genome within a day, using at most 54.5 GB of random-access memory, demonstrating the scalability of our genome assembly paradigm and its implementation.© 2023.

,No,20230525,methods,37149669,Generalising uncertainty improves accuracy and safety of deep learning analytics applied to oncology.,Sci Rep,"Uncertainty estimation is crucial for understanding the reliability of deep learning (DL) predictions, and critical for deploying DL in the clinic. Differences between training and production datasets can lead to incorrect predictions with underestimated uncertainty. To investigate this pitfall, we benchmarked one pointwise and three approximate Bayesian DL models for predicting cancer of unknown primary, using three RNA-seq datasets with 10,968 samples across 57 cancer types. Our results highlight that simple and scalable Bayesian DL significantly improves the generalisation of uncertainty estimation. Moreover, we designed a prototypical metric-the area between development and production curve (ADP), which evaluates the accuracy loss when deploying models from development to production. Using ADP, we demonstrate that Bayesian DL improves accuracy under data distributional shifts when utilising 'uncertainty thresholding'. In summary, Bayesian DL is a promising approach for generalising uncertainty, improving performance, transparency, and safety of DL models for deployment in the real world.© 2023. The Author(s)."

We developed a strategy using nanopore-based single-molecule sequencing to measure cfDNA methylomes. This approach generated up to 200 million reads for a single cfDNA sample from cancer patients, an order of magnitude improvement over existing nanopore sequencing methods. We developed a single-molecule classifier to determine whether individual reads originated from a tumor or immune cells. Leveraging methylomes of matched tumors and immune cells, we characterized cfDNA methylomes of cancer patients for longitudinal monitoring during treatment.© 2023. The Author(s)."
