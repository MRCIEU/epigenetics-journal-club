"37221626","The Swedish childhood tumor biobank: systematic collection and molecular characterization of all pediatric CNS and other solid tumors in Sweden.","J Transl Med","The Swedish Childhood Tumor Biobank (BTB) is a nonprofit national infrastructure for collecting tissue samples and genomic data from pediatric patients diagnosed with central nervous system (CNS) and other solid tumors. The BTB is built on a multidisciplinary network established to provide the scientific community with standardized biospecimens and genomic data, thereby improving knowledge of the biology, treatment and outcome of childhood tumors. As of 2022, over 1100 fresh-frozen tumor samples are available for researchers. We present the workflow of the BTB from sample collection and processing to the generation of genomic data and services offered. To determine the research and clinical utility of the data, we performed bioinformatics analyses on next-generation sequencing (NGS) data obtained from a subset of 82 brain tumors and patient blood-derived DNA combined with methylation profiling to enhance the diagnostic accuracy and identified germline and somatic alterations with potential biological or clinical significance. The BTB procedures for collection, processing, sequencing, and bioinformatics deliver high-quality data. We observed that the findings could impact patient management by confirming or clarifying the diagnosis in 79 of the 82 tumors and detecting known or likely driver mutations in 68 of 79 patients. In addition to revealing known mutations in a broad spectrum of genes implicated in pediatric cancer, we discovered numerous alterations that may represent novel driver events and specific tumor entities. In summary, these examples reveal the power of NGS to identify a wide number of actionable gene alterations. Making the power of NGS available in healthcare is a challenging task requiring the integration of the work of clinical specialists and cancer biologists; this approach requires a dedicated infrastructure, as exemplified here by the BTB.© 2023.

In the present study, 241 natural accessions of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) were grown under two different temperature regimes, 16 °C and 6 °C, and growth parameters were recorded, together with metabolite profiles, to investigate the natural genome × environment effects on metabolome variation. The plasticity of metabolism, which was captured by metabolic distance measures, varied considerably between accessions. Both relative growth rates and metabolic distances were predictable by the underlying natural genetic variation of accessions. Applying machine learning methods, climatic variables of the original growth habitats were tested for their predictive power of natural metabolic variation among accessions. We found specifically habitat temperature during the first quarter of the year to be the best predictor of the plasticity of primary metabolism, indicating habitat temperature as the causal driver of evolutionary cold adaptation processes. Analyses of epigenome- and genome-wide associations revealed accession-specific differential DNA-methylation levels as potentially linked to the metabolome and identified FUMARASE2 as strongly associated with cold adaptation in Arabidopsis accessions. These findings were supported by calculations of the biochemical Jacobian matrix based on variance and covariance of metabolomics data, which revealed that growth under low temperatures most substantially affects the accession-specific plasticity of fumarate and sugar metabolism. Our findings indicate that the plasticity of metabolic regulation is predictable from the genome and epigenome and driven evolutionarily by Arabidopsis growth habitats.© The Author(s) 2023.

"37218021","Profiling the immune epigenome across global cattle breeds.","Genome Biol","Understanding the variation between well and poorly adapted cattle breeds to local environments and pathogens is essential for breeding cattle with improved climate and disease-resistant phenotypes. Although considerable progress has been made towards identifying genetic differences between breeds, variation at the epigenetic and chromatin levels remains poorly characterized. Here, we generate, sequence and analyse over 150 libraries at base-pair resolution to explore the dynamics of DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility of the bovine immune system across three distinct cattle lineages.We find extensive epigenetic divergence between the taurine and indicine cattle breeds across immune cell types, which is linked to the levels of local DNA sequence divergence between the two cattle sub-species. The unique cell type profiles enable the deconvolution of complex cellular mixtures using digital cytometry approaches. Finally, we show distinct sub-categories of CpG islands based on their chromatin and methylation profiles that discriminate between classes of distal and gene proximal islands linked to discrete transcriptional states.Our study provides a comprehensive resource of DNA methylation, chromatin accessibility and RNA expression profiles of three diverse cattle populations. The findings have important implications, from understanding how genetic editing across breeds, and consequently regulatory backgrounds, may have distinct impacts to designing effective cattle epigenome-wide association studies in non-European breeds.© 2023.

"37216580","Impact of tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana on genome-wide DNA methylation and its relationship with hypertension.","Epigenetics","Tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana consumption is an important public health problem because of their high use worldwide and their association with the risk of mortality and many health conditions, such as hypertension, which is the commonest risk factor for death throughout the world. A likely pathway of action of substance consumption leading to persistent hypertension is DNA methylation. Here, we evaluated the effects of tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana on DNA methylation in the same cohort (N = 3,424). Three epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) were assessed in whole blood using the InfiniumHumanMethylationEPIC BeadChip. We also evaluated the mediation of the top CpG sites in the association between substance consumption and hypertension. Our analyses showed 2,569 CpG sites differentially methylated by alcohol drinking and 528 by tobacco smoking. We did not find significant associations with marijuana consumption after correcting for multiple comparisons. We found 61 genes overlapping between alcohol and tobacco that were enriched in biological processes involved in the nervous and cardiovascular systems. In the mediation analysis, we found 66 CpG sites that significantly mediated the effect of alcohol consumption on hypertension. The top alcohol-related CpG site (cg06690548, P-value = 5.9·10-83) mapped to SLC7A11 strongly mediated 70.5% of the effect of alcohol consumption on hypertension (P-value = 0.006). Our findings suggest that DNA methylation should be considered for new targets in hypertension prevention and management, particularly concerning alcohol consumption. Our data also encourage further research into the use of methylation in blood to study the neurological and cardiovascular effects of substance consumption."

Functional analysis showed that these DMGs were mainly enriched in biological process, cellular component and molecular function, Some of the genes in these pathways are involved in fat metabolism:NFATC4,LPIN2,MGAT2andMAT2B.Our results may help to further understand the epigenetic regulation mechanisms of deposition of fat in the tail of sheep and provide new basic data for the study of local sheep.Copyright © 2023 Caiye, Song, Li, Huang, Luo and Fang."
"37214877","Monomethylation of Lysine 27 at Histone 3 Confers Lifelong Susceptibility to Stress.","bioRxiv","Histone post-translational modifications are critical for mediating persistent alterations in gene expression. By combining unbiased proteomics profiling, and genome-wide approaches, we uncovered a role for mono-methylation of lysine 27 at histone H3 (H3K27me1) in the enduring effects of stress. Specifically, mice exposed to early life stress (ELS) or to chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) in adulthood displayed increased enrichment of H3K27me1, and transient decreases in H3K27me2, in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a key brain-reward region. Stress induction of H3K27me1 was mediated by the VEFS domain of SUZ12, a core subunit of the polycomb repressive complex-2, which is induced by chronic stress and controls H3K27 methylation patterns. Overexpression of the VEFS domain led to social, emotional, and cognitive abnormalities, and altered excitability of NAc D1 mediums spiny neurons. Together, we describe a novel function of H3K27me1 in brain and demonstrate its role as a ""chromatin scar"" that mediates lifelong stress susceptibility."

Epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) results of individual cohorts were combined by random-effect meta-analysis. A three-stage selection procedure (discovery, n = 884; testing, n = 520; validation, n = 879) established an epigenetic risk score including 30 CpG sites. Epigenetic age was assessed by Horvath's multi-tissue clock and Shireby's cortical clock.EWAS meta-analysis revealed 149 CpG sites linked to 136 genes (P < 0.05 after Bonferroni correction) in blood and 23 CpG linked to 18 genes in brain (false discovery rate [FDR] < 5%). Gene-set analyses of blood EWAS results suggested enrichments in brain tissue types and in subunits of the kainate-selective glutamate receptor complex. Individual candidate genes of the brain EWAS could be assigned to neurodevelopmental or metabolic traits. The blood epigenetic risk score achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.70 (0.67-0.73) in the validation set, comparable to analogous scores in other neurobehavioral disorders. A significant difference in biological age in blood or brain of RLS patients was not detectable.DNA methylation supports the notion of altered neurodevelopment in RLS. Epigenetic risk scores are reliably associated with RLS but require even higher accuracy to be useful as biomarkers. © 2023 The Authors.

"37211699","YBX1-Mediated DNA Methylation-Dependent SHANK3 Expression in PBMCs and Developing Cortical Interneurons in Schizophrenia.","Adv Sci (Weinh)","Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a severe psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorder. The pathological process of SCZ starts early during development, way before the first onset of psychotic symptoms. DNA methylation plays an important role in regulating gene expression and dysregulated DNA methylation is involved in the pathogenesis of various diseases. The methylated DNA immunoprecipitation-chip (MeDIP-chip) is performed to investigate genome-wide DNA methylation dysregulation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with first-episode SCZ (FES). Results show that the SHANK3 promoter is hypermethylated, and this hypermethylation (HyperM) is negatively correlated with the cortical surface area in the left inferior temporal cortex and positively correlated with the negative symptom subscores in FES. The transcription factor YBX1 is further found to bind to the HyperM region of SHANK3 promoter in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)-derived cortical interneurons (cINs) but not glutamatergic neurons. Furthermore, a direct and positive regulatory effect of YBX1 on the expression of SHANK3 is confirmed in cINs using shRNAs. In summary, the dysregulated SHANK3 expression in cINs suggests the potential role of DNA methylation in the neuropathological mechanism underlying SCZ. The results also suggest that HyperM of SHANK3 in PBMCs can serve as a potential peripheral biomarker of SCZ.© 2023 The Authors. Advanced Science published by Wiley-VCH GmbH."
"37210576","EZH2 mediated metabolic rewiring promotes tumor growth independently of histone methyltransferase activity in ovarian cancer.","Mol Cancer","Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), the key catalytic subunit of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), is overexpressed and plays an oncogenic role in various cancers through catalysis-dependent or catalysis-independent pathways. However, the related mechanisms contributing to ovarian cancer (OC) are not well understood.The levels of EZH2 and H3K27me3 were evaluated in 105 OC patients by immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining, and these patients were stratified based on these levels. Canonical and noncanonical binding sites of EZH2 were defined by chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq). The EZH2 solo targets were obtained by integrative analysis of ChIP-Seq and RNA sequencing data. In vitro and in vivo experiments were performed to determine the role of EZH2 in OC growth.We showed that a subgroup of OC patients with high EZH2 expression but low H3K27me3 exhibited the worst prognosis, with limited therapeutic options. We demonstrated that induction of EZH2 degradation but not catalytic inhibition profoundly blocked OC cell proliferation and tumorigenicity in vitro and in vivo. Integrative analysis of genome-wide chromatin and transcriptome profiles revealed extensive EZH2 occupancy not only at genomic loci marked by H3K27me3 but also at promoters independent of PRC2, indicating a noncanonical role of EZH2 in OC. Mechanistically, EZH2 transcriptionally upregulated IDH2 to potentiate metabolic rewiring by enhancing tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) activity, which contributed to the growth of OC.These data reveal a novel oncogenic role of EZH2 in OC and identify potential therapeutic strategies for OC by targeting the noncatalytic activity of EZH2.© 2023.

"37210443","Epigenome-wide association study of diabetic chronic kidney disease progression in the Korean population: the KNOW-CKD study.","Sci Rep","Since the etiology of diabetic chronic kidney disease (CKD) is multifactorial, studies on DNA methylation for kidney function deterioration have rarely been performed despite the need for an epigenetic approach. Therefore, this study aimed to identify epigenetic markers associated with CKD progression based on the decline in the estimated glomerular filtration rate in diabetic CKD in Korea. An epigenome-wide association study was performed using whole blood samples from 180 CKD recruited from the KNOW-CKD cohort. Pyrosequencing was also performed on 133 CKD participants as an external replication analysis. Functional analyses, including the analysis of disease-gene networks, reactome pathways, and protein-protein interaction networks, were conducted to identify the biological mechanisms of CpG sites. A phenome-wide association study was performed to determine the associations between CpG sites and other phenotypes. Two epigenetic markers, cg10297223 on AGTR1 and cg02990553 on KRT28 indicated a potential association with diabetic CKD progression. Based on the functional analyses, other phenotypes (blood pressure and cardiac arrhythmia for AGTR1) and biological pathways (keratinization and cornified envelope for KRT28) related to CKD were also identified. This study suggests a potential association between the cg10297223 and cg02990553 and the progression of diabetic CKD in Koreans. Nevertheless, further validation is needed through additional studies.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37208763","DDT-RELATED PROTEIN4-IMITATION SWITCH alters nucleosome distribution to relieve transcriptional silencing in Arabidopsis.","Plant Cell","DNA methylation is a conserved epigenetic modification that is typically associated with silencing of transposable elements and promoter methylated genes. However, some DNA-methylated loci are protected from silencing, allowing transcriptional flexibility in response to environmental and developmental cues. Through a genetic screen in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), we uncovered an antagonistic relationship between the MICRORCHIDIA (MORC) protein and the IMITATION SWITCH (ISWI) complex in regulating the DNA-methylated SUPPRESSOR OF DRM1 DRM2 CMT3 (SDC) reporter. We demonstrate that components of the plant-specific ISWI complex, including CHROMATIN REMODELING PROTEIN11 (CHR11), CHR17, DDT-RELATED PROTEIN4 (DDR4), and DDR5, function to partially de-repress silenced genes and transposable elements (TEs), through their function in regulating nucleosome distribution. This action also requires the known transcriptional activator DNAJ proteins, providing a mechanistic link between nucleosome remodeling and transcriptional activation. Genome-wide studies revealed that DDR4 causes changes in nucleosome distribution at numerous loci, a subset of which is associated with changes in DNA methylation and/or transcription. Our work reveals a mechanism for balancing transcriptional flexibility and faithful silencing of DNA-methylated loci. As both ISWI and MORC family genes are widely distributed across plant and animal species, our findings may represent a conserved eukaryotic mechanism for fine-tuning gene expression under epigenetic regulation.© The Author(s) 2023.

"37208732","Combined inhibition of histone deacetylase and cytidine deaminase improves epigenetic potency of decitabine in colorectal adenocarcinomas.","Clin Epigenetics","Targeting the epigenome of cancerous diseases represents an innovative approach, and the DNA methylation inhibitor decitabine is recommended for the treatment of hematological malignancies. Although epigenetic alterations are also common to solid tumors, the therapeutic efficacy of decitabine in colorectal adenocarcinomas (COAD) is unfavorable. Current research focuses on an identification of combination therapies either with chemotherapeutics or checkpoint inhibitors in modulating the tumor microenvironment. Here we report a series of molecular investigations to evaluate potency of decitabine, the histone deacetylase inhibitor PBA and the cytidine deaminase (CDA) inhibitor tetrahydrouridine (THU) in patient derived functional and p53 null colon cancer cell lines (CCCL). We focused on the inhibition of cell proliferation, the recovery of tumor suppressors and programmed cell death, and established clinical relevance by evaluating drug responsive genes among 270 COAD patients. Furthermore, we evaluated treatment responses based on CpG island density.Decitabine caused marked repression of the DNMT1 protein. Conversely, PBA treatment of CCCL recovered acetylation of histone 3 lysine residues, and this enabled an open chromatin state. Unlike single decitabine treatment, the combined decitabine/PBA treatment caused > 95% inhibition of cell proliferation, prevented cell cycle progression especially in the S and G2-phase and induced programmed cell death. Decitabine and PBA differed in their ability to facilitate re-expression of genes localized on different chromosomes, and the combined decitabine/PBA treatment was most effective in the re-expression of 40 tumor suppressors and 13 genes typically silenced in cancer-associated genomic regions of COAD patients. Furthermore, this treatment repressed expression of 11 survival (anti-apoptotic) genes and augmented expression of X-chromosome inactivated genes, especially the lncRNA Xist to facilitate p53-mediated apoptosis. Pharmacological inhibition of CDA by THU or its gene knockdown prevented decitabine inactivation. Strikingly, PBA treatment recovered the expression of the decitabine drug-uptake transporter SLC15A1, thus enabling high tumor drug-loads. Finally, for 26 drug responsive genes we demonstrated improved survival in COAD patients.The combined decitabine/PBA/THU drug treatment improved drug potency considerably, and given their existing regulatory approval, our findings merit prospective clinical trials for the triple combination in COAD patients.© 2023.

"37207494","Dissecting the features of TGA gene family in Saccharum and the functions of ScTGA1 under biotic stresses.","Plant Physiol Biochem","Sugarcane is an important sugar and energy crop and smut disease caused by Sporisorium scitamineum is a major fungal disease which can seriously reduce the yield and quality of sugarcane. In plants, TGACG motif binding (TGA) transcription factors are involved in the regulation of salicylic acid (SA) and methyl jasmonate (MeJA) signaling pathways, as well as in response to various biotic and abiotic stresses. However, no TGA-related transcription factor has been reported in Saccharum. In the present study, 44 SsTGA genes were identified from Saccharum spontaneum, and were assorted into three clades (I, II, III). Cis-regulatory elements (CREs) analysis revealed that SsTGA genes may be involved in hormone and stress response. RNA-seq data and RT-qPCR analysis indicated that SsTGAs were constitutively expressed in different tissues and induced by S. scitamineum stress. In addition, a ScTGA1 gene (GenBank accession number ON416997) was cloned from the sugarcane cultivar ROC22, which was homologous to SsTGA1e in S. spontaneum and encoded a nucleus protein. It was constitutively expressed in sugarcane tissues and up-regulated by SA, MeJA and S. scitamineum stresses. Furthermore, transient overexpression of ScTGA1 in Nicotiana benthamiana could enhance its resistance to the infection of Ralstonia solanacearum and Fusarium solani var. coeruleum, by regulating the expression of immune genes related to hypersensitive response (HR), ethylene (ET), SA and jasmonic acid (JA) pathways. This study should contribute to our understanding on the evolution and function of the SsTGA gene family in Saccharum, and provide a basis for the functional identification of ScTGA1 under biotic stresses.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS.

"37207321","Association of DNA methylation signatures with premature ageing and cardiovascular death in patients with end-stage kidney disease: a pilot epigenome-wide association study.","Epigenetics","Patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) display features of premature aging. There is strong evidence that changes in DNA methylation (DNAm) contribute to age-related pathologies; however, little is known about their association with premature aging and cardiovascular mortality in patients with ESKD. We assayed genome-wide DNAm in a pilot case-control study of 60 hemodialysis patients with (n=30, cases) and without (n=30, controls) a fatal cardiovascular event. DNAm was profiled on the Illumina EPIC BeadChip. Four established DNAm clocks (i.e., Horvath-, Hannum-, Pheno-, and GrimAge) were used to estimate epigenetic age (DNAmAge). Epigenetic age acceleration (EAA) was derived as the residuals of regressing DNAmAge on chronological age (chroAge), and its association with cardiovascular death was examined using multivariable conditional logistic regression. An epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) was performed to identify differentially methylated CpGs associated with cardiovascular death. All clocks performed well at predicting chroAge (correlation between DNAmAges and chroAge of r=0.76-0.89), with GrimAge showing the largest deviation from chroAge (a mean of +21.3 years). There was no significant association of EAAs with cardiovascular death. In the EWAS, a CpG (cg22305782) in theFBXL19gene had the strongest association with cardiovascular death with significantly lower DNAm in cases vs. controls (PFDR=2.0x10-6).FBXL19is involved in cell apoptosis, inflammation, and adipogenesis. Overall, we observed more accelerated aging in patients with ESKD, although there was no significant association of EAAs with cardiovascular death. EWAS suggests a potential novel DNAm biomarker for premature cardiovascular mortality in ESKD."
"37205524","Combinatorial quantification of 5mC and 5hmC at individual CpG dyads and the transcriptome in single cells reveals modulators of DNA methylation maintenance fidelity.","bioRxiv","Transmission of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) from one cell generation to the next plays a key role in regulating cellular identity in mammalian development and diseases. While recent work has shown that the activity of DNMT1, the protein responsible for the stable inheritance of 5mC from mother to daughter cells, is imprecise; it remains unclear how the fidelity of DNMT1 is tuned in different genomic and cell state contexts. Here we describe Dyad-seq, a method that combines enzymatic detection of modified cytosines with nucleobase conversion techniques to quantify the genome-wide methylation status of cytosines at the resolution of individual CpG dinucleotides. We find that the fidelity of DNMT1-mediated maintenance methylation is directly related to the local density of DNA methylation, and for genomic regions that are lowly methylated, histone modifications can dramatically alter the maintenance methylation activity. Further, to gain deeper insights into the methylation and demethylation turnover dynamics, we extended Dyad-seq to quantify all combinations of 5mC and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) at individual CpG dyads to show that TET proteins preferentially hydroxymethylate only one of the two 5mC sites in a symmetrically methylated CpG dyad rather than sequentially convert both 5mC to 5hmC. To understand how cell state transitions impact DNMT1-mediated maintenance methylation, we scaled the method down and combined it with the measurement of mRNA to simultaneously quantify genome-wide methylation levels, maintenance methylation fidelity and the transcriptome from the same cell (scDyad&T-seq). Applying scDyad&T-seq to mouse embryonic stem cells transitioning from serum to 2i conditions, we observe dramatic and heterogenous demethylation and the emergence of transcriptionally distinct subpopulations that are closely linked to the cell-to-cell variability in loss of DNMT1-mediated maintenance methylation activity, with regions of the genome that escape 5mC reprogramming retaining high levels of maintenance methylation fidelity. Overall, our results demonstrate that while distinct cell states can substantially impact the genome-wide activity of the DNA methylation maintenance machinery, locally there exists an intrinsic relationship between DNA methylation density, histone modifications and DNMT1-mediated maintenance methylation fidelity that is independent of cell state."

We systematically identified potentially modifiable targets of obesity at the onset and end of puberty in Hong Kong, the most economically developed major Chinese city.We conducted an environment-wide association study (EWAS) and an epigenome-wide association study of obesity to systematically assess associations with body mass index (BMI) and waist-hip ratio (WHR) in Hong Kong's population-representative 'Children of 1997' birth cohort. Univariable linear regression was used to select exposures related to obesity at ~11.5 years (BMI and obesity riskn≤ 7119, WHRn= 5691) and ~17.6 years (n= 3618) at Bonferroni-corrected significance, and multivariable regression to adjust for potential confounders followed by replicated multivariable regression (n= 308) and CpG by CpG analysis (n= 286) at ~23 years. Findings were compared with evidence from published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and Mendelian randomization (MR) studies.At ~11.5 and~17.6 years the EWAS identified 14 and 37 exposures associated with BMI, as well as 7 and 12 associated with WHR, respectively. Most exposures had directionally consistent associations at ~23 years. Maternal second-hand smoking, maternal weight, and birth weight were consistently associated with obesity. Diet (including dairy intake and artificially sweetened beverages), physical activity, snoring, binge eating, and earlier puberty were positively associated with BMI at ~17.6 years, while eating before sleep was inversely associated with BMI at ~17.6 years. Findings for birth weight, dairy intake, and binge eating are consistent with available evidence from RCTs or MR studies. We found 17 CpGs related to BMI and 17 to WHR.These novel insights into potentially modifiable factors associated with obesity at the outset and the end of puberty could, if causal, inform future interventions to improve population health in Hong Kong and similar Chinese settings.This study including the follow-up survey and epigenetics testing was supported by the Health and Medical Research Fund Research Fellowship, Food and Health Bureau, Hong Kong SAR Government (#04180097).

Japanese EACs frequently have underlying short length BE: short-segment BE (SSBE), for which, neoplastic potential remains unclear. We performed comprehensive methylation profiling of EAC and BE in Japanese patients, mostly comprised with SSBE. Using three different groups of biopsies obtained from non-neoplastic BE from patients without cancer (n = 50; N group), with EAC (n = 27; ADJ group) and EAC (n = 22; T group), methylation statuses of nine candidate genes (N33, DPYS, SLC16A12, CDH13, IGF2, MLF1, MYOD1, PRDM5, and P2RX7) were examined by the bisulfite pyrosequencing. Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing was performed to characterize the genome-wide methylation status in 32 samples (12 from N, 12 ADJ, and 8 from T groups). In the candidate approach, methylation levels of N33, DPYS, and SLC16A12 were higher in ADJ and T groups compared to that in N group. The ADJ group was an independent factor for higher DNA methylation in non-neoplastic BE. The genome-wide approach demonstrated an increase of hypermethylation from ADJ to T groups relative to N group near the transcription start sites. Among gene groups hypermethylated in ADJ and T groups (n = 645) and T group alone (n = 1438), 1/4 and 1/3 were overlapped with downregulated genes in the microarray data set, respectively. Accelerated DNA methylation is observed in EAC and underlying BE in Japanese patients, mostly comprised with SSBE, highlighting the potential impact of methylation in early carcinogenesis.© 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC."
"37202507","Investigating causality in the association between DNA methylation and type 2 diabetes using bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomisation.","Diabetologia","Several studies have identified associations between type 2 diabetes and DNA methylation (DNAm). However, the causal role of these associations remains unclear. This study aimed to provide evidence for a causal relationship between DNAm and type 2 diabetes.We used bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomisation (2SMR) to evaluate causality at 58 CpG sites previously detected in a meta-analysis of epigenome-wide association studies (meta-EWAS) of prevalent type 2 diabetes in European populations. We retrieved genetic proxies for type 2 diabetes and DNAm from the largest genome-wide association study (GWAS) available. We also used data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC, UK) when associations of interest were not available in the larger datasets. We identified 62 independent SNPs as proxies for type 2 diabetes, and 39 methylation quantitative trait loci as proxies for 30 of the 58 type 2 diabetes-related CpGs. We applied the Bonferroni correction for multiple testing and inferred causality based on p<0.001 for the type 2 diabetes to DNAm direction and p<0.002 for the opposing DNAm to type 2 diabetes direction in the 2SMR analysis.We found strong evidence of a causal effect of DNAm at cg25536676 (DHCR24) on type 2 diabetes. An increase in transformed residuals of DNAm at this site was associated with a 43% (OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.15, 1.78, p=0.001) higher risk of type 2 diabetes. We inferred a likely causal direction for the remaining CpG sites assessed. In silico analyses showed that the CpGs analysed were enriched for expression quantitative trait methylation sites (eQTMs) and for specific traits, dependent on the direction of causality predicted by the 2SMR analysis.We identified one CpG mapping to a gene related to the metabolism of lipids (DHCR24) as a novel causal biomarker for risk of type 2 diabetes. CpGs within the same gene region have previously been associated with type 2 diabetes-related traits in observational studies (BMI, waist circumference, HDL-cholesterol, insulin) and in Mendelian randomisation analyses (LDL-cholesterol). Thus, we hypothesise that our candidate CpG in DHCR24 may be a causal mediator of the association between known modifiable risk factors and type 2 diabetes. Formal causal mediation analysis should be implemented to further validate this assumption.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Although the prevalence of obesity is increasing markedly in this age group, information is sparse about the particular impacts of obesity on ageing skeletal muscle or the molecular mechanisms that underlie this and associated disease risk.Here, we examined genome-wide transcriptional changes using RNA sequencing in muscle biopsies from 40 older community-dwelling men from the Hertfordshire Sarcopenia Study with regard to obesity (body mass index [BMI] >30 kg/m2, n = 7), overweight (BMI 25-30, n = 19), normal weight (BMI < 25, n = 14), and per cent and total fat mass. In addition, we used EPIC DNA methylation array data to investigate correlations between DNA methylation and gene expression in aged skeletal muscle tissue and investigated the relationship between genes within altered regulatory pathways and muscle histological parameters.Individuals with obesity demonstrated a prominent modified transcriptional signature in muscle tissue, with a total of 542 differentially expressed genes associated with obesity (false discovery rate ≤0.05), of which 425 genes were upregulated when compared with normal weight. Upregulated genes were enriched in immune response (P = 3.18 × 10-41) and inflammation (leucocyte activation, P = 1.47 × 10-41; tumour necrosis factor, P = 2.75 × 10-15) signalling pathways and downregulated genes enriched in longevity (P = 1.5 × 10-3) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) (P = 4.5 × 10-3) signalling pathways. Furthermore, differentially expressed genes in both longevity and AMPK signalling pathways were associated with a change in DNA methylation, with a total of 256 and 360 significant cytosine-phosphate-guanine-gene correlations identified, respectively. Similar changes in the muscle transcriptome were observed with respect to per cent fat mass and total fat mass. Obesity was further associated with a significant increase in type II fast-fibre area (P = 0.026), of which key regulatory genes within both longevity and AMPK pathways were significantly associated.We provide for the first time a global transcriptomic profile of skeletal muscle in older people with and without obesity, demonstrating modulation of key genes and pathways implicated in the regulation of muscle function, changes in DNA methylation associated with such pathways and associations between genes within the modified pathways implicated in muscle regulation and changes in muscle fibre type.© 2023 The Authors.

"37196182","A novel principal component based method for identifying differentially methylated regions in Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip data.","Epigenetics","Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) are genomic regions with methylation patterns across multiple CpG sites that are associated with a phenotype. In this study, we proposed a Principal Component (PC) based DMR analysis method for use with data generated using the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip (EPIC) array. We obtained methylation residuals by regressing the M-values of CpGs within a region on covariates, extracted PCs of the residuals, and then combined association information across PCs to obtain regional significance. Simulation-based genome-wide false positive (GFP) rates and true positive rates were estimated under a variety of conditions before determining the final version of our method, which we have named DMRPC. Then, DMRPCand another DMR method, coMethDMR, were used to perform epigenome-wide analyses of several phenotypes known to have multiple associated methylation loci (age, sex, and smoking) in a discovery and a replication cohort. Among regions that were analysed by both methods, DMRPCidentified 50% more genome-wide significant age-associated DMRs than coMethDMR. The replication rate for the loci that were identified by only DMRPCwas higher than the rate for those that were identified by only coMethDMR (90% for DMRPC vs. 76% for coMethDMR). Furthermore, DMRPCidentified replicable associations in regions of moderate between-CpG correlation which are typically not analysed by coMethDMR. For the analyses of sex and smoking, the advantage of DMRPCwas less clear. In conclusion, DMRPCis a new powerful DMR discovery tool that retains power in genomic regions with moderate correlation across CpGs."
"37193737","DNA methylation variations and epigenetic aging in telomere biology disorders.","Sci Rep","Telomere Biology Disorders (TBDs) are characterized by mutations in telomere-related genes leading to short telomeres and premature aging but with no strict correlation between telomere length and disease severity. Epigenetic alterations are also markers of aging and we aimed to evaluate whether DNA methylation (DNAm) could be part of the pathogenesis of TBDs. In blood from 35 TBD cases, genome-wide DNAm were analyzed and the cases were grouped based on relative telomere length (RTL): short (S), with RTL close to normal controls, and extremely short (ES). TBD cases had increased epigenetic age and DNAm alterations were most prominent in the ES-RTL group. Thus, the differentially methylated (DM) CpG sites could be markers of short telomeres but could also be one of the mechanisms contributing to disease phenotype since DNAm alterations were observed in symptomatic, but not asymptomatic, cases with S-RTL. Furthermore, two or more DM-CpGs were identified in four genes previously linked to TBD or telomere length (PRDM8, SMC4, VARS, and WNT6) and in three genes that were novel in telomere biology (MAS1L, NAV2, and TM4FS1). The DM-CpGs in these genes could be markers of aging in hematological cells, but they could also be of relevance for the progression of TBD.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Factors such as nutrition or the intrauterine environment may play an important role, through epigenetic mechanisms, in the development of GDM. The aim of this work is to identify epigenetic marks involved in the mechanisms or pathways related to gestational diabetes. A total of 32 pregnant women were selected, 16 of them with GDM and 16 non-GDM. DNA methylation pattern was obtained from Illumina Methylation Epic BeadChip, from peripheral blood samples at the diagnostic visit (26-28 weeks). Differential methylated positions (DMPs) were extracted using ChAMP and limma package in R 2.9.10, with a threshold of FDR <0.05, deltabeta >|5|% and B >0. A total of 1.141 DMPs were found, and 714 were annotated in genes. A functional analysis was performed, and we found 23 genes significantly related to carbohydrate metabolism. Finally, a total of 27 DMPs were correlated with biochemical variables such as glucose levels at different points of oral glucose tolerance test, fasting glucose, cholesterol, HOMAIR and HbA1c, at different visits during pregnancy and postpartum. Our results show that there is a differentiated methylation pattern between GDM and non-GDM. Furthermore, the genes annotated to the DMPs could be implicated in the development of GDM as well as in alterations in related metabolic variables."

Driven by the enhanced implementation of molecular characterization, some diagnoses were adapted while others were newly introduced. How these changes are reflected in imaging features remains scarcely investigated.We retrospectively analyzed 226 treatment-naive primary brain tumor patients from our institution who received extensive molecular characterization by epigenome-wide methylation microarray and were diagnosed according to the 2021 WHO brain tumor classification. From multimodal preoperative 3T MRI scans, we extracted imaging metrics via a fully automated, AI-based image segmentation and processing pipeline. Subsequently, we examined differences in imaging features between the three main glioma entities (glioblastoma, astrocytoma, and oligodendroglioma) and particularly investigated new entities such as astrocytoma, WHO grade 4.Our results confirm prior studies that found significantly higher median CBV (p= 0.00003, ANOVA) and lower median ADC in contrast-enhancing areas of glioblastomas, compared to astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas (p= 0.41333, ANOVA). Interestingly, molecularly defined glioblastoma, which usually does not contain contrast-enhancing areas, also shows significantly higher CBV values in the non-enhancing tumor than common glioblastoma and astrocytoma grade 4 (p= 0.01309, ANOVA).This work provides extensive insights into the imaging features of gliomas in light of the new 2021 WHO CNS tumor classification. Advanced imaging shows promise in visualizing tumor biology and improving the diagnosis of brain tumor patients."

The parent-of-origin-effect (POE)-regulated methylome includes regions enriched for genetically controlled imprinting effects (the typical type of POE) and regions influenced by environmental effects associated with parents (the atypical POE). This part of the methylome is heavily influenced by early events, making it a potential route connecting early exposures, the epigenome, and aging. We aim to test the association of POE-CpGs with early and later exposures and subsequently with health-related phenotypes and adult aging.We perform a phenome-wide association analysis for the POE-influenced methylome using GS:SFHS (Ndiscovery = 5087, Nreplication = 4450). We identify and replicate 92 POE-CpG-phenotype associations. Most of the associations are contributed by the POE-CpGs belonging to the atypical class where the most strongly enriched associations are with aging (DNAmTL acceleration), intelligence, and parental (maternal) smoking exposure phenotypes. A proportion of the atypical POE-CpGs form co-methylation networks (modules) which are associated with these phenotypes, with one of the aging-associated modules displaying increased within-module methylation connectivity with age. The atypical POE-CpGs also display high levels of methylation heterogeneity, fast information loss with age, and a strong correlation with CpGs contained within epigenetic clocks.These results identify the association between the atypical POE-influenced methylome and aging and provide new evidence for the ""early development of origin"" hypothesis for aging in humans.© 2023.

Here, we combine epigenome-wide association and integrative genomics to investigate the impact of adipocyte DNA methylation variations in human obesity. We discover extensive DNA methylation changes that are robustly associated with obesity (N = 190 samples, 691 loci in subcutaneous and 173 loci in visceral adipocytes, P < 1 × 10-7). We connect obesity-associated methylation variations to transcriptomic changes at >500 target genes, and identify putative methylation-transcription factor interactions. Through Mendelian Randomisation, we infer causal effects of methylation on obesity and obesity-induced metabolic disturbances at 59 independent loci. Targeted methylation sequencing, CRISPR-activation and gene silencing in adipocytes, further identifies regional methylation variations, underlying regulatory elements and novel cellular metabolic effects. Our results indicate DNA methylation is an important determinant of human obesity and its metabolic complications, and reveal mechanisms through which altered methylation may impact adipocyte functions.© 2023.

Using a prospective cohort from the Hong Kong Diabetes Register, we perform two independent epigenome-wide association studies to identify methylation markers associated with baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and subsequent decline in kidney function (eGFR slope), respectively, in 1,271 type 2 diabetes subjects. Here we show 40 (30 previously unidentified) and eight (all previously unidentified) CpG sites individually reach epigenome-wide significance for baseline eGFR and eGFR slope, respectively. We also develop a multisite analysis method, which selects 64 and 37 CpG sites for baseline eGFR and eGFR slope, respectively. These models are validated in an independent cohort of Native Americans with type 2 diabetes. Our identified CpG sites are near genes enriched for functional roles in kidney diseases, and some show association with renal damage.

DNA methylation profiling has identified crucial aberrant methylation changes associated with diseases, thus providing biological insights into the roles of epigenetic factors in mycobacterial infection. Here, we performed a genome-wide methylation analysis of skin biopsies from patients with leprosy and healthy controls. The Th17 differentiation pathway was found to be significantly associated with leprosy through functional enrichment analysis. As a key gene in this pathway, IL23R was found to be critical to mycobacterial immunity in leprosy, according to integrated analysis with DNA methylation, RNA sequencing and genome-wide association studies. Functional analysis revealed IL-23/IL23R enhanced bacterial clearance by activating caspase-1/GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis in a manner dependent on NLRP3 through STAT3 signaling in macrophages. Moreover, IL23/IL23R promoted Th1 and Th17 cell differentiation and proinflammatory cytokine secretion, thereby increasing host bactericidal activity. IL23R knockout attenuated the aforementioned effects and increased susceptibility to mycobacterial infection. These findings illustrate biological functions of IL-23/IL23R in modulating intracellular bacterial clearance in macrophages and further support their regulatory effects in Th cell differentiation. Our study highlights IL-23/IL23R might serve as potential targets for the prevention and treatment of leprosy and other mycobacterial infections.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

It has a wide range of adaptations for growing on marginal lands under biotic and abiotic stresses. The immature inflorescence is an explant with high embryogenic competence and is frequently used to regenerate different sorghum cultivars. Caffeic acid O-methyl transferase (COMT) is a key enzyme in the lignin biosynthesis pathway, which limits ruminant digestion of forage cell walls and is a crucial barrier in the conversion of plant biomass to bioethanol. Genome editing by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutagenesis without a transgenic footprint will accelerate the improvement and facilitate regulatory approval and commercialization of biotech crops.We report the overcome of the recalcitrance in sudangrass transformation and regeneration in order to use genome editing technique. Hence, an efficient regeneration system has been established to induce somatic embryogenesis from the immature inflorescence of two sudangrass cultivars on four MS-based media supplemented with different components. Our results indicate an interaction between genotype and medium composition. The combination of Giza-1 cultivar and M4 medium produces the maximum frequency of embryogenic calli of 80% and subsequent regeneration efficiency of 22.6%. Precise mutagenesis of the COMT gene is executed using the CRISPR/Cas9 system with the potential to reduce lignin content and enhance forage and biomass quality in sudangrass.A reliable regeneration and transformation system has been established for sudangrass using immature inflorescence, and the CRISPR/Cas9 system has demonstrated a promising technology for genome editing.

Alterations in DNA methylations due to exposure towards environmental risk factors are widely sought markers for T2DM risk prediction. To identify such individual DNA methylation signatures and their effect on disease risk, we performed an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) in 844 Indian individuals of Indo-European origin. We identified and validated methylation alterations at 2 novel CpG sites in MIR1287 (cg01178710), and EDN2-SCMH1 (cg04673737) genes associated with T2DM risk at the epigenome-wide-significance-level (p < 1.2x10-7). Further, we also replicated the association of 2 known CpG sites in TXNIP, and CPT1A in the Indian population. With 535 EWAS significant CpGs (p < 1.2x10-7) identified in the discovery phase samples, we created a co-methylation network using weighted correlation network analysis and identified 4 modules among the CpGs. We observed that methylation of one of the module associates with T2DM risk factors (e.g. BMI, insulin, C-peptide) and can be used as markers to segregate T2DM patients with good glycemic control (e.g. low HbA1c) and dyslipidemia (low HDL and high TG) from the other patients. Additionally, an intronic SNP (rs6503650) in the JUP gene, a member of the same module, associated with methylation at all the 14 hub CpG sites of that module as methQTL. Our network-assisted epigenome-wide association study is the first to systematically explore DNA methylation variations conferring risks to T2DM in Indians and use the identified risk CpG sites for patient segregation with different clinical outcomes. These findings can be useful for better stratification of patients to improve the clinical management and treatment effects.© The Author(s) 2023. Published by Oxford University Press.

Replication was conducted among independent African American samples without HIV.DNA methylation sites cg17944885 near Zinc Finger Family Member 788 (ZNF788) and Zinc Finger Protein 20 (ZNF20), and cg06930757 inSHANK1were significantly associated with eGFR among PWH of African ancestry (false discovery rate < 0.05). DNA methylation site cg17944885 was also associated with eGFR among different populations including African Americans without HIV.Our study attempted to address an important gap in the literature and to understand the role of DNA methylation in renal diseases in PWH of African ancestry. Replication of cg17944885 among different populations suggests there may be a common pathway for renal diseases progression among PWH and people without HIV, and across different ancestral groups.

Decreased intestinal flora diversity and disruption of homeostasis have been proven to be associated with pathogenesis of SLE. In previous study, a clinical trial was conducted to verify the safety and effectiveness of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in the treatment of SLE. To explore the mechanism of FMT in the treatment of SLE, we included 14 SLE patients participating in clinical trials, including 8 in responders group (Rs) and 6 in non-responders group (NRs), and collected peripheral blood DNA and serum. We found that the serum of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), methylation group donor, was upregulated after FMT, accompanied by an increase in genome-wide DNA methylation level in Rs. We further showed that the methylation levels in promoter regions of Interferon-γ (IFN-γ), induced Helicase C Domain Containing Protein 1 (IFIH1), endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein complex 8 (EMC8), and Tripartite motif-containing protein 58 (TRIM58) increased after FMT treatment. On the contrary, there was no significant change in the methylation of IFIH1 promoter region in the NRs after FMT, and the methylation level of IFIH1 in the Rs was significantly higher than that in the NRs at week 0. We included 850 K methylation chip sequencing, combining previous data of metagenomic sequencing, and metabolomic sequencing for multi-omics analysis to discuss the relationship between flora-metabolite-methylation in FMT. Finally, we found that hexanoic acid treatment can up-regulate the global methylation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in SLE patients. Overall, our results delineate changes in methylation level after FMT treatment of SLE and reveal possible mechanisms of FMT treatment in terms of the recovery of abnormal hypomethylation.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

The prevalence of the Skeletal Class III disease is the lowest among all angle malocclusions, with varied prevalence across nations. Environmental, genetic, and societal factors play a role in its numerous etiologies. In this study, we conducted a thorough search across the published data relating to quantitative trait loci (QTL) and the genes associated with Class III progression in humans, discussed these findings and their limitations, and proposed future directions and strategies for studying this phenotype.An inclusive search of published papers in the PubMed and Google Scholar search engines using the following terms: 1.

We also characterized the number of members, genetic similarity, and phylogeny of HMT and HDM families in barley using the barley pangenome and the Tibetan Lasa Goumang genome. The results showed that HMT and HDM were highly conserved in the domestication of barley, but there were some differences in the Lasa Goumang SDG subfamily. Expression analysis showed thatHvHMTsandHvHDMswere highly expressed in specific tissues and had complex expression patterns under multiple stress treatments. In summary, the amplification and variation of HMT and HDM facilitate plant adaptation to complex terrestrial environments, while they are highly conserved in barley and play an important role in barley growth and development with abiotic stresses. In brief, our findings provide a novel perspective on the origin and evolutionary history of plantHvHMTsandHvHDMs, and lay a foundation for further investigation of their functions in barley."
"37175434","Effect of Ethanol-Induced Methyl Donors Consumption on the State of Hypomethylation in Cervical Cancer.","Int J Mol Sci","Cervical cancer causes malignant tumors in females and threatens the physical and mental health of women. Current research shows that persistent infection of high-risk HPV is the main cause of cervical cancer. However, not all cervical cancer is caused by HPV infection, which may also be related to other factors, such as nutritional status and lifestyle. This study focuses on the effect of alcohol consumption on the methylation status of cervical cancer from the perspective of methyl donors. We established a mouse tumor-bearing model with cervical cancer SiHa cells, and at the same time, we cultured SiHa cells in vitro. Different concentrations of ethanol were administered to the model mice and SiHa cells. Then, we detected the levels of the methyl-donor folate and methionine and their metabolite homocysteine levels in mice serum, tumor tissues, and SiHa cells. Furthermore, we determined the expression of the members of the DNA methyltransferase family (DNMT1, DNMT3a, and DNMT3b) in tumor tissue by immunohistochemistry. qRT-PCR and Western blotting analysis were used to detect the mRNA and protein levels of members of the DNA methyltransferase family in cervical cancer SiHa cells. Our results show that the levels of the methyl donor (folate and methionine) decreased with the increase of ethanol concentration (p< 0.05), and the homocysteine level increased significantly (p< 0.05). In SiHa cells, the mRNA and protein levels of the DNMT family members and their receptors were significantly higher than those in the control group (p< 0.05). Collectively, these results suggest that ethanol could influence DNMT expression by inducing methyl donor consumption, thereby causing cervical cancer cells to exhibit genome-wide hypomethylation."
"37173453","Relationship between gut microbiome Fusobacterium nucleatum and LINE-1 methylation level in esophageal cancer.","Esophagus","We previously demonstrated the relationship of human microbiome Fusobacterium nucleatum with unfavorable clinical outcomes and inferior chemotherapeutic responses in esophageal cancer. Global DNA methylation is associated with the occurrence and development of various cancers. In our previous study, LINE-1 hypomethylation (i.e., global DNA hypomethylation) was associated with a poor prognosis in esophageal cancer. As the gut microbiota may play crucial roles in the DNA methylation of host cells, we hypothesized that F. nucleatum might influence LINE-1 methylation levels in esophageal cancer.We qualified the F. nucleatum DNA using a quantitative PCR assay and LINE-1 methylation via a pyrosequencing assay using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens from 306 esophageal cancer patients.Intratumoral F. nucleatum DNA was detected in 65 cases (21.2%). The LINE-1 methylation scores ranged from 26.9 to 91.8 (median = 64.8) in tumors. F. nucleatum DNA was related to the LINE-1 hypomethylation of tumor lesions in esophageal cancer (P < 0.0001). The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that the area under the curve was 0.71 for F. nucleatum positivity. Finally, we found that the impact of F. nucleatum on clinical outcomes was not modified by LINE-1 hypomethylation (P for interaction = 0.34).F. nucleatum alters genome-wide methylation levels in cancer cells, which may be one of the mechanisms by which F. nucleatum affects the malignant behavior of esophageal cancer.© 2023.

"37170220","Oxidative stress gene expression, DNA methylation, and gut microbiota interaction trigger Crohn's disease: a multi-omics Mendelian randomization study.","BMC Med","Oxidative stress (OS) is a key pathophysiological mechanism in Crohn's disease (CD). OS-related genes can be affected by environmental factors, intestinal inflammation, gut microbiota, and epigenetic changes. However, the role of OS as a potential CD etiological factor or triggering factor is unknown, as differentially expressed OS genes in CD can be either a cause or a subsequent change of intestinal inflammation. Herein, we used a multi-omics summary data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR) approach to identify putative causal effects and underlying mechanisms of OS genes in CD.OS-related genes were extracted from the GeneCards database. Intestinal transcriptome datasets were collected from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and meta-analyzed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to OS in CD. Integration analyses of the largest CD genome-wide association study (GWAS) summaries with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and DNA methylation QTLs (mQTLs) from the blood were performed using SMR methods to prioritize putative blood OS genes and their regulatory elements associated with CD risk. Up-to-date intestinal eQTLs and fecal microbial QTLs (mbQTLs) were integrated to uncover potential interactions between host OS gene expression and gut microbiota through SMR and colocalization analysis. Two additional Mendelian randomization (MR) methods were used as sensitivity analyses. Putative results were validated in an independent multi-omics cohort from the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University (FAH-SYS).A meta-analysis from six datasets identified 438 OS-related DEGs enriched in intestinal enterocytes in CD from 817 OS-related genes. Five genes from blood tissue were prioritized as candidate CD-causal genes using three-step SMR methods: BAD, SHC1, STAT3, MUC1, and GPX3. Furthermore, SMR analysis also identified five putative intestinal genes, three of which were involved in gene-microbiota interactions through colocalization analysis: MUC1, CD40, and PRKAB1. Validation results showed that 88.79% of DEGs were replicated in the FAH-SYS cohort. Associations between pairs of MUC1-Bacillus aciditolerans and PRKAB1-Escherichia coli in the FAH-SYS cohort were consistent with eQTL-mbQTL colocalization.This multi-omics integration study highlighted that OS genes causal to CD are regulated by DNA methylation and host-microbiota interactions. This provides evidence for future targeted functional research aimed at developing suitable therapeutic interventions and disease prevention.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37170172","Capturing sex-specific and hypofertility-linked effects of assisted reproductive technologies on the cord blood DNA methylome.","Clin Epigenetics","Children conceived through assisted reproduction are at an increased risk for growth and genomic imprinting disorders, often linked to DNA methylation defects. It has been suggested that assisted reproductive technology (ART) and underlying parental infertility can induce epigenetic instability, specifically interfering with DNA methylation reprogramming events during germ cell and preimplantation development. To date, human studies exploring the association between ART and DNA methylation defects have reported inconsistent or inconclusive results, likely due to population heterogeneity and the use of technologies with limited coverage of the epigenome. In our study, we explored the epigenetic risk of ART by comprehensively profiling the DNA methylome of 73 human cord blood samples of singleton pregnancies (n = 36 control group, n = 37 ART/hypofertile group) from a human prospective longitudinal birth cohort, the 3D (Design, Develop, Discover) Study, using a high-resolution sequencing-based custom capture panel that examines over 2.4 million autosomal CpGs in the genome.We identified evidence of sex-specific effects of ART/hypofertility on cord blood DNA methylation patterns. Our genome-wide analyses identified ~ 46% more CpGs affected by ART/hypofertility in female than in male infant cord blood. We performed a detailed analysis of three imprinted genes which have been associated with altered DNA methylation following ART (KCNQ1OT1, H19/IGF2 and GNAS) and found that female infant cord blood was associated with DNA hypomethylation. When compared to less invasive procedures such as intrauterine insemination, more invasive ARTs (in vitro fertilization, intracytoplasmic sperm injection, embryo culture) resulted in more marked and distinct effects on the cord blood DNA methylome. In the in vitro group, we found a close to fourfold higher proportion of significantly enriched Gene Ontology terms involved in development than in the in vivo group.Our study highlights the ability of a sensitive, targeted, sequencing-based approach to uncover DNA methylation perturbations in cord blood associated with hypofertility and ART and influenced by offspring sex and ART technique invasiveness.© 2023.

"37169753","meQTL mapping in the GENOA study reveals genetic determinants of DNA methylation in African Americans.","Nat Commun","Identifying genetic variants that are associated with variation in DNA methylation, an analysis commonly referred to as methylation quantitative trait locus (meQTL) mapping, is an important first step towards understanding the genetic architecture underlying epigenetic variation. Most existing meQTL mapping studies have focused on individuals of European ancestry and are underrepresented in other populations, with a particular absence of large studies in populations with African ancestry. We fill this critical knowledge gap by performing a large-scale cis-meQTL mapping study in 961 African Americans from the Genetic Epidemiology Network of Arteriopathy (GENOA) study. We identify a total of 4,565,687 cis-acting meQTLs in 320,965 meCpGs. We find that 45% of meCpGs harbor multiple independent meQTLs, suggesting potential polygenic genetic architecture underlying methylation variation. A large percentage of the cis-meQTLs also colocalize with cis-expression QTLs (eQTLs) in the same population. Importantly, the identified cis-meQTLs explain a substantial proportion (median = 24.6%) of methylation variation. In addition, the cis-meQTL associated CpG sites mediate a substantial proportion (median = 24.9%) of SNP effects underlying gene expression. Overall, our results represent an important step toward revealing the co-regulation of methylation and gene expression, facilitating the functional interpretation of epigenetic and gene regulation underlying common diseases in African Americans.© 2023.

"37169241","Comparative analysis of epigenetic variability in two pine species exposed to chronic radiation in the chernobyl and fukushima affected zones.","Environ Pollut","Comparative analysis of epigenetic variability in two pine species affected as a result of the Chernobyl and Fukushima accidents is presented. The absorbed dose rate within the affected Chernobyl sites varies over a wider range (1.5-24.6 μGy/h) than within the Fukushima sites (3.5-6.5 μGy/h). It was shown that chronic irradiation can change the level of whole genome methylation in pine populations, but in different ways. The genomes of Japanese red pines are hypomethylated, and the degree of methylation and hydroxymethylation decreases with an increase in the level of radiation exposure. In contrast, the percentages of genome methylation and hydroxymethylation in Scots pine populations exceed the reference levels. The observed discrepancy in the patterns of genome-wide DNA methylation can be attributed partly to the design of the study (differences in the climate, radiation dose, age and species of the pines) which could affect the results. In the frame of IRAP analysis, a larger number of different bands was observed in the Chernobyl populations compared to the Japanese populations. Both the Japanese and Chernobyl populations are characterized by significant genetic variability. However, the main part of this variability is observed within populations. The dendrograms, based on presence/absence of IRAP fragments and Nei's genetic distances, revealed subdivisions of the Chernobyl and Japanese populations according to the level of radioactive contamination. Analysis of the results presented will improve our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the responses of pine trees to chronic radiation exposure.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

"37166351","Epigenotype-genotype-phenotype correlations in SETD1A and SETD2 chromatin disorders.","Hum Mol Genet","Germline pathogenic variants in two genes encoding the lysine-specific histone methyltransferase genes SETD1A and SETD2 are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) characterised by developmental delay and congenital anomalies. The SETD1A and SETD2 gene products play a critical role in chromatin-mediated regulation of gene expression. Specific methylation episignatures have been detected for a range of chromatin gene-related NDDs and have impacted clinical practice by improving interpretation of variant pathogenicity. To investigate if SETD1A and/or SETD2-related NDDs are associated with a detectable episignature, we undertook targeted genome-wide methylation profiling of > 2 M CpGs using a next generation sequencing based assay. Comparison of methylation profiles in patients with SETD1A variants (n = 6) did not reveal evidence of a strong methylation episignature. Review of the clinical and genetic features of SETD2 patient group revealed that, as reported previously, there were phenotypic differences between patients with truncating mutations (n = 4, Luscan-Lumish syndrome; MIM:616831) and those with missense codon 1740 variants (p.Arg1740Trp (n = 4) and p.Arg1740Gln (n = 2)). Both SETD2 subgroups demonstrated a methylation episignature which was characterised by hypomethylation and hypermethylation events respectively. Within the codon 1740 subgroup, both the methylation changes and clinical phenotype were more severe in those with p.Arg1740Trp variants. We also noted that two of 10 cases with a SETD2-NDD had developed a neoplasm. These findings reveal novel epigenotype-genotype-phenotype correlations in SETD2-NDDs and predict a gain-of-function mechanism for SETD2 codon 1740 pathogenic variants.© The Author(s) 2023.

Making the correct tumor diagnosis in the pontine location is thus critical. Here, we report a case study of a 14-month-old patient initially diagnosed as histone H3 wild-type DIPG. Due to the low age of the patient, the MRI appearance of DIPG, and anaplastic astrocytoma histology, intensive chemotherapy based on the HIT-SKK protocol with vinblastine maintenance chemotherapy was administered. Rapid clinical improvement and radiological regression of the tumor were observed with nearly complete remission with durable effect and excellent clinical condition more than 6.5 years after diagnosis. Based on this unexpected therapeutic outcome, genome-wide DNA methylation array was employed and the sample was classified into the methylation class ""Low-grade glioma, MYB(L1) altered."" Additionally, RT-PCR revealed the presence of MYB::QKI fusion. Taken together, the histopathological classification, molecular-genetic and epigenetic features, clinical behavior, and pontine location have led us to reclassify the tumor as a pontine MYB-altered glioma. Our case demonstrates that more intensive chemotherapy can achieve long-term clinical effect in the treatment of MYB-altered pontine gliomas compared to previously used LGG-based regimens or radiotherapy. It also emphasizes the importance of a biopsy and a thorough molecular investigation of pontine lesions.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37158941","Hybrid allele-specific ChIP-seq analysis identifies variation in brassinosteroid-responsive transcription factor binding linked to traits in maize.","Genome Biol","Genetic variation in regulatory sequences that alter transcription factor (TF) binding is a major cause of phenotypic diversity. Brassinosteroid is a growth hormone that has major effects on plant phenotypes. Genetic variation in brassinosteroid-responsive cis-elements likely contributes to trait variation. Pinpointing such regulatory variations and quantitative genomic analysis of the variation in TF-target binding, however, remains challenging. How variation in transcriptional targets of signaling pathways such as the brassinosteroid pathway contributes to phenotypic variation is an important question to be investigated with innovative approaches.Here, we use a hybrid allele-specific chromatin binding sequencing (HASCh-seq) approach and identify variations in target binding of the brassinosteroid-responsive TF ZmBZR1 in maize. HASCh-seq in the B73xMo17 F1s identifies thousands of target genes of ZmBZR1. Allele-specific ZmBZR1 binding (ASB) has been observed for 18.3% of target genes and is enriched in promoter and enhancer regions. About a quarter of the ASB sites correlate with sequence variation in BZR1-binding motifs and another quarter correlate with haplotype-specific DNA methylation, suggesting that both genetic and epigenetic variations contribute to the high level of variation in ZmBZR1 occupancy. Comparison with GWAS data shows linkage of hundreds of ASB loci to important yield and disease-related traits.Our study provides a robust method for analyzing genome-wide variations of TF occupancy and identifies genetic and epigenetic variations of the brassinosteroid response transcription network in maize.© 2023.

"37158274","Crucial role of iron in epigenetic rewriting during adipocyte differentiation mediated by JMJD1A and TET2 activity.","Nucleic Acids Res","Iron metabolism is closely associated with the pathogenesis of obesity. However, the mechanism of the iron-dependent regulation of adipocyte differentiation remains unclear. Here, we show that iron is essential for rewriting of epigenetic marks during adipocyte differentiation. Iron supply through lysosome-mediated ferritinophagy was found to be crucial during the early stage of adipocyte differentiation, and iron deficiency during this period suppressed subsequent terminal differentiation. This was associated with demethylation of both repressive histone marks and DNA in the genomic regions of adipocyte differentiation-associated genes, 　including Pparg, which encodes PPARγ, the master regulator of adipocyte differentiation. In addition, we identified several epigenetic demethylases to be responsible for iron-dependent adipocyte differentiation, with the histone demethylase jumonji domain-containing 1A and the DNA demethylase ten-eleven translocation 2 as the major enzymes. The interrelationship between repressive histone marks and DNA methylation was indicated by an integrated genome-wide association analysis, and was also supported by the findings that both histone and DNA demethylation were suppressed by either the inhibition of lysosomal ferritin flux or the knockdown of iron chaperone poly(rC)-binding protein 2. In summary, epigenetic regulations through iron-dependent control of epigenetic enzyme activities play an important role in the organized gene expression mechanisms of adipogenesis.© The Author(s) 2023.

"37156847","The value of EYA1/3/4 in clear cell renal cell carcinoma: a study from multiple databases.","Sci Rep","There is evidence from multiple studies that dysregulation of the Eyes Absent (EYA) protein plays multiple roles in many cancers. Despite this, little is known about the prognostic significance of the EYAs family in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). We systematically analyzed the value of EYAs in Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma. Our analysis included examining transcriptional levels, mutations, methylated modifications, co-expression, protein-protein interactions (PPIs), immune infiltration, single-cell sequencing, drug sensitivity, and prognostic values. We based our analysis on data from several databases, including the Cancer Genome Atlas database (TCGA), the Gene Expression Omnibus database (GEO), UALCAN, TIMER, Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA), STRING, cBioPortal and GSCALite. In patients with ccRCC, the EYA1 gene was significantly highly expressed, while the expression of EYA2/3/4 genes showed the opposite trend. The level of expression of the EYA1/3/4 gene was significantly correlated with the prognosis and clinicopathological parameters of ccRCC patients. Univariate and multifactorial Cox regression analyses revealed EYA1/3 as an independent prognostic factor for ccRCC, establishing nomogram line plots with good predictive power. Meanwhile, the number of mutations in EYAs was also significantly correlated with poor overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) of patients with ccRCC. Mechanistically, EYAs genes play an essential role in a wide range of biological processes such as DNA metabolism and double-strand break repair in ccRCC. The majority of EYAs members were related to the infiltration of immune cells, drug sensitivity, and methylation levels. Furthermore, our experiment confirmed that EYA1 gene expression was upregulated, and EYA2/3/4 showed low expression in ccRCC. The increased expression of EYA1 might play an important role in ccRCC oncogenesis, and the decreased expression of EYA3/4 could function as a tumor suppressor, suggesting EYA1/3/4 might serve as valuable prognostic markers and potential new therapeutic targets for ccRCC.© 2023.

"37154074","Developmental stress does not induce genome-wide DNA methylation changes in wild great tit (Parus major) nestlings.","Mol Ecol","The environment experienced during early life is a crucial factor in the life of many organisms. This early life environment has been shown to have profound effects on morphology, physiology and fitness. However, the molecular mechanisms that mediate these effects are largely unknown, even though they are essential for our understanding of the processes that induce phenotypic variation in natural populations. DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism that has been suggested to explain such environmentally induced phenotypic changes early in life. To investigate whether DNA methylation changes are associated with experimentally induced early developmental effects, we cross-fostered great tit (Parus major) nestlings and manipulated their brood sizes in a natural study population. We assessed experimental brood size effects on pre-fledging biometry and behaviour. We linked this to genome-wide DNA methylation levels of CpG sites in erythrocyte DNA, using 122 individuals and an improved epiGBS2 laboratory protocol. Brood enlargement caused developmental stress and negatively affected nestling condition, predominantly during the second half of the breeding season, when conditions are harsher. Brood enlargement, however, affected nestling DNA methylation in only one CpG site and only if the hatch date was taken into account. In conclusion, this study shows that nutritional stress in enlarged broods does not associate with direct effects on genome-wide DNA methylation. Future studies should assess whether genome-wide DNA methylation variation may arise later in life as a consequence of phenotypic changes during early development.© 2023 The Authors.

"37153002","A systematic pan-cancer analysis reveals the clinical prognosis and immunotherapy value of C-X3-C motif ligand 1 (CX3CL1).","Front Genet","It is now widely known that C-X3-C motif ligand 1 (CX3CL1) plays an essential part in the process of regulating pro-inflammatory cells migration across a wide range of inflammatory disorders, including a number of malignancies. However, there has been no comprehensive study on the correlation between CX3CL1 and cancers on the basis of clinical features. In order to investigate the potential function of CX3CL1 in the clinical prognosis and immunotherapy, I evaluated the expression of CX3CL1 in numerous cancer types, methylation levels and genetic alterations. I found CX3CL1 was differentially expressed in numerous cancer types, which indicated CX3CL1 may plays a potential role in tumor progression. Furthermore, CX3CL1 was variably expressed in methylation levels and gene alterations in most cancers according to The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). CX3CL1 was robustly associated with clinical characteristics and pathological stages, suggesting that it was related to the degree of tumor malignancy and the physical function of patients. As determined by the Kaplan-Meier method of estimating survival, high CX3CL1 expression was associated with either favorable or unfavorable outcomes depending on the different types of cancer. It suggests the correlation between CX3CL1 and tumor prognosis. Significant positive correlations of CX3CL1 expression with CD4+T cells, M1 macrophage cells and activated mast cells have been established in the majority of TCGA malignancies. Which indicates CX3CL1 plays an important role in tumor immune microenvironment. Gene Ontology (GO) terms and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis suggested that the chemokine signaling pathway may shed light on the pathway for CX3CL1 to exert function. In a conclusion, our study comprehensively summarizes the potential role of CX3CL1 in clinical prognosis and immunotherapy, suggesting that CX3CL1 may represent a promising pharmacological treatment target of tumors.Copyright © 2023 Sun."

There is urgent need to develop useful therapies for this lethal disease.A genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screening, in combination with gene profiling of highly invasive and metastatic ESCC sublines, as well as PDX models, was performed to identify key regulators of cancer metastasis. The Gain- and loss-of-function experiments were taken to examine gene function. Protein interactome, RNA-seq, and whole genome methylation sequencing were used to investigate gene regulation and molecular mechanisms. Clinical significance was analyzed in tumor tissue microarray and TCGA databases. Homology modeling, modified ELISA, surface plasmon resonance and functional assays were performed to identify lead compound which targets MEST to suppress cancer metastasis.High MEST expression was associated with poor patient survival and promoted cancer invasion and metastasis in ESCC. Mechanistically, MEST activates SRCIN1/RASAL1-ERK-snail signaling by interacting with PURA. miR-449a was identified as a direct regulator of MEST, and hypermethylation of its promoter led to MEST upregulation, whereas systemically delivered miR-449a mimic could suppress tumor metastasis without overt toxicity. Furthermore, molecular docking and computational screening in a small-molecule library of 1,500,000 compounds and functional assays showed that G699-0288 targets the MEST-PURA interaction and significantly inhibits cancer metastasis.We identified the MEST-PURA-SRCIN1/RASAL1-ERK-snail signaling cascade as an important mechanism underlying cancer metastasis. Blockade of MEST-PURA interaction has therapeutic potential in management of cancer metastasis.This work was supported by National Key Research and Development Program of China (2021YFC2501000, 2021YFC2501900, 2017YFA0505100); National Natural Science Foundation of China (31961160727, 82073196, 81973339, 81803551); NSFC/RGC Joint Research Scheme (N_HKU727/19); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province (2021A1515011158, 2021A0505030035); Key Laboratory of Guangdong Higher Education Institutes of China (2021KSYS009).Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).

However, few molecular details for turion biology have been elucidated due to the difficulties in isolating high-quality nucleic acids from this tissue. We successfully developed a new protocol to isolate high-quality transcripts and carried out RNA-seq analysis of mature turions from the Greater Duckweed Spirodela polyrhiza. Comparison of turion transcriptomes to that of fronds, the actively growing leaf-like tissue, were carried out. Bioinformatic analysis of high confidence, differentially expressed transcripts between frond and mature turion tissues revealed major pathways related to stress tolerance, starch and lipid metabolism, and dormancy that are mobilized to reprogram frond meristems for turion differentiation. We identified the key genes that are likely to drive starch and lipid accumulation during turion formation, as well as those in pathways for starch and lipid utilization upon turion germination. Comparison of genome-wide cytosine methylation levels also revealed evidence for epigenetic changes in the formation of turion tissues. Similarities between turions and seeds provide evidence that key regulators for seed maturation and germination were retooled for their function in turion biology.© 2023 The Authors.

Among the major FTLD pathological subgroups, FTLD with TDP-43 positive inclusions (FTLD-TDP) and FTLD with tau-positive inclusions (FTLD-tau) are the most common, representing about 90% of the cases. Although alterations in DNA methylation have been consistently associated with neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, little is known for FTLD and its heterogeneous subgroups and subtypes. The main goal of this study was to investigate DNA methylation variation in FTLD-TDP and FTLD-tau. We used frontal cortex genome-wide DNA methylation profiles from three FTLD cohorts (142 FTLD cases and 92 controls), generated using the Illumina 450K or EPIC microarrays. We performed epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) for each cohort followed by meta-analysis to identify shared differentially methylated loci across FTLD subgroups/subtypes. In addition, we used weighted gene correlation network analysis to identify co-methylation signatures associated with FTLD and other disease-related traits. Wherever possible, we also incorporated relevant gene/protein expression data. After accounting for a conservative Bonferroni multiple testing correction, the EWAS meta-analysis revealed two differentially methylated loci in FTLD, one annotated to OTUD4 (5'UTR-shore) and the other to NFATC1 (gene body-island). Of these loci, OTUD4 showed consistent upregulation of mRNA and protein expression in FTLD. In addition, in the three independent co-methylation networks, OTUD4-containing modules were enriched for EWAS meta-analysis top loci and were strongly associated with the FTLD status. These co-methylation modules were enriched for genes implicated in the ubiquitin system, RNA/stress granule formation and glutamatergic synaptic signalling. Altogether, our findings identified novel FTLD-associated loci, and support a role for DNA methylation as a mechanism involved in the dysregulation of biological processes relevant to FTLD, highlighting novel potential avenues for therapeutic development.© 2023.

Four of these CpGs, located in proximity to CNFN/LIPE, TENT5A, PALD1/PRF1, and DIRAS1, represent novel findings. Integrating DNAm levels with RNA sequencing-based mRNA expression data generated in the same individuals showed significant DNAm-mRNA correlations for 6 of the 12 significant CpGs. Lastly, by calculating rates of epigenetic age acceleration using two recently proposed ""epigenetic clock"" estimators we found a significant association with accelerated epigenetic aging in the brains of AD patients vs. controls.In summary, our study represents the hitherto most comprehensive EWAS in AD using EC and highlights several novel differentially methylated loci with potential effects on gene expression.© 2023.

We hypothesize that accumulation of DNA methylation changes in CpG sites across genomic locations of different genes might have biological significance. We tested the hypothesis by performing gene set based integrative analysis of blood DNA methylation and transcriptomics data to identify potential transcriptomic consequences of smoking via changes in DNA methylation in the Young Finns Study (YFS) participants (n = 1114, aged 34-49 years, women: 54%, men: 46%). First, we performed epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of smoking. We then defined sets of genes based on DNA methylation status within their genomic regions, for example, sets of genes containing hyper- or hypomethylated CpG sites in their body or promoter regions. Gene set analysis was performed using transcriptomics data from the same participants. Two sets of genes, one containing 49 genes with hypomethylated CpG sites in their body region and the other containing 33 genes with hypomethylated CpG sites in their promoter region, were differentially expressed among the smokers. Genes in the two gene sets are involved in bone formation, metal ion transport, cell death, peptidyl-serine phosphorylation, and cerebral cortex development process, revealing epigenetic-transcriptomic pathways to smoking-related diseases such as osteoporosis, atherosclerosis, and cognitive impairment. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the pathophysiology of smoking-related diseases and may provide potential therapeutic targets."

The development of novel therapeutic targets or drugs for AML is urgently needed. Ferroptosis is a form of regulated cell death driven by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation. Recently, ferroptosis has emerged as a novel method for targeting cancer, including AML. Epigenetic dysregulation is a hallmark of AML, and a growing body of evidence suggests that ferroptosis is subject to epigenetic regulation. Here, we identified protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) as a ferroptosis regulator in AML. The type I PRMT inhibitor GSK3368715 promoted ferroptosis sensitivity in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, PRMT1-knockout cells exhibited significantly increased sensitivity to ferroptosis, suggesting that PRMT1 is the primary target of GSK3368715 in AML. Mechanistically, both GSK3368715 and PRMT1 knockout upregulated acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 1 (ACSL1), which acts as a ferroptosis promoter by increasing lipid peroxidation. Knockout ACSL1 reduced the ferroptosis sensitivity of AML cells following GSK3368715 treatment. Additionally, the GSK3368715 treatment reduced the abundance of H4R3me2a, the main histone methylation modification mediated by PRMT1, in both genome-wide and ACSL1 promoter regions. Overall, our results demonstrated a previously unknown role of the PRMT1/ACSL1 axis in ferroptosis and suggested the potential value and applications of the combination of PRMT1 inhibitor and ferroptosis inducers in AML treatment.© 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC."

Considering its environmental cause, we hypothesized that COPD will be associated with altered epigenetic signaling in lung cells. We generated genome-wide DNA methylation maps at single CpG resolution of primary human lung fibroblasts (HLFs) across COPD stages. We show that the epigenetic landscape is changed early in COPD, with DNA methylation changes occurring predominantly in regulatory regions. RNA sequencing of matched fibroblasts demonstrated dysregulation of genes involved in proliferation, DNA repair, and extracellular matrix organization. Data integration identified 110 candidate regulators of disease phenotypes that were linked to fibroblast repair processes using phenotypic screens. Our study provides high-resolution multi-omic maps of HLFs across COPD stages. We reveal novel transcriptomic and epigenetic signatures associated with COPD onset and progression and identify new candidate regulators involved in the pathogenesis of chronic lung diseases. The presence of various epigenetic factors among the candidates demonstrates that epigenetic regulation in COPD is an exciting research field that holds promise for novel therapeutic avenues for patients.© 2023 The Authors.

In this study, we used MeRIP-Seq and RNA-Seq of the longissimus dorsi (LD) muscle of adult (QA) and newborn (QN) Queshan Black pigs to screen key genes with m6A modification involved in muscle growth by bioinformatics analysis.A total of 23,445 and 25,465 m6A peaks were found in the whole genomes of QA and QN, respectively. Among them, 613 methylation peaks were significantly different (DMPs) and 579 genes were defined as differentially methylated genes (DMGs). Compared with the QN group, there were 1,874 significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in QA group, including 620 up-regulated and 1,254 down-regulated genes. In order to investigate the relationship between m6A and mRNA expression in the muscle of Queshan Black pigs at different periods, a combined analysis of MeRIP-Seq and RNA-Seq showed that 88 genes were significantly different at both levels. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes results showed that DEGs and DMGs were mainly involved in skeletal muscle tissue development, FoxO signaling pathway, MAPK signaling pathway, insulin signaling pathway, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, and Wnt signaling pathway. Four DEGs (IGF1R, CCND2, MYOD1 and FOS) and four DMGs (CCND2, PHKB, BIN1 and FUT2), which are closely related to skeletal muscle development, were selected as candidate genes for verification, and the results were consistent with the sequencing results, which indicated the reliability of the sequencing results.These results lay the foundation for understanding the specific regulatory mechanisms of growth in Queshan Black pigs, and provide theoretical references for further research on the role of m6A in muscle development and breed optimization selection.© 2023.

"37142951","Telomere-to-Telomere genome assemblies of human-infecting Encephalitozoon species.","BMC Genomics","Microsporidia are diverse spore forming, fungal-related obligate intracellular pathogens infecting a wide range of hosts. This diversity is reflected at the genome level with sizes varying by an order of magnitude, ranging from less than 3 Mb in Encephalitozoon species (the smallest known in eukaryotes) to more than 50 Mb in Edhazardia spp. As a paradigm of genome reduction in eukaryotes, the small Encephalitozoon genomes have attracted much attention with investigations revealing gene dense, repeat- and intron-poor genomes characterized by a thorough pruning of molecular functions no longer relevant to their obligate intracellular lifestyle. However, because no Encephalitozoon genome has been sequenced from telomere-to-telomere and since no methylation data is available for these species, our understanding of their overall genetic and epigenetic architectures is incomplete.In this study, we sequenced the complete genomes from telomere-to-telomere of three human-infecting Encephalitozoon spp. -E. intestinalis ATCC 50506, E. hellem ATCC 50604 and E. cuniculi ATCC 50602- using short and long read platforms and leveraged the data generated as part of the sequencing process to investigate the presence of epigenetic markers in these genomes. We also used a mixture of sequence- and structure-based computational approaches, including protein structure prediction, to help identify which Encephalitozoon proteins are involved in telomere maintenance, epigenetic regulation, and heterochromatin formation.The Encephalitozoon chromosomes were found capped by TTAGG 5-mer telomeric repeats followed by telomere associated repeat elements (TAREs) flanking hypermethylated ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene loci featuring 5-methylcytosines (5mC) and 5-hemimethylcytosines (5hmC), themselves followed by lesser methylated subtelomeres and hypomethylated chromosome cores. Strong nucleotide biases were identified between the telomeres/subtelomeres and chromosome cores with significant changes in GC/AT, GT/AC and GA/CT contents. The presence of several genes coding for proteins essential to telomere maintenance, epigenetic regulation, and heterochromatin formation was further confirmed in the Encephalitozoon genomes.Altogether, our results strongly support the subtelomeres as sites of heterochromatin formation in Encephalitozoon genomes and further suggest that these species might shutdown their energy-consuming ribosomal machinery while dormant as spores by silencing of the rRNA genes using both 5mC/5hmC methylation and facultative heterochromatin formation at these loci.© 2023.

"37141384","On the causes of gene-body methylation variation in Arabidopsis thaliana.","PLoS Genet","Gene-body methylation (gbM) refers to sparse CG methylation of coding regions, which is especially prominent in evolutionarily conserved house-keeping genes. It is found in both plants and animals, but is directly and stably (epigenetically) inherited over multiple generations in the former. Studies in Arabidopsis thaliana have demonstrated that plants originating from different parts of the world exhibit genome-wide differences in gbM, which could reflect direct selection on gbM, but which could also reflect an epigenetic memory of ancestral genetic and/or environmental factors. Here we look for evidence of such factors in F2 plants resulting from a cross between a southern Swedish line with low gbM and a northern Swedish line with high gbM, grown at two different temperatures. Using bisulfite-sequencing data with nucleotide-level resolution on hundreds of individuals, we confirm that CG sites are either methylated (nearly 100% methylation across sampled cells) or unmethylated (approximately 0% methylation across sampled cells), and show that the higher level of gbM in the northern line is due to more sites being methylated. Furthermore, methylation variants almost always show Mendelian segregation, consistent with their being directly and stably inherited through meiosis. To explore how the differences between the parental lines could have arisen, we focused on somatic deviations from the inherited state, distinguishing between gains (relative to the inherited 0% methylation) and losses (relative to the inherited 100% methylation) at each site in the F2 generation. We demonstrate that deviations predominantly affect sites that differ between the parental lines, consistent with these sites being more mutable. Gains and losses behave very differently in terms of the genomic distribution, and are influenced by the local chromatin state. We find clear evidence for different trans-acting genetic polymorphism affecting gains and losses, with those affecting gains showing strong environmental interactions (G×E). Direct effects of the environment were minimal. In conclusion, we show that genetic and environmental factors can change gbM at a cellular level, and hypothesize that these factors can also lead to transgenerational differences between individuals via the inclusion of such changes in the zygote. If true, this could explain genographic pattern of gbM with selection, and would cast doubt on estimates of epimutation rates from inbred lines in constant environments.Copyright: © 2023 Pisupati et al.

"37140978","The interplay between early embryo metabolism and mitoepigenetic programming of development.","Reproduction","Initially perceived simply as an ATP producer, mitochondria also participate in a wide range of other cellular functions. Mitochondrial communication with the nucleus, as well as signaling to other cellular compartments is critical to cell homeostasis. Therefore, during early mammalian development, mitochondrial function is reported as a key element for survival. Any mitochondrial dysfunction may reflect in poor oocyte quality and may impair embryo development with possible long-lasting consequences to cell functions and the overall embryo phenotype. Growing evidence suggests that the availability of metabolic modulators can alter the landscape of epigenetic modifications in the nuclear genome providing an important layer for the regulation of nuclear-encoded gene expression. However, whether mitochondria could also be subjected to such similar epigenetic alterations and the mechanisms involved remain largely obscure and controversial. Mitochondrial epigenetics, also known as 'mitoepigenetics' is an intriguing regulatory mechanism in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)-encoded gene expression. In this review, we summarized the recent advances in mitoepigenetics, with a special focus on mtDNA methylation in reproductive biology and preimplantation development. A better comprehension of the regulatory role of mitoepigenetics will help the understanding of mitochondrial dysfunction and provide novel strategies for in vitro production systems and assisted reproduction technologies, as well as prevent metabolic-related stress and diseases."

In this multi-centric study, we performed genomic and transcriptomic characterization of a large set of patient-derived glioblastoma (GBM) stem-like cells (GSCs).94 (80 I surgery/14 II surgery) and 53 (42 I surgery/11 II surgery) GSCs lines underwent whole exome and trascriptome analysis, respectively.Exome sequencing revealed TP53 as the main mutated gene (41/94 samples, 44%), followed by PTEN (33/94, 35%), RB1 (16/94, 17%) and NF1 (15/94, 16%), among other genes associated to brain tumors. One GSC sample bearing a BRAF p.V600E mutation showed sensitivity in vitro to a BRAF inhibitor. Gene Ontology and Reactome analysis uncovered several biological processes mostly associated to gliogenesis and glial cell differentiation, S - adenosylmethionine metabolic process, mismatch repair and methylation. Comparison of I and II surgery samples disclosed a similar distribution of mutated genes, with an overrepresentation of mutations in mismatch repair, cell cycle, p53 and methylation pathways in I surgery samples, and of mutations in receptor tyrosine kinase and MAPK signaling pathways in II surgery samples. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of RNA-seq data produced 3 clusters characterized by distinctive sets of up-regulated genes and signaling pathways.The availability of a large set of fully molecularly characterized GCSs represents a valuable public resource to support the advancement of precision oncology for the treatment of GBM.© 2023.

"37139702","DNA methylation at birth and fine motor ability in childhood: an epigenome-wide association study with replication.","Epigenetics","Lower fine motor performance in childhood has been associated with poorer cognitive development and neurodevelopmental conditions such as autism spectrum disorder, yet, biological underpinnings remain unclear. DNA methylation (DNAm), an essential process for healthy neurodevelopment, is a key molecular system of interest. In this study, we conducted the first epigenome-wide association study of neonatal DNAm with childhood fine motor ability and further examined the replicability of epigenetic markers in an independent cohort. The discovery study was embedded in Generation R, a large population-based prospective cohort, including a subsample of 924 ~ 1026 European-ancestry singletons with available data on DNAm in cord blood and fine motor ability at a mean (SD) age of 9.8 (0.4) years. Fine motor ability was measured using a finger-tapping test (3 subtests including left-, right-hand and bimanual), one of the most frequently used neuropsychological instruments of fine motor function. The replication study comprised 326 children with a mean (SD) age of 6.8 (0.4) years from an independent cohort, the INfancia Medio Ambiente (INMA) study. Four CpG sites at birth were prospectively associated with childhood fine motor ability after genome-wide correction. Of these, one CpG (cg07783800 in GNG4) was replicated in INMA, showing that lower levels of methylation at this site were associated with lower fine motor performance in both cohorts. GNG4 is highly expressed in the brain and has been implicated in cognitive decline. Our findings support a prospective, reproducible association between DNAm at birth and fine motor ability in childhood, pointing to GNG4 methylation at birth as a potential biomarker of fine motor ability."
"37137336","Ginseng mediates its anti-cancer activity by inhibiting the expression of DNMTs and reactivating methylation-silenced genes in colorectal cancer.","Carcinogenesis","Developing safe and effective therapeutic modalities remains a critical challenge for improving the prognosis of patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). In this regard, targeting epigenetic regulation in cancers has recently emerged as a promising therapeutic approach. Since several natural compounds have recently been shown to be important epigenetic modulators, we hypothesized that Ginseng might exert its anti-cancer activity by regulating DNA methylation alterations in CRC. In this study, a series of cell culture studies were conducted, followed by their interrogation in patient-derived 3D organoid models to evaluate Ginseng's anti-cancer activity in CRC. Genome-wide methylation alterations were interrogated by undertaking MethylationEpic BeadChip microarrays. First, 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50) were determined by cell viability assays, and subsequent Ginseng treatment demonstrated a significant anti-cancer effect on clonogenicity and cellular migration in CRC cells. Treatment with Ginseng potentiated cellular apoptosis through regulation of apoptosis-related genes in CRC cells. Furthermore, Ginseng treatment downregulated the expression of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and decreased the global DNA methylation levels in CRC cells. The genome-wide methylation profiling identified Ginseng-induced hypomethylation of transcriptionally silenced tumor suppressor genes. Finally, cell culture-based findings were successfully validated in patient-derived 3D organoids. In conclusion, we demonstrate that Ginseng exerts its anti-tumorigenic potential by regulating cellular apoptosis via the downregulation of DNMTs and reversing the methylation status of transcriptionally silenced genes in CRC.© The Author(s) 2023.

Valgus-varus deformity (VVD) is a common leg bone problem in broilers that causes serious economic losses to the breeding industry. The genetic etiology of VVD is not clear, which restricts the genetic control of VVD.2. In this study, knee cartilage of 35-day-old VVD and normal broilers was sequenced by whole-genome bisulphite sequencing (WGBS). The unique whole-genome DNA methylation profile of VVD broilers was described, and the methylation data and transcription data were used for joint analysis.3. The mean methylation level of the VVD group was greater than that in the normal group. A total of 4315 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were detected from methylation data, with the highest DMR density on chromosomes 25, 27, 31 and 33. DMRs were mainly located in introns, which accounted for more than 60%, followed by promoter and exon regions.4. A total of 2326 differentially methylated genes (DMGs) were identified from DMRs, including 1159 genes with upregulated DMRs, 936 genes with downregulated DMRs, and 231 genes with two types of DMRs.5. TheESPL1gene may be an important epigenetic gene of VVD. The methylation of particular CpG17, CpG18 and CpG19 sites in the promoter region of theESPL1gene may hinder the binding of transcription factors and promoters and increase the expression ofESPL1."

Records of all patients were reviewed to obtain their medical history, family history, clinical phenotype, and investigations, including genetic testing (CGH- or SNP-array).A rate of 20.8% (n = 21) of CNVs was found including 57% (12/21) of pathogenic variants and 29% (6/21) of variants of uncertain signification (VUS).A particularly high number of CNVs was found in children and adolescents with FASD. It reinforces the plea for a multidisciplinary approach for developmental disorders to explore both environmental factors, such as avoidable teratogens and intrinsic vulnerabilities, especially genetic determinants."
"37163025","Decoding the role of transcriptomic clocks in the human prefrontal cortex.","medRxiv","Aging is a complex process with interindividual variability, which can be measured by aging biological clocks. Aging clocks are machine-learning algorithms guided by biological information and associated with mortality risk and a wide range of health outcomes. One of these aging clocks are transcriptomic clocks, which uses gene expression data to predict biological age; however, their functional role is unknown. Here, we profiled two transcriptomic clocks (RNAAgeCalc and knowledge-based deep neural network clock) in a large dataset of human postmortem prefrontal cortex (PFC) samples. We identified that deep-learning transcriptomic clock outperforms RNAAgeCalc to predict transcriptomic age in the human PFC. We identified associations of transcriptomic clocks with psychiatric-related traits. Further, we applied system biology algorithms to identify common gene networks among both clocks and performed pathways enrichment analyses to assess its functionality and prioritize genes involved in the aging processes. Identified gene networks showed enrichment for diseases of signal transduction by growth factor receptors and second messenger pathways. We also observed enrichment of genome-wide signals of mental and physical health outcomes and identified genes previously associated with human brain aging. Our findings suggest a link between transcriptomic aging and health disorders, including psychiatric traits. Further, it reveals functional genes within the human PFC that may play an important role in aging and health risk."

Blood DNA methylation profiles have been used to derive metrics of biological age that capture age-related physiological change, disease risk, and mortality. The relationships between hypertension and DNA methylation-based biological age metrics have yet to be carefully described.Among 4419 women enrolled in the prospective Sister Study cohort, DNA methylation data generated from whole blood samples collected at baseline were used to calculate 3 biological age metrics (PhenoAgeAccel, GrimAgeAccel, DunedinPACE). Women were classified as hypertensive at baseline if they had high blood pressure (systolic blood pressure ≥140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mm Hg) or reported current use of antihypertensive medication. New incident cases of hypertension during follow-up were identified via self-report on annual health questionnaires.All 3 DNA methylation metrics of biological age were positively associated with prevalent hypertension at baseline (per 1-SD increase; PhenoAgeAccel, adjusted odds ratio, 1.16 [95% CI, 1.05-1.28]; GrimAgeAccel, adjusted odds ratio, 1.28 [95% CI, 1.14-1.45]; DunedinPACE, adjusted odds ratio, 1.16 [95% CI, 1.03-1.30]).

To better understand the cellular changes associated with DS, we investigated the cell composition in blood, brain, and buccal swab samples from DS patients and controls using DNA methylation-based cell-type deconvolution. We used genome-scale DNA methylation data from Illumina HumanMethylation450k and HumanMethylationEPIC arrays to profile cell composition and trace fetal lineage cells in blood samples (DS N = 46; control N = 1469), brain samples from various regions (DS N = 71; control N = 101), and buccal swab samples (DS N = 10; control N = 10). In early development, the number of cells from the fetal lineage in the blood is drastically lower in DS patients (Δ = 17.5%), indicating an epigenetically dysregulated maturation process for DS patients. Across sample types, we observed significant alterations in relative cell-type proportions for DS subjects compared with the controls. Cell-type proportion alterations were present in samples from early development and adulthood. Our findings provide insight into DS cellular biology and suggest potential cellular interventional targets for DS."

Higher levels of VO2max (ρ = 0.2, p = 6.4E - 4, r = 0.19, p = 1.2E - 3), Jumpmax (p = 0.11, p = 5.5E - 2, r = 0.13, p = 2.8E - 2), Gripmax (ρ = 0.17, p = 3.5E - 3, r = 0.16, p = 5.6E - 3), and HDL levels (ρ = 0.18, p = 1.95E - 3, r = 0.19, p = 1.1E - 3) are associated with better verbal short-term memory. In addition, verbal short-term memory is associated with decelerated aging assessed with the new DNAm biomarker FitAgeAcceleration (ρ: - 0.18, p = 0.0017). DNAmFitAge can distinguish high-fitness individuals from low/medium-fitness individuals better than existing DNAm biomarkers and estimates a younger biological age in the high-fit males and females (1.5 and 2.0 years younger, respectively).

Epigenetic clocks derived from DNA methylation (DNAm) are associated with disease progression and all-cause mortality. In this study, we hypothesized that epigenetic age mediates the relationships between the co-occurrence of IDU and HCV with mortality risk among PLWH. We tested this hypothesis in the Veterans Aging Cohort Study (n = 927) by using four established epigenetic clocks of DNAm age (i.e., Horvath, Hannum, Pheno, Grim). Compared to individuals without IDU and HCV (IDU-HCV-), participants with IDU and HCV (IDU+HCV+) showed a 2.23-fold greater risk of mortality estimated using a Cox proportional hazards model (hazard ratio: 2.23; 95% confidence interval: 1.62-3.09;p = 1.09E-06). IDU+HCV+ was associated with a significantly increased epigenetic age acceleration (EAA) measured by 3 out of 4 epigenetic clocks, adjusting for demographic and clinical variables (Hannum:p = 8.90E-04, Pheno:p = 2.34E-03, Grim:p = 3.33E-11). Furthermore, we found that epigenetic age partially mediated the relationship between IDU+HCV+ and all-cause mortality, up to a 13.67% mediation proportion. Our results suggest that comorbid IDU with HCV increases EAA in PLWH that partially mediates the increased mortality risk."

Our goal was to explore the relation of TRAP exposure and supplemental folic acid intake with epigenetic aging and CpG-specific DNA methylation (DNAm) in granulosa cells (GC). Our study included 61 women undergoing ovarian stimulation at a fertility center (2005-2015). DNAm levels were profiled in GC using the Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip. TRAP was defined using a spatiotemporal model to estimate residence-based nitrogen dioxide (NO2) exposure. Supplemental folic acid intake was measured with a validated food frequency questionnaire. We used linear regression to evaluate whether NO2or supplemental folic acid was associated with epigenetic age acceleration according to the Pan-tissue, mural GC, and GrimAge clocks or DNAm across the genome adjusting for potential confounders and accounting for multiple testing with a false discovery rate < 0.1.There were no associations between NO2or supplemental folic acid intake and epigenetic age acceleration of GC. NO2and supplemental folic acid were associated with 9 and 11 differentially methylated CpG sites. Among these CpGs, only cg07287107 exhibited a significant interaction (p-value = 0.037). In women with low supplemental folic acid, high NO2exposure was associated with 1.7% higher DNAm. There was no association between NO2and DNAm in women with high supplemental folic acid. The genes annotated to the top 250 NO2-associated CpGs were enriched for carbohydrate and protein metabolism, postsynaptic potential and dendrite development, and membrane components and exocytosis. The genes annotated to the top 250 supplemental folic acid-associated CpGs were enriched for estrous cycle, learning, cognition, synaptic organization and transmission, and size and composition of neuronal cell bodies.We found no associations between NO2, supplemental folic acid, and DNAm age acceleration of GC.

While previous studies have identified epigenetic signatures associated with CLL, whether age-related DNA methylation changes modulate CLL relapse remains elusive. In this study, we examined the association between epigenetic age acceleration and time to CLL relapse in a publicly available dataset. DNA methylation profiling of 35 CLL patients prior to initiating chemoimmunotherapy was performed using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. Four epigenetic age acceleration metrics (intrinsic epigenetic age acceleration [IEAA], extrinsic epigenetic age acceleration [EEAA], PhenoAge acceleration [PhenoAA], and GrimAge acceleration [GrimAA]) were estimated from blood DNA methylation levels. Linear, quantile, and logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic curve analyses were conducted to assess the association between each epigenetic age metric and time to CLL relapse. EEAA (p = 0.011) and PhenoAA (p = 0.046) were negatively and GrimAA (p = 0.040) was positively associated with time to CLL relapse. Simultaneous assessment of EEAA and GrimAA in male patients distinguished patients who relapsed early from patients who relapsed later (p = 0.039). No associations were observed with IEAA. These findings suggest epigenetic age acceleration prior to chemoimmunotherapy initiation is associated with time to CLL relapse.

Although violence has been associated with accelerated cellular aging, little is known about associations with cardiac autonomic activity.Objective:The current study aimed to investigate the relationship of exposure to community and domestic violence (CDV) with vagal activity and epigenetic aging acceleration.Methods:A total of 86 adolescents (57% female) were evaluated and interviewed at two time-points in São Gonçalo (2014-2019), a Brazilian city with high levels of violence. Exposure to CDV was assessed in both time-points. GrimAge acceleration was calculated from saliva DNA methylation using Infinium HumanMethylation450K (Illumina) collected in the first assessment. Heart rate variability (HRV) was collected during two stress tasks at the second assessment.Results:The exposure to violence witnessed or directly experienced at home and in the community increased significantly (t = 4.87,p < .01) across two-time points, and males had reported higher violence exposure (t = 2.06,p = .043). Violence at 1st assessment was significantly associated with GrimAge acceleration (B = .039,pvalue = .043). Violence at both assessments were associated with HRV measured during the narration of the worst trauma (traumaHRV) (B = .009,pvalue = .039, andB = .007,pvalue = .024, 1st and 2nd assessment respectively). GrimAge acceleration was significantly associated with traumaHRV (B = .043,pvalue = .049), and HRV measured during a 3D roller coaster video (B = .061,pvalue = .024).Conclusions:We found relevant evidence that experiencing violence during adolescence is associated with epigenetic aging and stress-related vagal activity. Understanding these factors during this period could contribute to the development of early interventions for health promotion.HIGHLIGHTSHigher exposure to Community and domestic violence is associated with increased GrimAge acceleration.Higher GrimAge acceleration is associated with increased stress-related vagal activity.Exposure to community and domestic violence increased significantly over time."

Here we develop 'aging clocks' based on single-cell transcriptomics to characterize cell-type-specific aging and rejuvenation. We generated single-cell transcriptomes from the subventricular zone neurogenic region of 28 mice, tiling ages from young to old. We trained single-cell-based regression models to predict chronological age and biological age (neural stem cell proliferation capacity). These aging clocks are generalizable to independent cohorts of mice, other regions of the brains, and other species. To determine if these aging clocks could quantify transcriptomic rejuvenation, we generated single-cell transcriptomic datasets of neurogenic regions for two interventions-heterochronic parabiosis and exercise. Aging clocks revealed that heterochronic parabiosis and exercise reverse transcriptomic aging in neurogenic regions, but in different ways. This study represents the first development of high-resolution aging clocks from single-cell transcriptomic data and demonstrates their application to quantify transcriptomic rejuvenation.© 2022.

"37086262","How can we modulate aging through nutrition and physical exercise? An epigenetic approach.","Aging (Albany NY)","The World Health Organization predicts that by 2050, 2.1 billion people worldwide will be over 60 years old, a drastic increase from only 1 billion in 2019. Considering these numbers, strategies to ensure an extended ""healthspan"" or healthy longevity are urgently needed. The present study approaches the promotion of healthspan from an epigenetic perspective. Epigenetic phenomena are modifiable in response to an individual's environmental exposures, and therefore link an individual's environment to their gene expression pattern. Epigenetic studies demonstrate that aging is associated with decondensation of the chromatin, leading to an altered heterochromatin structure, which promotes the accumulation of errors. In this review, we describe how aging impacts epigenetics and how nutrition and physical exercise can positively impact the aging process, from an epigenetic point of view. Canonical histones are replaced by histone variants, concomitant with an increase in histone post-translational modifications. A slight increase in DNA methylation at promoters has been observed, which represses transcription of previously active genes, in parallel with global genome hypomethylation. Aging is also associated with deregulation of gene expression - usually provided by non-coding RNAs - leading to both the repression of previously transcribed genes and to the transcription of previously repressed genes. Age-associated epigenetic events are less common in individuals with a healthy lifestyle, including balanced nutrition, caloric restriction and physical exercise. Healthy aging is associated with more tightly condensed chromatin, fewer PTMs and greater regulation by ncRNAs."
"37143783","The relationship of trait-like compassion with epigenetic aging: The population-based prospective Young Finns Study.","Front Psychiatry","Helping others within and beyond the family has been related to living a healthy and long life. Compassion is a prosocial personality trait characterized by concern for another person who is suffering and the motivation to help. The current study examines whether epigenetic aging is a potential biological mechanism that explains the link between prosociality and longevity.We used data from the Young Finns Study that follows six birth-cohorts from age 3-18 to 19-49. Trait-like compassion for others was measured with the Temperament and Character Inventory in the years 1997 and 2001. Epigenetic age acceleration and telomere length were measured with five DNA methylation (DNAm) indicators (DNAmAgeHorvath, IEAA_Hannum, EEAA_Hannum, DNAmPhenoAge, and DNAmTL) based on blood drawn in 2011. We controlled for sex, socioeconomic status in childhood and adulthood, and body-mass index.An association between higher compassion in 1997 and a less accelerated DNAmPhenoAge, which builds on previous work on phenotypic aging, approached statistical significance in a sex-adjusted model (n = 1,030;b = -0.34;p = 0.050). Compassion in 1997 predicted less accelerated epigenetic aging over and above the control variables (n = 843;b = -0.47;p = 0.016). There was no relationship between compassion in 2001 (n = 1108/910) and any of the other four studied epigenetic aging indicators. High compassion for others might indeed influence whether an individual's biological age is lower than their chronological age. The conducted robustness checks partially support this conclusion, yet cannot rule out that there might be a broader prosocial trait behind the findings. The observed associations are interesting but should be interpreted as weak requiring replication.Copyright © 2023 Dobewall, Keltikangas-Järvinen, Marttila, Mishra, Saarinen, Cloninger, Zwir, Kähönen, Hurme, Raitakari, Lehtimäki and Hintsanen."

We compared the proportion of ART-conceived livebirths and maternal childbearing age between patients with UPD-IDs and the general population or patients with epi-IDs. The proportion of ART-conceived livebirths in patients with aneuploid UPD-IDs was consistent with that in the general population of maternal age ≥ 30 years and was lower than that in the patients with epi-IDs, although there was no significant difference. The maternal childbearing age of patients with aneuploid UPD-IDs was skewed to the increased ages with several cases exceeding the 97.5th percentile of maternal childbearing age of the general population and significantly higher than that of patients with epi-IDs (P < 0.001). In addition, we compared the proportion of ART-conceived livebirths and parental age at childbirth between patients with UPD-IDs caused by aneuploid oocytes (oUPD-IDs) and that by aneuploid sperm (sUPD-IDs). Almost all ART-conceived livebirths were identified in patients with oUPD-IDs, and both maternal age and paternal age at childbirth were significantly higher in patients with oUPD-IDs than in patients with sUPD-IDs. Because maternal age and paternal age were strongly correlated (rs = 0.637, P < 0.001), higher paternal age in oUPD-IDs was explained by the higher maternal age in this group.Different from the case of epi-IDs, ART itself is not likely to facilitate the development of aneuploid UPD-IDs. We demonstrated that advanced maternal age can be a risk factor for the development of aneuploid UPD-IDs, particularly oUPD-IDs.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37190082","Can Epigenetics Predict Drug Efficiency in Mental Disorders?","Cells","Psychiatric disorders affect millions of individuals and their families worldwide, and the costs to society are substantial and are expected to rise due to a lack of effective treatments. Personalized medicine-customized treatment tailored to the individual-offers a solution. Although most mental diseases are influenced by genetic and environmental factors, finding genetic biomarkers that predict treatment efficacy has been challenging. This review highlights the potential of epigenetics as a tool for predicting treatment efficacy and personalizing medicine for psychiatric disorders. We examine previous studies that have attempted to predict treatment efficacy through epigenetics, provide an experimental model, and note the potential challenges at each stage. While the field is still in its infancy, epigenetics holds promise as a predictive tool by examining individual patients' epigenetic profiles in conjunction with other indicators. However, further research is needed, including additional studies, replication, validation, and application beyond clinical settings."
"37217561","Senotherapeutic peptide treatment reduces biological age and senescence burden in human skin models.","NPJ Aging","Cellular senescence is known to play a role in age-related skin function deterioration which potentially influences longevity. Here, a two-step phenotypic screening was performed to identify senotherapeutic peptides, leading to the identification of Peptide (Pep) 14. Pep 14 effectively decreased human dermal fibroblast senescence burden induced by Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS), chronological aging, ultraviolet-B radiation (UVB), and etoposide treatment, without inducing significant toxicity. Pep 14 functions via modulation of PP2A, an understudied holoenzyme that promotes genomic stability and is involved in DNA repair and senescence pathways. At the single-cell level, Pep 14 modulates genes that prevent senescence progression by arresting the cell cycle and enhancing DNA repair, which consequently reduce the number of cells progressing to late senescence. When applied on aged ex vivo skin, Pep 14 promoted a healthy skin phenotype with structural and molecular resemblance to young ex vivo skin, decreased the expression of senescence markers, including SASP, and reduced the DNA methylation age. In summary, this work shows the safe reduction of the biological age of ex vivo human skins by a senomorphic peptide.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37186209","Dietary inflammatory potential and biological aging among US adults: a population-based study.","Aging Clin Exp Res","The rate of biological aging is influenced by various factors such as genetics, environment, and diet. The dietary inflammatory index (DII) is strongly associated with various chronic diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between DII and biological aging in US adults using quantitative indicators.Based on data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2018, weighted multiple linear regression models, generalized weighted models, and smoothed fitted curves were used to investigate the linear and nonlinear relationships of DII with four biological markers of aging (biological age, phenotypic age, telomere length, and serum klotho concentration).A total of 35,575 adult participants with complete data were included in the study. After adjusting for all confounders, significant positive correlations were found between DII with biological age [0.070 (0.045, 0.095)] and phenotypic age [0.421 (0.371, 0.471)], with an increase of 0.07 and 0.42 years in biological age and phenotypic age, respectively, for each increase in DII score. The negative correlations between DII with telomere length [ - 0.005 ( - 0.008, - 0.002)] and klotho [ - 3.874 ( - 7.409, - 0.338)] were significant only in partially adjusted models and differed across subgroups.In the current study, higher DII scores (greater pro-inflammatory dietary potential) were associated with biological aging. These findings may contribute to the development of aging prevention strategies through dietary interventions.© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
"37156786","Epigenetic age deacceleration in youth at familial risk for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.","Transl Psychiatry","Epigenetic modifications occur sequentially during the lifespan, but their pace can be altered by external stimuli. The onset of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder is critically modulated by stressors that may alter the epigenetic pattern, a putative signature marker of exposure to environmental risk factors. In this study, we estimated the age-related epigenetic modifications to assess the differences between young individuals at familial high risk (FHR) and controls and their association with environmental stressors. The sample included 117 individuals (6-17 years) at FHR (45%) and a control group (55%). Blood and saliva samples were used estimate the epigenetic age with six epigenetic clocks through methylation data. Environmental risk was measured with obstetric complications, socioeconomic statuses and recent stressful life events data. Epigenetic age was correlated with chronological age. FHR individuals showed epigenetic age deacceleration of Horvath and Hannum epigenetic clocks compared to controls. No effect of the environmental risk factors on the epigenetic age acceleration could be detected. Epigenetic age acceleration adjusted by cell counts showed that the FHR group was deaccelerated also with the PedBE epigenetic clock. Epigenetic age asynchronicities were found in the young at high risk, suggesting that offspring of affected parents follow a slower pace of biological aging than the control group. It still remains unclear which environmental stressors orchestrate the changes in the methylation pattern. Further studies are needed to better characterize the molecular impact of environmental stressors before illness onset, which could be critical in the development of tools for personalized psychiatry.© 2023.

"37152987","Examining the immunoepigenetic-gut microbiome axis in the context of self-esteem among Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders.","Front Genet","Introduction:Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander (NHPI) populations experience higher rates of immunometabolic diseases compared to other racial-ethnic groups in Hawaii. As annual NHPI mortality rates for suicide and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) exceed those of the state as a whole, understanding the social and biological mechanisms underlying these disparities are urgently needed to enable preventive strategies.Methods:A community-based approach was used to investigate the immunoepigenetic-gut microbiome axis in an NHPI-enriched cohort of Oahu residents (N= 68). Self-esteem (SE) data was collected using a modified Rosenberg self-esteem (SE) assessment as a proxy measure for mental wellbeing in consideration for cultural competency. T2DM status was evaluated using point-of-care A1c (%) tests. Stool samples were collected for 16s-based metagenomic sequencing analyses. Plasma from blood samples were isolated by density-gradient centrifugation. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected from the same samples and enriched for monocytes using negative selection techniques. Flow-cytometry was used for immunoprofiling assays. Monocyte DNA was extracted for Illumina EPIC array-based methylation analysis.Results:Compared to individuals with normal SE (NSE), those with low SE (LSE) exhibited significantly higher plasma concentrations (pg/ml) of proinflammatory cytokines IL-8 (p= 0.051) and TNF-α (p= 0.011). Metagenomic analysis revealed that the relative abundance (%) of specific gut bacteria significantly differed between SE groups - some of which directly correlated with SE scores. Gene ontology analysis revealed that 104 significantly differentially methylated loci (DML) between SE groups were preferentially located at genes involved in immunometabolic processes. Horvath clock analyses indicated epigenetic age (Epi-Age) deceleration in individuals with LSE and acceleration in individuals with NSE (p= 0.042), yet was not reproduced by other clocks.Discussion:These data reveal novel differences in the immunoepigenetic-gut microbiome axis with respect to SE, warranting further investigation into its relationship to brain activity and mental health in NHPI. Unexpected results from Epi-Age analyses warrant further investigation into the relationship between biological age and disparate health outcomes among the NHPI population. The modifiable component of epigenetic processes and the gut microbiome makes this axis an attractive target for potential therapeutics, biomarker discovery, and novel prevention strategies.Copyright © 2023 Becerra, Wells, Kunihiro, Lee, Umeda, Allan, Rubas, McCracken, Nunokawa, Lee, Pidlaoan, Phankitnirondorn, Dye, Yamamoto, Peres, Juarez and Maunakea."
"37176128","Single-Cell Analysis in Immuno-Oncology.","Int J Mol Sci","The complexity of the cellular and non-cellular milieu surrounding human tumors plays a decisive role in the course and outcome of disease. The high variability in the distribution of the immune and non-immune compartments within the tumor microenvironments (TME) among different patients governs the mode of their response or resistance to current immunotherapeutic approaches. Through deciphering this diversity, one can tailor patients' management to meet an individual's needs. Single-cell (sc) omics technologies have given a great boost towards this direction. This review gathers recent data about how multi-omics profiling, including the utilization of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing (scATAC-seq), T-cell receptor sequencing (scTCR-seq), mass, tissue-based, or microfluidics cytometry, and related bioinformatics tools, contributes to the high-throughput assessment of a large number of analytes at single-cell resolution. Unravelling the exact TCR clonotype of the infiltrating T cells or pinpointing the classical or novel immune checkpoints across various cell subsets of the TME provide a boost to our comprehension of adaptive immune responses, their antigen specificity and dynamics, and grant suggestions for possible therapeutic targets. Future steps are expected to merge high-dimensional data with tissue localization data, which can serve the investigation of novel multi-modal biomarkers for the selection and/or monitoring of the optimal treatment from the current anti-cancer immunotherapeutic armamentarium."
"37096870","The single-cell chromatin accessibility landscape in mouse perinatal testis development.","Elife","Spermatogenesis depends on an orchestrated series of developing events in germ cells and full maturation of the somatic microenvironment. To date, the majority of efforts to study cellular heterogeneity in testis has been focused on single-cell gene expression rather than the chromatin landscape shaping gene expression. To advance our understanding of the regulatory programs underlying testicular cell types, we analyzed single-cell chromatin accessibility profiles in more than 25,000 cells from mouse developing testis. We showed that single-cell sequencing assay for transposase-accessible chromatin (scATAC-Seq) allowed us to deconvolve distinct cell populations and identifycis-regulatory elements (CREs) underlying cell-type specification. We identified sets of transcription factors associated with cell type-specific accessibility, revealing novel regulators of cell fate specification and maintenance. Pseudotime reconstruction revealed detailed regulatory dynamics coordinating the sequential developmental progressions of germ cells and somatic cells. This high-resolution dataset also unveiled previously unreported subpopulations within both the Sertoli and Leydig cell groups. Further, we defined candidate target cell types and genes of several genome-wide association study (GWAS) signals, including those associated with testosterone levels and coronary artery disease. Collectively, our data provide a blueprint of the 'regulon' of the mouse male germline and supporting somatic cells.© 2023, Suen et al."
"37174498","SNP-Based Heritability of Osteochondrosis Dissecans in Hanoverian Warmblood Horses.","Animals (Basel)","Before the genomics era, heritability estimates were performed using pedigree data. Data collection for pedigree analysis is time consuming and holds the risk of incorrect or incomplete data. With the availability of SNP-based arrays, heritability can now be estimated based on genotyping data. We used SNP array and 1.6 million imputed genotype data with different minor allele frequency restrictions to estimate heritabilities for osteochondrosis dissecans in the fetlock, hock and stifle joints of 446 Hanoverian warmblood horses. SNP-based heritabilities were estimated using a genomic restricted maximum likelihood (GREML) method and accounting for patterns of regional linkage disequilibrium in the equine genome. In addition, we employed GREML for family data to account for different degrees of relatedness in the study population. Our results indicate that we were able to capture a larger proportion of additive genetic variance compared to pedigree-based estimates in the same population of Hanoverian horses. Heritability estimates on the linear scale for fetlock-, hock- and stifle-osteochondrosis dissecans were 0.41-0.43, 0.62-0.63, and 0.23-0.25, respectively, with standard errors of 0.11-0.14. Accounting for linkage disequilibrium patterns had an upward effect on the imputed data and a downward impact on the SNP array genotype data. GREML for family data resulted in higher heritability estimates for fetlock-osteochondrosis dissecans and slightly higher estimates for hock-osteochondrosis dissecans, but had no effect on stifle-osteochondrosis dissecans. The largest and most consistent heritability estimates were obtained when we employed GREML for family data with genomic relationship matrices weighted through patterns of regional linkage disequilibrium. Estimation of SNP-based heritability should be recommended for traits that can only be phenotyped in smaller samples or are cost-effective."

Here, we study 1084 eQTLs affecting the TIME found through analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas and literature curation. These TIME eQTLs are enriched in areas of active transcription, and associate with gene expression in specific immune cell subsets, such as macrophages and dendritic cells. Polygenic score models built with TIME eQTLs reproducibly stratify cancer risk, survival and immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) response across independent cohorts. To assess whether an eQTL-informed approach could reveal potential cancer immunotherapy targets, we inhibit CTSS, a gene implicated by cancer risk and ICB response-associated polygenic models; CTSS inhibition results in slowed tumor growth and extended survival in vivo. These results validate the potential of integrating germline variation and TIME characteristics for uncovering potential targets for immunotherapy.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Genomic selection (GS) is an effective approach in animal breeding to improve selection and reduce costs. However, the performance of genomic prediction in duck carcass traits remains largely unknown.In this study, we estimated the genetic parameters, performed GS using different models and marker densities, and compared the estimation performance between GS and conventional BLUP on 35 carcass traits in an F2population of ducks. Most of the cut weight traits and intestine length traits were estimated to be high and moderate heritabilities, respectively, while the heritabilities of percentage slaughter traits were dynamic. The reliability of genome prediction using GBLUP increased by an average of 0.06 compared to the conventional BLUP method. The Permutation studies revealed that 50K markers had achieved ideal prediction reliability, while 3K markers still achieved 90.7% predictive capability would further reduce the cost for duck carcass traits. The genomic relationship matrix normalized by our true variance method instead of the widely used [Formula: see text] could achieve an increase in prediction reliability in most traits. We detected most of the bayesian models had a better performance, especially for BayesN. Compared to GBLUP, BayesN can further improve the predictive reliability with an average of 0.06 for duck carcass traits.This study demonstrates genomic selection for duck carcass traits is promising. The genomic prediction can be further improved by modifying the genomic relationship matrix using our proposed true variance method and several Bayesian models. Permutation study provides a theoretical basis for the fact that low-density arrays can be used to reduce genotype costs in duck genome selection.© 2023. The Author(s)."

However, there is a lack of evidence supporting a genetic association between polymorphisms in the TLR9 gene and T1D.In total, 1513 individuals, including T1D patients (n=738) and healthy control individuals (n=775), from the Han Chinese population were recruited for an association analysis of the rs352140 polymorphism of the TLR9 gene and T1D. rs352140 was genotyped by MassARRAY. The allele and genotype distributions of rs352140 in the T1D and healthy groups and those in different T1D subgroups were analyzed by the chi-squared test and binary logistic regression model. The chi-square test and Kruskal-Wallis H test were performed to explore the association between genotype and phenotype in T1D patients.The allele and genotype distributions of rs352140 were significantly different in T1D patients and healthy control individuals (p=0.019,p=0.035). Specifically, the T allele and TT genotype of rs352140 conferred a higher risk of T1D (OR=1.194, 95% CI=1.029-1.385,p=0.019, OR=1.535, 95% CI=1.108-2.126,p=0.010). The allele and genotype distributions of rs352140 were not significantly different between childhood-onset and adult-onset T1D and between T1D with a single islet autoantibody and T1D with multiple islet autoantibodies (p=0.603,p=0.743). rs352140 was associated with T1D susceptibility according to the recessive and additive models (p=0.015,p=0.019) but was not associated with T1D susceptibility in the dominant and overdominant models (p=0.117,p=0.928). Moreover, genotype-phenotype association analysis showed that the TT genotype of rs352140 was associated with higher fasting C-peptide levels (p=0.017).In the Han Chinese population, the TLR9 polymorphism rs352140 is associated with T1D and is a risk factor for susceptibility to T1D.Copyright © 2023 Wang, Xia, Chen, Xu, Sun, Li, Huang, Li, Xie and Zhou."
"37066291","The Heritability of Human Connectomes: a Causal Modeling Analysis.","bioRxiv","The heritability of human connectomes is crucial for understanding the influence of genetic and environmental factors on variability in connectomes, and their implications for behavior and disease. However, current methods for studying heritability assume an associational rather than a causal effect, or rely on strong distributional assumptions that may not be appropriate for complex, high-dimensional connectomes. To address these limitations, we propose two solutions: first, we formalize heritability as a problem in causal inference, and identify measured covariates to control for unmeasured confounding, allowing us to make causal claims. Second, we leverage statistical models that capture the underlying structure and dependence within connectomes, enabling us to define different notions of connectome heritability by removing common structures such as scaling of edge weights between connectomes. We then develop a non-parametric test to detect whether causal heritability exists after taking principled steps to adjust for these commonalities, and apply it to diffusion connectomes estimated from the Human Connectome Project. Our findings reveal that heritability can still be detected even after adjusting for potential confounding like neuroanatomy, age, and sex. However, once we address for rescaling between connectomes, our causal tests are no longer significant. These results suggest that previous conclusions on connectome heritability may be driven by rescaling factors. Together, our manuscript highlights the importance for future works to continue to develop data-driven heritability models which faithfully reflect potential confounders and network structure."

Supplementing KSCs is the key to solution while lineage reprogramming provides a new approach to acquiring KSCs. Through direct lineage reprogramming, induced KSCs (iKSCs) can be produced from somatic cells, which exhibit great application potential. Two strategies are currently being used to directly generate iKSCs, lineage transcription factor (TF)-mediated and pluripotency factors-mediated. This review focuses on lineage TF-mediated direct reprogramming and describes the conversion process along with the underlying epigenetic mechanisms. It also discusses other potential induction strategies to generate iKSCs and challenges associated with in situ reprogramming for skin repair.© The Author(s) 2023.

Here, we show that characteristic monoclonal natural antibodies recognize common chemical moieties or adducts, supporting the view that polyreactive antibodies may often correspond to anti-adduct antibodies. We next examined the development of immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG to 81 ubiquitous adducts from birth to old age. Newborn IgM only reacted to a limited number of consensus determinants. This highly restricted neonatal repertoire abruptly diversified around 6 months of age through the development of antibodies to environmental antigens and age-driven epigenetic modifications. In contrast, the IgG repertoire was diverse across the entire life span. Our studies reveal an unrecognized component of humoral immunity directed to common adducts. These findings set the ground for further investigations into the role of anti-adduct B cell responses in homeostatic functions and pathological conditions."

We aimed to systematically screen circulating proteins for AF drug targets and determine their safety and efficacy using genetic methods.The protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) of up to 1949 circulating proteins were retrieved from nine large genome-proteome-wide association studies. Two-sample Mendelian Randomization (MR) and colocalization analyses were used to estimate the causal effects of proteins on the risk of AF. Furthermore, phenome-wide MR was conducted to depict side effects and the drug-target databases were searched for drug validation and repurposing.Systematic MR screen identified 30 proteins as promising AF drug targets. Genetically predicted 12 proteins increased AF risk (TES, CFL2, MTHFD1, RAB1A, DUSP13, SRL, ANXA4, NEO1, FKBP7, SPON1, LPA, MANBA); 18 proteins decreased AF risk (PMVK, UBE2F, SYT11, CHMP3, PFKM, FBP1, TNFSF12, CTSZ, QSOX2, ALAD, EFEMP1, FLRT2, LRIG1, OLA1, SH3BGRL3, IL6R, B3GNT8, FCGR2A). DUSP13 and TNFSF12 possess strong colocalization evidence. For the proteins that were identified, extended phe-MR analysis was conducted to assess their side-effect profiles, while drug-target databases provided information on their approved or investigated indications.We identified 30 circulating proteins as potential preventive targets for AF.© 2023.

HCRT deficiency can also occur in secondary forms of narcolepsy and be only temporary, suggesting it can occur without irreversible neuronal loss. The recent discovery that narcolepsy patients also show loss of hypothalamic (corticotropin-releasing hormone) CRH-producing neurons suggests that other mechanisms than cell-specific autoimmune attack, are involved. Here, we identify the HCRT cell-colocalized neuropeptide QRFP as the best marker of HCRT neurons. We show that if HCRT neurons are ablated in mice, in addition to Hcrt,Qrfptranscript is also lost in the lateral hypothalamus, while in mice where only the Hcrt gene is inactivatedQrfpis unchanged. Similarly, postmortem hypothalamic tissues of narcolepsy patients show preserved QRFP expression, suggesting the neurons are present but fail to actively produce HCRT. We show that the promoter of the HCRT gene of patients exhibits hypermethylation at a methylation-sensitive and evolutionary-conserved PAX5:ETS1 transcription factor-binding site, suggesting the gene is subject to transcriptional silencing. We show also that in addition to HCRT, CRH and Dynorphin (PDYN) gene promoters, exhibit hypermethylation in the hypothalamus of patients. Altogether, we propose thatHCRT, PDYN, and CRHare epigenetically silenced by a hypothalamic assault (inflammation) in narcolepsy patients, without concurrent cell death. Since methylation is reversible, our findings open the prospect of reversing or curing narcolepsy."

Outcomes included the following: (1) insulin sensitivity by hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp, defined as the glucose infusion rate (GIR); (2) resting metabolism and substrate oxidation by indirect calorimetry; and (3) glucose, insulin, and C-peptide concentrations following a standard meal test.Nine postmenopausal women (mean [SD], age 59 [4] years, BMI 28.0  [2.6] kg/m2) were analyzed. Accelerometer-determined total time in bed was 8.4 ± 0.6 hours during HS versus 5.0 ± 0.4 hours during SR (38% reduction, p < 0.0001). SR reduced low-dose insulin GIR by 20% (HS: 2.55 ± 0.22 vs. SR: 2.03 ± 0.20 mg/kg/min; p = 0.01) and high-dose insulin GIR by 12% (HS: 10.48 ± 0.72 vs. SR: 9.19 ± 0.72 mg/kg/min; p < 0.001). SR reduced fat oxidation during high-dose insulin infusion (p < 0.01), and it did not alter resting energy metabolism.Four nights of SR reduced insulin sensitivity and fat oxidation in postmenopausal women. These findings underscore the role of insufficient sleep in metabolic dysfunction following menopause.

A missense variant (c.689G>T p.Gly230Val) in ELOVL5 causes Spinocerebellar Ataxia subtype 38 (SCA38), a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by autosomal dominant inheritance, cerebellar Purkinje cell demise and adult-onset ataxia. Having previously showed aberrant accumulation of p.G230V in the Golgi complex, here we further investigated the pathogenic mechanisms triggered by p.G230V, integrating functional studies with bioinformatic analyses of protein sequence and structure. Biochemical analysis showed that p.G230V enzymatic activity was normal. In contrast, SCA38-derived fibroblasts showed reduced expression of ELOVL5, Golgi complex enlargement and increased proteasomal degradation with respect to controls. By heterologous overexpression, p.G230V was significantly more active than wild-type ELOVL5 in triggering the unfolded protein response and in decreasing viability in mouse cortical neurons. By homology modelling, we generated native and p.G230V protein structures whose superposition revealed a shift in Loop 6 in p.G230V that altered a highly conserved intramolecular disulphide bond. The conformation of this bond, connecting Loop 2 and Loop 6, appears to be elongase-specific. Alteration of this intramolecular interaction was also observed when comparing wild-type ELOVL4 and the p.W246G variant which causes SCA34. We demonstrate by sequence and structure analyses that ELOVL5 p.G230V and ELOVL4 p.W246G are position-equivalent missense variants. We conclude that SCA38 is a conformational disease and propose combined loss of function by mislocalization and gain of toxic function by ER/Golgi stress as early events in SCA38 pathogenesis.© 2023.

Many studies have shown that in older MZ twins, there are significant differences in overall content and genomic distribution of methylation.In this study, we analyzed the DNA methylome profile of blood to identify recurrent differentially methylated CpG sites (DMCs) to discriminate between MZ twins.Blood samples were collected from 47 paired MZ twins. We performed the DNA methylation profiling using the HumanMethylation EPIC BeadChip platform and identified recurrent DMCs between MZ twins. Then, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), Gene Ontology (GO), and motif enrichment analyses were performed to reveal the biological functions of recurrent DMCs. We collected DNA methylome data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) public database to verify the recurrent DMCs between MZ twins.We identified recurrent DMCs between MZ twin samples and observed that they were enriched in immune-related genes. In addition, we verified our DMCs in a public dataset.Our results suggest that the methylation level at recurrent DMCs between MZ twins may serve as a valuable biomarker for identification of individuals in a pair of MZ twins.© 2023.

The following environmental factors were found to act epigenetically on the genome to influence the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders: social determinants of mental health, maternal prenatal psychological stress, poverty, migration, urban dwelling, pregnancy and birth complications, alcohol and substance abuse, microbiota, and prenatal and postnatal infections. The article also discusses the ways by which factors such as drugs, psychotherapy, electroconvulsive therapy, and physical exercise act epigenetically to alleviate the symptoms of psychiatric disorders in affected patients. These data will be useful information for clinical psychiatrists and those researching the pathogenesis and treatment of psychiatric disorders."
"37207277","Using brain cell-type-specific protein interactomes to interpret neurodevelopmental genetic signals in schizophrenia.","iScience","Genetics have nominated many schizophrenia risk genes and identified convergent signals between schizophrenia and neurodevelopmental disorders. However, functional interpretation of the nominated genes in the relevant brain cell types is often lacking. We executed interaction proteomics for six schizophrenia risk genes that have also been implicated in neurodevelopment in human induced cortical neurons. The resulting protein network is enriched for common variant risk of schizophrenia in Europeans and East Asians, is down-regulated in layer 5/6 cortical neurons of individuals affected by schizophrenia, and can complement fine-mapping and eQTL data to prioritize additional genes in GWAS loci. A sub-network centered on HCN1 is enriched for common variant risk and contains proteins (HCN4 and AKAP11) enriched for rare protein-truncating mutations in individuals with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Our findings showcase brain cell-type-specific interactomes as an organizing framework to facilitate interpretation of genetic and transcriptomic data in schizophrenia and its related disorders.© 2023 The Authors."
"37202504","Investigating the shared genetic architecture between schizophrenia and body mass index.","Mol Psychiatry","Evidence for reciprocal comorbidity of schizophrenia (SCZ) and body mass index (BMI) has grown in recent years. However, little is known regarding the shared genetic architecture or causality underlying the phenotypic association between SCZ and BMI. Leveraging summary statistics from the hitherto largest genome-wide association study (GWAS) on each trait, we investigated the genetic overlap and causal associations of SCZ with BMI. Our study demonstrated a genetic correlation between SCZ and BMI, and the correlation was more evident in local genomic regions. The cross-trait meta-analysis identified 27 significant SNPs shared between SCZ and BMI, most of which had the same direction of influence on both diseases. Mendelian randomization analysis showed the causal association of SCZ with BMI, but not vice versa. Combining the gene expression information, we found that the genetic correlation between SCZ and BMI is enriched in six regions of brain, led by the brain frontal cortex. Additionally, 34 functional genes and 18 specific cell types were found to have an impact on both SCZ and BMI within these regions. Taken together, our comprehensive genome-wide cross-trait analysis suggests a shared genetic basis including pleiotropic loci, tissue enrichment, and shared function genes between SCZ and BMI. This work provides novel insights into the intrinsic genetic overlap of SCZ and BMI, and highlights new opportunities and avenues for future investigation.© 2023.

"37156767","Genetics implicates overactive osteogenesis in the development of diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis.","Nat Commun","Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH) is a condition where adjacent vertebrae become fused through formation of osteophytes. The genetic and epidemiological etiology of this condition is not well understood. Here, we implemented a machine learning algorithm to assess the prevalence and severity of the pathology in ~40,000 lateral DXA scans in the UK Biobank Imaging cohort. We find that DISH is highly prevalent, above the age of 45, ~20% of men and ~8% of women having multiple osteophytes. Surprisingly, we find strong phenotypic and genetic association of DISH with increased bone mineral density and content throughout the entire skeletal system. Genetic association analysis identified ten loci associated with DISH, including multiple genes involved in bone remodeling (RUNX2, IL11, GDF5, CCDC91, NOG, and ROR2). Overall, this study describes genetics of DISH and implicates the role of overactive osteogenesis as a key driver of the pathology.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37174656","Epigenetic Changes Associated with Different Types of Stressors and Suicide.","Cells","Stress is associated with various epigenetic changes. Some stress-induced epigenetic changes are highly dynamic, whereas others are associated with lasting marks on the epigenome. In our study, a comprehensive narrative review of the literature was performed by investigating the epigenetic changes that occur with acute stress, chronic stress, early childhood stress, and traumatic stress exposures, along with examining those observed in post-mortem brains or blood samples of suicide completers and attempters. In addition, the transgenerational effects of these changes are reported. For all types of stress studies examined, the genesNr3c1,OXTR,SLC6A4, andBDNFreproducibly showed epigenetic changes, with some modifications observed to be passed down to subsequent generations following stress exposures. The aforementioned genes are known to be involved in neuronal development and hormonal regulation and are all associated with susceptibility to mental health disorders including depression, anxiety, personality disorders, and PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder). Further research is warranted in order to determine the scope of epigenetic actionable targets in individuals suffering from the long-lasting effects of stressful experiences."

We defined the regional DNAm levels as the average methylation level of 5'-cytosine-phosphate-guanine-3' within 500 bp ofLINC00319(cg01820192),ATP2B1(cg00508575), andLMNA(cg12593793), respectively. Generalized linear regression models were used to assess the association between the regional DNAm and 2-year blood pressure changes. Trajectory analysis was used to identify subgroups that shared a similar underlying trajectory of 2-year blood pressure changes.The regional DNAm atLINC00319, showed significantly different associations with 2-year changes in systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure among participants assigned to low- or high-fat diets (Pfor interaction<0.05 for all). In response to the low-fat diet, per SD higher regional DNAm atLINC00319was associated with greater reductions in both 2-year changes in systolic blood pressure (β, -1.481;P=0.020) and diastolic blood pressure (β, -1.096;P=0.009). Three trajectories of changes in systolic blood pressure or diastolic blood pressure were identified, and participants with higher regional DNAm atLINC00319were more likely to experience and maintain decreased systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure (odds ratio of being in decrease-stable versus stable [95% CI], 1.542 [1.146-2.076] and 1.463 [1.125-1.902]).Our findings suggest that DNAm could be a metabolic memory bridging early and later life, and an indicator of more benefits from eating a low-fat weight-loss diet."

Diverse brain cell types have been implicated in MDD etiology. Significant sexual differences exist in MDD clinical presentation and outcome, and recent evidence suggests different molecular bases for male and female MDD. We evaluated over 160,000 nuclei from 71 female and male donors, leveraging new and pre-existing single-nucleus RNA-sequencing data from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Cell type specific transcriptome-wide threshold-free MDD-associated gene expression patterns were similar between the sexes, but significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) diverged. Among 7 broad cell types and 41 clusters evaluated, microglia and parvalbumin interneurons contributed the most DEGs in females, while deep layer excitatory neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocyte precursors were the major contributors in males. Further, the Mic1 cluster with 38% of female DEGs and the ExN10_L46 cluster with 53% of male DEGs, stood out in the meta-analysis of both sexes.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37189848","MyBrain-Seq: A Pipeline for MiRNA-Seq Data Analysis in Neuropsychiatric Disorders.","Biomedicines","High-throughput sequencing of small RNA molecules such as microRNAs (miRNAs) has become a widely used approach for studying gene expression and regulation. However, analyzing miRNA-Seq data can be challenging because it requires multiple steps, from quality control and preprocessing to differential expression and pathway-enrichment analyses, with many tools and databases available for each step. Furthermore, reproducibility of the analysis pipeline is crucial to ensure that the results are accurate and reliable. Here, we present myBrain-Seq, a comprehensive and reproducible pipeline for analyzing miRNA-Seq data that incorporates miRNA-specific solutions at each step of the analysis. The pipeline was designed to be flexible and user-friendly, allowing researchers with different levels of expertise to perform the analysis in a standardized and reproducible manner, using the most common and widely used tools for each step. In this work, we describe the implementation of myBrain-Seq and demonstrate its capacity to consistently and reproducibly identify differentially expressed miRNAs and enriched pathways by applying it to a real case study in which we compared schizophrenia patients who responded to medication with treatment-resistant schizophrenia patients to obtain a 16-miRNA treatment-resistant schizophrenia profile."
"37159365","Candidate biomarkers in psychiatric disorders: state of the field.","World Psychiatry","The field of psychiatry is hampered by a lack of robust, reliable and valid biomarkers that can aid in objectively diagnosing patients and providing individualized treatment recommendations. Here we review and critically evaluate the evidence for the most promising biomarkers in the psychiatric neuroscience literature for autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, anxiety disorders and post-traumatic stress disorder, major depression and bipolar disorder, and substance use disorders. Candidate biomarkers reviewed include various neuroimaging, genetic, molecular and peripheral assays, for the purposes of determining susceptibility or presence of illness, and predicting treatment response or safety. This review highlights a critical gap in the biomarker validation process. An enormous societal investment over the past 50 years has identified numerous candidate biomarkers. However, to date, the overwhelming majority of these measures have not been proven sufficiently reliable, valid and useful to be adopted clinically. It is time to consider whether strategic investments might break this impasse, focusing on a limited number of promising candidates to advance through a process of definitive testing for a specific indication. Some promising candidates for definitive testing include the N170 signal, an event-related brain potential measured using electroencephalography, for subgroup identification within autism spectrum disorder; striatal resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measures, such as the striatal connectivity index (SCI) and the functional striatal abnormalities (FSA) index, for prediction of treatment response in schizophrenia; error-related negativity (ERN), an electrophysiological index, for prediction of first onset of generalized anxiety disorder, and resting-state and structural brain connectomic measures for prediction of treatment response in social anxiety disorder. Alternate forms of classification may be useful for conceptualizing and testing potential biomarkers. Collaborative efforts allowing the inclusion of biosystems beyond genetics and neuroimaging are needed, and online remote acquisition of selected measures in a naturalistic setting using mobile health tools may significantly advance the field. Setting specific benchmarks for well-defined target application, along with development of appropriate funding and partnership mechanisms, would also be crucial. Finally, it should never be forgotten that, for a biomarker to be actionable, it will need to be clinically predictive at the individual level and viable in clinical settings.© 2023 World Psychiatric Association."
"37153459","The sex-dependent response to psychosocial stress and ischaemic heart disease.","Front Cardiovasc Med","Stress is an important risk factor for modern chronic diseases, with distinct influences in males and females. The sex specificity of the mammalian stress response contributes to the sex-dependent development and impacts of coronary artery disease (CAD). Compared to men, women appear to have greater susceptibility to chronic forms of psychosocial stress, extending beyond an increased incidence of mood disorders to include a 2- to 4-fold higher risk of stress-dependent myocardial infarction in women, and up to 10-fold higher risk of Takotsubo syndrome-a stress-dependent coronary-myocardial disorder most prevalent in post-menopausal women. Sex differences arise at all levels of the stress response: from initial perception of stress to behavioural, cognitive, and affective responses and longer-term disease outcomes. These fundamental differences involve interactions between chromosomal and gonadal determinants, (mal)adaptive epigenetic modulation across the lifespan (particularly in early life), and the extrinsic influences of socio-cultural, economic, and environmental factors. Pre-clinical investigations of biological mechanisms support distinct early life programming and a heightened corticolimbic-noradrenaline-neuroinflammatory reactivity in females vs. males, among implicated determinants of the chronic stress response. Unravelling the intrinsic molecular, cellular and systems biological basis of these differences, and their interactions with external lifestyle/socio-cultural determinants, can guide preventative and therapeutic strategies to better target coronary heart disease in a tailored sex-specific manner.© 2023 Helman, Headrick, Stapelberg and Braidy."
"37179258","Persistent accelerated epigenetic ageing in a longitudinal cohort of vertically infected HIV-positive adolescents.","J Neurovirol","We have previously shown accelerated ageing in adolescents perinatally infected with HIV (PHIV +), based on discrepancies between epigenetic and chronological age. The current study examines follow-up longitudinal patterns of epigenetic ageing and the association of epigenetic ageing with cognition as well as whole brain structure changes in PHIV + and healthy controls enrolled in the Cape Town Adolescent Antiretroviral Cohort Study (CTAAC). The Illumina EPIC array was used to generate blood DNA methylation data from 60 PHIV + adolescents and 36 age-matched controls aged 9-12 years old at baseline and again at a 36-month follow-up. Epigenetic clock software estimated two measures of epigenetic age acceleration: extrinsic epigenetic accelerated ageing (EEAA) and age acceleration difference (AAD) at both time points. At follow-up, each participant completed neuropsychological testing, structural magnetic resonance imaging, and diffusion tensor imaging. At follow-up, PHIV infection remains associated with increased EEAA and AAD. Accelerated epigenetic ageing remained positively associated with viral load and negatively associated with CD4 ratio. EEAA was positively associated with whole brain grey matter volume and alterations in whole brain white matter integrity. AAD and EEAA were not associated with cognitive function within the PHIV + group. Measures of epigenetic ageing, as detected in DNA methylation patterns, remain increased in PHIV + adolescents across a 36-month period. Associations between epigenetic ageing measures, viral biomarkers, and alterations in brain micro- and macrostructure also persist at 36-month follow-up. Further study should determine if epigenetic age acceleration is associated with cognitive functional changes due to brain alterations in later life.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Biological age is a risk factor for many chronic diseases independent of chronological age. A good lifestyle is known to improve overall health, but its association with biological age is unclear.This study included participants from the UK Biobank who had undergone 12-lead resting electrocardiography (ECG). Biological age was estimated by a deep learning model (defined as ECG-age), and the difference between ECG-age and chronological age was defined as Δage. Participants were further categorized into an ideal (score 4), intermediate (scores 2 and 3) or unfavorable lifestyle (score 0 or 1). Four lifestyle factors were investigated, including diet, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and smoking. Linear regression models were used to examine the association between lifestyle factors and Δage, and the models were adjusted for sex and chronological age.This study included 44,094 individuals (mean age 64 ± 8, 51.4% females). A significant correlation was observed between predicted biological age and chronological age (correlation coefficient = 0.54,P < 0.001) and the mean Δage (absolute error of biological age and chronological age) was 9.8 ± 7.4 years. Δage was significantly associated with all of the four lifestyle factors, with the effect size ranging from 0.41 ± 0.11 for the healthy diet to 2.37 ± 0.30 for non-smoking. Compared with an ideal lifestyle, an unfavorable lifestyle was associated with an average of 2.50 ± 0.29 years of older predicted ECG-age.In this large contemporary population, a strong association was observed between all four studied healthy lifestyle factors and deaccelerated aging.

"37186582","Multi-omic modeling of antidepressant response implicates dynamic immune and inflammatory changes in individuals who respond to treatment.","PLoS One","Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of disability worldwide, and is commonly treated with antidepressant drugs (AD). Although effective, many patients fail to respond to AD treatment, and accordingly identifying factors that can predict AD response would greatly improve treatment outcomes. In this study, we developed a machine learning tool to integrate multi-omic datasets (gene expression, DNA methylation, and genotyping) to identify biomarker profiles associated with AD response in a cohort of individuals with MDD.Individuals with MDD (N = 111) were treated for 8 weeks with antidepressants and were separated into responders and non-responders based on the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Using peripheral blood samples, we performed RNA-sequencing, assessed DNA methylation using the Illumina EPIC array, and performed genotyping using the Illumina PsychArray. To address this rich multi-omic dataset with high dimensional features, we developed integrative Geneset-Embedded non-negative Matrix factorization (iGEM), a non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) based model, supplemented with auxiliary information regarding gene sets and gene-methylation relationships. In particular, we factorize the subjects by features (i.e., gene expression or DNA methylation) into subjects-by-factors and factors-by-features. We define the factors as the meta-phenotypes as they represent integrated composite scores of the molecular measurements for each subject.Using our model, we identified a number of meta-phenotypes which were related to AD response. By integrating geneset information into the model, we were able to relate these meta-phenotypes to biological processes, including a meta-phenotype related to immune and inflammatory functions as well as other genes related to depression or AD response. The meta-phenotype identified several genes including immune interleukin 1 receptor like 1 (IL1RL1) and interleukin 5 receptor (IL5) subunit alpha (IL5RA), AKT/PIK3 pathway related phosphoinositide-3-kinase regulatory subunit 6 (PIK3R6), and sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase 3 (SMPD3), which has been identified as a target of AD treatment.The derived meta-phenotypes and associated biological functions represent both biomarkers to predict response, as well as potential new treatment targets.

Here we propose a Bayesian model for fine-mapping that has several advantages over existing methods, including flexible specification of the prior distribution of effect sizes, joint modeling of summary statistics and functional annotations and accounting for discrepancies between summary statistics and external linkage disequilibrium in meta-analyses. Using simulations, we compare performance with commonly used fine-mapping methods and show that the proposed model has higher power and lower false discovery rate (FDR) when including functional annotations, and higher power, lower FDR and higher coverage for credible sets in meta-analyses. We further illustrate our approach by applying it to a meta-analysis of Alzheimer's disease genome-wide association studies where we prioritize putatively causal variants and genes.© 2023.

Here we examined the associations of polygenic scores for carbohydrate, fat, and protein preference with 12 months' workplace food purchases among 397 hospital employees from the ChooseWell 365 study. Food purchases were obtained retrospectively from the hospital's cafeteria sales data for the 12 months before participants were enrolled in the ChooseWell 365 study. Traffic light labels, visible to employees when making purchases, measured the quality of workplace purchases. During the 12-month study period, there were 215,692 cafeteria purchases. Each SD increase in the polygenic score for carbohydrate preference was associated with 2.3 additional purchases/month (95%CI, 0.2 to 4.3; p = 0.03) and a higher number of green-labeled purchases (β = 1.9, 95%CI, 0.5-3.3; p = 0.01). These associations were consistent in subgroup and sensitivity analyses accounting for additional sources of bias. There was no evidence of associations between fat and protein polygenic scores and cafeteria purchases. Findings from this study suggest that genetic differences in carbohydrate preference could influence long-term workplace food purchases and may inform follow-up experiments to enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying food choice behavior.© 2023.

"37198172","Higher-order epistasis shapes natural variation in germ stem cell niche activity.","Nat Commun","To study how natural allelic variation explains quantitative developmental system variation, we characterized natural differences in germ stem cell niche activity, measured as progenitor zone (PZ) size, between two Caenorhabditis elegans isolates. Linkage mapping yielded candidate loci on chromosomes II and V, and we found that the isolate with a smaller PZ size harbours a 148 bp promoter deletion in the Notch ligand, lag-2/Delta, a central signal promoting germ stem cell fate. As predicted, introducing this deletion into the isolate with a large PZ resulted in a smaller PZ size. Unexpectedly, restoring the deleted ancestral sequence in the isolate with a smaller PZ did not increase-but instead further reduced-PZ size. These seemingly contradictory phenotypic effects are explained by epistatic interactions between the lag-2/Delta promoter, the chromosome II locus, and additional background loci. These results provide first insights into the quantitative genetic architecture regulating an animal stem cell system.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Additionally, rare damaging variants in cilia-related outer dynein arm heavy chain (ODNAH) genes (DNAH5,DNAH8,DNAH9,DNAH11, andDNAH17) (p = 8.5 × 10-47) were significantly enriched in hypospadias cases.

"37156924","Darwin's agential materials: evolutionary implications of multiscale competency in developmental biology.","Cell Mol Life Sci","A critical aspect of evolution is the layer of developmental physiology that operates between the genotype and the anatomical phenotype. While much work has addressed the evolution of developmental mechanisms and the evolvability of specific genetic architectures with emergent complexity, one aspect has not been sufficiently explored: the implications of morphogenetic problem-solving competencies for the evolutionary process itself. The cells that evolution works with are not passive components: rather, they have numerous capabilities for behavior because they derive from ancestral unicellular organisms with rich repertoires. In multicellular organisms, these capabilities must be tamed, and can be exploited, by the evolutionary process. Specifically, biological structures have a multiscale competency architecture where cells, tissues, and organs exhibit regulative plasticity-the ability to adjust to perturbations such as external injury or internal modifications and still accomplish specific adaptive tasks across metabolic, transcriptional, physiological, and anatomical problem spaces. Here, I review examples illustrating how physiological circuits guiding cellular collective behavior impart computational properties to the agential material that serves as substrate for the evolutionary process. I then explore the ways in which the collective intelligence of cells during morphogenesis affect evolution, providing a new perspective on the evolutionary search process. This key feature of the physiological software of life helps explain the remarkable speed and robustness of biological evolution, and sheds new light on the relationship between genomes and functional anatomical phenotypes.© 2023.

We develop a method for the quantile normalization of ATAC-seq fragments and test for differences in coverage among genotypes, tissues, and their interaction at 44099 peaks throughout the euchromatic genome. For the strains with reference quality genome assemblies, we correct ATAC-seq profiles for read mis-mapping due to nearby polymorphic structural variants (SVs). Comparing coverage among genotypes without accounting for SVs results in a highly elevated rate (55%) of identifying false positive differences in chromatin state between genotypes. After SV correction, we identify 1050, 30383, and 4508 regions whose peak heights are polymorphic among genotypes, among tissues, or exhibit genotype-by-tissue interactions, respectively. Finally, we identify 3988 candidate causative variants that explain at least 80% of the variance in chromatin state at nearby ATAC-seq peaks.Copyright: © 2023 Huynh et al.

"37142572","Identification of schizophrenia symptom-related gene modules by postmortem brain transcriptome analysis.","Transl Psychiatry","Schizophrenia is a multifactorial disorder, the genetic architecture of which remains unclear. Although many studies have examined the etiology of schizophrenia, the gene sets that contribute to its symptoms have not been fully investigated. In this study, we aimed to identify each gene set associated with corresponding symptoms of schizophrenia using the postmortem brains of 26 patients with schizophrenia and 51 controls. We classified genes expressed in the prefrontal cortex (analyzed by RNA-seq) into several modules by weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and examined the correlation between module expression and clinical characteristics. In addition, we calculated the polygenic risk score (PRS) for schizophrenia from Japanese genome-wide association studies, and investigated the association between the identified gene modules and PRS to evaluate whether genetic background affected gene expression. Finally, we conducted pathway analysis and upstream analysis using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis to clarify the functions and upstream regulators of symptom-related gene modules. As a result, three gene modules generated by WGCNA were significantly correlated with clinical characteristics, and one of these showed a significant association with PRS. Genes belonging to the transcriptional module associated with PRS significantly overlapped with signaling pathways of multiple sclerosis, neuroinflammation, and opioid use, suggesting that these pathways may also be profoundly implicated in schizophrenia. Upstream analysis indicated that genes in the detected module were profoundly regulated by lipopolysaccharides and CREB. This study identified schizophrenia symptom-related gene sets and their upstream regulators, revealing aspects of the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and identifying potential therapeutic targets.© 2023.

"37133683","Clinical utility of polygenic risk scores: a critical 2023 appraisal.","J Community Genet","Since their first appearance in the context of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in 2009, polygenic risk scores (PRSs) have been described for a large number of common complex diseases. However, the clinical utility of PRSs in disease risk assessment or therapeutic decision making is likely limited because PRSs usually only account for the heritable component of a trait and ignore the etiological role of environment and lifestyle. We surveyed the current state of PRSs for various diseases, including breast cancer, diabetes, prostate cancer, coronary artery disease, and Parkinson disease, with an extra focus upon the potential improvement of clinical scores by their combination with PRSs. We observed that the diagnostic and prognostic performance of PRSs alone is consistently low, as expected. Moreover, combining a PRS with a clinical score at best led to moderate improvement of the power of either risk marker. Despite the large number of PRSs reported in the scientific literature, prospective studies of their clinical utility, particularly of the PRS-associated improvement of standard screening or therapeutic procedures, are still rare. In conclusion, the benefit to individual patients or the health care system in general of PRS-based extensions of existing diagnostic or treatment regimens is still difficult to judge.© 2023.

"37185958","A systematic review of neuroimaging epigenetic research: calling for an increased focus on development.","Mol Psychiatry","Epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation (DNAm), have gained increasing attention as potential biomarkers and mechanisms underlying risk for neurodevelopmental, psychiatric and other brain-based disorders. Yet, surprisingly little is known about the extent to which DNAm is linked to individual differences in the brain itself, and how these associations may unfold across development - a time of life when many of these disorders emerge. Here, we systematically review evidence from the nascent field of Neuroimaging Epigenetics, combining structural or functional neuroimaging measures with DNAm, and the extent to which the developmental period (birth to adolescence) is represented in these studies. We identified 111 articles published between 2011-2021, out of which only a minority (21%) included samples under 18 years of age. Most studies were cross-sectional (85%), employed a candidate-gene approach (67%), and examined DNAm-brain associations in the context of health and behavioral outcomes (75%). Nearly half incorporated genetic data, and a fourth investigated environmental influences. Overall, studies support a link between peripheral DNAm and brain imaging measures, but there is little consistency in specific findings and it remains unclear whether DNAm markers present a cause, correlate or consequence of brain alterations. Overall, there is large heterogeneity in sample characteristics, peripheral tissue and brain outcome examined as well as the methods used. Sample sizes were generally low to moderate (median nall = 98, ndevelopmental = 80), and attempts at replication or meta-analysis were rare. Based on the strengths and weaknesses of existing studies, we propose three recommendations on how advance the field of Neuroimaging Epigenetics. We advocate for: (1) a greater focus on developmentally oriented research (i.e. pre-birth to adolescence); (2) the analysis of large, prospective, pediatric cohorts with repeated measures of DNAm and imaging to assess directionality; and (3) collaborative, interdisciplinary science to identify robust signals, triangulate findings and enhance translational potential.© 2023.

Here, we investigated whether prenatal exposure to citalopram or escitalopram ((es)citalopram) and maternal depression is associated with differences in DNAm. Then, we examined if there is an interaction effect of (es)citalopram exposure and DNAm on offspring neurodevelopmental outcomes. Finally, we investigated whether DNAm at birth correlates with neurodevelopmental trajectories in childhood. We analyzed DNAm in cord blood from the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) biobank. MoBa contains questionnaire data on maternal (es)citalopram use and depression during pregnancy and information about child neurodevelopmental outcomes assessed by internationally recognized psychometric tests. In addition, we retrieved ADHD diagnoses from the Norwegian Patient Registry and information on pregnancies from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway. In total, 958 newborn cord blood samples were divided into three groups: (1) prenatal (es)citalopram exposed (n = 306), (2) prenatal maternal depression exposed (n = 308), and (3) propensity score-selected controls (n = 344). Among children exposed to (es)citalopram, there were more ADHD diagnoses and symptoms and delayed communication and psychomotor development. We did not identify differential DNAm associated with (es)citalopram or depression, nor any interaction effects on neurodevelopmental outcomes throughout childhood. Trajectory modeling identified subgroups of children following similar developmental patterns. Some of these subgroups were enriched for children exposed to maternal depression, and some subgroups were associated with differences in DNAm at birth. Interestingly, several of the differentially methylated genes are involved in neuronal processes and development. These results suggest DNAm as a potential predictive molecular marker of later abnormal neurodevelopmental outcomes, but we cannot conclude whether DNAm links prenatal (es)citalopram exposure or maternal depression with child neurodevelopmental outcomes.© 2023.

Therefore, the utilization of gynoecy is beneficial for the genetic breeding of chieh-qua. However, little knowledge of gynoecious-related genes in chieh-qua has been reported until now. Here, we used an F2population from the cross between the gynoecious line 'A36' and the monoecious line 'SX' for genetic mapping and revealed that chieh-qua gynoecy was regulated by a single recessive gene. We fine-mapped it into a 530-kb region flanked by the markers Indel-3 and KASP145 on Chr.8, which harbors eight candidate genes. One of the candidate genes,Bhi08G000345, encoding networked protein 4 (CqNET4), contained a non-synonymous SNP resulting in the amino acid substitution of isoleucine (ATA; I) to methionine (ATG; M).CqNET4was prominently expressed in the female flower, and only three genes related to ethylene synthesis were significantly expressed between 'A36' and 'SX.' The results presented here provide support for theCqNET4as the most likely candidate gene for chieh-qua gynoecy, which differed from the reported gynoecious genes.Copyright © 2023 Wang, Yang, Liu, Cao, Chen, Liu, Xie, Yan, Jiang and Peng."
"37206627","On the prediction of non-CG DNA methylation using machine learning.","NAR Genom Bioinform","DNA methylation can be detected and measured using sequencing instruments after sodium bisulfite conversion, but experiments can be expensive for large eukaryotic genomes. Sequencing nonuniformity and mapping biases can leave parts of the genome with low or no coverage, thus hampering the ability of obtaining DNA methylation levels for all cytosines. To address these limitations, several computational methods have been proposed that can predict DNA methylation from the DNA sequence around the cytosine or from the methylation level of nearby cytosines. However, most of these methods are entirely focused on CG methylation in humans and other mammals. In this work, we study, for the first time, the problem of predicting cytosine methylation for CG, CHG and CHH contexts on six plant species, either from the DNA primary sequence around the cytosine or from the methylation levels of neighboring cytosines. In this framework, we also study the cross-species prediction problem and the cross-context prediction problem (within the same species). Finally, we show that providing gene and repeat annotations allows existing classifiers to significantly improve their prediction accuracy. We introduce a new classifier called AMPS (annotation-based methylation prediction from sequence) that takes advantage of genomic annotations to achieve higher accuracy.© The Author(s) 2023.

"37189439","Multiomics Analysis Reveals Novel Genetic Determinants for Lens Differentiation, Structure, and Transparency.","Biomolecules","Recent advances in next-generation sequencing and data analysis have provided new gateways for identification of novel genome-wide genetic determinants governing tissue development and disease. These advances have revolutionized our understanding of cellular differentiation, homeostasis, and specialized function in multiple tissues. Bioinformatic and functional analysis of these genetic determinants and the pathways they regulate have provided a novel basis for the design of functional experiments to answer a wide range of long-sought biological questions. A well-characterized model for the application of these emerging technologies is the development and differentiation of the ocular lens and how individual pathways regulate lens morphogenesis, gene expression, transparency, and refraction. Recent applications of next-generation sequencing analysis on well-characterized chicken and mouse lens differentiation models using a variety of omics techniques including RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS), chip-seq, and CUT&RUN have revealed a wide range of essential biological pathways and chromatin features governing lens structure and function. Multiomics integration of these data has established new gene functions and cellular processes essential for lens formation, homeostasis, and transparency including the identification of novel transcription control pathways, autophagy remodeling pathways, and signal transduction pathways, among others. This review summarizes recent omics technologies applied to the lens, methods for integrating multiomics data, and how these recent technologies have advanced our understanding ocular biology and function. The approach and analysis are relevant to identifying the features and functional requirements of more complex tissues and disease states."

"37066210","A zinc finger transcription factor tunes social behaviors by controlling transposable elements and immune response in prefrontal cortex.","bioRxiv","The neurobiological origins of social behaviors are incompletely understood. Here we utilized synthetic biology approaches to reprogram the function of ZFP189, a transcription factor whose expression and function in the rodent prefrontal cortex was previously determined to be protective against stress-induced social deficits. We created novel synthetic ZFP189 transcription factors including ZFP189VPR, which activates the transcription of target genes and therefore exerts opposite functional control from the endogenous, transcriptionally repressive ZFP189WT. Upon viral delivery of these synthetic ZFP189 transcription factors to mouse prefrontal cortex, we observe that ZFP189-mediated transcriptional control promotes mature dendritic spine morphology on transduced pyramidal neurons. Interestingly, dysregulation of ZFP189-mediated transcription in this brain area, achieved by delivery of synthetic ZFP189VPR, precipitates social behavioral deficits in terms of social interaction, motivation, and the cognition necessary for the maintenance of social hierarchy, without other observable behavioral deficits. By performing RNA sequencing in virally manipulated prefrontal cortex tissues, we discover that ZFP189 transcription factors of opposing regulatory function have opposite influence on the expression of genetic transposable elements as well as genes that participate in immune functions. Collectively, this work reveals that ZFP189 function in the prefrontal cortex coordinates structural and transcriptional neuroadaptations necessary for social behaviors by binding transposable element-rich regions of DNA to regulate immune-related genes. Given the evidence for a co-evolution of social behavior and the brain immune response, we posit that ZFP189 may have evolved to augment brain transposon-associated immune function as a way of enhancing an animalâ€™s capacity for functioning in social groups."

The variables of interest, the calculated NLR and PLR and others (demographics, injury, lifestyles and comorbidities) were extracted from the medical records. Two independent multivariate logistics regression models were used to detect the relationship between NLR or PLR and DVT. If any, combination diagnostic model was constructed and its diagnostic ability was evaluated.There were 1103 patients included, and 92 (8.3%) were found to have preoperative DVT. The NLR and PLR, which had respective optimal cut-off point of 4 and 200, were significantly different between patients with and without DVT either in continuous or categorical variable. After adjustment for covariates, both NLR and PLR were identified as independent risk factors associated with DVT, with odd ratio of 2.16 and 2.84, respectively. The combination diagnostic model, including NLR, PLR and D-dimer, demonstrated to significantly improved the diagnostic performance than any one alone or combined (all P < 0.05), and the area under the curve was 0.729 (95% CI 0.701-0.755).We concluded the relatively low incidence rate of preoperative DVT after ankle fracture, and both NLR and PLR were independently associated with DVT. The combination diagnostic model can be considered as a useful auxiliary tool for identifying high-risk patients for DUS examination.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Sepsis prevalence is increased in developing countries and requires prompt diagnosis and treatment. Reports, although controversial, suggest that full blood count parameters and cell ratios could assist in the early screening for sepsis.The study evaluated the use of haematological cell ratios in screening for sepsis in a South African population.The study retrospectively analysed the complete blood counts, blood cultures (BC) and biochemical test results of 125 adult patients who presented between January 2021 and July 2021 at a hospital in Cape Town. An ISO15189-accredited laboratory performed all of the tests. We compared and correlated the automated differential counts, neutrophil, monocyte and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratios with procalcitonin levels. Ap-value of < 0.05 was considered significant.Sixty-two sepsis patients (procalcitonin > 2 ng/L and positive BC) were identified and compared to 63 non-sepsis controls. All cell ratios were significantly elevated in sepsis patients (p< 0.001). However, the two groups had no significant difference in absolute monocyte counts (p= 0.377). In addition, no correlation was detected between any cell ratios and procalcitonin.In combination with complete blood count parameters, haematology cell ratios can be used for early sepsis detection. The full blood count is widely available, inexpensive, and routinely requested by emergency care clinicians. Although procalcitonin and BC remain the gold standard, the calculation of cell ratios could provide a simple screening tool for the early detection of sepsis.This study adds evidence to the proposal that calculating haematological cell ratios assists in the early screening of sepsis in a South African setting.© 2023.

However, the regulatory architecture in alternative and reference promoters, and how they differ, remains elusive. In 100 CAGE-seq libraries from hepatocellular carcinoma patients, here we annotate 4083 alternative promoters in 2926 multi-promoter genes, which are largely undetected in normal livers. These genes are enriched in oncogenic processes and predominantly show association with overall survival. Alternative promoters are narrow nucleosome depleted regions, CpG island depleted, and enriched for tissue-specific transcription factors. Globally tumors lose DNA methylation. We show hierarchical retention of intragenic DNA methylation with CG-poor regions rapidly losing methylation, while CG-rich regions retain it, a process mediated by differential SETD2, H3K36me3, DNMT3B, and TET1 binding. This mechanism is validated in SETD2 knockdown cells and SETD2-mutated patients. Selective DNA methylation loss in CG-poor regions makes the chromatin accessible for alternative transcription. We show alternative promoters can control tumor transcriptomes and their regulatory architecture.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37202378","Child and adolescent obesity.","Nat Rev Dis Primers","The prevalence of child and adolescent obesity has plateaued at high levels in most high-income countries and is increasing in many low-income and middle-income countries. Obesity arises when a mix of genetic and epigenetic factors, behavioural risk patterns and broader environmental and sociocultural influences affect the two body weight regulation systems: energy homeostasis, including leptin and gastrointestinal tract signals, operating predominantly at an unconscious level, and cognitive-emotional control that is regulated by higher brain centres, operating at a conscious level. Health-related quality of life is reduced in those with obesity. Comorbidities of obesity, including type 2 diabetes mellitus, fatty liver disease and depression, are more likely in adolescents and in those with severe obesity. Treatment incorporates a respectful, stigma-free and family-based approach involving multiple components, and addresses dietary, physical activity, sedentary and sleep behaviours. In adolescents in particular, adjunctive therapies can be valuable, such as more intensive dietary therapies, pharmacotherapy and bariatric surgery. Prevention of obesity requires a whole-system approach and joined-up policy initiatives across government departments. Development and implementation of interventions to prevent paediatric obesity in children should focus on interventions that are feasible, effective and likely to reduce gaps in health inequalities.© 2023.

Chronic low-grade inflammation of adipose tissue is associated with obesity and obesity-related complications.This study intends to establish a nomogram based on inflammatory response-related methylation sites in intraoperative visceral adipose tissue (VAT) to predict excess weight loss (EWL)% at one-year after LSG.Based on EWL% at one-year after LSG, patients were divided into two groups: the satisfied group (group-A, EWL%≥50%) and the unsatisfied group (group-B, EWL%<50%). Next, we defined genes corresponding to the methylation sites in the 850 K methylation microarray as methylation-related genes (MRGs). We then took the intersection of MRGs and inflammatory response-related genes. After that, inflammatory response-related methylation sites were identified based on overlapping genes. Moreover, difference analysis was carried out to obtain inflammatory response-related differentially methylated sites (IRRDMSs) between group-A and group-B. LASSO analysis was used to identify the hub methylation sites. Finally, we developed a nomogram based on the hub methylation sites.There were 26 patients in the study, with 13 in group-A and 13 in group-B. After data filtering and difference analysis, 200 IRRDMSs were identified (143 hypermethylated sites and 57 hypomethylated sites). Then, we identified three hub methylation sites (cg03610073, cg03208951, and cg18746357) by LASSO analysis and built a predictive nomogram (Area under the curve=0.953).The predictive nomogram based on three inflammatory-related methylation sites (cg03610073, cg03208951, and cg18746357) in intraoperative visceral adipose tissue can predict one-year EWL% after LSG effectively.© 2023 Chen et al."

However, the ways in which parents impact each other in the context of caregiving is comparatively less understood, but can account for much of the variation observed in the postnatal environment. Prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster) demonstrate a range of postnatal social groups, including pups raised by biparental pairs and by their mothers alone. In addition to the challenges of providing parental care, prairie vole parents often experience acute natural stressors (e.g., predation, foraging demands, and thermoregulation) that could alter the way co-parents interact.We investigated how variation in the experience of raising offspring impacts parental behavior and neurobiology by administering an acute handling stressor on prairie vole families of single mothers and biparental parents over the course of offspring postnatal development.Mothers and fathers exhibited robust behavioral plasticity in response to the age of their pups, but in sex-dependent ways. Pup-directed care from mothers did not vary as a function of their partner's presence, but did covary with the number of hypothalamic vasopressin neurons in experience-dependent ways. The relationship between vasopressin neuron numbers and fathers' behaviors was also contingent upon the stress handling manipulation, suggesting that brain-behavior associations exhibit stress-induced plasticity.These results demonstrate that the behavioral and neuroendocrine profiles of adults are sensitive to distinct and interacting experiences as a parent, and extend our knowledge of the neural mechanisms that may facilitate parental behavioral plasticity.Copyright © 2023 Hiura, Lazaro and Ophir."
"37207134","ALKBH4 Stabilization Is Required for Arsenic-Induced 6mA DNA Methylation Inhibition, Keratinocyte Malignant Transformation, and Tumorigenicity.","Water (Basel)","Inorganic arsenic is one of the well-known human skin carcinogens. However, the molecular mechanism by which arsenic promotes carcinogenesis remains unclear. Previous studies have established that epigenetic changes, including changes in DNA methylation, are among the critical mechanisms that drive carcinogenesis.N6-methyladenine (6mA) methylation on DNA is a widespread epigenetic modification that was initially found on bacterial and phage DNA. Only recently has 6mA been identified in mammalian genomes. However, the function of 6mA in gene expression and cancer development is not well understood. Here, we show that chronic low doses of arsenic induce malignant transformation and tumorigenesis in keratinocytes and lead to the upregulation of ALKBH4 and downregulation of 6mA on DNA. We found that reduced 6mA levels in response to low levels of arsenic were mediated by the upregulation of the 6mA DNA demethylase ALKBH4. Moreover, we found that arsenic increased ALKBH4 protein levels and that ALKBH4 deletion impaired arsenic-induced tumorigenicityin vitroand in mice. Mechanistically, we found that arsenic promoted ALKBH4 protein stability through reduced autophagy. Together, our findings reveal that the DNA 6mA demethylaseALKBH4 promotes arsenic tumorigenicity and establishes ALKBH4 as a promising target for arsenic-induced tumorigenesis."
"37192968","Toward a systems-level probing of tumor clonality.","iScience","Cancer has been described as a genetic disease that clonally evolves in the face of selective pressures imposed by cell-intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Although classical models based on genetic data predominantly propose Darwinian mechanisms of cancer evolution, recent single-cell profiling of cancers has described unprecedented heterogeneity in tumors providing support for alternative models of branched and neutral evolution through both genetic and non-genetic mechanisms. Emerging evidence points to a complex interplay between genetic, non-genetic, and extrinsic environmental factors in shaping the evolution of tumors. In this perspective, we briefly discuss the role of cell-intrinsic and extrinsic factors that shape clonal behaviors during tumor progression, metastasis, and drug resistance. Taking examples of pre-malignant states associated with hematological malignancies and esophageal cancer, we discuss recent paradigms of tumor evolution and prospective approaches to further enhance our understanding of this spatiotemporally regulated process.© 2023 The Authors."

Studies were categorized into three subgroups: term low birth weight (TLBW) among full-term births and all births (regardless of gestational age) and low birth weight (LBW) among all births, based on the search results of MEDLINE and the Web of Science from the inception of the database to April 2022. Subgroup analyses were conducted based on the economic status, region, exposure assessment, risk of bias, and adjustment. Sixty-one studies involving 34,506,975 singleton live births in 15 countries were analyzed. Overall, the risk of bias for most studies (75%) was low. In 39 of 47 term birth studies, the pooled odds ratio of TLBW among term births for per interquartile range (IQR) increases throughout the entire pregnancy was 1.02 (1.01 to 1.03) for PM2.5and 1.03 (1.01 to 1.05) for PM10after adjustment for covariates. No significant relevance was detected across each trimester period for PM2.5. A stronger effect was observed during the second trimester (1.03, 1.01 to 1.06) for PM10. There was no increased risk of TLBW in all births associated with IQR increases in PM2.5and PM10. LBW was associated with PM2.5exposure in 4 of 7 studies, but statistical heterogeneity was considerable. In the TLBW subgroup analysis, the effects of PM2.5and PM10were both greater in studies conducted in advanced countries, studies with low bias, and studies that adjusted for maternal age, infant sex, and parity. Stronger effects were present for PM2.5exposure collected from monitoring stations and PM10exposure interpolated from the inverse distance weighting model. TLBW may be associated with prenatal exposure to particulate matter, but no critical windows were identified. Stronger associations were observed in advanced countries.

"37126061","Considerations toward an epigenetic and common pathways theory of mental disorder.","J Psychopathol Clin Sci","Psychopathology emerges from the dynamic interplay of physiological and mental processes and ecological context. It can be seen as a failure of recursive, homeostatic processes to achieve adaptive re-equilibrium. This general statement can be actualized with consideration of polygenic liability, early exposures, and multiunit (multi-""level"") analysis of the psychological action and the associated physiological and neural operations, all in the context of the developmental exposome. This article begins by identifying key principles and clarifying key terms necessary to mental disorder theory. It then ventures a sketch of a model that highlights epigenetic dynamics and proposes a common pathways hypothesis toward psychopathology. An epigenetic perspective elevates the importance of developmental context and adaptive systems, particularly in early life, while opening the door to new mechanistic discovery. The key proposal is that a finite number of homeostatic biological and psychological mechanisms are shared across most risky environments (and possibly many genetic liabilities) for psychopathology. Perturbation of these mediating mechanisms leads to development of psychopathology. A focus on dynamic changes in these homeostatic mechanisms across multiple units of analysis and time points can render the problem of explaining psychopathology tractable. Key questions include the mapping of recursive processes over time, at adequate density, as mental disorders unfold across development. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)."

In the germline, transposon activity is antagonized by the PIWI-interacting RNA pathway tasked with repression of transposon transcription and degrading transcripts that have already been produced. However, most of the genes required for transposon control are not expressed outside the germline, prompting the question: what causes deleterious transposons activity in the soma and how is it managed? Here, we show that disruptions of the Histone 3 lysine 36 methylation machinery led to increased transposon transcription inDrosophila melanogasterbrains and that there is division of labour for the repression of transposable elements between the different methyltransferases Set2, NSD, and Ash1. Furthermore, we show that disruption of methylation leads to somatic activation of key genes in the PIWI-interacting RNA pathway and the preferential production of RNA from dual-strand piRNA clusters.© 2023 Lindehell et al."
"37018873","Sex and gender perspectives in colorectal cancer.","ESMO Open","Historically women were frequently excluded from clinical trials and drug usage to protect unborn babies from potential harm. As a consequence, the impact of sex and gender on both tumour biology and clinical outcomes has been largely underestimated. Although interrelated and often used interchangeably, sex and gender are not equivalent concepts. Sex is a biological attribute that defines species according to their chromosomal makeup and reproductive organ, while gender refers to a chosen sexual identity. Sex dimorphisms are rarely taken into account, in either preclinical or clinical research, with inadequate analysis of differences in outcomes according to sex or gender still widespread, reflecting a gap in our knowledge for a large proportion of the target population. Underestimation of sex-based differences in study design and analyses has invariably led to 'one-drug' treatment regimens for both males and females. For patients with colorectal cancer (CRC), sex also has an impact on the disease incidence, clinicopathological features, therapeutic outcomes, and tolerability to anticancer treatments. Although the global incidence of CRC is higher in male subjects, the proportion of patients presenting right-sided tumours and BRAF mutations is higher among females. Concerning sex-related differences in treatment efficacy and toxicity, drug dosage does not take into account sex-specific differences in pharmacokinetics. Toxicity associated with fluoropyrimidines, targeted therapies, and immunotherapies has been reported to be more extensive for females with CRC than for males, although evidence about differences in efficacy is more controversial. This article aims to provide an overview of the research achieved so far into sex and gender differences in cancer and summarize the growing body of literature illustrating the sex and gender perspective in CRC and their impact in relation to tumour biology and treatment efficacy and toxicity. We propose endorsing research on how biological sex and gender influence CRC as an added value for precision oncology.Copyright © 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.. All rights reserved."

The lead compound broadly improves survival and function of human ALS motor neurons. Mechanistically, it works as an inhibitor of MAP4Ks, regulates the MAP4Ks-HDAC6-TUBA4A-RANGAP1 pathway, and normalizes subcellular distribution of RANGAP1 and TDP-43. Finally, in an ALS mouse model we show that inhibiting MAP4Ks preserves motor neurons and extends animal lifespan."

Through switching the corresponding histone modifications, the level of transcription and diverse downstream biological processes can be regulated. Although animal systems are widely used in studying histone modifications, the signalling processes that occur outside the nucleus prior to histone modifications have not been well understood due to the limitations including non viable mutants, partial lethality, and infertility of survivors. Here, we review the benefits of usingArabidopsis thalianaas the model organism to study histone modifications and their upstream regulations. Similarities among histones and key histone modifiers such as the Polycomb group (PcG) and Trithorax group (TrxG) inDrosophila,Human, and Arabidopsis are examined. Furthermore, prolonged cold-induced vernalization system has been well-studied and revealed the relationship between the controllable environment input (duration of vernalization), its chromatin modifications ofFLOWERING LOCUS C(FLC), following gene expression, and the corresponding phenotypes. Such evidence suggests that research on Arabidopsis can bring insights into incomplete signalling pathways outside of the histone box, which can be achieved through viable reverse genetic screenings based on the phenotypes instead of direct monitoring of histone modifications among individual mutants. The potential upstream regulators in Arabidopsis can provide cues or directions for animal research based on the similarities between them."

One way to understand the health effects of PM2.5 is by examining its impact on performed hospital procedures, particularly among those with existing chronic disease. However, such studies are rare. Here, we investigated the associations between annual average PM2.5 and hospital procedures among individuals with heart failure.Using electronic health records from the University of North Carolina Healthcare System, we created a retrospective cohort of 15,979 heart failure patients who had at least one of 53 common (frequency > 10%) procedures. We used daily modeled PM2.5 at 1x1 km resolution to estimate the annual average PM2.5 at the time of heart failure diagnosis. We used quasi-Poisson models to estimate associations between PM2.5 and the number of performed hospital procedures over the follow-up period (12/31/2016 or date of death) while adjusting for age at heart failure diagnosis, race, sex, year of visit, and socioeconomic status.A 1 μg/m3 increase in annual average PM2.5 was associated with increased glycosylated hemoglobin tests (10.8%; 95% confidence interval = 6.56%, 15.1%), prothrombin time tests (15.8%; 95% confidence interval = 9.07%, 22.9%), and stress tests (6.84%; 95% confidence interval = 3.65%, 10.1%). Results were stable under multiple sensitivity analyses.These results suggest that long-term PM2.5 exposure is associated with an increased need for diagnostic testing on heart failure patients. Overall, these associations give a unique lens into patient morbidity and potential drivers of healthcare costs linked to PM2.5 exposure.Copyright: This is an open access article, free of all copyright, and may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, modified, built upon, or otherwise used by anyone for any lawful purpose.

However, the mutational landscape induced by retrotransposition of long interspersed nuclear element-1 (L1), a widespread mobile element in the human genome12-14, is poorly understood in normal cells. Here we explored the whole-genome sequences of 899 single-cell clones established from three different cell types collected from 28 individuals. We identified 1,708 somatic L1 retrotransposition events that were enriched in colorectal epithelium and showed a positive relationship with age. Fingerprinting of source elements showed 34 retrotransposition-competent L1s. Multidimensional analysis demonstrated that (1) somatic L1 retrotranspositions occur from early embryogenesis at a substantial rate, (2) epigenetic on/off of a source element is preferentially determined in the early organogenesis stage, (3) retrotransposition-competent L1s with a lower population allele frequency have higher retrotransposition activity and (4) only a small fraction of L1 transcripts in the cytoplasm are finally retrotransposed in somatic cells. Analysis of matched cancers further suggested that somatic L1 retrotransposition rate is substantially increased during colorectal tumourigenesis. In summary, this study illustrates L1 retrotransposition-induced somatic mosaicism in normal cells and provides insights into the genomic and epigenomic regulation of transposable elements over the human lifetime.© 2023.

Here we characterize the genomic differences between early-stage untreated primary tumours and late-stage treated metastatic tumours using a harmonized pan-cancer analysis (or reanalysis) of two unpaired primary4and metastatic5cohorts of 7,108 whole-genome-sequenced tumours. Metastatic tumours in general have a lower intratumour heterogeneity and a conserved karyotype, displaying only a modest increase in mutations, although frequencies of structural variants are elevated overall. Furthermore, highly variable tumour-specific contributions of mutational footprints of endogenous (for example, SBS1 and APOBEC) and exogenous mutational processes (for example, platinum treatment) are present. The majority of cancer types had either moderate genomic differences (for example, lung adenocarcinoma) or highly consistent genomic portraits (for example, ovarian serous carcinoma) when comparing early-stage and late-stage disease. Breast, prostate, thyroid and kidney renal clear cell carcinomas and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours are clear exceptions to the rule, displaying an extensive transformation of their genomic landscape in advanced stages. Exposure to treatment further scars the tumour genome and introduces an evolutionary bottleneck that selects for known therapy-resistant drivers in approximately half of treated patients. Our data showcase the potential of pan-cancer whole-genome analysis to identify distinctive features of late-stage tumours and provide a valuable resource to further investigate the biological basis of cancer and resistance to therapies.© 2023.

We find that the activity of NER determines heterogeneity of the mutation rates across skin cancer genomes and that transcription-coupled NER extends beyond the gene boundaries reducing the intergenic mutation rate. Mutational profile in XP-V tumors and experiments with POLH knockout cell line reveal the role of polymerase η in the error-free bypass of (i) rare TpG and TpA DNA lesions, (ii) 3' nucleotides in pyrimidine dimers, and (iii) TpT photodimers. Our study unravels the genetic basis of skin cancer risk in XP and provides insights into the mechanisms reducing UV-induced mutagenesis in the general population.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37217680","RNA alternative splicing impacts the risk for alcohol use disorder.","Mol Psychiatry","Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a complex genetic disorder characterized by problems arising from excessive alcohol consumption. Identifying functional genetic variations that contribute to risk for AUD is a major goal. Alternative splicing of RNA mediates the flow of genetic information from DNA to gene expression and expands proteome diversity. We asked whether alternative splicing could be a risk factor for AUD. Herein, we used a Mendelian randomization (MR)-based approach to identify skipped exons (the predominant splicing event in brain) that contribute to AUD risk. Genotypes and RNA-seq data from the CommonMind Consortium were used as the training dataset to develop predictive models linking individual genotypes to exon skipping in the prefrontal cortex. We applied these models to data from the Collaborative Studies on Genetics of Alcoholism to examine the association between the imputed cis-regulated splicing outcome and the AUD-related traits. We identified 27 exon skipping events that were predicted to affect AUD risk; six of these were replicated in the Australian Twin-family Study of Alcohol Use Disorder. Their host genes are DRC1, ELOVL7, LINC00665, NSUN4, SRRM2 and TBC1D5. The genes downstream of these splicing events are enriched in neuroimmune pathways. The MR-inferred impacts of the ELOVL7 skipped exon on AUD risk was further supported in four additional large-scale genome-wide association studies. Additionally, this exon contributed to changes of gray matter volumes in multiple brain regions, including the visual cortex known to be involved in AUD. In conclusion, this study provides strong evidence that RNA alternative splicing impacts the susceptibility to AUD and adds new information on AUD-relevant genes and pathways. Our framework is also applicable to other types of splicing events and to other complex genetic disorders.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Despite the advanced stage of illness at presentation, we have shown that host genetics in patients who are critically ill with COVID-19 can identify immunomodulatory therapies with strong beneficial effects in this group3. Here we analyse 24,202 cases of COVID-19 with critical illness comprising a combination of microarray genotype and whole-genome sequencing data from cases of critical illness in the international GenOMICC (11,440 cases) study, combined with other studies recruiting hospitalized patients with a strong focus on severe and critical disease: ISARIC4C (676 cases) and the SCOURGE consortium (5,934 cases). To put these results in the context of existing work, we conduct a meta-analysis of the new GenOMICC genome-wide association study (GWAS) results with previously published data. We find 49 genome-wide significant associations, of which 16 have not been reported previously. To investigate the therapeutic implications of these findings, we infer the structural consequences of protein-coding variants, and combine our GWAS results with gene expression data using a monocyte transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) model, as well as gene and protein expression using Mendelian randomization. We identify potentially druggable targets in multiple systems, including inflammatory signalling (JAK1), monocyte-macrophage activation and endothelial permeability (PDE4A), immunometabolism (SLC2A5 and AK5), and host factors required for viral entry and replication (TMPRSS2 and RAB2A).© 2023.

"37198407","Systematic analyses of GWAS summary statistics from UK Biobank identified novel susceptibility loci and genes for upper gastrointestinal diseases.","J Hum Genet","In recent decades, upper gastrointestinal (GI) diseases have been highly prevalent worldwide. Although genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified thousands of susceptibility loci, only a few of them were conducted for chronic upper GI disorders, and most of them were underpowered and with small sample sizes. Additionally, for the known loci, only a tiny fraction of heritability can be explained and the underlying mechanisms and related genes remain unclear. In this study, we conducted a multi-trait analysis by the MTAG software and a two-stage transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) with UTMOST and FUSION for seven upper GI diseases (oesophagitis, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, other diseases of oesophagus, gastric ulcer, duodenal ulcer, gastritis and duodenitis and other diseases of stomach and duodenum) based on summary GWAS statistics from UK Biobank. In the MTAG analysis, we identified 7 loci associated with these upper GI diseases, including 3 novel ones at 4p12 (rs10029980), 12q13.13 (rs4759317) and 18p11.32 (rs4797954). In the TWAS analysis, we revealed 5 susceptibility genes in known loci and identified 12 novel potential susceptibility genes, including HOXC9 at 12q13.13. Further functional annotations and colocalization analysis indicated that rs4759317 (A>G) driven the association for GWAS signals and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) simultaneously at 12q13.13. The identified variant acted by decreasing the expression of HOXC9 to affect the risk of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease.

Multiple loci correlated with AITD have been discovered utilizing genome-wide association studies (GWASs). Nevertheless, demonstrating the biological relevance and function of these genetic loci is difficult.The FUSION software was utilized to define genes that were expressed differentially in AITD using a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) method in accordance with GWAS summary statistics from the largest genome-wide association study of 755,406 AITD individuals (30,234 cases and 725,172 controls) and levels of gene expression from two tissue datasets (blood and thyroid). Further analyses were performed such as colocalization, conditional, and fine-mapping analyses to extensively characterize the identified associations, using functional mapping and annotation (FUMA) to conduct functional annotation of the summary statistics of 23329 significant risk SNPs (P< 5 × 10-8) recognized by GWAS, together with summary-data-based mendelian randomization (SMR) for identifying functionally related genes at the loci in GWAS.There were 330 genes with transcriptome-wide significant differences between cases and controls, and the majority of these genes were new. 9 of the 94 unique significant genes had strong, colocalized, and potentially causal correlations with AITD. Such strong associations includedCD247,TPO,KIAA1524,PDE8B,BACH2,FYN,FOXK1,NKX2-3, andSPATA13. Subsequently, applying the FUMA approach, novel putative AITD susceptibility genes and involved gene sets were detected. Furthermore, we detected 95 probes that showed strong pleiotropic association with AITD through SMR analysis, such asCYP21A2,TPO,BRD7, andFCRL3. Lastly, we selected 26 genes by integrating the result of TWAS, FUMA, and SMR analysis. A phenome-wide association study (pheWAS) was then carried out to determine the risk of other related or co-morbid phenotypes for AITD-related genes.The current work provides further insight into widespread changes in AITD at the transcriptomic level, as well as characterized the genetic component of gene expression in AITD by validating identified genes, establishing new correlations, and uncovering novel susceptibility genes.

Here, we identify specific genes and potential mechanisms that, in placenta, may mediate such outcomes. We performed TWAS in healthy term placentae (N = 147) to derive candidate placental causal genes that we confirmed with SMR; to search for placenta and schizophrenia-specific associations, we performed an analogous analysis in fetal brain (N = 166) and additional placenta TWAS for other disorders/traits. The analyses in the whole sample and stratifying by sex ultimately highlight 139 placenta and schizophrenia-specific risk genes, many being sex-biased; the candidate molecular mechanisms converge on the nutrient-sensing capabilities of placenta and trophoblast invasiveness. These genes also implicate the Coronavirus-pathogenesis pathway and showed increased expression in placentae from a small sample of SARS-CoV-2-positive pregnancies. Investigating placental risk genes for schizophrenia and candidate mechanisms may lead to opportunities for prevention that would not be suggested by study of the brain alone.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37181332","Using GWAS summary data to impute traits for genotyped individuals.","HGG Adv","Genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary data have become extremely useful in daily routine data analysis, largely facilitating new methods development and new applications. However, a severe limitation with the current use of GWAS summary data is its exclusive restriction to only linear single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-trait association analyses. To further expand the use of GWAS summary data, along with a large sample of individual-level genotypes, we propose a nonparametric method for large-scale imputation of the genetic component of the trait for the given genotypes. The imputed individual-level trait values, along with the individual-level genotypes, make it possible to conduct any analysis as with individual-level GWAS data, including nonlinear SNP-trait associations and predictions. We use the UK Biobank data to highlight the usefulness and effectiveness of the proposed method in three applications that currently cannot be done with only GWAS summary data (for SNP-trait associations): marginal SNP-trait association analysis under non-additive genetic models, detection of SNP-SNP interactions, and genetic prediction of a trait using a nonlinear model of SNPs.© 2023 The Author(s)."

To prioritize the putative variants and genes, we ran a comprehensive genome-wide association studies (GWAS) analysis for 21 agronomic traits using imputed whole-genome variants in Simmental beef cattle. Then, we applied expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) mapping between the genotype variants and transcriptome of three tissues (longissimus dorsi muscle, backfat, and liver) in 120 cattle.We identified 1,580 association signals for 21 beef agronomic traits using GWAS. We then illuminated 854,498 cis-eQTLs for 6,017 genes and 46,970 trans-eQTLs for 1,903 genes in three tissues and built a synergistic network by integrating transcriptomics with agronomic traits. These cis-eQTLs were preferentially close to the transcription start site and enriched in functional regulatory regions. We observed an average of 43.5% improvement in cis-eQTL discovery using multi-tissue eQTL mapping. Fine-mapping analysis revealed that 111, 192, and 194 variants were most likely to be causative to regulate gene expression in backfat, liver, and muscle, respectively. The transcriptome-wide association studies identified 722 genes significantly associated with 11 agronomic traits. Via the colocalization and Mendelian randomization analyses, we found that eQTLs of several genes were associated with the GWAS signals of agronomic traits in three tissues, which included genes, such as NADSYN1, NDUFS3, LTF and KIFC2 in liver, GRAMD1C, TMTC2 and ZNF613 in backfat, as well as TIGAR, NDUFS3 and L3HYPDH in muscle that could serve as the candidate genes for economic traits.The extensive atlas of GWAS, eQTL, fine-mapping, and transcriptome-wide association studies aid in the suggestion of potentially functional variants and genes in cattle agronomic traits and will be an invaluable source for genomics and breeding in beef cattle.© 2023.

This study aims to identify novel causal proteins in the brains of patients with ALS using an integrative analytical pipeline.Using the datasets of Protein Quantitative Trait Loci (pQTL) (NpQTL1 = 376, NpQTL2 = 152), expression QTL (eQTL) (N = 452), and the largest ALS GWAS (NALS=27,205, NControls = 110,881), we performed a systematic analytical pipeline including Proteome-Wide Association Study (PWAS), Mendelian Randomization (MR), Bayesian colocalization, and Transcriptome-Wide Association Study (TWAS) to identify novel causal proteins for ALS in the brain.Using PWAS, we found that the altered protein abundance of 12 genes in the brain was associated with ALS. Three genes (SCFD1, SARM1 and CAMLG) were identified as lead causal genes for ALS with solid evidence (False discovery rate < 0.05, in MR analysis; PPH4 > 80% for Bayesian colocalization). Specifically, an increased abundance of SCFD1 and CAMLG led to an increased risk of ALS, whereas a higher abundance of SARM1 led to a decreased risk of developing ALS. TWAS showed that SCFD1 and CAMLG were related to ALS at the transcriptional level.SCFD1, CAMLG, and SARM1 exhibited robust associations and causality with ALS. The study findings provide novel clues for identifying potential therapeutic targets in ALS. Further studies are required to explore the mechanisms underlying the identified genes.© 2023.

We then investigated genetic relationships leveraging summary statistics from the hitherto largest genome-wide association study of European individuals conducted for depression (N = 500,199), BC (N = 247,173), and its subtypes based on the status of estrogen receptor (ER + : N = 175,475; ER - : N = 127,442).Observational analysis suggested an increased hazard of BC in depression patients (HR = 1.10, 95%CIs = 0.95-1.26). A positive genetic correlation between depression and overall BC was observed ([Formula: see text] = 0.08, P = 3.00 × 10-4), consistent across ER + ([Formula: see text] = 0.06, P = 6.30 × 10-3) and ER - subtypes ([Formula: see text] = 0.08, P = 7.20 × 10-3). Several specific genomic regions showed evidence of local genetic correlation, including one locus at 9q31.2, and four loci at, or close, to 6p22.1. Cross-trait meta-analysis identified 17 pleiotropic loci shared between depression and BC. TWAS analysis revealed five shared genes. Bi-directional Mendelian randomization suggested risk of depression was causally associated with risk of overall BC (OR = 1.12, 95%Cis = 1.04-1.19), but risk of BC was not causally associated with risk of depression.Our work demonstrates a shared genetic basis, pleiotropic loci, and a putative causal relationship between depression and BC, highlighting a biological link underlying the observed phenotypic relationship; these findings may provide important implications for future studies aimed reducing BC risk.© 2023.

While these datasets are extremely useful for studying mechanisms of gene regulation in disease and cell development, they only identify open chromatin regions in individual samples. A uniform comparison of accessibility of the same regulatory sites across multiple samples is necessary to correlate open chromatin accessibility and expression of target genes across matched cell types.

However, the development of optimal protocols for the production and long-term culturing of NSCs remains a challenge. One of the most important aspects of this problem is to determine the stability of NSCs during long-term in vitro passaging. To address this problem, our study was aimed at investigating the spontaneous differentiation profile in different iPSC-derived human NSCs cultures during long-term cultivation using.Four different IPSC lines were used to generate NSC and spontaneously differentiated neural cultures using DUAL SMAD inhibition. These cells were analyzed at different passages using immunocytochemistry, qPCR, bulk transcriptomes and scRNA-seq.We found that various NSC lines generate significantly different spectrums of differentiated neural cells, which can also change significantly during long-term cultivationin vitro.Our results indicate that both internal (genetic and epigenetic) and external (conditions and duration of cultivation) factors influence the stability of NSCs.

Although loci associated with the disease groups are highly specific, they converge on perturbing the same pathways. Finally, we test for colocalization between loci and single-cell eQTLs derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. We identify the causal route by which 46 loci predispose to three disease groups and find evidence for eight genes being candidates for drug repurposing.

Although several risk loci have been already identified, HP biology and epidemiology are still insufficiently investigated by large-scale genetic studies.Leveraging the UK Biobank, the Nurses' Health Studies (I and II), the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, and the Million Veteran Program, we conducted a comprehensive genome-wide investigation of HP in 748,668 adult participants (discovery N = 501,825; replication N = 226,043; cross-ancestry replication N = 20,800). We leveraged the GWAS findings to characterize HP polygenic architecture, exploring sex differences, polygenic risk across ancestries, tissue-specific transcriptomic regulation, cause-effect relationships with genetically correlated traits, and gene interactions with HP environmental risk factors.We identified 54 risk loci and demonstrated that HP polygenic risk is shared across ancestry groups. Our transcriptomic regulation analysis highlighted the potential role of the central nervous system in HP pathogenesis. The sex-stratified analyses showed several additional associations related to peripheral hormonally regulated tissues reflecting a potential role of estrogen in hearing function. This evidence was supported by the multivariate interaction analysis that showed how genes involved in brain development interact with sex, noise pollution, and tobacco smoking in relation to their HP associations. Additionally, the genetically informed causal inference analysis showed that HP is linked to many physical and mental health outcomes.The results provide many novel insights into the biology and epidemiology of HP in adults.

Then, we applied multivariable MR to investigate the independent effects considering both general and central obesity.In univariable MR, a heterogeneous effect of subclass high-density lipoproteins (HDL) was observed, in which small HDL traits (ORs ranged from 0.89 to 0.94) were associated with a decreased risk of breast cancer while non-small HDLs traits (OR ranged from 1.04 to 1.08) were associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. Very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) traits and serum total triglycerides (TG) were associated with a decreased risk of breast cancer (ORs ranged from 0.88 to 0.94). Similar association patterns were found for ER + subtype. In multivariable MR, only the protective effects of small HDL, VLDL and TG on ER + subtype remained significant.We identified a heterogeneous effect of subclass HDLs and a consistent protective effect of VLDL on breast cancer.

Advanced insights into the genetic basis of CAD require deeper understanding of the contributions of different cell types, molecular pathways, and genes to disease heritability. Here, we investigate the biological diversity of atherosclerosis-associated cell states and interrogate their contribution to the genetic risk of CAD by using single-cell and bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of mouse and human lesions. We identified 12 disease-associated cell states that we characterized further by gene set functional profiling, ligand-receptor prediction, and transcription factor inference. Importantly, Vcam1+ smooth muscle cell state genes contributed most to SNP-based heritability of CAD. In line with this, genetic variants near smooth muscle cell state genes and regulatory elements explained the largest fraction of CAD-risk variance between individuals. Using this information for variant prioritization, we derived a hybrid polygenic risk score (PRS) that demonstrated improved performance over a classical PRS. Our results provide insights into the biological mechanisms associated with CAD risk, which could make a promising contribution to precision medicine and tailored therapeutic interventions in the future.Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).

"37037607","Cellular Diversity in Human Subgenual Anterior Cingulate and Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex by Single-Nucleus RNA-Sequencing.","J Neurosci","Regional cellular heterogeneity is a fundamental feature of the human neocortex; however, details of this heterogeneity are still undefined. We used single-nucleus RNA-sequencing to examine cell-specific transcriptional features in the dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC) and the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC), regions implicated in major psychiatric disorders. Droplet-based nuclei-capture and library preparation were performed on replicate samples from 8 male donors without history of psychiatric or neurologic disorder. Unsupervised clustering identified major neural cell classes. Subsequent iterative clustering of neurons further revealed 20 excitatory and 22 inhibitory subclasses. Inhibitory cells were consistently more abundant in the sgACC and excitatory neuron subclusters exhibited considerable variability across brain regions. Excitatory cell subclasses also exhibited greater within-class transcriptional differences between the two regions. We used these molecular definitions to determine which cell classes might be enriched in loci carrying a genetic signal in genome-wide association studies or for differentially expressed genes in mental illness. We found that the heritable signals of psychiatric disorders were enriched in neurons and that, while the gene expression changes detected in bulk-RNA-sequencing studies were dominated by glial cells, some alterations could be identified in specific classes of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Intriguingly, only two excitatory cell classes exhibited concomitant region-specific enrichment for both genome-wide association study loci and transcriptional dysregulation. In sum, by detailing the molecular and cellular diversity of the DLPFC and sgACC, we were able to generate hypotheses on regional and cell-specific dysfunctions that may contribute to the development of mental illness.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTDysfunction of the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex has been implicated in mood disorders, particularly major depressive disorder, and the dorsolateral PFC, a subsection of the PFC involved in executive functioning, has been implicated in schizophrenia. Understanding the cellular composition of these regions is critical to elucidating the neurobiology underlying psychiatric and neurologic disorders. We studied cell type diversity of the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex and dorsolateral PFC of humans with no neuropsychiatric illness using a clustering analysis of single-nuclei RNA-sequencing data. Defining the transcriptomic profile of cellular subpopulations in these cortical regions is a first step to demystifying the cellular and molecular pathways involved in psychiatric disorders.Copyright © 2023 the authors."
"37030289","Fast and accurate Bayesian polygenic risk modeling with variational inference.","Am J Hum Genet","The advent of large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWASs) has motivated the development of statistical methods for phenotype prediction with single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array data. These polygenic risk score (PRS) methods use a multiple linear regression framework to infer joint effect sizes of all genetic variants on the trait. Among the subset of PRS methods that operate on GWAS summary statistics, sparse Bayesian methods have shown competitive predictive ability. However, most existing Bayesian approaches employ Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms, which are computationally inefficient and do not scale favorably to higher dimensions, for posterior inference. Here, we introduce variational inference of polygenic risk scores (VIPRS), a Bayesian summary statistics-based PRS method that utilizes variational inference techniques to approximate the posterior distribution for the effect sizes. Our experiments with 36 simulation configurations and 12 real phenotypes from the UK Biobank dataset demonstrated that VIPRS is consistently competitive with the state-of-the-art in prediction accuracy while being more than twice as fast as popular MCMC-based approaches. This performance advantage is robust across a variety of genetic architectures, SNP heritabilities, and independent GWAS cohorts. In addition to its competitive accuracy on the ""White British"" samples, VIPRS showed improved transferability when applied to other ethnic groups, with up to 1.7-fold increase in R2among individuals of Nigerian ancestry for low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. To illustrate its scalability, we applied VIPRS to a dataset of 9.6 million genetic markers, which conferred further improvements in prediction accuracy for highly polygenic traits, such as height.Copyright © 2023 American Society of Human Genetics.

"37113569","Characterisation of OXA-48-like carbapenemases in Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae from North India.","3 Biotech","The oxacillinase-48 (OXA-48)-like carbapenemases are class D β-lactamases and increasingly reported in Enterobacterial species. The detection of these carbapenemases is challenging and little information is available on the epidemiology and plasmid characteristics of OXA-48-like carbapenemase producers. We detected the presence of OXA-48-like carbapenemases in 500 clinical isolates ofEscherichia coliandKlebsiella pneumoniae, followed by detection of other carbapenemases, extended spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) and 16S rRNA methyltransferases in OXA-48 producers. Clonal relatedness was studied using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multi-locus sequence typing (MLST). Finally, plasmid characterisation was performed through conjugation experiment, S1-PFGE and Southern hybridisation. Around 40% ofE. coliandK. pneumoniaeisolates harboured OXA-48-like β-lactamases. Two OXA-48 allele variants, OXA-232 and OXA-181 were detected in our study. OXA-48 producers co-harbored diverse drug-resistant genes belonging to other classes of carbapenemases, ESBLs and 16S rRNA methyltransferases. OXA-48-like carbapenemase producers exhibited high clonal diversity.BlaOXA-48carrying plasmids were conjugative, untypable and their size was ~ 45 kb and ~ 104.5 kb inE. coliandK. pneumoniaerespectively. In conclusion, OXA-48-like carbapenemases have emerged as major cause of carbapenem resistance in Enterobacteriaceae and probably still being under reported. Strict surveillance and adequate detection methods are needed to prevent the dissemination of OXA-48-like carbapenemases.© King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology 2023, Springer Nature or its licensor (e.g. a society or other partner) holds exclusive rights to this article under a publishing agreement with the author(s) or other rightsholder(s); author self-archiving of the accepted manuscript version of this article is solely governed by the terms of such publishing agreement and applicable law."
"37200795",NA,NA,"In this review, we summarize the current state of knowledge on the fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) gene and its role in obesity. The FTO-encoded protein is involved in multiple molecular pathways contributing to obesity as well as other metabolic complexities. This review emphasizes the epigenetic influence on theFTOgene as a new approach in the treatment and management of obesity. Several known substances have a positive effect on reducingFTOexpression. Depending on which variant of the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is present, the profile and level of gene expression changes. Implementation of environmental change measures could lead to reduced phenotypic manifestation ofFTOexpression. Treating obesity throughFTOgene regulation will have to include various complex signal pathways in whichFTOtakes part. Identification ofFTOgene polymorphisms may be useful for the development of individual obesity management strategies, including the recommendation of taking certain foods and supplements."

A common polymorphism in PPARGC1A (rs8192678, C/T, Gly482Ser) has been associated with obesity and related metabolic disorders, but no published functional studies have investigated direct allele-specific effects in adipocyte biology. We examined whether rs8192678 is a causal variant and reveal its biological function in human white adipose cells.We used CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing to perform an allelic switch (C-to-T or T-to-C) at rs8192678 in an isogenic human pre-adipocyte white adipose tissue (hWAs) cell line. Allele-edited single-cell clones were expanded and screened to obtain homozygous T/T (Ser482Ser), C/C (Gly482Gly) and heterozygous C/T (Gly482Ser) isogenic cell populations, followed by functional studies of the allele-dependent effects on white adipocyte differentiation and mitochondrial function.After differentiation, the C/C adipocytes were visibly less BODIPY-positive than T/T and C/T adipocytes, and had significantly lower triacylglycerol content. The C allele presented a dose-dependent lowering effect on lipogenesis, as well as lower expression of genes critical for adipogenesis, lipid catabolism, lipogenesis and lipolysis. Moreover, C/C adipocytes had decreased oxygen consumption rate (OCR) at basal and maximal respiration, and lower ATP-linked OCR. We determined that these effects were a consequence of a C-allele-driven dysregulation of PGC-1α protein content, turnover rate and transcriptional coactivator activity.Our data show allele-specific causal effects of the rs8192678 variant on adipogenic differentiation. The C allele confers lower levels of PPARGC1A mRNA and PGC-1α protein, as well as disrupted dynamics of PGC-1α turnover and activity, with downstream effects on cellular differentiation and mitochondrial function. Our study provides the first experimentally deduced insights on the effects of rs8192678 on adipocyte phenotype.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37142787","Physiological and pathological roles of lipogenesis.","Nat Metab","Lipids are essential metabolites, which function as energy sources, structural components and signalling mediators. Most cells are able to convert carbohydrates into fatty acids, which are often converted into neutral lipids for storage in the form of lipid droplets. Accumulating evidence suggests that lipogenesis plays a crucial role not only in metabolic tissues for systemic energy homoeostasis but also in immune and nervous systems for their proliferation, differentiation and even pathophysiological roles. Thus, excessive or insufficient lipogenesis is closely associated with aberrations in lipid homoeostasis, potentially leading to pathological consequences, such as dyslipidaemia, diabetes, fatty liver, autoimmune diseases, neurodegenerative diseases and cancers. For systemic energy homoeostasis, multiple enzymes involved in lipogenesis are tightly controlled by transcriptional and post-translational modifications. In this Review, we discuss recent findings regarding the regulatory mechanisms, physiological roles and pathological importance of lipogenesis in multiple tissues such as adipose tissue and the liver, as well as the immune and nervous systems. Furthermore, we briefly introduce the therapeutic implications of lipogenesis modulation.© 2023. Springer Nature Limited."
"37217727","Addressing the ethical and societal challenges posed by genome-wide association studies of behavioral and brain-related traits.","Nat Neurosci","Genome-wide association studies have led to the identification of robust statistical associations of genetic variants with numerous brain-related traits, including neurological and psychiatric conditions, and psychological and behavioral measures. These results may provide insight into the biology underlying these traits and may facilitate clinically useful predictions. However, these results also carry the risk of harm, including possible negative effects of inaccurate predictions, violations of privacy, stigma and genomic discrimination, raising serious ethical and legal implications. Here, we discuss ethical concerns surrounding the results of genome-wide association studies for individuals, society and researchers. Given the success of genome-wide association studies and the increasing availability of nonclinical genomic prediction technologies, better laws and guidelines are urgently needed to regulate the storage, processing and responsible use of genetic data. Also, researchers should be aware of possible misuse of their results, and we provide guidance to help avoid such negative impacts on individuals and society.© 2023. Springer Nature America, Inc."
"37198491","Polygenic scoring accuracy varies across the genetic ancestry continuum.","Nature","Polygenic scores (PGSs) have limited portability across different groupings of individuals (for example, by genetic ancestries and/or social determinants of health), preventing their equitable use1-3. PGS portability has typically been assessed using a single aggregate population-level statistic (for example, R2)4, ignoring inter-individual variation within the population. Here, using a large and diverse Los Angeles biobank5(ATLAS, n = 36,778) along with the UK Biobank6(UKBB, n = 487,409), we show that PGS accuracy decreases individual-to-individual along the continuum of genetic ancestries7in all considered populations, even within traditionally labelled 'homogeneous' genetic ancestries. The decreasing trend is well captured by a continuous measure of genetic distance (GD) from the PGS training data: Pearson correlation of -0.95 between GD and PGS accuracy averaged across 84 traits. When applying PGS models trained on individuals labelled as white British in the UKBB to individuals with European ancestries in ATLAS, individuals in the furthest GD decile have 14% lower accuracy relative to the closest decile; notably, the closest GD decile of individuals with Hispanic Latino American ancestries show similar PGS performance to the furthest GD decile of individuals with European ancestries. GD is significantly correlated with PGS estimates themselves for 82 of 84 traits, further emphasizing the importance of incorporating the continuum of genetic ancestries in PGS interpretation. Our results highlight the need to move away from discrete genetic ancestry clusters towards the continuum of genetic ancestries when considering PGSs.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37173343","CADM2 is implicated in impulsive personality and numerous other traits by genome- and phenome-wide association studies in humans and mice.","Transl Psychiatry","Impulsivity is a multidimensional heritable phenotype that broadly refers to the tendency to act prematurely and is associated with multiple forms of psychopathology, including substance use disorders. We performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of eight impulsive personality traits from the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale and the short UPPS-P Impulsive Personality Scale (N = 123,509-133,517 23andMe research participants of European ancestry), and a measure of Drug Experimentation (N = 130,684). Because these GWAS implicated the gene CADM2, we next performed single-SNP phenome-wide studies (PheWAS) of several of the implicated variants in CADM2 in a multi-ancestral 23andMe cohort (N = 3,229,317, European; N = 579,623, Latin American; N = 199,663, African American). Finally, we produced Cadm2 mutant mice and used them to perform a Mouse-PheWAS (""MouseWAS"") by testing them with a battery of relevant behavioral tasks. In humans, impulsive personality traits showed modest chip-heritability (~6-11%), and moderate genetic correlations (rg = 0.20-0.50) with other personality traits, and various psychiatric and medical traits. We identified significant associations proximal to genes such as TCF4 and PTPRF, and also identified nominal associations proximal to DRD2 and CRHR1. PheWAS for CADM2 variants identified associations with 378 traits in European participants, and 47 traits in Latin American participants, replicating associations with risky behaviors, cognition and BMI, and revealing novel associations including allergies, anxiety, irritable bowel syndrome, and migraine. Our MouseWAS recapitulated some of the associations found in humans, including impulsivity, cognition, and BMI. Our results further delineate the role of CADM2 in impulsivity and numerous other psychiatric and somatic traits across ancestries and species.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37168552","Multi-trait genome-wide association study identifies a novel endometrial cancer risk locus that associates with testosterone levels.","iScience","To detect novel endometrial cancer risk variants, we leveraged information from endometrial cancer risk factors in a multi-trait GWAS analysis. We first assessed causal relationships between established and suspected endometrial cancer risk factors, and endometrial cancer using Mendelian randomization. Following multivariable analysis, five independent risk factors (waist circumference, testosterone levels, sex hormone binding globulin levels, age at menarche, and age at natural menopause) were included in a multi-trait Bayesian GWAS analysis. We identified three potentially novel loci that associate with endometrial cancer risk, one of which (7q22.1) replicated in an independent endometrial cancer GWAS dataset and was genome-wide significant in a meta-analysis. This locus may affect endometrial cancer risk through altered testosterone levels. Consistent with this, we observed colocalization between the signals for endometrial cancer risk and expression ofCYP3A7, a gene involved in testosterone metabolism. Thus, our findings suggest opportunities for hormone therapy to prevent or treat endometrial cancer.© 2023 The Author(s)."

Here we sought to identify genes and molecular pathways underlying the associations between PD and the volume of ten brain structures measured through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. We leveraged genome-wide genetic data from several cohorts, including the International Parkinson's Disease Genomics Consortium (IPDG), the UK Biobank, the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study, the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE), the Enhancing Neuroimaging Genetics through Meta-Analyses (ENIGMA), and 23andMe. We observed significant positive genetic correlations between PD and intracranial and subcortical brain volumes. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) - pairwise analyses identified 210 genomic segments with shared aetiology between PD and at least one of these brain structures. Pathway enrichment results highlight potential links with chronic inflammation, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal pathway, mitophagy, disrupted vesicle-trafficking, calcium-dependent, and autophagic pathways. Investigations for putative causal genetic effects suggest that a larger putamen volume could influence PD risk, independently of the potential causal genetic effects of intracranial volume (ICV) on PD. Our findings suggest that genetic variants influencing larger intracranial and subcortical brain volumes, possibly during earlier stages of life, influence the risk of developing PD later in life.© 2023.

"37163049","Unsupervised representation learning improves genomic discovery for lung function and respiratory disease prediction.","medRxiv","High-dimensional clinical data are becoming more accessible in biobank-scale datasets. However, accurately phenotyping high-dimensional clinical data remains a major impediment to genetic discovery.We introduce a general deep learning framework, RE presentation learning for Genetic discovery on Low-dimensional Embeddings (REGLE), for discovering associations between genetic variants and high-dimensional clinical data. REGLE uses convolutional variational autoencoders to compute anon-linear, low-dimensional, disentangled embeddingof the data and can also incorporate expert clinical metrics. We demonstrate the utility of REGLE by application to spirograms, which measure lung function. We generate two types of synthetic representations of pulmonary functions we call spirogram encodings (SPINCs) and residual spirogram encodings (RSPINCs).Genome-wide association studies on (R)SPINCs identify more genome-wide significant loci than existing methods while replicating most known lung function loci. Furthermore, (R)SPINCs are associated with overall survival and, under the latent causal variable model, they exhibit significantly high genetic causality proportion with asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and inflammatory diseases. Finally, we construct a set of polygenic risk scores (PRS) that are generally predictive of pulmonary traits and diseases. We demonstrate superior performance predicting asthma and COPD, in multiple ancestries and across four biobanks, compared to PRSs constructed using expert-defined pulmonary function measurements.REGLE is a method for generating low-dimensional, disentangled representations of high-dimensional clinical data that does not require labels, and improves upon expert-defined phenotypes for genetic discovery and disease prediction. It can flexibly incorporate expert-defined or clinical features and provides a framework to create accurate disease-specific PRS in datasets which have minimal expert phenotyping. (R)SPINCs are quantifying clinically relevant features that are not currently captured in a standardized or automated way.Google LLC."
"37161092","Abdominal obesity is a more important causal risk factor for pancreatic cancer than overall obesity.","Eur J Hum Genet","Obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are associated with increased risk of pancreatic cancer. Here we assessed the relationship between pancreatic cancer and two distinct measures of obesity, namely total adiposity, using BMI, versus abdominal adiposity, using BMI adjusted waist-to-hip ratio (WHRadjBMI) by utilising polygenic scores (PGS) and Mendelian randomisation (MR) analyses. We constructed z-score weighted PGS for BMI and WHRadjBMI using publicly available data and tested for their association with pancreatic cancer defined in UK biobank (UKBB). Using publicly available summary statistics, we then performed bi-directional MR analyses between the two obesity traits and pancreatic cancer. PGSBMIwas significantly (multiple testing-corrected) associated with pancreatic cancer (OR[95%CI] = 1.0804[1.025-1.14], P = 0.0037). The significance of association declined after T2D adjustment (OR[95%CI] = 1.073[1.018-1.13], P = 0.00904). PGSWHRadjBMIassociation with pancreatic cancer was at the margin of statistical significance (OR[95%CI] = 1.047[0.99-1.104], P = 0.086). T2D adjustment effectively lost any suggestive association of PGSWHRadjBMIwith pancreatic cancer (OR[95%CI] = 1.039[0.99-1.097], P = 0.14). MR analyses showed a nominally significant causal effect of WHRadjBMI on pancreatic cancer (OR[95%CI] = 1.00095[1.00011-1.0018], P = 0.027) but not for BMI on pancreatic cancer. Overall, we show that abdominal adiposity measured using WHRadjBMI, may be a more important causal risk factor for pancreatic cancer compared to total adiposity, with T2D being a potential driver of this relationship.© 2023.

To date, most IBD genetic associations were derived from individuals of European (EUR) ancestries. Here we report the largest IBD study of individuals of East Asian (EAS) ancestries, including 14,393 cases and 15,456 controls. We found 80 IBD loci in EAS alone and 320 when meta-analyzed with ~370,000 EUR individuals (~30,000 cases), among which 81 are new. EAS-enriched coding variants implicate many new IBD genes, including ADAP1 and GIT2. Although IBD genetic effects are generally consistent across ancestries, genetics underlying CD appears more ancestry dependent than UC, driven by allele frequency (NOD2) and effect (TNFSF15). We extended the IBD polygenic risk score (PRS) by incorporating both ancestries, greatly improving its accuracy and highlighting the importance of diversity for the equitable deployment of PRS.© 2023.

"37147289","Multi-trait genome-wide association analyses leveraging alcohol use disorder findings identify novel loci for smoking behaviors in the Million Veteran Program.","Transl Psychiatry","Smoking behaviors and alcohol use disorder (AUD), both moderately heritable traits, commonly co-occur in the general population. Single-trait genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified multiple loci for smoking and AUD. However, GWASs that have aimed to identify loci contributing to co-occurring smoking and AUD have used small samples and thus have not been highly informative. Applying multi-trait analysis of GWASs (MTAG), we conducted a joint GWAS of smoking and AUD with data from the Million Veteran Program (N = 318,694). By leveraging GWAS summary statistics for AUD, MTAG identified 21 genome-wide significant (GWS) loci associated with smoking initiation and 17 loci associated with smoking cessation compared to 16 and 8 loci, respectively, identified by single-trait GWAS. The novel loci for smoking behaviors identified by MTAG included those previously associated with psychiatric or substance use traits. Colocalization analysis identified 10 loci shared by AUD and smoking status traits, all of which achieved GWS in MTAG, including variants on SIX3, NCAM1, and near DRD2. Functional annotation of the MTAG variants highlighted biologically important regions on ZBTB20, DRD2, PPP6C, and GCKR that contribute to smoking behaviors. In contrast, MTAG of smoking behaviors and alcohol consumption (AC) did not enhance discovery compared with single-trait GWAS for smoking behaviors. We conclude that using MTAG to augment the power of GWAS enables the identification of novel genetic variants for commonly co-occuring phenotypes, providing new insights into their pleiotropic effects on smoking behavior and AUD.© 2023.

Estimation of can be susceptible to biases due to population structure in ancestral populations. Here, we present a novel approach, Heritability estimation from Admixture Mapping Summary STAtistics (HAMSTA), which uses summary statistics from admixture mapping to infer heritability explained by local ancestry while adjusting for biases due to ancestral stratification. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that HAMSTA estimates are approximately unbiased and are robust to ancestral stratification compared to existing approaches. In the presence of ancestral stratification, we show a HAMSTA-derived sampling scheme provides a calibrated family-wise error rate (FWER) of âˆ¼5% for admixture mapping, unlike existing FWER estimation approaches. We apply HAMSTA to 20 quantitative phenotypes of up to 15,988 self-reported African American individuals in the Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) study. We observe in the 20 phenotypes range from 0.0025 to 0.033 (mean ), which translates to ranging from 0.062 to 0.85 (mean ). Across these phenotypes we find little evidence of inflation due to ancestral population stratification in current admixture mapping studies (mean inflation factor of 0.99 +/-0.001). Overall, HAMSTA provides a fast and powerful approach to estimate genome-wide heritability and evaluate biases in test statistics of admixture mapping studies."

Worldwide, its prevalence is ~2% and its etiology is mostly unknown. Identifying biological factors contributing to OCD will elucidate underlying mechanisms and might contribute to improved treatment outcomes. Genomic studies of OCD are beginning to reveal long-sought risk loci, but >95% of the cases currently in analysis are of homogenous European ancestry. If not addressed, this Eurocentric bias will result in OCD genomic findings being more accurate for individuals of European ancestry than other ancestries, thereby contributing to health disparities in potential future applications of genomics. In this study protocol paper, we describe the Latin American Trans-ancestry INitiative for OCD genomics (LATINO, www.latinostudy.org ). LATINO is a new network of investigators from across Latin America, the United States, and Canada who have begun to collect DNA and clinical data from 5,000 richly-phenotyped OCD cases of Latin American ancestry in a culturally sensitive and ethical manner. In this project, we will utilize trans-ancestry genomic analyses to accelerate the identification of OCD risk loci, fine-map putative causal variants, and improve the performance of polygenic risk scores in diverse populations. We will also capitalize on rich clinical data to examine the genetics of treatment response, biologically plausible OCD subtypes, and symptom dimensions. Additionally, LATINO will help elucidate the diversity of the clinical presentations of OCD across cultures through various trainings developed and offered in collaboration with Latin American investigators. We believe this study will advance the important goal of global mental health discovery and equity."

In total, 33 plasma proteins were prioritized, including repurposing candidates for DCM and/or HF: IL18R (providing indirect evidence for IL18), I17RA, GPC5, LAMC2, PA2GA, CD33, and SLAF7. In addition, 13 of the 25 druggable proteins (52%; 95% confidence interval, 0.31 to 0.72) could be mapped to compounds with known oncological indications or side effects.

Here, we used data from the UK Biobank to conduct a GWAS of RTV in participants of white British ancestry (n= 404,302) as well as a trans-ancestry GWAS meta-analysis (n= 44,873) to assess replication. We found 161 genome-wide significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) distributed across 7 genomic loci in our discovery GWAS. Functional annotation of the variants implicated genes involved in synaptic function and neural development. The SNP-based heritability (h2SNP) estimate for RTV was 3%. We investigated genetic correlations between RTV and selected neuropsychological traits using linkage disequilibrium score regression, and found significant correlations with several traits, including a positive correlation with schizophrenia. We assessed the predictive ability of a polygenic score (PGS) for RTV, calculated using PRSice and PRS-CS, and found that the RTV-PGS significantly predicted RTV in independent cohorts, but that the generalizability to other ancestry groups was poor. These results identify genetic underpinnings of RTV, and support the use of RTV as an endophenotype for neurological and psychiatric disorders."

While its success in the past decade, this one-to-one paradigm lacks efficiency because it does not utilize the information of intrinsic genetic structure and pleiotropic effects. Due to privacy reasons, only summary statistics of current genome-wide association study data are publicly available. Existing summary statistics-based association tests do not consider covariates for regression model, while adjusting for covariates including population stratification factors is a routine issue.In this work, we first derive the correlation coefficients between summary Wald statistics obtained from linear regression model with covariates. Then, a new test is proposed by integrating three-level information including the intrinsic genetic structure, pleiotropy, and the potential information combinations. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed test outperforms three other existing methods under most of the considered scenarios. Real data analysis of polyunsaturated fatty acids further shows that the proposed test can identify more genes than the compared existing methods.Code is available at https://github.com/bschilder/ThreeWayTest.© The Author(s) 2023.

The ABIDE sample included individuals diagnosed with ASD aged between 16 and 64 years and age- and sex-match typically developing individuals. Validation cohorts included individuals with schizophrenia from the Psychosis Heterogeneity Evaluated via Dimensional Neuroimaging (PHENOM) consortium and individuals from the UK Biobank to represent the general population. The multisite discovery cohort included 16 internationally distributed imaging sites. Analyses were performed between March 2021 and March 2022.The trained semisupervised heterogeneity through discriminative analysis models were tested for reproducibility using extensive cross-validations. It was then applied to individuals from the PHENOM and the UK Biobank. It was hypothesized that neuroanatomical dimensions of ASD would display distinct clinical and genetic profiles and would be prominent also in non-ASD populations.Heterogeneity through discriminative analysis models trained on T1-weighted brain magnetic resonance images of 307 individuals with ASD (mean [SD] age, 25.4 [9.8] years; 273 [88.9%] male) and 362 typically developing control individuals (mean [SD] age, 25.8 [8.9] years; 309 [85.4%] male) revealed that a 3-dimensional scheme was optimal to capture the ASD neuroanatomy. The first dimension (A1: aginglike) was associated with smaller brain volume, lower cognitive function, and aging-related genetic variants (FOXO3; Z = 4.65; P = 1.62 × 10-6). The second dimension (A2: schizophrenialike) was characterized by enlarged subcortical volumes, antipsychotic medication use (Cohen d = 0.65; false discovery rate-adjusted P = .048), partially overlapping genetic, neuroanatomical characteristics to schizophrenia (n = 307), and significant genetic heritability estimates in the general population (n = 14 786; mean [SD] h2, 0.71 [0.04]; P < 1 × 10-4). The third dimension (A3: typical ASD) was distinguished by enlarged cortical volumes, high nonverbal cognitive performance, and biological pathways implicating brain development and abnormal apoptosis (mean [SD] β, 0.83 [0.02]; P = 4.22 × 10-6).This cross-sectional study discovered 3-dimensional endophenotypic representation that may elucidate the heterogeneous neurobiological underpinnings of ASD to support precision diagnostics. The significant correspondence between A2 and schizophrenia indicates a possibility of identifying common biological mechanisms across the 2 mental health diagnoses."

The seven SNPs such as rs1173771 (G/A)AC026703.1, rs1799945 (C/G)HFE, rs805303 (G/A)BAG6, rs932764 (A/G)PLCE1, rs4387287 (C/A)OBFC1, rs7302981 (G/A)CERS5, rs167479 (T/G)RGL3, out of ten regarded loci, were related with AH within eight SNP-SNP interaction models (<0.001 ≤ pperm-interaction ≤ 0.047). Three polymorphisms such as rs8068318 (T/C)TBX2, rs633185 (C/G)ARHGAP42, and rs2681472 (A/G)ATP2B1were not linked with AH. The pairwise rs805303 (G/A)BAG6-rs7302981 (G/A)CERS5combination was a priority in determining the susceptibility to AH (included in six out of eight SNP-SNP interaction models [75%] and described 0.82% AH entropy). AH-associated variants are conjecturally functional for 101 genes involved in processes related to the immune system (major histocompatibility complex protein, processing/presentation of antigens, immune system process regulation, etc.). In conclusion, the rs1799945 polymorphism of theHFEgene and intergenic interactions ofBAG6,CERS5,AC026703.1,HFE,PLCE1,OBFC1,RGL3have been linked with AH risky in the Caucasian population of Central Russia."

In two groups of European subjects of Russia (n= 1405 in total), such as men (n= 821 in total:n= 564 HTN,n= 257 control) and women (n= 584 in total:n= 375 HTN,n= 209 control), the distribution of ten specially selected polymorphisms (they have confirmed associations of GWAS level with blood pressure (BP) parameters and/or HTN in Europeans) has been considered. The list of studied loci was as follows: (PLCE1) rs932764 A > G, (AC026703.1) rs1173771 G > A, (CERS5) rs7302981 G > A, (HFE) rs1799945 C > G, (OBFC1) rs4387287 C > A, (BAG6) rs805303 G > A, (RGL3) rs167479 T > G, (ARHGAP42) rs633185 C > G, (TBX2) rs8068318 T > C, and (ATP2B1) rs2681472 A > G. The contribution of individual loci and their inter-locus interactions to the HTN susceptibility with bioinformatic interpretation of associative links was evaluated separately in men's and women's cohorts. The men-women differences in involvement in the disease of the BP/HTN-associated GWAS SNPs were detected. Among women, the HTN risk has been associated withHFErs1799945 C > G (genotype GG was risky; ORGG= 11.15 ppermGG= 0.014) and inter-locus interactions of all 10 examined SNPs as part of 26 intergenic interactions models. In men, the polymorphismBAG6rs805303 G > A (genotype AA was protective; ORAA= 0.30 ppermAA= 0.0008) and inter-SNPs interactions of eight loci in only seven models have been founded as HTN-correlated. HTN-linked loci and strongly linked SNPs were characterized by pronounced polyvector functionality in both men and women, but at the same time, signaling pathways of HTN-linked genes/SNPs in women and men were similar and were represented mainly by immune mechanisms. As a result, the present study has demonstrated a more pronounced contribution of BP/HTN-associated GWAS SNPs to the HTN susceptibility (due to weightier intergenic interactions) in European women than in men."
"37084258","DFHiC: a dilated full convolution model to enhance the resolution of Hi-C data.","Bioinformatics","Hi-C technology has been the most widely used chromosome conformation capture (3C) experiment that measures the frequency of all paired interactions in the entire genome, which is a powerful tool for studying the 3D structure of the genome. The fineness of the constructed genome structure depends on the resolution of Hi-C data. However, due to the fact that high-resolution Hi-C data require deep sequencing and thus high experimental cost, most available Hi-C data are in low-resolution. Hence, it is essential to enhance the quality of Hi-C data by developing the effective computational methods.In this work, we propose a novel method, so-called DFHiC, which generates the high-resolution Hi-C matrix from the low-resolution Hi-C matrix in the framework of the dilated convolutional neural network. The dilated convolution is able to effectively explore the global patterns in the overall Hi-C matrix by taking advantage of the information of the Hi-C matrix in a way of the longer genomic distance. Consequently, DFHiC can improve the resolution of the Hi-C matrix reliably and accurately. More importantly, the super-resolution Hi-C data enhanced by DFHiC is more in line with the real high-resolution Hi-C data than those done by the other existing methods, in terms of both chromatin significant interactions and identifying topologically associating domains.https://github.com/BinWangCSU/DFHiC.© The Author(s) 2023.

The last decade has seen significant advances in the livestock PSC field, particularly the development of robust methods for long-term culture of PSC from several livestock species. Along with this, considerable progress has been made in understanding the states of cellular pluripotency and what they mean for cell differentiation capacity, and significant efforts are ongoing to dissect the critical signaling pathways required for the maintenance of PSC in different species and distinct states of pluripotency. Among the cell types that can be generated from PSC, the germline holds special importance as they are the genetic link between generations; and devising methods to enable in vitro gametogenesis (IVG) and produce viable gametes could revolutionize animal agriculture, wildlife conservation, and human assisted reproduction alike. Within the last decade, many pivotal studies about IVG were published using rodent models, filling some critical knowledge gaps in the field. Most importantly, the entire female reproductive cycle was reproduced in vitro from mouse ESC. Although complete male gametogenesis in vitro has not yet been reported, significant advances were made showing the capacity of germline stem cell-like cells to generate healthy offspring. In this review, we provide an overview of PSC and advances in the establishment of livestock PSC; we present the breakthroughs made in rodents regarding IVG and the current progress towards livestock IVG, including the importance of a detailed understanding of fetal germline development. Finally, we discuss some key advances that will be critical to enable this technology at scale. Given the potential impact of IVG for animal agriculture, major efforts will likely continue to be employed by research institutions and industry towards the development of methods to achieve efficient generation of gametes in vitro.© The Author(s) 2023.

"37153633","Involvement of oxytocin receptor deficiency in psychiatric disorders and behavioral abnormalities.","Front Cell Neurosci","Oxytocin and its target receptor (oxytocin receptor, OXTR) exert important roles in the regulation of complex social behaviors and cognition. The oxytocin/OXTR system in the brain could activate and transduce several intracellular signaling pathways to affect neuronal functions or responses and then mediate physiological activities. The persistence and outcome of the oxytocin activity in the brain are closely linked to the regulation, state, and expression of OXTR. Increasing evidence has shown that genetic variations, epigenetic modification states, and the expression of OXTR have been implicated in psychiatric disorders characterized by social deficits, especially in autism. Among these variations and modifications, OXTR gene methylation and polymorphism have been found in many patients with psychiatric disorders and have been considered to be associated with those psychiatric disorders, behavioral abnormalities, and individual differences in response to social stimuli or others. Given the significance of these new findings, in this review, we focus on the progress of OXTR's functions, intrinsic mechanisms, and its correlations with psychiatric disorders or deficits in behaviors. We hope that this review can provide a deep insight into the study of OXTR-involved psychiatric disorders.Copyright © 2023 Wei, Zheng, Li, Chen, Fang and Yan."

Human genome sequencing has discovered more than 500 kinases. Mutations of the kinase itself or the pathway regulated by kinases leads to the progression of diseases such as Alzheimer's, viral infections, and cancers. Cancer chemotherapy has made significant leaps in recent years. The utilization of chemotherapeutic agents for treating cancers has become difficult due to their unpredictable nature and their toxicity toward the host cells. Therefore, targeted therapy as a therapeutic option against cancer-specific cells and toward the signaling pathways is a valuable avenue of research. SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the Betacoronavirus genus that is responsible for causing the COVID pandemic. Kinase family provides a valuable source of biological targets against cancers and for recent COVID infections. Kinases such as tyrosine kinases, Rho kinase, Bruton tyrosine kinase, ABL kinases, and NAK kinases play an important role in the modulation of signaling pathways involved in both cancers and viral infections such as COVID. These kinase inhibitors consist of multiple protein targets such as the viral replication machinery and specific molecules targeting signaling pathways for cancer. Thus, kinase inhibitors can be used for their anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic activity along with cytokine suppression in cases of COVID. The main goal of this review is to focus on the pharmacology of kinase inhibitors for cancer and COVID, as well as ideas for future development.© 2023.

Broader adoption of eDNA analysis will produce many well-recognized benefits for pathogen surveillance, biodiversity monitoring, endangered and invasive species detection, and population genetics. Here we show that deep-sequencing-based eDNA approaches capture genomic information from humans (Homo sapiens) just as readily as that from the intended target species. We term this phenomenon human genetic bycatch (HGB). Additionally, high-quality human eDNA could be intentionally recovered from environmental substrates (water, sand and air), holding promise for beneficial medical, forensic and environmental applications. However, this also raises ethical dilemmas, from consent, privacy and surveillance to data ownership, requiring further consideration and potentially novel regulation. We present evidence that human eDNA is readily detectable from 'wildlife' environmental samples as human genetic bycatch, demonstrate that identifiable human DNA can be intentionally recovered from human-focused environmental sampling and discuss the translational and ethical implications of such findings.© 2023.

Our goal was to systematize research studies dedicated to the investigation of structure and functions of super-enhancers as well as to define further perspectives of the field in various applications, such as drug development and clinical use. We overviewed the fundamental studies which provided experimental data on various pathologies and their associations with particular super-enhancers. The analysis of mainstream approaches for SE search and prediction allowed us to accumulate existing data and propose directions for further algorithmic improvements of SEs' reliability levels and efficiency. Thus, here we provide the description of the most robust algorithms such as ROSE, imPROSE, and DEEPSEN and suggest their further use for various research and development tasks. The most promising research direction, which is based on topic and number of published studies, are cancer-associated super-enhancers and prospective SE-targeted therapy strategies, most of which are discussed in this review."

Recently developed self-transcribing active regulatory region sequencing (STARR-Seq) has allowed for genome-wide annotation of functional CREs. Despite this, STARR-Seq assays are only employed in cell lines, in part, due to difficulties in delivering reporter constructs. Herein, we implemented and validated a STARR-Seq-based screen in human CD4+ T cells using a non-integrating lentiviral transduction system. Lenti-STARR-Seq is the first example of a genome-wide assay of CRE function in human primary cells, identifying thousands of functional enhancers and negative regulatory elements (NREs) in human CD4+ T cells. We find an unexpected difference in nucleosome organization between enhancers and NRE: enhancers are located between nucleosomes, whereas NRE are occupied by nucleosomes in their endogenous locations. We also describe chromatin modification, eRNA production, and transcription factor binding at both enhancers and NREs. Our findings support the idea of silencer repurposing as enhancers in alternate cell types. Collectively, these data suggest that Lenti-STARR-Seq is a successful approach for CRE screening in primary human cell types, and provides an atlas of functional CREs in human CD4+ T cells.© 2023.

"37169747","Detecting recurrent passenger mutations in melanoma by targeted UV damage sequencing.","Nat Commun","Sequencing of melanomas has identified hundreds of recurrent mutations in both coding and non-coding DNA. These include a number of well-characterized oncogenic driver mutations, such as coding mutations in the BRAF and NRAS oncogenes, and non-coding mutations in the promoter of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT). However, the molecular etiology and significance of most of these mutations is unknown. Here, we use a new method known as CPD-capture-seq to map UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) with high sequencing depth and single nucleotide resolution at sites of recurrent mutations in melanoma. Our data reveal that many previously identified drivers and other recurrent mutations in melanoma occur at CPD hotspots in UV-irradiated melanocytes, often associated with an overlapping binding site of an E26 transformation-specific (ETS) transcription factor. In contrast, recurrent mutations in the promoters of a number of known or suspected cancer genes are not associated with elevated CPD levels. Our data indicate that a subset of recurrent protein-coding mutations are also likely caused by ETS-induced CPD hotspots. This analysis indicates that ETS proteins profoundly shape the mutation landscape of melanoma and reveals a method for distinguishing potential driver mutations from passenger mutations whose recurrence is due to elevated UV damage.© 2023.

This epigenome dataset was analysed with previously reported genome and transcriptome data of the overlapping group of patients from the same cohort. We performed patient-specific differential expression testing using multiregion sequencing data to identify genes that undergo both enhancer and gene expression changes. Based on the genes selected, we identified two patient groups and performed a recurrence-free survival analysis.We observed large-scale changes in the enhancer distribution between HCC tumours and the adjacent normal samples. Many of the gain-in-tumour enhancers showed corresponding upregulation of the associated genes andvice versa, but much of the enhancer and gene expression changes were patient-specific. A subset of the upregulated genes was activated in a subgroup of patients' tumours. Recurrence-free survival analysis revealed that the patients with a more robust upregulation of those genes showed a worse prognosis.We report the genomic enhancer signature associated with differential prognosis in HCC. Findings that cohere with oncofoetal reprogramming in HCC were underpinned by genome-wide enhancer rewiring. Our results present the epigenetic changes in HCC that offer the rational selection of epigenetic-driven gene targets for therapeutic intervention or disease prognostication in HCC.Lifestyle and environmental-related exposures are the important risk factors of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), suggesting that tumour-associated epigenetic dysregulations may significantly underpin HCC.

"37160995","Streamlined quantitative analysis of histone modification abundance at nucleosome-scale resolution with siQ-ChIP version 2.0.","Sci Rep","We recently introduced an absolute and physical quantitative scale for chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq). The scale itself was determined directly from measurements routinely made on sequencing samples without additional reagents or spike-ins. We called this approach sans spike-in quantitative ChIP, or siQ-ChIP. Herein, we extend those results in several ways. First, we simplified the calculations defining the quantitative scale, reducing practitioner burden. Second, we reveal a normalization constraint implied by the quantitative scale and introduce a new scheme for generating 'tracks'. The constraint requires that tracks are probability distributions so that quantified ChIP-seq is analogous to a mass distribution. Third, we introduce some whole-genome analyses that allow us, for example, to project the IP mass (immunoprecipitated mass) onto the genome to evaluate how much of any genomic interval was captured in the IP. We applied siQ-ChIP to p300/CBP inhibition and compare our results to those of others. We detail how the same data-level observations are misinterpreted in the literature when tracks are not understood as probability densities and are compared without correct quantitative scaling, and we offer new interpretations of p300/CBP inhibition outcomes.© 2023.

Here, we made the first effort to analyze the expression profiles of highly differentiated genes with eastern and western origins in 90 Uyghurs using whole-genome (30× to 60×) and transcriptome data. We screened 921 872 east-west highly differentiated genetic variants, of which ∼4.32% were expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), ∼0.12% were alternative splicing quantitative trait loci (sQTLs), and ∼0.12% showed allele-specific expression (ASE). The 8305 highly differentiated eQTLs of strong effects appear to have undergone natural selection, associated with immunity and metabolism. European-origin alleles tend to be more biasedly expressed; highly differentiated ASEs were enriched in diabetes-associated genes, likely affecting the diabetes susceptibility in the Uyghurs. We proposed an admixture-induced expression model to dissect the highly differentiated expression profiles. We provide new insights into the genetic basis of phenotypic differentiation between Western and Eastern populations, advancing our understanding of the impact of genetic admixture.© The Author(s) 2023.

Bivalent genes, that direct development and differentiation of stem cells, are found to be frequent targets of hypermethylation in cancers.Here we performed comprehensive analysis across multiple cancer types and identified that the decrease in H3K4me1 levels coincides with DNA hypermethylation at the bivalent promoter CGIs during tumorigenesis. Removal of DNA hypermethylation leads to increment of H3K4me1 at promoter CGIs with preference for bivalent genes. Nevertheless, the alteration of H3K4me1 by overexpressing or knockout LSD1, the demethylase of H3K4, doesn't change the level or pattern of DNA methylation. Moreover, LSD1 was found to regulate the expression of a bivalent gene OVOL2 to promote tumorigenesis. Knockdown of OVOL2 in LSD1 knockout HCT116 cells restored the cancer cell phenotype.In summary, our work identified a universal indicator that can pre-mark DNA hypermethylation in cancer cells, and dissected the interplay between H3K4me1 and DNA hypermethylation in detail.

However, the epigenotype dictated by, in addition to other mechanisms, DNA methylation is also strongly influenced by the individual's genotype. Hence, we performed a DNA methylation study using EPIC arrays on 7 monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs discordant for ALS in whole blood, which serves as an ideal model for eliminating the effects of the genetic-epigenetic interplay to a large extent. We found one CpG site showing intra-pair hypermethylation in the affected co-twins, which maps to the Glutamate Ionotropic Receptor Kainate Type Subunit 1 gene (GRIK1). Additionally, we found 4 DMPs which were subsequently confirmed using 2 different statistical approaches. Differentially methylated regions or blocks could not be detected within the scope of this work. In conclusion, we revealed that despite a low sample size, monozygotic twin studies discordant for the disease can bring new insights into epigenetic processes in ALS, pointing to new target loci for further investigations.© The Author(s) 2023."

A potential factor indicating the occurrence of HPV-positive OSCC is a change in the degree of methylation of gene promoters that play a key role in the immune response. In this study, we investigated the difference in the methylation ofEDARADD,GBP4,HAVCR2,HLA DPB1,IL12RB1,MARCO, andSIGLEC12gene promoters in samples of healthy oral mucosa versus samples of oral and oropharyngeal cancer. The presence of HPV infection in samples was examined earlier. To determine the difference in methylation of those gene promotors, isolated and bisulfite-modified DNA was analysed by the methylation-specific PCR method. The investigated gene promoters were found to be more hypomethylated in the oral and oropharyngeal cancer samples in comparison to normal tissue. The proportion of unmethylated gene promoters was similar in HPV-positive and HPV-negative cancers, although the data should be confirmed on a larger set of samples. To conclude, in samples of healthy oral mucosa, the investigated gene promoters were found to be methylated in a high percentage (73.3% to 100%), while in oral and oropharyngeal cancer samples, they were methylated in a low percentage (11.1% to 37%), regardless of HPV infection."

However, the role of ALDOB in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) patients has not been clearly elucidated. Therefore, this study aimed to comprehensively explore the expression level, prognostic value, functional enrichment, immune infiltration, and N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification of ALDOB in ccRCC patients.A total of 1,070 ccRCC tissues and 409 normal tissues from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, and the ArrayExpress database were enrolled to evaluate the expression level and prognostic value of ALDOB in ccRCC. The Kaplan-Meier survival curves and the Log-Rank test were performed to assess the prognostic value. The univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis were used to identify the independent prognostic predictors in ccRCC patients. In addition, R version 4.2.0 with its suitable packages were used to perform the functional enrichment analysis, immune infiltration analysis, and m6A methylation analysis. Statistical significance was set at the P value <0.05.The expression level of ALDOB was significantly down-regulated in ccRCC compared to normal tissue, and the ALDOB expression level was noticeably correlated with T stage, M stage, and histologic grade of patients with ccRCC. The survival analysis revealed that ALODB was the independent predictor of overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), and progression-free survival (PFS) of ccRCC patients. In addition, the functional enrichment analysis showed that ALDOB and its related genes were mainly involved in the metabolism and metabolic pathways of multiple substances, including glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and fatty acid degradation. Finally, the immune infiltration analysis and the m6A methylation analysis suggested that ALDOB was closely correlated with the infiltration abundance of immune cells and stromal cells in the tumor microenvironment and several types of m6A regulators in ccRCC.As a potential prognostic biomarker for patients with ccRCC, downregulation of ALDOB was closely associated with the clinicopathological features, poor prognosis, immune infiltration, and m6A modification in ccRCC patients.2023 Translational Andrology and Urology.

Samples from 408 patients who underwent surgery for colon and rectal cancer between 2006 and 2011, including a sub-cohort of 127 (31%) patients treated with adjuvant therapy, were analyzed. In Kaplan-Meier survival analyses, we found that high MRE11 expression in the tumor center (TC) was significantly associated with poor disease-free survival (DFS;p= 0.045) and overall survival (OS;p= 0.039). Intriguingly, high MRE11 expression in the TC was also significantly correlated with reduced DFS (p= 0.005) and OS (p= 0.010) in the subgroup with right-sided primary CRC. In multivariate analyses, high MRE11 expression (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.697, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.034-2.785;p= 0.036) and lymphovascular/perineural invasion (LVI/PNI; HR = 1.922, 95% CI 1.122-3.293;p= 0.017) showed significant association with worse OS in patients with right-sided tumors but not those with left-sided tumors. Moreover, in patients with right-sided tumors, high MRE11 was associated with worse OS for those with lymph node involvement (p= 0.006) and LVI/PNI (p= 0.049).

Supplementation with the marine omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is associated with lower CVD risk. However, results from randomized controlled trials that examine the effect of omega-3 supplementation on CVD risk are inconsistent. This risk-reducing effect may be mediated by reducing inflammation, oxidative stress and serum triglyceride (TG) levels. However, not all individuals respond by reducing TG levels after omega-3 supplementation. This inter-individual variability in TG response to omega-3 supplementation is not fully understood. Hence, we aim to review the evidence for how interactions between omega-3 fatty acid supplementation and genetic variants, epigenetic and gene expression profiling, gut microbiota and habitual intake of omega-3 fatty acids can explain why the TG response differs between individuals. This may contribute to understanding the current controversies and play a role in defining future personalized guidelines to prevent CVD.Copyright © 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

We performed a genome-wide association study on the largest collection of amyloid imaging data (N = 13,409) to date, across multiple ethnicities from multicenter cohorts to identify variants associated with brain amyloidosis and AD risk. We found a strong APOE signal on chr19q.13.32 (top SNP: APOE ɛ4; rs429358; β = 0.35, SE = 0.01, P = 6.2 × 10-311, MAF = 0.19), driven by APOE ɛ4, and five additional novel associations (APOE ε2/rs7412; rs73052335/rs5117, rs1081105, rs438811, and rs4420638) independent of APOE ɛ4. APOE ɛ4 and ε2 showed race specific effect with stronger association in Non-Hispanic Whites, with the lowest association in Asians. Besides the APOE, we also identified three other genome-wide loci: ABCA7 (rs12151021/chr19p.13.3; β = 0.07, SE = 0.01, P = 9.2 × 10-09, MAF = 0.32), CR1 (rs6656401/chr1q.32.2; β = 0.1, SE = 0.02, P = 2.4 × 10-10, MAF = 0.18) and FERMT2 locus (rs117834516/chr14q.22.1; β = 0.16, SE = 0.03, P = 1.1 × 10-09, MAF = 0.06) that all colocalized with AD risk. Sex-stratified analyses identified two novel female-specific signals on chr5p.14.1 (rs529007143, β = 0.79, SE = 0.14, P = 1.4 × 10-08, MAF = 0.006, sex-interaction P = 9.8 × 10-07) and chr11p.15.2 (rs192346166, β = 0.94, SE = 0.17, P = 3.7 × 10-08, MAF = 0.004, sex-interaction P = 1.3 × 10-03). We also demonstrated that the overall genetic architecture of brain amyloidosis overlaps with that of AD, Frontotemporal Dementia, stroke, and brain structure-related complex human traits. Overall, our results have important implications when estimating the individual risk to a population level, as race and sex will needed to be taken into account. This may affect participant selection for future clinical trials and therapies.© 2023. The Author(s)."

This article is a narrative review of the literature and a summary of the main observations, conclusions, and perspectives raised in the literature and the study projects of the Working Group of Childhood Obesity (WGChO) of the Italian Society of Paediatric Endocrinology and Diabetology (ISPED) on MetS in childhood obesity. Although there is an agreement on the distinctive features of MetS, no international diagnostic criteria in a pediatric population exist. Moreover, to date, the prevalence of MetS in childhood is not certain and thus the true value of diagnosis of MetS in youth as well as its clinical implications, is unclear. The aim of this narrative review is to summarize the pathogenesis and current role of MetS in children and adolescents with particular reference to applicability in clinical practice in childhood obesity."

Studies to date have focused on the utility of e-cigarettes as a smoking cessation tool, but the biological effects are largely unknown.To identify transcriptomic differences in the blood and sputum of e-cigarette users compared to conventional cigarettes smokers and healthy controls and describe biological pathways affected by these tobacco products.Cross-sectional analysis of whole blood and sputum RNA-sequencing data from 8 smokers, 9 e-cigarette users (e-cigs) and 4 controls. Weighted gene co-network analysis (WGCNA) identified gene module associations. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) identified canonical pathways associated with tobacco products.In blood, a three-group comparison showed 16 differentially expressed genes (DEGs); pair-wise comparison showed 7 DEGs between e-cigs and controls, 35 DEGs between smokers and controls, and 13 DEGs between smokers and e-cigs. In sputum, 438 DEGs were in the three-group comparison. In pair-wise comparisons, there were 2 DEGs between e-cigs and controls, 270 DEGs between smokers and controls, and 468 DEGs between smokers and e-cigs. Only 2 genes in the smokers vs. control comparison overlapped between blood and sputum. Most gene modules identified through WGCNA associated with tobacco product exposures also were associated with cotinine and exhaled CO levels. IPA showed more canonical pathways altered by conventional cigarette smoking than by e-cigarette use.Cigarette smoking and e-cigarette use led to transcriptomic changes in both blood and sputum. However, conventional cigarettes induced much stronger transcriptomic responses in both compartments.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Height, weight, BMI, 25-hydroxy vitamin D, parathyroid hormone, glycemic status, and lipid profile (TG, LDL, HDL, and TC) of CYP2R1 were measured in 100 women (31 normal and 69 obese patients).Our result shows that hypermethylation in site 2 of the CYP2R1 gene with body weight (p < 0.004), BMI (p < 0.002), waist circumference (p < 0.002), total-LDL (p < 0.027), total cholesterol (p < 0.022), and vitamin D (VD) (close to borderline significance p < 0.06) and site 4 of CYP2R1 with LDL (p < 0.041) in the four tested sites among normal and obese women was significantly associated. Moreover, we tested five different CpG sites in the CYP27B1 gene where site 5 correlated significantly with VD levels.Our present study clearly indicates that hypermethylation of specific sites in the CYP2R1 and CYP27B1 genes might regulate gene expression with special reference to the risk of obesity and vitamin D metabolism.© 2023.

Causes and contributors underpinning the CHD and NDD paradigm are not fully understood, and likely include innate patient factors, such as genetic and epigenetic factors, prenatal haemodynamic consequences as a result of the heart defect, and factors affecting the fetal-placental-maternal environment, such as placental pathology, maternal diet, psychological stress and autoimmune disease. Additional postnatal factors, including the type and complexity of disease and other clinical factors such as prematurity, peri-operative factors and socioeconomic factors are also expected to play a role in determining the final presentation of the NDD. Despite significant advances in knowledge and strategies to optimise outcomes, the extent to which adverse neurodevelopment can be modified remains unknown. Understanding biological and structural phenotypes associated with NDD in CHD are vital for understanding disease mechanisms, which in turn will advance the development of effective intervention strategies for those at risk. This review article summarises our current knowledge surrounding biological, structural, and genetic contributors to NDD in CHD and describes avenues for future research; highlighting the need for translational studies that bridge the gap between basic science and clinical practice.2023 Translational Pediatrics.

"37165157","The contribution of the exposome to the burden of cardiovascular disease.","Nat Rev Cardiol","Large epidemiological and health impact assessment studies at the global scale, such as the Global Burden of Disease project, indicate that chronic non-communicable diseases, such as atherosclerosis and diabetes mellitus, caused almost two-thirds of the annual global deaths in 2020. By 2030, 77% of all deaths are expected to be caused by non-communicable diseases. Although this increase is mainly due to the ageing of the general population in Western societies, other reasons include the increasing effects of soil, water, air and noise pollution on health, together with the effects of other environmental risk factors such as climate change, unhealthy city designs (including lack of green spaces), unhealthy lifestyle habits and psychosocial stress. The exposome concept was established in 2005 as a new strategy to study the effect of the environment on health. The exposome describes the harmful biochemical and metabolic changes that occur in our body owing to the totality of different environmental exposures throughout the life course, which ultimately lead to adverse health effects and premature deaths. In this Review, we describe the exposome concept with a focus on environmental physical and chemical exposures and their effects on the burden of cardiovascular disease. We discuss selected exposome studies and highlight the relevance of the exposome concept for future health research as well as preventive medicine. We also discuss the challenges and limitations of exposome studies.© 2023. Springer Nature Limited."

Although there is no single gene that results in the development of FM, this study reveals that certain polymorphisms in genes involved in the catecholaminergic pathway, the serotonergic pathway, pain processing, oxidative stress, and inflammation may influence susceptibility to FM and the severity of its symptoms. Furthermore, epigenetic changes at the DNA level may lead to the development of FM. Likewise, microRNAs may impact the expression of certain proteins that lead to the worsening of FM-associated symptoms."

The first step in reducing body weight is a calorie-restricted diet. To date, there are many different diet types available, including the ketogenic diet (KD) which is recently gaining a lot of attention. However, all the physiological consequences of KD in the human body are not fully understood. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of an eight-week, isocaloric, energy-restricted, KD as a weight management solution in women with overweight and obesity compared to a standard, balanced diet with the same calorie content. The primary outcome is to evaluate the effects of a KD on body weight and composition. The secondary outcomes are to evaluate the effect of KD-related weight loss on inflammation, oxidative stress, nutritional status, profiles of metabolites in breath, which informs about the metabolic changes in the body, obesity and diabetes-associated parameters, including a lipid profile, status of adipokines and hormones. Notably, in this trial, the long-term effects and efficiency of the KD will be studied. In summary, the proposed study will fill the gap in knowledge about the effects of KD on inflammation, obesity-associated parameters, nutritional deficiencies, oxidative stress and metabolism in a single study.

"37152101","Arsenic and Diabetes Mellitus: A Putative Role for the Immune System.","All Life","Diabetes mellitus (DM) is an enormous public health issue worldwide. Recent data suggest that chronic arsenic exposure is linked to the risk of developing type 1 and type 2 DM, albeit the underlying mechanisms are unclear. This review discusses the role of the immune system as a link to possibly explain some of the mechanisms of developing T1DM or T2DM associated with arsenic exposure in humans, animal models, andin vitrostudies. The rationale for the hypothesis includes: (1) Arsenic is a well-recognized modulator of the immune system; (2) arsenic exposures are associated with increased risk of DM; and (3) dysregulation of the immune system is one of the hallmarks in the pathogenesis of both T1DM and T2DM. A better understanding of DM in association with immune dysregulation and arsenic exposures may help to understand how environmental exposures modulate the immune system and how these effects may impact the manifestation of disease."
"37112557","Contaminants of Emerging Concern (CECs) and Male Reproductive Health: Challenging the Future with a Double-Edged Sword.","Toxics","Approximately 9% of couples are infertile, with half of these cases relating to male factors. While many cases of male infertility are associated with genetic and lifestyle factors, approximately 30% of cases are still idiopathic. Contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) denote substances identified in the environment for the first time or detected at low concentrations during water quality analysis. Since CEC production and use have increased in recent decades, CECs are now ubiquitous in surface and groundwater. CECs are increasingly observed in human tissues, and parallel reports indicate that semen quality is continuously declining, supporting the notion that CECs may play a role in infertility. This narrative review focuses on several CECs (including pesticides and pharmaceuticals) detected in the nearshore marine environment of False Bay, Cape Town, South Africa, and deliberates their potential effects on male fertility and the offspring of exposed parents, as well as the use of spermatozoa in toxicological studies. Collective findings report that chronic in vivo exposure to pesticides, including atrazine, simazine, and chlorpyrifos, is likely to be detrimental to the reproduction of many organisms, as well as to sperm performance in vitro. Similarly, exposure to pharmaceuticals such as diclofenac and naproxen impairs sperm motility both in vivo and in vitro. These contaminants are also likely to play a key role in health and disease in offspring sired by parents exposed to CECs. On the other side of the double-edged sword, we propose that due to its sensitivity to environmental conditions, spermatozoa could be used as a bioindicator in eco- and repro-toxicology studies."
"37142891","Genetic characterization of Macaca arctoides: A highlight of key genes and pathways.","Primates","When compared to the approximately 22 other macaque species, Macaca arctoides has many unique phenotypes. These traits fall into various phenotypic categories, including genitalia, coloration, mating, and olfactory traits. Here we used a previously identified whole genome set of 690 outlier genes to look for possible genetic explanations of these unique traits. Of these, 279 genes were annotated miRNAs, which are non-coding. Patterns within the remaining outliers in coding genes were investigated using GO (n = 370) and String (n = 383) analysis, which showed many interconnected immune-related genes. Further, we compared the outliers to candidate pathways associated with M. arcotides' unique phenotypes, revealing 10/690 outlier genes that overlapped these four pathways: hedgehog signaling, WNT signaling, olfactory, and melanogenesis. Of these, genes in all pathways except olfactory had higher FSTvalues than the rest of the genes in the genome based on permutation tests. Overall, our results point to many genes each having a small impact on phenotype, working in tandem to cause large systemic changes. Additionally, these results may indicate pleiotropy. This seems to be especially true with the development and coloration of M. arctoides. Our results highlight that development, melanogenesis, immune function, and miRNAs may be heavily involved in M. arctoides' evolutionary history.© 2023.

"37071997","SRSF1 haploinsufficiency is responsible for a syndromic developmental disorder associated with intellectual disability.","Am J Hum Genet","SRSF1 (also known as ASF/SF2) is a non-small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (non-snRNP) that belongs to the arginine/serine (R/S) domain family. It recognizes and binds to mRNA, regulating both constitutive and alternative splicing. The complete loss of this proto-oncogene in mice is embryonically lethal. Through international data sharing, we identified 17 individuals (10 females and 7 males) with a neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD) with heterozygous germline SRSF1 variants, mostly de novo, including three frameshift variants, three nonsense variants, seven missense variants, and two microdeletions within region 17q22 encompassing SRSF1. Only in one family, the de novo origin could not be established. All individuals featured a recurrent phenotype including developmental delay and intellectual disability (DD/ID), hypotonia, neurobehavioral problems, with variable skeletal (66.7%) and cardiac (46%) anomalies. To investigate the functional consequences of SRSF1 variants, we performed in silico structural modeling, developed an in vivo splicing assay in Drosophila, and carried out episignature analysis in blood-derived DNA from affected individuals. We found that all loss-of-function and 5 out of 7 missense variants were pathogenic, leading to a loss of SRSF1 splicing activity in Drosophila, correlating with a detectable and specific DNA methylation episignature. In addition, our orthogonal in silico, in vivo, and epigenetics analyses enabled the separation of clearly pathogenic missense variants from those with uncertain significance. Overall, these results indicated that haploinsufficiency of SRSF1 is responsible for a syndromic NDD with ID due to a partial loss of SRSF1-mediated splicing activity.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

To contribute toward a molecular understanding of aging, we analyzed age-resolved transcriptomic data from multiple studies. Here, we show that transcript length alone explains most transcriptional changes observed with aging in mice and humans. We present three lines of evidence supporting the biological importance of the uncovered transcriptome imbalance. First, in vertebrates the length association primarily displays a lower relative abundance of long transcripts in aging. Second, eight antiaging interventions of the Interventions Testing Program of the National Institute on Aging can counter this length association. Third, we find that in humans and mice the genes with the longest transcripts enrich for genes reported to extend lifespan, whereas those with the shortest transcripts enrich for genes reported to shorten lifespan. Our study opens fundamental questions on aging and the organization of transcriptomes.© 2022. The Author(s)."

Despite remarkable improvements in our understanding of these pathogeneses, serious worldwide problems with significant public health burdens are remained. Therefore, new efficient diagnostic and therapeutic strategies are urgently required. PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are a major class of small non-coding RNAs that silence gene expression through transcriptional and post-transcriptional processes. Recent studies have demonstrated that piRNAs, originally found in the germ line, are also produced in non-gonadal somatic cells, including neurons, and further revealed the emerging roles of piRNAs, including their roles in neurodevelopment, aging, and neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we aimed to summarize the current knowledge regarding the piRNA roles in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases. In this context, we first reviewed on recent updates on neuronal piRNA functions, including biogenesis, axon regeneration, behavior, and memory formation, in humans and mice. We also discuss the aberrant expression and dysregulation of neuronal piRNAs in neurodegenerative diseases, such as AD, PD, and ALS. Moreover, we review pioneering preclinical studies on piRNAs as biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Elucidation of the mechanisms underlying piRNA biogenesis and their functions in the brain would provide new perspectives for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of AD and various neurodegenerative diseases.Copyright © 2023 Sato, Takayama and Inoue."

At a molecular level, it is marked by the gradual alterations of biomolecules. Indeed, important changes are observed on the DNA, as well as at a protein level, that are influenced by both genetic and environmental parameters. These molecular changes directly contribute to the development or progression of several human pathologies, including cancer, diabetes, osteoporosis, neurodegenerative disorders and others aging-related diseases. Additionally, they increase the risk of mortality. Therefore, deciphering the hallmarks of aging represents a possibility for identifying potential druggable targets to attenuate the aging process, and then the age-related comorbidities. Given the link between aging, genetic, and epigenetic alterations, and given the reversible nature of epigenetic mechanisms, the precisely understanding of these factors may provide a potential therapeutic approach for age-related decline and disease.

Thus, it is important to determine the differences between metabolically healthy obese individuals and those with metabolic disorders. The aim of this study was to perform an untargeted metabolomics assay in women with morbid obesity (MO) compared to a normal weight group, and to differentiate the metabolome of these women with MO who present with T2DM. We carried out a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based untargeted metabolomics assay using serum samples of 209 Caucasian women: 73 with normal weight and 136 with MO, of which 71 had T2DM. First, we found increased levels of choline and acylglycerols and lower levels of bile acids, steroids, ceramides, glycosphingolipids, lysophosphatidylcholines, and lysophosphatidylethanolamines in MO women than in the control group. Then, in MO women with T2DM, we found increased levels of glutamate, propionyl-carnitine, bile acids, ceramides, lysophosphatidylcholine 14:0, phosphatidylinositols and phosphoethanolamines, and lower levels of Phe-Ile/Leu. Thus, we found metabolites with opposite trends of concentration in the two metabolomic analyses. These metabolites could be considered possible new factors of study in the pathogenesis of MO and associated T2DM in women."

This study aims to find out how hyperglycemia affect oxidative stress and then the expression and methylation of endothelin 1 (ET-1) gene in in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC).Methods:Cells were cultured in growth medium and exposed to low and high glucose concentrations to mimic normal and diabetic condition respectively. Computational analysis were performed using UCSC genome browser and eukaryotic promoter database (EPD). The expression of ET-1 gene was investigated by real time PCR. Cytotoxicity and oxidative stress were determined by MTT and DCFH-DA assays respectively. Promoter methylation was assessed by the bisulfite sequencing method.Results:DCFH-DA assay showed that hyperglycemia can significantly increase the regulation of reactive oxygen species synthesis. The relative expression of ET-1 gene was increased due to exposure to high glucose concentration. MTT assay revealed reduced viability of cells due to the glucose induced damage. Methylation analysis revealed hypomethylation of the promoter of ET-1 however the difference was not significant. Out of 175 CpGs at 25 CpG sites, only 36 CpGs were methylated (20.5% methylation) in cell treated with normal glucose. Upon exposure to high glucose only 30 CpGs were methylated in 175 CpGs at 25 CpG sites (17.1% methylation).Discussion:Our study concludes a significantly high expression of ET-1 gene in response to high glucose exposure in HUVECs. It also reports that hyperglycemic condition leads to elevated oxidative stress. No significant change was found in methylation when cells were treated with high and low glucose concentrations.Copyright © 2023 Binjawhar, Alhazmi, Bin Jawhar, MohammedSaeed and Safi."

The twin design is also a valuable tool for studying causality, intergenerational transmission, and gene-environment correlation and interaction. Here we review recent developments in twin studies, recent results from twin studies of new phenotypes and recent insights into twinning. We ask whether the results of existing twin studies are representative of the general population and of global diversity, and we conclude that stronger efforts to increase representativeness are needed. We provide an updated overview of twin concordance and discordance for major diseases and mental disorders, which conveys a crucial message: genetic influences are not as deterministic as many believe. This has important implications for public understanding of genetic risk prediction tools, as the accuracy of genetic predictions can never exceed identical twin concordance rates.© 2023.

Administration of Rg1 (30 and 60 μmol/kg) and Rb1 (30 and 60 μmol/kg) for 2 weeks resulted in a significant amelioration of impaired spatial and associative learning and memory caused by 4-week HLS exposure, measured using the Morris water maze and Reward operating conditioning reflex (ROCR) tests, respectively. Furthermore, Rg1 and Rb1 administration alleviated reactive oxygen species production and enhanced antioxidant enzyme activities in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Rg1 and Rb1 also assisted in the recovery of mitochondrial complex I (NADH dehydrogenase) activities, increased the expression of Mfn2 and decreased the fission marker dynamin-related protein (Drp)-1expression. Additionally, Rg1 and Rb1 treatment increased the SYN, and PSD95 protein expressions and decreased the ratio of Bax:Bcl-2 and reduced the expression of cleaved caspase-3 and cytochrome C. Besides these, the BDNF-TrkB/PI3K-Akt pathway was also activated by Rg1 and Rb1 treatment. Altogether, Rg1 and Rb1 treatment attenuated cognitive deficits induced by HLS, mitigated mitochondrial dysfunction, attenuated oxidative stress, inhibited apoptosis, increased synaptic plasticity, and restored BDNF-TrkB/PI3K-Akt signaling.Copyright © 2023 Jiang, Lv, Zhang, Sun, Yao, Wang, He and Liu."
"37075072","Fragmentation landscape of cell-free DNA revealed by deconvolutional analysis of end motifs.","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) fragmentation is nonrandom, at least partially mediated by various DNA nucleases, forming characteristic cfDNA end motifs. However, there is a paucity of tools for deciphering the relative contributions of cfDNA cleavage patterns related to underlying fragmentation factors. In this study, through non-negative matrix factorization algorithm, we used 256 5' 4-mer end motifs to identify distinct types of cfDNA cleavage patterns, referred to as ""founder"" end-motif profiles (F-profiles). F-profiles were associated with different DNA nucleases based on whether such patterns were disrupted in nuclease-knockout mouse models. Contributions of individual F-profiles in a cfDNA sample could be determined by deconvolutional analysis. We analyzed 93 murine cfDNA samples of different nuclease-deficient mice and identified six types of F-profiles. F-profiles I, II, and III were linked to deoxyribonuclease 1 like 3 (DNASE1L3), deoxyribonuclease 1 (DNASE1), and DNA fragmentation factor subunit beta (DFFB), respectively. We revealed that 42.9% of plasma cfDNA molecules were attributed to DNASE1L3-mediated fragmentation, whereas 43.4% of urinary cfDNA molecules involved DNASE1-mediated fragmentation. We further demonstrated that the relative contributions of F-profiles were useful to inform pathological states, such as autoimmune disorders and cancer. Among the six F-profiles, the use of F-profile I could inform the human patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. F-profile VI could be used to detect individuals with hepatocellular carcinoma, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.97. F-profile VI was more prominent in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma undergoing chemoradiotherapy. We proposed that this profile might be related to oxidative stress."

Chemokine interactions with receptors trigger signaling pathway activity to form a network fundamental to diverse immune processes, including host homeostasis and responses to disease. Genetic and nongenetic regulation of both the expression and structure of chemokines and receptors conveys chemokine functional heterogeneity. Imbalances and defects in the system contribute to the pathogenesis of a variety of diseases, including cancer, immune and inflammatory diseases, and metabolic and neurological disorders, which render the system a focus of studies aiming to discover therapies and important biomarkers. The integrated view of chemokine biology underpinning divergence and plasticity has provided insights into immune dysfunction in disease states, including, among others, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this review, by reporting the latest advances in chemokine biology and results from analyses of a plethora of sequencing-based datasets, we outline recent advances in the understanding of the genetic variations and nongenetic heterogeneity of chemokines and receptors and provide an updated view of their contribution to the pathophysiological network, focusing on chemokine-mediated inflammation and cancer. Clarification of the molecular basis of dynamic chemokine-receptor interactions will help advance the understanding of chemokine biology to achieve precision medicine application in the clinic.© 2023.

The present study aimed to explore the associations of breast cancer risk and prognosis with reproductive tract infections and the modification effects of estrogen exposure.We collected history of reproductive tract infections, menstruation and reproduction from 1003 cases and 1107 controls and a cohort of 4264 breast cancer patients during 2008-2018 in Guangzhou, China. We used logistic regression model to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for risk; Cox model was applied to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).It was found that previous reproductive tract infections were negatively associated with breast cancer risk (OR = 0.80, 95%CI, 0.65-0.98), particularly for patients with more menstrual cycles (OR = 0.74, 95%CI, 0.57-0.96). Patients with previous reproductive tract infections experienced better OS (HR = 0.61; 95% CI, 0.40-0.94) and PFS (HR = 0.84; 95% CI, 0.65-1.09). This protective effect on PFS was only found in patients with more menstrual cycles (HR = 0.52, 95% CI:0.34-0.79, Pinteraction = 0.015).The findings suggested that reproductive tract infections may be protective for the initiation and development of breast cancer, particularly for women with a longer interval of lifetime estrogen exposure.© 2023.

"37217528","Unlocking multidimensional cancer therapeutics using geometric data science.","Sci Rep","Personalised approaches to cancer therapeutics primarily involve identification of patient sub-populations most likely to benefit from targeted drugs. Such a stratification has led to plethora of designs of clinical trials that are often too complex due to the need for incorporating biomarkers and tissue types. Many statistical methods have been developed to address these issues; however, by the time such methodology is available research in cancer has moved on to new challenges and therefore in order to avoid playing catch-up it is necessary to develop new analytic tools alongside. One of the challenges facing cancer therapy is to effectively and appropriately target multiple therapies for sensitive patient population based on a panel of biomarkers across multiple cancer types, and matched future trial designs. We present novel geometric methods (mathematical theory of hypersurfaces) to visualise complex cancer therapeutics data as multidimensional, as well as geometric representation of oncology trial design space in higher dimensions. The hypersurfaces are used to describe master protocols, with application to a specific example of a basket trial design for melanoma, and thus setup a framework for further incorporating multi-omics data as multidimensional therapeutics.© 2023.

"37208442","The chemokine monocyte chemoattractant protein-1/CCL2 is a promoter of breast cancer metastasis.","Cell Mol Immunol","Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer worldwide, and metastasis is the leading cause of death in cancer patients. Human monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1/CCL2) was isolated from the culture supernatants of not only mitogen-activated peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes but also malignant glioma cells based on its in vitro chemotactic activity toward human monocytes. MCP-1 was subsequently found to be identical to a previously described tumor cell-derived chemotactic factor thought to be responsible for the accumulation of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), and it became a candidate target of clinical intervention; however, the role of TAMs in cancer development was still controversial at the time of the discovery of MCP-1. The in vivo role of MCP-1 in cancer progression was first evaluated by examining human cancer tissues, including breast cancers. Positive correlations between the level of MCP-1 production in tumors and the degree of TAM infiltration and cancer progression were established. The contribution of MCP-1 to the growth of primary tumors and metastasis to the lung, bone, and brain was examined in mouse breast cancer models. The results of these studies strongly suggested that MCP-1 is a promoter of breast cancer metastasis to the lung and brain but not bone. Potential mechanisms of MCP-1 production in the breast cancer microenvironment have also been reported. In the present manuscript, we review studies in which the role of MCP-1 in breast cancer development and progression and the mechanisms of its production were examined and attempt to draw a consensus and discuss the potential use of MCP-1 as a biomarker for diagnosis.© 2023.

"37207166","Identification of prognostic cancer-associated fibroblast markers in luminal breast cancer using weighted gene co-expression network analysis.","Front Oncol","Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play a pivotal role in cancer progression and are known to mediate endocrine and chemotherapy resistance through paracrine signaling. Additionally, they directly influence the expression and growth dependence of ER in Luminal breast cancer (LBC). This study aims to investigate stromal CAF-related factors and develop a CAF-related classifier to predict the prognosis and therapeutic outcomes in LBC.The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases were utilized to obtain mRNA expression and clinical information from 694 and 101 LBC samples, respectively. CAF infiltrations were determined by estimating the proportion of immune and cancer cells (EPIC) method, while stromal scores were calculated using the Estimation of STromal and Immune cells in MAlignant Tumors using Expression data (ESTIMATE) algorithm. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to identify stromal CAF-related genes. A CAF risk signature was developed through univariate and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator method (LASSO) Cox regression model. The Spearman test was used to evaluate the correlation between CAF risk score, CAF markers, and CAF infiltrations estimated through EPIC, xCell, microenvironment cell populations-counter (MCP-counter), and Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE) algorithms. The TIDE algorithm was further utilized to assess the response to immunotherapy. Additionally, Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was applied to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the findings.We constructed a 5-gene prognostic model consisting of RIN2, THBS1, IL1R1, RAB31, and COL11A1 for CAF. Using the median CAF risk score as the cutoff, we classified LBC patients into high- and low-CAF-risk groups and found that those in the high-risk group had a significantly worse prognosis. Spearman correlation analyses demonstrated a strong positive correlation between the CAF risk score and stromal and CAF infiltrations, with the five model genes showing positive correlations with CAF markers. In addition, the TIDE analysis revealed that high-CAF-risk patients were less likely to respond to immunotherapy. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) identified significant enrichment of ECM receptor interaction, regulation of actin cytoskeleton, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and TGF-β signaling pathway gene sets in the high-CAF-risk group patients.The five-gene prognostic CAF signature presented in this study was not only reliable for predicting prognosis in LBC patients, but it was also effective in estimating clinical immunotherapy response. These findings have significant clinical implications, as the signature may guide tailored anti-CAF therapy in combination with immunotherapy for LBC patients.Copyright © 2023 Xu, Xu, Luo, Huang, Gong and Fu."

These characteristics determine inherent and acquired resistance, which need to be overcome for improving patient survival. In line with the global efforts in identifying druggable resistance factors, extensive preclinical research of the Cordes lab and others designated the cancer adhesome as a critical and general therapy resistance mechanism with multiple druggable cancer targets. In our study, we addressed pancancer cell adhesion mechanisms by connecting the preclinical datasets generated in the Cordes lab with publicly available transcriptomic and patient survival data. We identified similarly changed differentially expressed genes (scDEGs) in nine cancers and their corresponding cell models relative to normal tissues. Those scDEGs interconnected with 212 molecular targets from Cordes lab datasets generated during two decades of research on adhesome and radiobiology. Intriguingly, integrative analysis of adhesion associated scDEGs, TCGA patient survival and protein-protein network reconstruction revealed a set of overexpressed genes adversely affecting overall cancer patient survival and specifically the survival in radiotherapy-treated cohorts. This pancancer gene set includes key integrins (e.g. ITGA6, ITGB1, ITGB4) and their interconnectors (e.g. SPP1, TGFBI), affirming their critical role in the cancer adhesion resistome. In summary, this meta-analysis demonstrates the importance of the adhesome in general, and integrins together with their interconnectors in particular, as potentially conserved determinants and therapeutic targets in cancer.© 2023 The Authors."

Investigating the mechanisms underlying NED is conducive to designing appropriate treatment options for NSCLC patients.In the present study, we integrated multiple lung cancer datasets to identify neuroendocrine features using a one-class logistic regression (OCLR) machine learning algorithm trained on small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cells, a pulmonary neuroendocrine cell type, based on the transcriptome of NSCLC and named the NED index (NEDI). Single-sample gene set enrichment analysis, pathway enrichment analysis, ESTIMATE algorithm analysis, and unsupervised subclass mapping (SubMap) were performed to assess the altered pathways and immune characteristics of lung cancer samples with different NEDI values.We developed and validated a novel one-class predictor based on the expression values of 13,279 mRNAs to quantitatively evaluate neuroendocrine features in NSCLC. We observed that a higher NEDI correlated with better prognosis in patients with LUAD. In addition, we observed that a higher NEDI was significantly associated with reduced immune cell infiltration and immune effector molecule expression. Furthermore, we found that etoposide-based chemotherapy might be more effective in the treatment of LUAD with high NEDI values. Moreover, we noted that tumours with low NEDI values had better responses to immunotherapy than those with high NEDI values.Our findings improve the understanding of NED and provide a useful strategy for applying NEDI-based risk stratification to guide decision-making in the treatment of LUAD.© 2023.

However, the mechanism by which the acquisition of squamous lineage phenotypes leads to a poor prognosis remains unclear. We previously reported that retinoic acid signaling via retinoic acid receptor γ (RARγ signaling) determines the differentiation lineage into the esophageal squamous epithelium. These findings hypothesized that the activation of RARγ signaling contributed to acquiring squamous lineage phenotypes and malignant behavior in PDAC.This study utilized public databases and immunostaining of surgical specimens to examine RARγ expression in PDAC. We evaluated the function of RARγ signaling by inhibitors and siRNA knockdown using a PDAC cell line and patient-derived PDAC organoids. The mechanism of the tumor-suppressive effects by blocking RARγ signaling was examined by a cell cycle analysis, apoptosis assays, RNA sequencing and Western blotting.RARγ expression in pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) and PDAC was higher than that in the normal pancreatic duct. Its expression correlated with a poor patient prognosis in PDAC. In PDAC cell lines, blockade of RARγ signaling suppressed cell proliferation by inducing cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase without causing apoptosis. We demonstrated that blocking RARγ signaling upregulated p21 and p27 and downregulated many cell cycle genes, including cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2), CDK4 and CDK6. Furthermore, using patient-derived PDAC organoids, we confirmed the tumor-suppressive effect of RARγ inhibition and indicated the synergistic effects of RARγ inhibition with gemcitabine.This study clarified the function of RARγ signaling in PDAC progression and demonstrated the tumor-suppressive effect of selective blockade of RARγ signaling against PDAC. These results suggest that RARγ signaling might be a new therapeutic target for PDAC.© 2023. The Author(s)."

However, the mechanism of pyroptosis in colorectal cancer (CRC) remains still unclear. Therefore, this study investigated the role of pyroptosis in CRC.A pyroptosis-related risk model was developed using univariate Cox regression and LASSO Cox regression analyses. Based on this model, pyroptosis-related risk scores (PRS) of CRC samples with OS time > 0 from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database were calculated. The abundance of immune cells in CRC tumor microenvironment (TME) was predicted by single-sample gene-set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA). Then, the responses to chemotherapy and immunotherapy were predicted by pRRophetic algorithm, the tumor immune dysfunction and exclusion (TIDE) and SubMap algorithms, respectively. Moreover, the Cancer Therapeutics Response Portal (CTRP) and PRISM Repurposing dataset (PRISM) were used to explore novel drug treatment strategies of CRC. Finally, we investigated pyroptosis-related genes in the level of single-cell and validated the expression levels of these genes between normal and CRC cell lines by RT-qPCR.Survival analysis showed that CRC samples with low PRS had better overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). CRC samples with low PRS had higher immune-related gene expression and immune cell infiltration than those with high PRS. Besides, CRC samples with low PRS were more likely to benefit from 5-fluorouracil based chemotherapy and anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. In novel drug prediction, some compounds such as C6-ceramide and noretynodrel, were inferred as potential drugs for CRC with different PRS. Single-cell analysis revealed pyroptosis-related genes were highly expressed in tumor cells. RT-qPCR also demonstrated different expression levels of these genes between normal and CRC cell lines.Taken together, this study provides a comprehensive investigation of the role of pyroptosis in CRC at the bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) levels, advances our understanding of CRC characteristics, and guides more effective treatment regimens.© 2023.

Based on association with patient survival (n= 1016), 10 miRNAs were identified as potential tumor suppressors (hsa-miR-144, hsa-miR-195, hsa-miR-223, hsa-miR-30a, hsa-miR-30b, hsa-miR-30d, hsa-miR-335, hsa-miR-363, hsa-miR-451, and hsa-miR-99a), and 4 were identified as potential oncogenes (hsa-miR-21, hsa-miR-31, hsa-miR-411, and hsa-miR-494) in lung cancer. Experimentally confirmed target genes were identified for the 73 diagnostic miRNAs, from which proliferation genes were selected from CRISPR-Cas9/RNA interference (RNAi) screening assays. Pansensitive and panresistant genes to 21 NCCN-recommended drugs with concordant mRNA and protein expression were identified. DGKE and WDR47 were found with significant associations with responses to both systemic therapies and radiotherapy in lung cancer. Based on our identified miRNA-regulated molecular machinery, an inhibitor of PDK1/Akt BX-912, an anthracycline antibiotic daunorubicin, and a multi-targeted protein kinase inhibitor midostaurin were discovered as potential repositioning drugs for treating lung cancer. These findings have implications for improving lung cancer diagnosis, optimizing treatment selection, and discovering new drug options for better patient outcomes."
"37189735","Cellular Membrane Localization of Innate Immune Checkpoint Molecule CD47 Is Regulated by Radixin in Human Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Cells.","Biomedicines","In the past decade, immune checkpoint inhibitors have exhibited potent antitumor efficacy against multiple solid malignancies but limited efficacy against pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Cluster of differentiation (CD) 47, a member of the immunoglobulin G superfamily, is overexpressed in the surface membrane of PDAC and independently correlates with a worse clinical prognosis. Furthermore, CD47 functions as a dominant macrophage checkpoint, providing a potent ""do not eat me"" signal to enable cancer cells to evade the innate immune system. Thus, the blockade of CD47 is a promising immunotherapeutic strategy for PDAC. In this study, we determined whether ezrin/radixin/moesin (ERM) family members, which post-translationally modulate the cellular membrane localization of numerous transmembrane proteins by crosslinking with the actin cytoskeleton, contribute to the cellular membrane localization of CD47 in KP-2 cells derived from human PDAC. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that CD47 and ezrin/radixin were highly co-localized in the plasma membrane. Interestingly, gene silencing of radixin but not ezrin dramatically decreased the cell surface expression of CD47 but had little effects on its mRNA level. Furthermore, CD47 and radixin interacted with each other, as determined by a co-immunoprecipitation assay. In conclusion, radixin regulates the cellular membrane localization of CD47 as a scaffold protein in KP-2 cells."

E-cad is known to be essential for maintaining the integrity of epithelial tissues, and the loss of E-cad has been widely considered a hallmark of metastatic cancers enabling carcinoma cells to acquire the ability to migrate and invade nearby tissues. However, this conclusion has come under scrutiny.To assess how CDH1 and E-cad expression changes during cancer progression, we analyzed multiple large transcriptomics, proteomics, and immunohistochemistry datasets on clinical cancer samples and cancer cell lines to determine the CDH1 mRNA and E-cad protein expression profiles in tumor and normal cells.In contrast to the textbook knowledge of the loss of E-cad during tumor progression and metastasis, the levels of CDH1 mRNA and E-cad protein are either upregulated or remain unchanged in most carcinoma cells compared to normal cells. In addition, the CDH1 mRNA upregulation occurs in the early stages of tumor development and the levels remain elevated as tumors progress to later stages across most carcinoma types. Furthermore, E-cad protein levels are not downregulated in most metastatic tumor cells compared to primary tumor cells. The CDH1 mRNA and E-cad protein levels are positively correlated, and the CDH1 mRNA levels are positively correlated to cancer patient's survival. We have discussed potential mechanisms underlying the observed expression changes in CDH1 and E-cad during tumor progression.CDH1 mRNA and E-cadherin protein are not downregulated in most tumor tissues and cell lines derived from commonly occurring carcinomas. The role of E-cad in tumor progression and metastasis may have previously been oversimplified. CDH1 mRNA levels may serve as a reliable biomarker for the diagnosis of some tumors (such as colon and endometrial carcinomas) due to the marked upregulation of CDH1 mRNA in the early stages of tumor development of these carcinomas.© 2023.

However, the RPPA approach is highly dependent on antibody reliability and approximately one-quarter of the antibodies used in the the Cancer Genome Atlas are deemed to be somewhat less reliable. Here, we assess the impact of antibody reliability on observed mRNA-protein correlations. We find that, in general, proteins measured with less reliable antibodies have lower observed mRNA-protein correlations. This is not true of the same proteins when measured using mass spectrometry. Furthermore, in cell lines, we find that when the same protein is quantified by both mass spectrometry and RPPA, the overall correlation between the two measurements is lower for proteins measured with less reliable antibodies. Overall our results reinforce the need for caution in using RPPA measurements from less reliable antibodies.© 2023 Upadhya and Ryan."

However, many patients without apparent HR defects also respond well to PARP inhibitors/cisplatin. The biomarker responsible for this mechanism remains unclear. Here, we identified a set of ribosomal genes that predict response to PARP inhibitors/cisplatin in HR-proficient patients. PARP inhibitor/cisplatin selectively eliminates cells with high expression of the eight genes in the identified panel via DNA damage (ATM) signaling-induced pro-apoptotic ribosomal stress, which along with ATM signaling-induced pro-survival HR repair constitutes a new model to balance the cell fate in response to DNA damage. Therefore, the combined examination of the gene panel along with HR status would allow for more precise predictions of clinical response to PARP inhibitor/cisplatin. The gene panel as an independent biomarker was validated by multiple published clinical datasets, as well as by an ovarian cancer organoids library we established. More importantly, its predictive value was further verified in a cohort of PARP inhibitor-treated ovarian cancer patients with both RNA-seq and WGS data. Furthermore, we identified several marketed drugs capable of upregulating the expression of the genes in the panel without causing HR deficiency in PARP inhibitor/cisplatin-resistant cell lines. These drugs enhance PARP inhibitor/cisplatin sensitivity in both intrinsically resistant organoids and cell lines with acquired resistance. Together, our study identifies a marker gene panel for HR-proficient patients and reveals a broader application of PARP inhibitor/cisplatin in cancer therapy.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1) is a marker of breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs), and its enzymatic activity regulates tumor stemness. Identifying upstream targets to control ALDH+cells may facilitate TNBC tumor suppression. Here, we show that KK-LC-1 determines the stemness of TNBC ALDH+cells via binding with FAT1 and subsequently promoting its ubiquitination and degradation. This compromises the Hippo pathway and leads to nuclear translocation of YAP1 and ALDH1A1 transcription. These findings identify the KK-LC-1-FAT1-Hippo-ALDH1A1 pathway in TNBC ALDH+cells as a therapeutic target. To reverse the malignancy due to KK-LC-1 expression, we employ a computational approach and discover Z839878730 (Z8) as an small-molecule inhibitor which may disrupt KK-LC-1 and FAT1 binding. We demonstrate that Z8 suppresses TNBC tumor growth via a mechanism that reactivates the Hippo pathway and decreases TNBC ALDH+cell stemness and viability.© 2023. The Author(s)."

It has been predicted that the global prevalence of EC will increase in part because of its positive association with economic growth and lifestyle. The majority of EC presented with endometrioid histology and mutations in the tumor suppressor gene PTEN, resulting in its loss of function. PTEN negatively regulates the PI3K/Akt/mTOR axis of cell proliferation and thus serves as a tumorigenesis gatekeeper. Through its chromatin functions, PTEN is also implicated in genome maintenance procedures. However, our comprehension of how DNA repair occurs in the absence of PTEN function in EC is inadequate.We utilized The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data analysis to establish a correlation between PTEN and DNA damage response genes in EC, followed by a series of cellular and biochemical assays to elucidate a molecular mechanism utilizing the AN3CA cell line model for EC.The TCGA analyses demonstrated an inverse correlation between the expression of the damage sensor protein of nucleotide excision repair (NER), DDB2, and PTEN in EC. The transcriptional activation of DDB2 is mediated by the recruitment of active RNA polymerase II to the DDB2 promoter in the PTEN-null EC cells, revealing a correlation between increased DDB2 expression and augmented NER activity in the absence of PTEN.Our study indicated a causal relationship between NER and EC that may be exploited in disease management.© 2023.

Here, we show that a subset of basal-like PDAC tumors aberrantly express p73 (TA isoform), which is a known transcriptional activator of basal lineage identity, ciliogenesis, and tumor suppression in normal tissue development. Using gain- and loss- of function experiments, we show that p73 is necessary and sufficient to activate genes related to basal identity (e.g.KRT5), ciliogenesis (e.g.FOXJ1), and p53-like tumor suppression (e.g.CDKN1A) in human PDAC models. Owing to the paradoxical combination of oncogenic and tumor suppressive outputs of this transcription factor, we propose that PDAC cells express a low level of p73 that is optimal for promoting lineage plasticity without severe impairment of cell proliferation. Collectively, our study reinforces how PDAC cells exploit master regulators of the basal epithelial lineage during disease progression."

Therefore, we sought to determine the role of kinase and nonkinase functions of MK2 in promoting nuclear translocation of caspase-3. We identified two non-small cell lung cancer cell lines for use in these experiments based on low MK2 expression. Wild-type, enzymatic and cellular localization mutant MK2 constructs were expressed using adenoviral infection. Cell death was evaluated by flow cytometry. In addition, cell lysates were harvested for protein analyses. Phosphorylation of caspase-3 was determined using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting and in vitro kinase assay. Association between MK2 and caspase-3 was evaluated using proximity-based biotin ligation assays and co-immunoprecipitation. Overexpression of MK2 resulted in nuclear translocation of caspase-3 and caspase-3-mediated apoptosis. MK2 directly phosphorylates caspase-3; however, phosphorylation status of caspase-3 or MK2-dependent phosphorylation of caspase-3 did not alter caspase-3 activity. The enzymatic function of MK2 was dispensable in nuclear translocation of caspase-3. MK2 and caspase-3 associated together and a nonenzymatic function of MK2, chaperoned nuclear trafficking, is required for caspase-3-mediated apoptosis. Taken together, our results demonstrate a nonenzymatic role for MK2 in the nuclear translocation of caspase-3.

PLR and other variables were evaluated to identify the factors related to the recurrence/residual cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN)-free survival (RFS), namely, the time from LEEP at baseline to first detection of recurrence/residual CIN or end of follow-up, by logistic and Cox regression.In the Kaplan‒Meier analysis, HR-HPV infection (p=0.049/0.012), higher PLR (p=0.031/0.038), and gland invasion (p=0.047) had a higher risk for recurrence/residual CIN at the 3-/5-year follow-up. The univariate logistic and Cox regression analyses showed significant differences and a higher cumulative risk in patients with HR-HPV infection (OR=3.917,p=0.026; HR=3.996,p=0.020) and higher PLR (OR=2.295,p=0.041; HR=2.161,p=0.030) at the 5-year follow-up. The findings by multivariate Cox regression analysis were similar, indicating a poor prognosis for patients with HR-HPV infection (HR=3.901,p=0.023) and higher PLR (HR=2.082,p=0.038) at the 5-year follow-up. The calibration plot showed a better model fit for RFS at the 3-year follow-up.Preoperative PLR level and HR-HPV infection could be available markers for predicting recurrence/residual disease of HSIL after LEEP. Clinically, combining PLR with HR-HPV tests may provide novel evaluation method and reference for management in post-treatment patients with cervical precancerous lesions.© 2023 Huang et al."
"37108357","Aberrant Dopamine System Function in the Ferrous Amyloid Buthionine (FAB) Rat Model of Alzheimer's Disease.","Int J Mol Sci","Antipsychotics increase the risk of death in elderly patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Thus, there is an immediate need for novel therapies to treat comorbid psychosis in AD. Psychosis has been attributed to a dysregulation of the dopamine system and is associated with aberrant regulation by the hippocampus. Given that the hippocampus is a key site of pathology in AD, we posit that aberrant regulation of the dopamine system may contribute to comorbid psychosis in AD. A ferrous amyloid buthionine (FAB) rodent model was used to model a sporadic form of AD. FAB rats displayed functional hippocampal alterations, which were accompanied by decreases in spontaneous, low-frequency oscillations and increases in the firing rates of putative pyramidal neurons. Additionally, FAB rats exhibited increases in dopamine neuron population activity and augmented responses to the locomotor-inducing effects of MK-801, as is consistent with rodent models of psychosis-like symptomatology. Further, working memory deficits in the Y-maze, consistent with an AD-like phenotype, were observed in FAB rats. These data suggest that the aberrant hippocampal activity observed in AD may contribute to dopamine-dependent psychosis, and that the FAB model may be useful for the investigation of comorbid psychosis related to AD. Understanding the pathophysiology that leads to comorbid psychosis in AD will ultimately lead to the discovery of novel targets for the treatment of this disease."
"37181876","Blood transcriptome analysis suggests an indirect molecular association of early life adversities and adult social anxiety disorder by immune-related signal transduction.","Front Psychiatry","Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is a psychiatric disorder characterized by severe fear in social situations and avoidance of these. Multiple genetic as well as environmental factors contribute to the etiopathology of SAD. One of the main risk factors for SAD is stress, especially during early periods of life (early life adversity; ELA). ELA leads to structural and regulatory alterations contributing to disease vulnerability. This includes the dysregulation of the immune response. However, the molecular link between ELA and the risk for SAD in adulthood remains largely unclear. Evidence is emerging that long-lasting changes of gene expression patterns play an important role in the biological mechanisms linking ELA and SAD. Therefore, we conducted a transcriptome study of SAD and ELA performing RNA sequencing in peripheral blood samples. Analyzing differential gene expression between individuals suffering from SAD with high or low levels of ELA and healthy individuals with high or low levels of ELA, 13 significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified with respect to SAD while no significant differences in expression were identified with respect to ELA. The most significantly expressed gene wasMAPK3(p= 0.003) being upregulated in the SAD group compared to control individuals. In contrary, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) identified only modules significantly associated with ELA (p≤ 0.05), not with SAD. Furthermore, analyzing interaction networks of the genes from the ELA-associated modules and the SAD-relatedMAPK3revealed complex interactions of those genes. Gene functional enrichment analyses indicate a role of signal transduction pathways as well as inflammatory responses supporting an involvement of the immune system in the association of ELA and SAD. In conclusion, we did not identify a direct molecular link between ELA and adult SAD by transcriptional changes. However, our data indicate an indirect association of ELA and SAD mediated by the interaction of genes involved in immune-related signal transduction.Copyright © 2023 Edelmann, Wiegand, Hentrich, Pasche, Schulze-Hentrich, Munk, Fallgatter, Kreifelts and Nieratschker."
"37169856","Anticancer role of mango (Mangifera indica L.) peel and seed kernel extracts against 7,12- dimethylbenz[a]anthracene-induced mammary carcinogenesis in female rats.","Sci Rep","Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death among women. The present study is an effort to reveal the antiproliferative and antioxidant actions of mango seed kernel extract (KE), peel extract (PE), and their combination (KEPE) on mammary tumors induced by 7,12 dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA). Seven groups of adult female Sprague-Dawley rats were prepared, including C: (control), DMBA: (rats were administered with DMBA), (DMBA-KE), (DMBA-PE), and (DMBA-KEPE): rats were administered with DMBA and then treated with KE, PE, and (both KE and PE), respectively, (KE) and (PE): rats were administered with KE and PE, separately. The study focused on the assessment of markers of endocrine derangement [serum 17-β estradiol (E2)], apoptosis [caspase-3 and deoxyribonucleic acid fragmentation (DNAF)], and oxidative stress [lipid peroxidation and antioxidants (glutathione, glutathione-S-transferase, glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase)]. Histopathological examination and immunohistochemical expression of caspase-3 and estrogen receptor-α (ER-α) in mammary gland tissues (MGTs) were determined, as well as the characterization of mango extracts. The results showed that DMBA administration induced mammary tumors by increasing cell proliferation and evading apoptosis. In addition, DMBA administration caused oxidative stress by the production of reactive oxygen species, which increased lipid peroxidation and decreased cellular antioxidants, allowing cancer to progress. In contrast, treatment with DMBA-KE, DMBA-PE, or DMBA-KEPE diminished mammary tumors induced by DMBA, where they reduced oxidative stress via increased antioxidant parameters including reduced glutathione, superoxide dismutase, total glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, and glutathione S-transferase. Also, different treatments decreased proliferation through the reduction of E2, and ER-α expression levels. However, these treatments increased the apoptosis of unwanted cells as they increased caspase-3 activity and DNAF. All these changes led to the prevention of breast injuries and the reduction of mammary tumors. This demonstrates that the contents of mango extracts, especially phenolics and flavonoids, have an important role in mammary tumor treatment through their potential antioxidant, antiproliferative, proapoptotic, and anti-estrogenic effects. KE and PE administration for 4 weeks had no adverse effects. Conclusion: Each of KE, PE, and KEPE has a therapeutic effect against DMBA-induced mammary tumors via induction of apoptosis and reduction of each of the OS, proliferation, and estrogenic effects. So, they can play an important role in the pharmacological tole.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37205910","Applying single cell multi-omic analyses to understand treatment resistance in pediatric high grade glioma.","Front Pharmacol","Despite improvements in cancer patient outcomes seen in the past decade, tumor resistance to therapy remains a major impediment to achieving durable clinical responses. Intratumoral heterogeneity related to genetic, epigenetic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolic differences between individual cancer cells has emerged as a driver of therapeutic resistance. This cell to cell heterogeneity can be assessed using single cell profiling technologies that enable the identification of tumor cell clones that exhibit similar defining features like specific mutations or patterns of DNA methylation. Single cell profiling of tumors before and after treatment can generate new insights into the cancer cell characteristics that confer therapeutic resistance by identifying intrinsically resistant sub-populations that survive treatment and by describing new cellular features that emerge post-treatment due to tumor cell evolution. Integrative, single cell analytical approaches have already proven advantageous in studies characterizing treatment-resistant clones in cancers where pre- and post-treatment patient samples are readily available, such as leukemia. In contrast, little is known about other cancer subtypes like pediatric high grade glioma, a class of heterogeneous, malignant brain tumors in children that rapidly develop resistance to multiple therapeutic modalities, including chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and radiation. Leveraging single cell multi-omic technologies to analyze naïve and therapy-resistant glioma may lead to the discovery of novel strategies to overcome treatment resistance in brain tumors with dismal clinical outcomes. In this review, we explore the potential for single cell multi-omic analyses to reveal mechanisms of glioma resistance to therapy and discuss opportunities to apply these approaches to improve long-term therapeutic response in pediatric high grade glioma and other brain tumors with limited treatment options.Copyright © 2023 Murdaugh and Anastas."

"37185464","Bone marrow endosteal stem cells dictate active osteogenesis and aggressive tumorigenesis.","Nat Commun","The bone marrow contains various populations of skeletal stem cells (SSCs) in the stromal compartment, which are important regulators of bone formation. It is well-described that leptin receptor (LepR)+perivascular stromal cells provide a major source of bone-forming osteoblasts in adult and aged bone marrow. However, the identity of SSCs in young bone marrow and how they coordinate active bone formation remains unclear. Here we show that bone marrow endosteal SSCs are defined by fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (Fgfr3) and osteoblast-chondrocyte transitional (OCT) identities with some characteristics of bone osteoblasts and chondrocytes. These Fgfr3-creER-marked endosteal stromal cells contribute to a stem cell fraction in young stages, which is later replaced by Lepr-cre-marked stromal cells in adult stages. Further, Fgfr3+endosteal stromal cells give rise to aggressive osteosarcoma-like lesions upon loss of p53 tumor suppressor through unregulated self-renewal and aberrant osteogenic fates. Therefore, Fgfr3+endosteal SSCs are abundant in young bone marrow and provide a robust source of osteoblasts, contributing to both normal and aberrant osteogenesis.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37162839","TISSUE: uncertainty-calibrated prediction of single-cell spatial transcriptomics improves downstream analyses.","bioRxiv","Spatial transcriptomics capture high-resolution spatial distributions of RNA transcripts within biological systems, yet whole-transcriptome profiling of genes at single-cell resolution remains a challenge. To address this limitation, spatial gene expression prediction methods have been developed to infer the spatial expression of unmeasured transcripts, but the quality of these predictions can vary greatly across different contexts. Poor predictions of gene expression in even a small subset of cells or genes can manifest in misleading downstream analyses. As such, there is a need for uncertainty-aware procedures for utilizing predicted spatial gene expression profiles. Here we present TISSUE (Transcript Imputation with Spatial Single-cell Uncertainty Estimation) as a general framework for estimating uncertainty for spatial gene expression predictions and providing uncertainty-aware methods for downstream inference. Leveraging conformal techniques, TISSUE provides well-calibrated prediction intervals for predicted expression values. Moreover it improves downstream analyses to consistently reduce false discovery rates for differential gene expression analysis, improve clustering and visualization of predicted spatial transcriptomics, and improve the performance of predictive models trained on imputed gene expression profiles. We have made TISSUE publicly available as a flexible wrapper method for existing spatial gene expression prediction methods to assist researchers with implementing uncertainty-aware analyses of spatial transcriptomics data."
"37122067","Matching single cells across modalities with contrastive learning and optimal transport.","Brief Bioinform","Understanding the interactions between the biomolecules that govern cellular behaviors remains an emergent question in biology. Recent advances in single-cell technologies have enabled the simultaneous quantification of multiple biomolecules in the same cell, opening new avenues for understanding cellular complexity and heterogeneity. Still, the resulting multimodal single-cell datasets present unique challenges arising from the high dimensionality and multiple sources of acquisition noise. Computational methods able to match cells across different modalities offer an appealing alternative towards this goal. In this work, we propose MatchCLOT, a novel method for modality matching inspired by recent promising developments in contrastive learning and optimal transport. MatchCLOT uses contrastive learning to learn a common representation between two modalities and applies entropic optimal transport as an approximate maximum weight bipartite matching algorithm. Our model obtains state-of-the-art performance on two curated benchmarking datasets and an independent test dataset, improving the top scoring method by 26.1% while preserving the underlying biological structure of the multimodal data. Importantly, MatchCLOT offers high gains in computational time and memory that, in contrast to existing methods, allows it to scale well with the number of cells. As single-cell datasets become increasingly large, MatchCLOT offers an accurate and efficient solution to the problem of modality matching.© The Author(s) 2023. Published by Oxford University Press."

RAS association domain family protein 1 subtype A (RASSF1A) is a tumor suppressor that is silenced in a variety of human cancers. The present study aimed to investigate the role of RASSF1A in HER2+ breast cancer and the therapeutic potential of RASSF1A-based targeted gene therapy for this malignancy. RASSF1A expression in human HER2+ breast cancer tissues and cell lines was evaluated by reverse transcription PCR and western blot analysis. The associations between tumorous RASSF1A level and tumor grade, TNM stage, tumor size, lymph node metastasis and five-year survival were examined. HER2+ and HER2-negative (HER2-) breast cancer cells were transfected with a lentiviral vector (LV-5HH-RASSF1A) that could express RASSF1A under the control of five copies of the hypoxia-responsive element (5HRE) and one copy of the HER2 promoter (HER2p). Cell proliferation was evaluated by the MTT and colony formation assays. It was found that tumorous RASSF1A level was negatively associated with tumor grade (P=0.014), TNM stage (P=0.0056), tumor size (P=0.014) and lymph node metastasis (P=0.029) and positively associated with five-year survival (P=0.038) in HER2+ breast cancer patients. Lentiviral transfection of HER2+ breast cancer cells resulted in increased RASSF1A expression and decreased cell proliferation, especially under hypoxic conditions. However, lentiviral transfection of HER2-breast cancer cells did not affect RASSF1A expression. In conclusion, these findings verified the clinical significance of RASSF1A as a tumor suppressor in HER2+ breast cancer and supported LV-5HH-RASSF1A as a potential targeted gene therapy for this malignancy.Copyright © 2020, Spandidos Publications."
"37139222","Comprehensive multi-omics analysis reveals m7G-related signature for evaluating prognosis and immunotherapy efficacy in osteosarcoma.","J Bone Oncol","Osteosarcoma is one of the most prevalent bone malignancies with a poor prognosis. The N7-methylguanosine (m7G) modification facilitates the modification of RNA structure and function tightly associated with cancer. Nonetheless, there is a lack of joint exploration of the relationship between m7G methylation and immune status in osteosarcoma.With the support of TARGET and GEO databases, we performed consensus clustering to characterize molecular subtypes based on m7G regulators in all osteosarcoma patients. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method, Cox regression, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were employed to construct and validate m7G-related prognostic features and derived risk scores. In addition, GSVA, ssGSEA, CIBERSORT, ESTIMATE, and gene set enrichment analysis were conducted to characterize biological pathways and immune landscapes. We explored the relationship between risk scores and drug sensitivity, immune checkpoints, and human leukocyte antigens by correlation analysis. Finally, the roles of EIF4E3 in cell function were verified through external experiments.Two molecular isoforms based on regulator genes were identified, which presented significant discrepancies in terms of survival and activated pathways. Moreover, the six m7G regulators most associated with prognosis in osteosarcoma patients were identified as independent predictors for the construction of prognostic signature. The model was well stabilized and outperformed traditional clinicopathological features to reliably predict 3-year (AUC = 0.787) and 5-year (AUC = 0.790) survival in osteosarcoma cohorts. Patients with increased risk scores had a poorer prognosis, higher tumor purity, lower checkpoint gene expression, and were in an immunosuppressive microenvironment. Furthermore, enhanced expression of EIF4E3 indicated a favorable prognosis and affected the biological behavior of osteosarcoma cells.We identified six prognostic relevant m7G modulators that may provide valuable indicators for the estimation of overall survival and the corresponding immune landscape in patients with osteosarcoma.© 2023 The Author(s)."

The majority of researches focused on the functions of these proteins in drug resistance, but their relationships with radiotherapy (RT) response remain unclear. In this study, we examined protein expression of FOXO3, FOXM1 and SIRT6 and their clinical significance in a Swedish rectal cancer trial of preoperative RT.Expression of FOXO3, FOXM1 and SIRT6 protein was examined by immunohistochemistry in patient samples. Genetic analysis of FOXO3, FOXM1 and SIRT6 were performed by cBioportal and MEXPRESS database. Gene-gene network analysis was conducted using GeneMANIA. Functional enrichment analysis was performed based on LinkedOmics and Metascape online software.FOXO3 and FOXM1were mainly expressed in the cytoplasm in both normal and tumour tissues, and SIRT6 in both the cytoplasm and nucleus in normal and tumour tissues. FOXO3 and FOXM1 expression increased from normal mucosa to primary cancer (P < 0.001), while SIRT6 expression decreased from normal mucosa to primary cancer (P < 0.001). High FOXO3 expression correlated with late TNM stage (P = 0.040), distant metastasis (P = 0.032) and independently with disease free survival (DFS) in the RT patients (HR = 7.948; P = 0.049; 95% CI = 1.002-63.032) but not in non-RT patients (P > 0.05). Genetic analysis indicated that DNA methylation status contributed to FOXO3 overexpression. Functional enrichment analysis demonstrated that FOXO3 was closely related to metabolism-related signalling pathway which in turn associated with cancer radioresistance. Moreover, there were strong gene-gene interactions between FOXO3 and metabolism-related signalling.Our findings suggest that FOXO3 may be a prognostic factor in rectal cancer patients with RT.© 2023 Published by Elsevier Ltd."

We conducted a meta-analysis of recent single-cell benchmarks to summarize the scope, extensibility, and neutrality, as well as technical features and whether best practices in open data and reproducible research were followed. The results highlight that while benchmarks often make code available and are in principle reproducible, they remain difficult to extend, for example, as new methods and new ways to assess methods emerge. In addition, embracing containerization and workflow systems would enhance reusability of intermediate benchmarking results, thus also driving wider adoption.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37188913","Accurate prognosis for localized prostate cancer through coherent voting networks with multi-omic and clinical data.","Sci Rep","Localized prostate cancer is a very heterogeneous disease, from both a clinical and a biological/biochemical point of view, which makes the task of producing stratifications of patients into risk classes remarkably challenging. In particular, it is important an early detection and discrimination of the indolent forms of the disease, from the aggressive ones, requiring post-surgery closer surveillance and timely treatment decisions. This work extends a recently developed supervised machine learning (ML) technique, called coherent voting networks (CVN) by incorporating a novel model-selection technique to counter the danger of model overfitting. For the challenging problem of discriminating between indolent and aggressive types of localized prostate cancer, accurate prognostic prediction of post-surgery progression-free survival with a granularity within a year is attained, improving accuracy with respect to the current state of the art. The development of novel ML techniques tailored to the problem of combining multi-omics and clinical prognostic biomarkers is a promising new line of attack for sharpening the capability to diversify and personalize cancer patient treatments. The proposed approach allows a finer post-surgery stratification of patients within the clinical high-risk category, with a potential impact on the surveillance regime and the timing of treatment decisions, complementing existing prognostic methods.© 2023.

In this regard, the global medical community pays special attention to the genetic prerequisites for the occurrence of this disease. Therefore, the search for the genetic polymorphisms underlying bronchial asthma has expanded considerably. As the present study progressed, a significant amount of scientific medical literature was analyzed and 167 genes reported to be associated with the development of bronchial asthma were identified. A group of participants (n = 7,303) who had voluntarily provided their biomaterial (venous blood) to be used in the research conducted by the Federal Medical Biological Agency of Russia was formed to subsequently perform a bioinformatic verification of known associations and search for new ones. This group of participants was divided into four cohorts, including two sex-distinct cohorts of individuals with a history of asthma and two sex-distinct cohorts of apparently healthy individuals. A search for polymorphisms was made in each cohort among the selected genes, and genetic variants were identified whose difference in occurrence in the different cohorts was statistically significant (significance level less than 0.0001).

Generalized estimating equations were utilized to compare differences in PMD placental features between COVID-era and pre-pandemic cohorts. Maternal stress and depression scores were significantly higher in the pandemic cohort. Placental volume, thickness, gray level kurtosis, skewness and run length non-uniformity were increased in the pandemic cohort, while placental elongation, mean gray level and long run emphasis were decreased. PMD was a mediator of the association between pandemic status and placental features. Altered in vivo placental structure during the pandemic suggests an underappreciated link between disturbances in maternal environment and perturbed placental development.

BPA is extensively used in the manufacture of polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins. The widespread utilities of BPA include its use as internal coating for food and beverage cans, bottles, and food-packaging materials, and as a building block for countless goods of common use. BPA can be released into the environment and enter the human body at any stage during its production, or in the process of manufacture, use, or disposal of materials made from this chemical. While the general population is predominantly exposed to BPA through contaminated food and drinking water, non-dietary exposures through the respiratory system, integumentary system, and vertical transmission, as well as other routes of exposure, also exist. BPA is often classified as an endocrine-disrupting chemical as it can act as a xenoestrogen. Exposure to BPA has been associated with developmental, reproductive, cardiovascular, neurological, metabolic, or immune effects, as well as oncogenic effects. BPA can disrupt the synthesis or clearance of hormones by binding and interfering with biological receptors. BPA can also interact with key transcription factors to modulate regulation of gene expression. Over the past 17 years, an epigenetic mechanism of action for BPA has emerged. This article summarizes the current state of research on the epigenetic effects of BPA by analyzing the findings from various studies in model systems and human populations. It evaluates the weight of evidence on the ability of BPA to alter the epigenome, while also discussing the direction of future research."

Nonetheless, the function and significance of necroptosis in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) remain unknown and require further investigation.We utilized single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) data to assess the expression patterns of necroptosis in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) based on 159 necroptosis-related genes. We identified differentially expressed NRGs and used an unsupervised clustering approach to divide ASD children into distinct molecular subgroups. We also evaluated immunological infiltrations and immune checkpoints using the CIBERSORT algorithm. Characteristic NRGs, identified by the LASSO, RF, and SVM-RFE algorithms, were utilized to construct a risk model. Moreover, functional enrichment, immune infiltration, and CMap analysis were further explored. Additionally, external validation was performed using RT-PCR analysis.Both snRNA-seq and bulk transcriptome data demonstrated a greater necroptosis score in ASD children. Among these cell subtypes, excitatory neurons, inhibitory neurons, and endothelials displayed the highest activity of necroptosis. Children with ASD were categorized into two subtypes of necroptosis, and subtype2 exhibited higher immune activity. Four characteristic NRGs (TICAM1, CASP1, CAPN1, and CHMP4A) identified using three machine learning algorithms could predict the onset of ASD. Nomograms, calibration curves, and decision curve analysis (DCA) based on 3-NRG have been shown to have clinical benefit in children with ASD. Furthermore, necroptosis-based riskScore was found to be positively associated with immune activation. Finally, RT-PCR demonstrated differentially expressed of these four NRGs in human peripheral blood samples.A comprehensive identification of necroptosis may shed light on the underlying pathogenic process driving ASD onset. The classification of necroptosis subtypes and construction of a necroptosis-related risk model may yield significant insights for the individualized treatment of children with ASD.Copyright © 2023 Liu, Fu, Ding, Jiang, Zhan and Lai."

A CCRGs-based risk signature was established by differential expression analysis, univariate, Lasso and multivariate Cox regression analyses. we conducted a gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) between groups. A nomogram integrating independent clinical factors and risk score was generated and evaluated by calibration curves and decision curve analysis (DCA). Differentially expression analysis revealed 80 differentially expressed CCRGs, and 27 of them were significantly associated with the overall survival (OS) of BC. BC can be classified into 4 molecular subtypes with significant differences in prognosis based on the 27 CCRGs. Three prognostic CCRGs, including desmocollin 1 (DSC1), LEF1, and protocadherin 9 (PCDH9), were identified to be independent risk factors of BC prognosis and were used to construct a risk score model. BC patients were divided into high- and low-risk groups, and there were significant differences in prognosis between the 2 groups both in the training and validation cohorts. It was found that patients in different groups of race, status, or T stage had significant levels of risk score. Furthermore, patients of different risk levels exhibit varying degrees of sensitivity to vinorelbine, lapatinib, metformin, and vinblastine. GSEA showed that in the high-risk group, immune response-related activities were dramatically repressed whereas cilium-related processes were significantly stimulated. Cox regression analysis demonstrated that age, N stage, radiotherapy and the risk score were independent prognostic risk factors of BC, and a nomogram was established based on these variables. The nomogram exerted a favorable concordance index (0.798) as well as calibration performance, which strongly supports the clinical application of the nomogram. Our study indicated the disruption of the expression of CCRGs in BC and built a favorable prognostic risk model based on 3 independent prognostic CCRGs. These genes may be applied as candidate molecular targets for the diagnosis and therapy of BC.Copyright © 2023 the Author(s). Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc."
"37138869","Integrated bioinformatic analysis of mitochondrial metabolism-related genes in acute myeloid leukemia.","Front Immunol","Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a common hematologic malignancy characterized by poor prognoses and high recurrence rates. Mitochondrial metabolism has been increasingly recognized to be crucial in tumor progression and treatment resistance. The purpose of this study was to examined the role of mitochondrial metabolism in the immune regulation and prognosis of AML.In this study, mutation status of 31 mitochondrial metabolism-related genes (MMRGs) in AML were analyzed. Based on the expression of 31 MMRGs, mitochondrial metabolism scores (MMs) were calculated by single sample gene set enrichment analysis. Differential analysis and weighted co-expression network analysis were performed to identify module MMRGs. Next, univariate Cox regression and the least absolute and selection operator regression were used to select prognosis-associated MMRGs. A prognosis model was then constructed using multivariate Cox regression to calculate risk score. We validated the expression of key MMRGs in clinical specimens using immunohistochemistry (IHC). Then differential analysis was performed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between high- and low-risk groups. Functional enrichment, interaction networks, drug sensitivity, immune microenvironment, and immunotherapy analyses were also performed to explore the characteristic of DEGs.Given the association of MMs with prognosis of AML patients, a prognosis model was constructed based on 5 MMRGs, which could accurately distinguish high-risk patients from low-risk patients in both training and validation datasets. IHC results showed that MMRGs were highly expressed in AML samples compared to normal samples. Additionally, the 38 DEGs were mainly related to mitochondrial metabolism, immune signaling, and multiple drug resistance pathways. In addition, high-risk patients with more immune-cell infiltration had higher Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion scores, indicating poor immunotherapy response. mRNA-drug interactions and drug sensitivity analyses were performed to explore potential druggable hub genes. Furthermore, we combined risk score with age and gender to construct a prognosis model, which could predict the prognosis of AML patients.Our study provided a prognostic predictor for AML patients and revealed that mitochondrial metabolism is associated with immune regulation and drug resistant in AML, providing vital clues for immunotherapies.Copyright © 2023 Tong and Zhou."
"37138850","The value of cuproptosis-related differential genes in guiding prognosis and immune status in patients with skin cutaneous melanoma.","Front Pharmacol","Background:Skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) is one of the most common cutaneous malignancies, which incidence is increasing. Cuproptosis is a new type of programming cell death recently reported, which may affect the progression of SKCM.Method:The mRNA expression data of melanoma were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus and the Cancer Genome Atlas databases. We constructed a prognostic model according to the cuproptosis-related differential genes in SKCM. Finally, real-time quantitative PCR was performed to verify the expression of cuproptosis-related differential genes in patients with different stages of cutaneous melanoma.Results:We detected 767 cuproptosis-related differential genes based on 19 cuproptosis-related genes, and screened out 7 differential genes to construct a prognostic model, which including three high-risk differential genes (SNAI2, RAP1GAP, BCHE), and four low-risk differential genes (JSRP1, HAPLN3, HHEX, ERAP2). Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that SKCM patients with low-risk differential genes signals had better prognosis. The Encyclopedia of Genomes results manifested that cuproptosis-related differential genes are not only involved in T cell receptor signaling channel, natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity, but also chemokine signaling pathway and B cell receptor signaling pathway. In our risk scoring model, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) values of the three-time nodes are 0.669 (1-year), 0.669 (3-year) and 0.685 (5-year), respectively. Moreover, the tumor burden mutational and immunology function, cell stemness characteristics and drug sensitivity have significant differences between low-risk group and high-risk group. The mRNA level of SNAI2, RAP1GAP and BCHE in stage Ⅲ+Ⅳ SKCM patients was significantly higher than that in stage Ⅰ+Ⅱ patients, while the level of JSRP1, HAPLN3, HHEX and ERAP2 in stage Ⅰ+Ⅱ SKCM patients was more remarkable higher than that in stage Ⅲ+Ⅳ SKCM patients.Conclusion:In summary, we suggest that cuproptosis can not only regulate the tumor immune microenvironment but also affect the prognosis of SKCM patients, and may offer a basic theory for SKCM patients survival studies and clinical decision-making with potentially therapeutic drugs.Copyright © 2023 Sun, Lei, Luo, Jiang and Li."

Datasets contained demographic information, environment stress factors, and the methylation levels of 38 methylated sites of tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2) genes in peripheral blood samples. Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) was employed to select features. Five classification algorithms (logistic regression, classification and regression trees, support vector machine, logitboost and random forests) were used to establish the models. Performance metrics (AUC, F-Measure, G-Mean, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value) were computed with 5-fold-cross-validation. Variable importance was evaluated by random forest algorithm.RF with RFE outperformed the other models in our samples based on the demographic information and clinical features (AUC = 61.2%, 95%CI: 60.1-62.4%) / TPH2 CpGs features (AUC = 66.6%, 95%CI: 65.4-67.8%) / both clinical and TPH2 CpGs features (AUC = 72.9%, 95%CI: 71.8-74.0%).The effects of TPH2 on the early-stage antidepressant response were explored by machine learning algorithms. On the basis of the baseline depression severity and TPH2 CpG sites, machine learning approaches can enhance our ability to predict the early-stage antidepressant response. Some potentially important predictors (e.g., TPH2-10-60 (rs2129575), TPH2-2-163 (rs11178998), age of first onset, age) in early-stage treatment response could be utilized in future fundamental research, drug development and clinical practice.© 2023.

To investigate plasticity-induced adaptation during standard-of-care chemotherapy temozolomide (TMZ), we performed in vivo single-cell RNA sequencing in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) tumors of GBM before, during, and after therapy. Comparing single-cell transcriptomic patterns identified distinct cellular populations present during TMZ therapy. Of interest was the increased expression of ribonucleotide reductase regulatory subunit M2 (RRM2), which we found to regulate dGTP and dCTP production vital for DNA damage response during TMZ therapy. Furthermore, multidimensional modeling of spatially resolved transcriptomic and metabolomic analysis in patients' tissues revealed strong correlations betweenRRM2and dGTP. This supports our data that RRM2 regulates the demand for specific dNTPs during therapy. In addition, treatment with the RRM2 inhibitor 3-AP (Triapine) enhances the efficacy of TMZ therapy in PDX models. We present a previously unidentified understanding of chemoresistance through critical RRM2-mediated nucleotide production."

Healthy control (HC) samples and samples of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) were calculated with enrichment scores in folate biosynthesis pathways. The scores acted as a new phenotype combined with clinical information (control or PTB) for subsequent analysis. Weight gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to seek the modules mostly related to PTB and folate biosynthesis in training sets. Twenty-nine coexistence genes were screened by intersecting the genes in the green-yellow module of GSE28623 and the brown module of GSE83456. We used the protein-protein interaction network analysis to narrow the gene range to search for hub genes. Then, we downloaded the unified and standardized pan-cancer data set from the UCSC database for correlations between biomarkers and prognosis and tumor stage differences.Eventually, RTP4 was selected as a biomarker. To verify the reliability of this biomarker, an area under the ROC (AUC) was calculated in gene sets (GSE28623, GSE83456, and GSE34608). Lastly, to explore the difference in RTP4 expression before and after antituberculosis treatment, the GSE31348 gene set was enrolled to compare the expressions in weeks 0 and 26. The results showed significant differences between these two time points (p< 0.001). RTP4 was significantly upregulated in the pulmonary tuberculosis group compared to the healthy control group in three gene sets and downregulated after antituberculosis therapy in one gene set. These results suggest that RTP4 can be used as a potential biomarker in diagnosing tuberculosis. The results of pan-cancer analysis showed that high expression of RTP4 in 4 tumor types was positively correlated with poor prognosis and high expression of RTP4 in 6 tumor types was negatively correlated with poor prognosis. We found significant differences in the expression of the RTP4 gene at different stages in 5 types of tumors.RTP4 might be a new potential biomarker for diagnosing pulmonary tuberculosis.Copyright © 2023 Hao Li et al."

Nonetheless, the mechanisms of action of the genes responsible for morphine addiction have not been exhaustively studied.We obtained morphine addiction-related datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and screened for Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs). Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) functional modularity constructs were analyzed for genes associated with clinical traits. Venn diagrams were filtered for intersecting common DEGs (CDEGs). Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis for functional annotation. Protein-protein interaction network (PPI) and CytoHubba were used to screen for hub genes. Potential treatments for morphine addiction were figured out with the help of an online database.Sixty-five common differential genes linked to morphine addiction were identified, and functional enrichment analysis showed that they were primarily involved in ion channel activity, protein transport, the oxytocin signalling pathway, neuroactive ligand-receptor interactions, and other signalling pathways. Based on the PPI network, ten hub genes (CHN2, OLIG2, UGT8A, CACNB2, TIMP3, FKBP5, ZBTB16, TSC22D3, ISL1, and SLC2A1) were checked. In the data set GSE7762, all of the Area Under Curve (AUC) values for the hub gene Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves were greater than 0.8. We also used the DGIdb database to look for eight small-molecule drugs that might be useful for treating morphine addiction.The hub genes are crucial genes associated with morphine addiction in the mouse striatum.

"37192975","Endothelial cell senescence exacerbates pulmonary hypertension by inducing juxtacrine Notch signaling in smooth muscle cells.","iScience","Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a fatal disease characterized by a progressive increase in pulmonary artery pressure caused by pathological pulmonary artery remodeling. Here, we demonstrate that endothelial cell (EC) senescence plays a negative role in pulmonary hypertension via juxtacrine interaction with smooth muscle cells (SMCs). By using EC-specific progeroid mice, we discovered that EC progeria deteriorated vascular remodeling in the lungs, and exacerbated pulmonary hypertension in mice. Mechanistically, senescent ECs overexpressed Notch ligands, which resulted in increased Notch signaling and activated proliferation and migration capacities in neighboring SMCs. Pharmacological inhibition of Notch signaling reduced the effects of senescent ECs on SMCs functionsin vitro, and improved the worsened pulmonary hypertension in EC-specific progeroid micein vivo. Our findings show that EC senescence is a critical disease-modifying factor in PAH and that EC-mediated Notch signaling is a pharmacotherapeutic target for the treatment of PAH, particularly in the elderly.© 2023 The Authors."

Despite ongoing efforts that have mapped gene expression and cell diversity across bronchial PML pathologies, signaling and transcriptional events driving malignancy are poorly understood. Evidence has suggested key roles for the Hippo pathway effectors YAP and TAZ and associated TEAD and TP63 transcription factor families in bronchial basal cell biology and LUSC. In this study we examine the functional association of YAP/TAZ, TEADs and TP63 in bronchial epithelial cells and PMLs.We performed RNA-seq in primary human bronchial epithelial cells following small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated depletion of YAP/TAZ, TEADs or TP63, and combined these data with ChIP-seq analysis of these factors. Directly activated or repressed genes were identified and overlapping genes were profiled across gene expression data obtained from progressive or regressive human PMLs and across lung single cell RNA-seq data sets.Analysis of genes regulated by YAP/TAZ, TEADs, and TP63 in human bronchial epithelial cells revealed a converged transcriptional network that is strongly associated with the pathological progression of bronchial PMLs. Our observations suggest that YAP/TAZ-TEAD-TP63 associate to cooperatively promote basal epithelial cell proliferation and repress signals associated with interferon responses and immune cell communication. Directly repressed targets we identified include the MHC Class II transactivator CIITA, which is repressed in progressive PMLs and associates with adaptive immune responses in the lung. Our findings provide molecular insight into the control of gene expression events driving PML progression, including those contributing to immune evasion, offering potential new avenues for lung cancer interception.Our study identifies important gene regulatory functions for YAP/TAZ-TEAD-TP63 in the early stages of lung cancer development, which notably includes immune-suppressive roles, and suggest that an assessment of the activity of this transcriptional complex may offer a means to identify immune evasive bronchial PMLs and serve as a potential therapeutic target.© 2023.

"37026483","Characterization of the dual role of Plasmodium falciparum DNA methyltransferase in regulating transcription and translation.","Nucleic Acids Res","DNA modifications are critical in fine-tuning the biological processes in model organisms. However, the presence of cytosine methylation (5mC) and the function of the putative DNA methyltransferase, PfDNMT2, in the human malaria pathogen, Plasmodium falciparum, remain controversial. Here, we revisited the 5mC in the parasite genome and the function of PfDNMT2. Low levels of genomic 5mC (0.1-0.2%) during asexual development were identified using a sensitive mass spectrometry procedure. Native PfDNMT2 displayed substantial DNA methylation activities, and disruption or overexpression of PfDNMT2 resulted in reduced or elevated genomic 5mC levels, respectively. PfDNMT2 disruption led to an increased proliferation phenotype, with the parasites having an extended schizont stage and producing a higher number of progenies. Consistent with PfDNMT2's interaction with an AP2 domain-containing transcription factor, transcriptomic analyses revealed that PfDNMT2 disruption led to a drastic alteration in the expression of many genes, some of which provided the molecular basis of enhanced proliferation after PfDNMT2 disruption. Furthermore, levels of tRNAAsp and its methylation rate at position C38, and the translation of a reporter containing an aspartate repeat were significantly reduced after PfDNMT2 disruption, while the levels of tRNAAsp and its C38 methylation were restored after complementation of PfDNMT2. Our study sheds new light on the dual function of PfDNMT2 during P. falciparum asexual development.© The Author(s) 2023. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research."

Here, we present InferLoop, a novel method for inferring the strength of chromatin interaction using single-cell chromatin accessibility data. The workflow of InferLoop is, first, to conduct signal enhancement by grouping nearby cells into bins, and then, for each bin, leverage accessibility signals for loop signals using a newly constructed metric that is similar to the perturbation of the Pearson correlation coefficient. In this study, we have described three application scenarios of InferLoop, including the inference of cell-type-specific loop signals, the prediction of gene expression levels and the interpretation of intergenic loci. The effectiveness and superiority of InferLoop over other methods in those three scenarios are rigorously validated by using the single-cell 3D genome structure data of human brain cortex and human blood, the single-cell multi-omics data of human blood and mouse brain cortex, and the intergenic loci in the GWAS Catalog database as well as the GTEx database, respectively.

It is the main cause of liver cirrhosis and liver cancer. Although many important roles of RNA modification in stem cells or tumor diseases have been identified, the role of N7-methylguanosine (m7G) modification in the process of chronic HBV infection has not been clearly defined. Therefore, we conducted a systematic analysis on the process of chronic HBV infection. We found that a total of 18 m7G-related genes were altered in chronic HBV infection, and then we screened out CHB potential diagnostic biomarkers using machine learning and random forest methods. RT-qPCR was performed on the samples of healthy people and CHB, which further verified the possibility of being a diagnostic marker. Then, we typed CHB patients based on these 18 genes. We found that the immune microenvironment of different subtypes was different. Among them, patients with subtype-Ⅰ had severe immune response, that is, relatively serious immune cell infiltration, rich immune pathways, relatively many HLA genes, and immune checkpoints. Finally, we conducted an in-depth discussion on our m7G-related genes, and found that m7G gene related to immune cell infiltration may be involved in the disease progression of CHB patients, which was also confirmed in the GSE84044 dataset. In conclusion, m7G-related genes can not only serve as diagnostic markers of CHB, but also participate in the regulation of immune microenvironment and play an important role in the progression of CHB.Copyright © 2023 Rongzheng Zhang et al."

In this review of the literature, we have summarized important knowledge linking cancer cell characteristics with the response to immunotherapy. Mostly focused on lung cancer, our objective was to illustrate how cancer cell diversity inside a well-defined pathology might explain sensitivity and refractoriness to immunotherapies. We first discuss how genomic instability, epigenetics and innate immune signaling could explain differences in the response to immune checkpoint blockers. Then, in a second part we detailed important notions suggesting that altered cancer cell metabolism, specific oncogenic signaling, tumor suppressor loss as well as tight control of the cGAS/STING pathway in the cancer cells can be associated with resistance to immune checkpoint blockade. At the end, we discussed recent evidences that could suggest that immune checkpoint blockade as first line therapy might shape the cancer cell clones diversity and give rise to the appearance of novel resistance mechanisms.Copyright © 2023 Ursino, Mouric, Gros, Bonnefoy and Faget."
"37170217","Low impact of polyploidization on the transcriptome of synthetic allohexaploid wheat.","BMC Genomics","Bread wheat is a recent allohexaploid (genomic constitution AABBDD) that emerged through a hybridization between tetraploid Triticum turgidum (AABB) and diploid Aegilops tauschii (DD) less than 10,000 years ago. The hexaploidization can be re-created artificially, producing synthetic wheat that has been used to study immediate genomic responses to polyploidization. The scale of the consequences of polyploidization, and their mechanism of establishment, remain uncertain.Here we sampled several synthetic wheats from alternative parental genotypes and reciprocal crosses, and examined transcriptomes from two different tissues and successive generations. We did not detect any massive reprogramming in gene expression, with only around 1% of expressed genes showing significant differences compared to their lower-ploidy parents. Most of this differential expression is located on the D subgenome, without consistency in the direction of the expression change. Homoeolog expression bias in synthetic wheat is similar to the pattern observed in the parents. Both differential expression and homoeolog bias are tissue-specific. While up to three families of transposable elements became upregulated in wheat synthetics, their position and distance are not significantly associated with expression changes in proximal genes.While only a few genes change their expression pattern after polyploidization, they can be involved in agronomically important pathways. Alternative parental combinations can lead to opposite changes on the same subset of D-located genes, which is relevant for harnessing new diversity in wheat breeding. Tissue specificity of the polyploidization-triggered expression changes indicates the remodelling of transcriptomes in synthetic wheat is plastic and likely caused by regulome interactions rather than permanent changes. We discuss the pitfalls of transcriptomic comparisons across ploidy levels that can inflate the de-regulation signal.Transcriptomic response to polyploidization in synthetic AABBDD wheat is modest and much lower than some previous estimates. Homoeolog expression bias in wheat allohexaploids is mostly attributed to parental legacy, with polyploidy having a mild balancing effect.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Rit2 is a reported PD risk allele, and recent single cell transcriptomic studies identified a major RIT2 cluster in PD DA neurons, potentially linking Rit2 expression anomalies to a PD patient cohort. However, it is still unknown whether Rit2 loss itself is causative for PD or PD-like symptoms. Here we report that conditional Rit2 silencing in mouse DA neurons drove a progressive motor dysfunction that was more rapid in males than females and was rescued at early stages by either inhibiting the DA transporter (DAT) or with L-DOPA treatment. Motor dysfunction was accompanied by decreases in DA release, striatal DA content, phenotypic DAergic markers, and a loss of DA neurons, with increased pSer129-alpha synuclein expression. These results provide the first evidence that Rit2 loss is causal for SNc cell death and a PD-like phenotype, and reveal key sex-specific differences in the response to Rit2 loss."

The methyl-CpG-binding domain 2 (MBD2), a ""reader"" to interpret DNA methylome-encoded information, has been noted to be involved in the development of certain types of tumors, while its exact impact on tumor metastasis remains elusive. Herein we demonstrated that patients with LUAD metastasis were highly correlated with enhanced MBD2 expression. Therefore, knockdown of MBD2 significantly attenuated the migration and invasion of LUAD cells (A549 and H1975 cell lines) coupled with attenuated epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Moreover, similar results were observed in other types of tumor cells (B16F10). Mechanistically, MBD2 selectively bound to the methylated CpG DNA within the DDB2 promoter, by which MBD2 repressed DDB2 expression to promote tumor metastasis. As a result, administration of MBD2 siRNA-loaded liposomes remarkably suppressed EMT along with attenuated tumor metastasis in the B16F10 tumor-bearing mice. Collectively, our study indicates that MBD2 could be a promising prognostic marker for tumor metastasis, while administration of MBD2 siRNA-loaded liposomes could be a viable therapeutic approach against tumor metastasis in clinical settings.© 2023.

To understand the mechanisms underlying this association, we characterized the changing cellular, genomic, transcriptional, and epigenetic landscape of lung aging using bulk and single-cell RNAseq (scRNAseq) data. Our analysis revealed age-associated gene networks that reflected hallmarks of aging, including mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, and cellular senescence. Cell type deconvolution revealed age-associated changes in the cellular composition of the lung: decreased alveolar epithelial cells and increased fibroblasts and endothelial cells. In the alveolar microenvironment, aging is characterized by decreased AT2B cells and reduced surfactant production, a finding that was validated by scRNAseq and IHC. We showed that a previously reported senescence signature, SenMayo, captures cells expressing canonical senescence markers. SenMayo signature also identified cell-type specific senescence-associated co-expression modules that have distinct molecular functions, including ECM regulation, cell signaling, and damage response pathways. Analysis of somatic mutations showed that burden was highest in lymphocytes and endothelial cells and was associated with high expression of senescence signature. Finally, aging and senescence gene expression modules were associated with differentially methylated regions, with inflammatory markers such asIL1B, IL6R, andTNFbeing significantly regulated with age. Our findings provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying lung aging and may have implications for the development of interventions to prevent or treat age-related lung diseases."

Hypoxia increases many elements of the adenosine signaling pathway, resulting in higher adenosine levels in the TME, further contributing to immune suppression. Extracellular adenosine signals through 4 adenosine receptors (Adora1, Adora2a, Adora2b, Adora3). Of the 4 receptors, Adora2b has the lowest affinity for adenosine and thus, has important consequences when stimulated by adenosine binding in the hypoxic TME. We and others have shown that Adora2b is present in normal pancreas tissue, and in injured or diseased pancreatic tissue, Adora2b levels are significantly elevated. The Adora2b receptor is present on many immune cells, including macrophages, dendritic cells, natural killer cells, natural killer T cells, γδ T cells, B cells, T cells, CD4+T cells, and CD8+T cells. In these immune cell types, adenosine signaling through Adora2b can reduce the adaptive anti-tumor response, augmenting immune suppression, or may contribute to transformation and changes in fibrosis, perineural invasion, or the vasculature by binding the Adora2b receptor on neoplastic epithelial cells, cancer-associated fibroblasts, blood vessels, lymphatic vessels, and nerves. In this review, we discuss the mechanistic consequences of Adora2b activation on cell types in the tumor microenvironment. As the cell-autonomous role of adenosine signaling through Adora2b has not been comprehensively studied in pancreatic cancer cells, we will also discuss published data from other malignancies to infer emerging therapeutic considerations for targeting the Adora2b adenosine receptor to reduce the proliferative, invasive, and metastatic potential of PDAC cells.Copyright © 2023 Strickland, Faraoni, Ruan, Yuan, Eltzschig and Bailey-Lundberg."
"37198662","Sex-based differences in cardiovascular proteomic profiles and their associations with adverse outcomes in patients with chronic heart failure.","Biol Sex Differ","Studies focusing on sex differences in circulating proteins in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) are scarce. Insight into sex-specific cardiovascular protein profiles and their associations with the risk of adverse outcomes may contribute to a better understanding of the pathophysiological processes involved in HFrEF. Moreover, it could provide a basis for the use of circulating protein measurements for prognostication in women and men, wherein the most relevant protein measurements are applied in each of the sexes.In 382 patients with HFrEF, we performed tri-monthly blood sampling (median follow-up: 25 [13-31] months). We selected all baseline samples and two samples closest to the primary endpoint (PEP: composite of cardiovascular death, heart transplantation, left ventricular assist device implantation, and HF hospitalization) or censoring. We then applied an aptamer-based multiplex proteomic assay identifying 1105 proteins previously associated with cardiovascular disease. We used linear regression models and gene-enrichment analysis to study sex-based differences in baseline levels. We used time-dependent Cox models to study differences in the prognostic value of serially measured proteins. All models were adjusted for the MAGGIC HF mortality risk score and p-values for multiple testing.In 104 women and 278 men (mean age 62 and 64 years, respectively) cumulative PEP incidence at 30 months was 25% and 35%, respectively. At baseline, 55 (5%) out of the 1105 proteins were significantly different between women and men. The female protein profile was most strongly associated with extracellular matrix organization, while the male profile was dominated by regulation of cell death. The association of endothelin-1 (Pinteraction < 0.001) and somatostatin (Pinteraction = 0.040) with the PEP was modified by sex, independent of clinical characteristics. Endothelin-1 was more strongly associated with the PEP in men (HR 2.62 [95%CI, 1.98, 3.46], p < 0.001) compared to women (1.14 [1.01, 1.29], p = 0.036). Somatostatin was positively associated with the PEP in men (1.23 [1.10, 1.38], p < 0.001), but inversely associated in women (0.33 [0.12, 0.93], p = 0.036).Baseline cardiovascular protein levels differ between women and men. However, the predictive value of repeatedly measured circulating proteins does not seem to differ except for endothelin-1 and somatostatin.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Unbiased proteomics using biological specimens can lead to improved risk stratification and discover pathophysiological mechanisms.MethodsUsing measurements of ~4000 plasma proteins in two cohorts of patients hospitalized with COVID-19, we discovered and validated markers of COVID-associated AKI (stage 2 or 3) and long-term kidney dysfunction. In the discovery cohort (N= 437), we identified 413 higher plasma abundances of protein targets and 40 lower plasma abundances of protein targets associated with COVID-AKI (adjusted p <0.05). Of these, 62 proteins were validated in an external cohort (p <0.05, N =261).ResultsWe demonstrate that COVID-AKI is associated with increased markers of tubular injury (NGAL) and myocardial injury. Using estimated glomerular filtration (eGFR) measurements taken after discharge, we also find that 25 of the 62 AKI-associated proteins are significantly associated with decreased post-discharge eGFR (adjusted p <0.05). Proteins most strongly associated with decreased post-discharge eGFR includeddesmocollin-2,trefoil factor 3,transmembrane emp24 domain-containing protein 10, andcystatin-Cindicating tubular dysfunction and injury.ConclusionsUsing clinical and proteomic data, our results suggest that while both acute and long-term COVID-associated kidney dysfunction are associated with markers of tubular dysfunction, AKI is driven by a largely multifactorial process involving hemodynamic instability and myocardial damage."

We aimed to identify protein biomarkers of the DASH diet using data from 2 randomized feeding studies and validate them in an observational study, the ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) study. Methods and Results Large-scale proteomic profiling was conducted in serum specimens (SomaLogic) collected at the end of 8-week and 4-week DASH diet interventions in multicenter, randomized controlled feeding studies of the DASH trial (N=215) and the DASH-Sodium trial (N=396), respectively. Multivariable linear regression models were used to compare the relative abundance of 7241 proteins between the DASH and control diet interventions. Estimates from the 2 trials were meta-analyzed using fixed-effects models. We validated significant proteins in the ARIC study (N=10 490) using the DASH diet score. At a false discovery rate <0.05, there were 71 proteins that were different between the DASH diet and control diet in the DASH and DASH-Sodium trials. Nineteen proteins were validated in the ARIC study. The 19 proteins collectively improved the prediction of the DASH diet intervention in the feeding studies (range of difference in C statistics, 0.267-0.313;P<0.001 for both tests) and the DASH diet score in the ARIC study (difference in C statistics, 0.017;P<0.001) beyond participant characteristics. Conclusions We identified 19 proteins robustly associated with the DASH diet in 3 studies, which may serve as biomarkers of the DASH diet. These results suggest potential pathways that are impacted by consumption of the DASH diet. Registration URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; Unique identifiers: NCT03403166, NCT00000608."

While promising combination chemotherapy treatments and novel immunotherapies have improved patient outcomes, resistance to these treatments remains poorly understood. New insights into the dysregulation of the epigenome show how it promotes tumor growth and resistance to therapy. By altering control of gene expression, tumor cells can evade immune cell recognition, ignore apoptotic cues, and reverse DNA damage induced by chemotherapies.

However, systematic analysis of cancer enhancers poses a challenge due to the lack of integrative data resources, especially those from tumor primary tissues. To provide a comprehensive enhancer profile across cancer types, we developed a cancer enhancer database CenhANCER by curating public resources including all the public H3K27ac ChIP-Seq data from 805 primary tissue samples and 671 cell line samples across 41 cancer types. In total, 57 029 408 typical enhancers, 978 411 super-enhancers and 226 726 enriched transcription factors were identified. We annotated the super-enhancers with chromatin accessibility regions, cancer expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), genotype-tissue expression eQTLs and genome-wide association study risk single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for further functional analysis. The identified enhancers were highly consistent with accessible chromatin regions in the corresponding cancer types, and all the 10 super-enhancer regions identified from one colorectal cancer study were recapitulated in our CenhANCER, both of which testified the high quality of our data. CenhANCER with high-quality cancer enhancer candidates and transcription factors that are potential therapeutic targets across multiple cancer types provides a credible resource for single cancer analysis and for comparative studies of various cancer types.

"37144127","Predicting enhancer-promoter interaction based on epigenomic signals.","Front Genet","Introduction:The physical interactions between enhancers and promoters are often involved in gene transcriptional regulation. High tissue-specific enhancer-promoter interactions (EPIs) are responsible for the differential expression of genes. Experimental methods are time-consuming and labor-intensive in measuring EPIs. An alternative approach, machine learning, has been widely used to predict EPIs. However, most existing machine learning methods require a large number of functional genomic and epigenomic features as input, which limits the application to different cell lines.Methods:In this paper, we developed a random forest model, HARD (H3K27ac, ATAC-seq, RAD21, and Distance), to predict EPI using only four types of features.Results:Independent tests on a benchmark dataset showed that HARD outperforms other models with the fewest features.Discussion:Our results revealed that chromatin accessibility and the binding of cohesin are important for cell-line-specific EPIs. Furthermore, we trained the HARD model in the GM12878 cell line and performed testing in the HeLa cell line. The cross-cell-lines prediction also performs well, suggesting it has the potential to be applied to other cell lines.Copyright © 2023 Zheng, Liu, Zhu, Ding and Wu."

The increasing availability of data may allow the development of machine-learning algorithms capable of accurate diagnostic predictions using low-cost measures to supplement human decision-making. We report on the performance of multiple classification methods used to predict a clinician-consensus ADHD diagnosis. Methods ranged from fairly simple (e.g., logistic regression) to more complex (e.g., random forest), while emphasizing a multi-stage Bayesian approach. Classifiers were evaluated in two large (N>1000), independent cohorts. The multi-stage Bayesian classifier provides an intuitive approach consistent with clinical workflows, and was able to predict expert consensus ADHD diagnosis with high accuracy (>86%)-though not significantly better than other methods. Results suggest that parent and teacher surveys are sufficient for high-confidence classifications in the vast majority of cases, while an important minority require additional evaluation for accurate diagnosis."
"37198436","Single-cell and spatial transcriptomics: deciphering brain complexity in health and disease.","Nat Rev Neurol","In the past decade, single-cell technologies have proliferated and improved from their technically challenging beginnings to become common laboratory methods capable of determining the expression of thousands of genes in thousands of cells simultaneously. The field has progressed by taking the CNS as a primary research subject - the cellular complexity and multiplicity of neuronal cell types provide fertile ground for the increasing power of single-cell methods. Current single-cell RNA sequencing methods can quantify gene expression with sufficient accuracy to finely resolve even subtle differences between cell types and states, thus providing a great tool for studying the molecular and cellular repertoire of the CNS and its disorders. However, single-cell RNA sequencing requires the dissociation of tissue samples, which means that the interrelationships between cells are lost. Spatial transcriptomic methods bypass tissue dissociation and retain this spatial information, thereby allowing gene expression to be assessed across thousands of cells within the context of tissue structural organization. Here, we discuss how single-cell and spatially resolved transcriptomics have been contributing to unravelling the pathomechanisms underlying brain disorders. We focus on three areas where we feel these new technologies have provided particularly useful insights: selective neuronal vulnerability, neuroimmune dysfunction and cell-type-specific treatment response. We also discuss the limitations and future directions of single-cell and spatial RNA sequencing technologies.© 2023. Springer Nature Limited."
"37189441","Large-Scale Integration of Single-Cell RNA-Seq Data Reveals Astrocyte Diversity and Transcriptomic Modules across Six Central Nervous System Disorders.","Biomolecules","The dysfunction of astrocytes in response to environmental factors contributes to many neurological diseases by impacting neuroinflammation responses, glutamate and ion homeostasis, and cholesterol and sphingolipid metabolism, which calls for comprehensive and high-resolution analysis. However, single-cell transcriptome analyses of astrocytes have been hampered by the sparseness of human brain specimens. Here, we demonstrate how large-scale integration of multi-omics data, including single-cell and spatial transcriptomic and proteomic data, overcomes these limitations. We created a single-cell transcriptomic dataset of human brains by integration, consensus annotation, and analyzing 302 publicly available single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets, highlighting the power to resolve previously unidentifiable astrocyte subpopulations. The resulting dataset includes nearly one million cells that span a wide variety of diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), multiple sclerosis (MS), epilepsy (Epi), and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). We profiled the astrocytes at three levels, subtype compositions, regulatory modules, and cell-cell communications, and comprehensively depicted the heterogeneity of pathological astrocytes. We constructed seven transcriptomic modules that are involved in the onset and progress of disease development, such as the M2 ECM and M4 stress modules. We validated that the M2 ECM module could furnish potential markers for AD early diagnosis at both the transcriptome and protein levels. In order to accomplish a high-resolution, local identification of astrocyte subtypes, we also carried out a spatial transcriptome analysis of mouse brains using the integrated dataset as a reference. We found that astrocyte subtypes are regionally heterogeneous. We identified dynamic cell-cell interactions in different disorders and found that astrocytes participate in key signaling pathways, such as NRG3-ERBB4, in epilepsy. Our work supports the utility of large-scale integration of single-cell transcriptomic data, which offers new insights into underlying multiple CNS disease mechanisms where astrocytes are involved."

Reactive astrocytes are important in the onset and progression of many neuropathologies, such as neurotrauma, stroke, and neurodegenerative diseases. Single-cell transcriptomics has revealed remarkable heterogeneity of reactive astrocytes, indicating their multifaceted functions in a whole spectrum of neuropathologies, with important temporal and spatial resolution, both in the brain and in the spinal cord. Interestingly, transcriptomic signatures of reactive astrocytes partially overlap between neurological diseases, suggesting shared and unique gene expression patterns in response to individual neuropathologies. In the era of single-cell transcriptomics, the number of new datasets steeply increases, and they often benefit from comparisons and integration with previously published work.

We recruited and vaccinated 39 older adults (>60 years) with PPSV23 or PCV13. Both vaccines induced strong antibody responses at day 28 and similar plasmablast transcriptional signatures at day 10, however, their baseline predictors were distinct. Analyses of baseline flow cytometry and RNA-seq data (bulk and single cell) revealed a novel baseline phenotype that is specifically associated with weaker PCV13 responses, characterized by i) increased expression of cytotoxicity-associated genes and increased CD16+NK frequency; ii) increased Th17 and decreased Th1 cell frequency. Men were more likely to display this cytotoxic phenotype and mounted weaker responses to PCV13 than women. Baseline expression levels of a distinct gene set was predictive of PPSV23 responses.

The standard approach is to apply a transformation to the count matrix, followed by principal components analysis. However, this approach can spuriously indicate heterogeneity where it does not exist and mask true heterogeneity where it does exist. An alternative approach is to directly model the counts, but existing model-based methods tend to be computationally intractable on large datasets and do not quantify uncertainty in the low-dimensional representation. To address these problems, we develop scGBM, a novel method for model-based dimensionality reduction of single-cell RNA-seq data. scGBM employs a scalable algorithm to fit a Poisson bilinear model to datasets with millions of cells and quantifies the uncertainty in each cell's latent position. Furthermore, scGBM leverages these uncertainties to assess the confidence associated with a given cell clustering. On real and simulated single-cell data, we find that scGBM produces low-dimensional embeddings that better capture relevant biological information while removing unwanted variation. scGBM is publicly available as an R package."

However, little is known about their genomes, biology, and ecological role.We present the first nuclear genome sequence from a diplonemid, the type species Diplonema papillatum. The ~ 280-Mb genome assembly contains about 32,000 protein-coding genes, likely co-transcribed in groups of up to 100. Gene clusters are separated by long repetitive regions that include numerous transposable elements, which also reside within introns. Analysis of gene-family evolution reveals that the last common diplonemid ancestor underwent considerable metabolic expansion. D. papillatum-specific gains of carbohydrate-degradation capability were apparently acquired via horizontal gene transfer. The predicted breakdown of polysaccharides including pectin and xylan is at odds with reports of peptides being the predominant carbon source of this organism. Secretome analysis together with feeding experiments suggest that D. papillatum is predatory, able to degrade cell walls of live microeukaryotes, macroalgae, and water plants, not only for protoplast feeding but also for metabolizing cell-wall carbohydrates as an energy source. The analysis of environmental barcode samples shows that D. papillatum is confined to temperate coastal waters, presumably acting in bioremediation of eutrophication.Nuclear genome information will allow systematic functional and cell-biology studies in D. papillatum. It will also serve as a reference for the highly diverse diplonemids and provide a point of comparison for studying gene complement evolution in the sister group of Kinetoplastida, including human-pathogenic taxa.© 2023.

Here, we present the novel, unsupervised algorithm Identify Cell states Across Treatments (ICAT) that employs self-supervised feature weighting and control-guided clustering to accurately resolve cell states across heterogeneous conditions.Using simulated and real datasets, we show ICAT is superior in identifying and resolving cell states compared with current integration workflows. While requiring no a priori knowledge of extant cell states or discriminatory marker genes, ICAT is robust to low signal strength, high perturbation severity, and disparate cell type proportions. We empirically validate ICAT in a developmental model and find that only ICAT identifies a perturbation-unique cellular response.

Cardiovascular risk factors may impair MSC mitochondrial structure and function, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. We hypothesized that metabolic syndrome (MetS) induces epigenetic alterations in mitochondria-related genes in swine MSCs. Pigs were fed a Lean or MetS diet (n= 6 each) for 16 weeks. MSCs were collected from subcutaneous abdominal fat, and DNA hydroxymethylation (5 hmC) profiles of mitochondria-related genes (MitoCarta-2.0) were analyzed by hydroxymethylated DNA immunoprecipitation and next-generation sequencing (hMeDIP-seq) in Lean- and MetS-MSCs untreated or treated with the epigenetic modulator vitamin (Vit)-C (n= 3 each). Functional analysis of genes with differential 5 hmC regions was performed using DAVID6.8. Mitochondrial structure (electron microscopy), oxidative stress, and membrane potential were assessed. hMeDIP-seq identified 172 peaks (associated with 103 mitochondrial genes) with higher and 416 peaks (associated with 165 mitochondrial genes) with lower 5 hmC levels in MetS-MSCs versus Lean-MSCs (≥2-fold,p< 0.05). Genes with higher 5 hmC levels in MetS + MSCs were primarily implicated in fatty acid metabolism, whereas those with lower 5 hmC levels were associated with electron transport chain activity. Vit-C increased 5 hmC levels in mitochondrial antioxidant genes, improved mitochondrial structure and membrane potential, and decreased oxidative stress. MetS alters 5 hmC levels of mitochondria-related genes in swine MSCs. Vit-C modulated 5 hmC levels in these genes and preserved mitochondrial structure and function in MetS-MSCs. These observations may contribute to development of strategies to overcome the deleterious effects of MetS on MSCs."

Estimation of co-expression networks is well-established for bulk RNA-seq; however, single-cell measurements pose novel challenges due to technical limitations and noise levels of this technology. Gene-gene correlation estimates from scRNA-seq tend to be severely biased towards zero for genes with low and sparse expression. Here, we present Dozer to debias gene-gene correlation estimates from scRNA-seq datasets and accurately quantify network level variation across individuals. Dozer corrects correlation estimates in the general Poisson measurement model and provides a metric to quantify genes measured with high noise. Computational experiments establish that Dozer estimates are robust to mean expression levels of the genes and the sequencing depths of the datasets. Compared to alternatives, Dozer results in fewer false positive edges in the co-expression networks, yields more accurate estimates of network centrality measures and modules, and improves the faithfulness of networks estimated from separate batches of the datasets. We showcase unique analyses enabled by Dozer in two population-scale scRNA-seq applications. Co-expression network-based centrality analysis of multiple differentiating human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines yields biologically coherent gene groups that are associated with iPSC differentiation efficiency. Application with population-scale scRNA-seq of oligodendrocytes from postmortem human tissues of Alzheimer disease and controls uniquely reveals co-expression modules of innate immune response with markedly different co-expression levels between the diagnoses. Dozer represents an important advance in estimating personalized co-expression networks from scRNA-seq data."

In a previous epidemiological study, we found that ancestral exposure (F0 generation) to endocrine disruptors or the common plasticizer DEHP promoted allergic airway inflammation via transgenerational transmission in mice from generation F1 to F4. In the current study, we employed a MethylationEPIC Beadchip microarray to examine global DNA methylation in the human placenta as a function of maternal exposure to DEHP during pregnancy. Interestingly, global DNA hypomethylation was observed in placental DNA following exposure to DEHP at high concentrations. Bioinformatic analysis confirmed that DNA methylation affected genes related to neurological disorders, such as autism and dementia. These results suggest that maternal exposure to DEHP may predispose offspring to neurological diseases. Given the small sample size in this study, the potential role of DNA methylation as a biomarker to assess the risk of these diseases deserves further investigation.© 2023. The Author(s)."

"37152062","Monitoring EGFR-lung cancer evolution: a possible beginning of a ""methylation era"" in TKI resistance prediction.","Front Oncol","The advances in scientific knowledge on biological therapies of the last two decades have impressively oriented the clinical management of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. The treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in patients harboring Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR)-activating mutations is dramatically associated with an improvement in disease control. Anyhow, the prognosis for this selected group of patients remains unfavorable, due to the innate and/or acquired resistance to biological therapies. The methylome analysis of many tumors revealed multiple patterns of methylation at single/multiple cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites that are linked to the modulation of several cellular pathways involved in cancer onset and progression. In lung cancer patients, ever increasing evidences also suggest that the association between DNA methylation changes at promoter/intergenic regions and the consequent alteration of gene-expression signatures could be related to the acquisition of resistance to biological therapies. Despite this intriguing hypothesis, large confirmatory studies are demanded to consolidate and finalize many preliminary observations made in this field. In this review, we will summarize the available knowledge about the dynamic role of DNA methylation inEGFR-mutated NSCLC patients.Copyright © 2023 Fabrizio, Sparaneo and Muscarella."
"37152045","Liquid biopsy in hematological malignancies: current and future applications.","Front Oncol","The assessment of the cancer mutational profile is crucial for patient management, stratification, and therapeutic decisions. At present, in hematological malignancies with a solid mass, such as lymphomas, tumor genomic profiling is generally performed on the tissue biopsy, but the tumor may harbor genetic lesions that are unique to other anatomical compartments. The analysis of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) on the liquid biopsy is an emerging approach that allows genotyping and monitoring of the disease during therapy and follow-up. This review presents the different methods for ctDNA analysis and describes the application of liquid biopsy in different hematological malignancies. In diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), ctDNA analysis on the liquid biopsy recapitulates the mutational profile of the tissue biopsy and can identify mutations otherwise absent on the tissue biopsy. In addition, changes in the ctDNA amount after one or two courses of chemotherapy significantly predict patient outcomes. ctDNA analysis has also been tested in myeloid neoplasms with promising results. In addition to mutational analysis, liquid biopsy also carries potential future applications of ctDNA, including the analysis of ctDNA fragmentation and epigenetic patterns. On these grounds, several clinical trials aiming at incorporating ctDNA analysis for treatment tailoring are currently ongoing in hematological malignancies.Copyright © 2023 Talotta, Almasri, Cosentino, Gaidano and Moia."
"37143897","Recent advances in optical aptasensors for biomarkers in early diagnosis and prognosis monitoring of hepatocellular carcinoma.","Front Cell Dev Biol","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounts for approximately 90% of all primary liver cancers and is one of the main malignant tumor types globally. It is essential to develop rapid, ultrasensitive, and accurate strategies for the diagnosis and surveillance of HCC. In recent years, aptasensors have attracted particular attention owing to their high sensitivity, excellent selectivity, and low production costs. Optical analysis, as a potential analytical tool, offers the advantages of a wide range of targets, rapid response, and simple instrumentation. In this review, recent progress in several types of optical aptasensors for biomarkers in early diagnosis and prognosis monitoring of HCC is summarized. Furthermore, we evaluate the strengths and limitations of these sensors and discuss the challenges and future perspectives for their use in HCC diagnosis and surveillance.Copyright © 2023 Dong, Wang, Yuan, Guo, Yu, Peng, Cai, Xue, Zhou, Sun and Chen."
"37066361","Enhanced performance of gene expression predictive models with protein-mediated spatial chromatin interactions.","bioRxiv","There have been multiple attempts to predict the expression of the genes based on the sequence, epigenetics, and various other factors. To improve those predictions, we have decided to investigate adding protein-specific 3D interactions that play a major role in the compensation of the chromatin structure in the cell nucleus. To achieve this, we have used the architecture of one of the state-of-the-art algorithms, ExPecto (J. Zhou et al., 2018), and investigated the changes in the model metrics upon adding the spatially relevant data. We have used ChIA-PET interactions that are mediated by cohesin (24 cell lines), CTCF (4 cell lines), and RNAPOL2 (4 cell lines). As the output of the study, we have developed the Spatial Gene Expression (SpEx) algorithm that shows statistically significant improvements in most cell lines."

An accumulating body of evidence suggests that these cardiovascular disorders in women, occurring before and during their pregnancy, can affect the development of the structure, physiology and function of cardiovascular organ systems at different stages during embryonic and fetal development. These developmental adaptations might, in addition to genetics and sociodemographic and lifestyle factors, increase the susceptibility of the offspring to cardiovascular disease throughout the life course. In this Review, we discuss current knowledge of the influence of maternal cardiovascular disorders, occurring before and during pregnancy, on offspring cardiovascular development, dysfunction and disease from embryonic life until adulthood. We discuss findings from contemporary, large-scale, observational studies that provide insights into specific critical periods, evidence for causality and potential underlying mechanisms. Furthermore, we focus on priorities for future research, including defining optimal cardiovascular and reproductive health in women and men before their pregnancy and identifying specific embryonic, placental and fetal molecular developmental adaptations from early pregnancy onwards. Together, these approaches will help stop the intergenerational cycle of cardiovascular disease.© 2023.

"37173615","Improving variant calling using population data and deep learning.","BMC Bioinformatics","Large-scale population variant data is often used to filter and aid interpretation of variant calls in a single sample. These approaches do not incorporate population information directly into the process of variant calling, and are often limited to filtering which trades recall for precision. In this study, we develop population-aware DeepVariant models with a new channel encoding allele frequencies from the 1000 Genomes Project. This model reduces variant calling errors, improving both precision and recall in single samples, and reduces rare homozygous and pathogenic clinvar calls cohort-wide. We assess the use of population-specific or diverse reference panels, finding the greatest accuracy with diverse panels, suggesting that large, diverse panels are preferable to individual populations, even when the population matches sample ancestry. Finally, we show that this benefit generalizes to samples with different ancestry from the training data even when the ancestry is also excluded from the reference panel.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37145601","Demographic Characteristics Associated With Perceptions of Personal Utility in Genetic and Genomic Testing: A Systematic Review.","JAMA Netw Open","The expansion of genetic and genomic testing in health care has led to recognition that these tests provide personal as well as clinical utility to patients and families. However, available systematic reviews on this topic have not reported the demographic backgrounds of participants in studies of personal utility, leaving generalizability unclear.To determine the demographic characteristics of participants in studies examining the personal utility of genetic and genomic testing in health care.For this systematic review, we utilized and updated the results of a highly cited 2017 systematic review on the personal utility of genetics and genomics, which identified relevant articles published between January 1, 2003, and August 4, 2016. We also used the original methods to update this bibliography with literature published subsequently up to January 1, 2022. Studies were screened for eligibility by 2 independent reviewers. Eligible studies reported empirical data on the perspectives of patients, family members, and/or the general public in the US on the personal utility of any type of health-related genetic or genomic test. We utilized a standardized codebook to extract study and participant characteristics. We summarized demographic characteristics descriptively across all studies and by subgroup based on study and participant characteristics.We included 52 studies with 13 251 eligible participants. Sex or gender was the most frequently reported demographic characteristic (48 studies [92.3%]), followed by race and ethnicity (40 studies [76.9%]), education (38 studies [73.1%]), and income (26 studies [50.0%]). Across studies, participants disproportionately were women or female (mean [SD], 70.8% [20.5%]), were White (mean [SD], 76.1% [22.0%]), had a college degree or higher (mean [SD], 64.5% [19.9%]), and reported income above the US median (mean [SD], 67.4% [19.2%]). Examination of subgroups of results by study and participant characteristics evidenced only small shifts in demographic characteristics.This systematic review examined the demographic characteristics of individual participants in studies of the personal utility of health-related genetic and genomic testing in the US. The results suggest that participants in these studies were disproportionately White, college-educated women with above-average income. Understanding the perspectives of more diverse individuals regarding the personal utility of genetic and genomic testing may inform barriers to research recruitment and uptake of clinical testing in currently underrepresented populations."
"37169761","Base-resolution UV footprinting by sequencing reveals distinctive damage signatures for DNA-binding proteins.","Nat Commun","Decades ago, it was shown that proteins binding to DNA can quantitatively alter the formation of DNA damage by UV light. This established the principle of UV footprinting for non-intrusive study of protein-DNA contacts in living cells, albeit at limited scale and precision. Here, we perform deep base-resolution quantification of the principal UV damage lesion, the cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD), at select human promoter regions using targeted CPD sequencing. Several transcription factors exhibited distinctive and repeatable damage signatures indicative of site occupancy, involving strong (up to 17-fold) position-specific elevations and reductions in CPD formation frequency relative to naked DNA. Positive damage modulation at some ETS transcription factor binding sites coincided at base level with melanoma somatic mutation hotspots. Our work provides proof of concept for the study of protein-DNA interactions at individual loci using light and sequencing, and reveals widespread and potent modulation of UV damage in regulatory regions.© 2023.

"37140548","HAMPLE: deciphering TF-DNA binding mechanism in different cellular environments by characterizing higher-order nucleotide dependency.","Bioinformatics","Transcription factor (TF) binds to conservative DNA binding sites in different cellular environments and development stages by physical interaction with interdependent nucleotides. However, systematic computational characterization of the relationship between higher-order nucleotide dependency and TF-DNA binding mechanism in diverse cell types remains challenging.Here, we propose a novel multi-task learning framework HAMPLE to simultaneously predict TF binding sites (TFBS) in distinct cell types by characterizing higher-order nucleotide dependencies. Specifically, HAMPLE first represents a DNA sequence through three higher-order nucleotide dependencies, including k-mer encoding, DNA shape and histone modification. Then, HAMPLE uses the customized gate control and the channel attention convolutional architecture to further capture cell-type-specific and cell-type-shared DNA binding motifs and epigenomic languages. Finally, HAMPLE exploits the joint loss function to optimize the TFBS prediction for different cell types in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experimental results on seven datasets demonstrate that HAMPLE significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in terms of auROC. In addition, feature importance analysis illustrates that k-mer encoding, DNA shape, and histone modification have predictive power for TF-DNA binding in different cellular environments and are complementary to each other. Furthermore, ablation study, and interpretable analysis validate the effectiveness of the customized gate control and the channel attention convolutional architecture in characterizing higher-order nucleotide dependencies.The source code is available at https://github.com/ZhangLab312/Hample.© The Author(s) 2023.

"37190127","Androgen Receptor Activation Induces Senescence in Thyroid Cancer Cells.","Cancers (Basel)","Thyroid cancer (TC) is the most common endocrine malignancy, with an approximately three-fold higher incidence in women. TCGA data indicate that androgen receptor (AR) RNA is significantly downregulated in PTC. In this study, AR-expressing 8505C (anaplastic TC) (84E7) and K1 (papillary TC) cells experienced an 80% decrease in proliferation over 6 days of exposure to physiological levels of 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT). In 84E7, continuous AR activation resulted in G1 growth arrest, accompanied by a flattened, vacuolized cell morphology, with enlargement of the cell and the nuclear area, which is indicative of senescence; this was substantiated by an increase in senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity, total RNA and protein content, and reactive oxygen species. Additionally, the expression of tumor suppressor proteins p16, p21, and p27 was significantly increased. A non-inflammatory senescence-associated secretory profile was induced, significantly decreasing inflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as IL-6, IL-8, TNF, RANTES, and MCP-1; this is consistent with the lower incidence of thyroid inflammation and cancer in men. Migration increased six-fold, which is consistent with the clinical observation of increased lymph node metastasis in men. Proteolytic invasion potential was not significantly altered, which is consistent with unchanged MMP/TIMP expression. Our studies provide evidence that the induction of senescence is a novel function of AR activation in thyroid cancer cells, and may underlie the protective role of AR activation in the decreased incidence of TC in men."

Thus far, CCNF expression and its potential as a pancancer biomarker and immunotherapy target have not been reported.TCGA datasets and the R language were used to analyze the pancancer gene expression, protein expression, and methylation levels of CCNF; the relationship of CCNF expression with overall survival (OS), recurrence-free survival (RFS), immune matrix scores, sex and race; and the mechanisms for posttranscriptional regulation of CCNF.CCNF expression analysis showed that CCNF mRNA expression was higher in cancer tissues than in normal tissues in the BRCA, CHOL, COAD, ESCA, HNSC, LUAD, LUSC, READ, STAD, and UCEC; CCNF protein expression was also high in many cancer tissues, indicating that it could be an important predictive factor for OS and RFS. CCNF overexpression may be caused by CCNF hypomethylation. CCNF expression was also found to be significantly different between patients grouped based on sex and race. Overexpression of CCNF reduces immune and stromal cell infiltration in many cancers. Posttranscriptional regulation analysis showed that miR-98-5p negatively regulates the expression of the CCNF gene.CCNF is overexpressed across cancers and is an adverse prognostic factor in terms of OS and RFS in many cancers; this phenomenon may be related to hypomethylation of the CCNF gene, which could lead to cancer progression and worsen prognosis.

"37202496","Mechanisms underlying phenotypic variation in neurogenetic disorders.","Nat Rev Neurol","Neurological diseases associated with pathogenic variants in a specific gene, or even with a specific pathogenic variant, can show profound phenotypic variation with regard to symptom presentation, age at onset and disease course. Highlighting examples from a range of neurogenetic disorders, this Review explores emerging mechanisms that are involved in this variability, including environmental, genetic and epigenetic factors that influence the expressivity and penetrance of pathogenic variants. Environmental factors, some of which can potentially be modified to prevent disease, include trauma, stress and metabolic changes. Dynamic patterns of pathogenic variants might explain some of the phenotypic variations, for example, in the case of disorders caused by DNA repeat expansions such as Huntington disease (HD). An important role for modifier genes has also been identified in some neurogenetic disorders, including HD, spinocerebellar ataxia and X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism. In other disorders, such as spastic paraplegia, the basis for most of the phenotypic variability remains unclear. Epigenetic factors have been implicated in disorders such as SGCE-related myoclonus-dystonia and HD. Knowledge of the mechanisms underlying phenotypic variation is already starting to influence management strategies and clinical trials for neurogenetic disorders.© 2023. Springer Nature Limited."
"37175617","Atherosclerosis and Inflammation: Insights from the Theory of General Pathological Processes.","Int J Mol Sci","Recent advances have greatly improved our understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind atherosclerosis pathogenesis. However, there is still a need to systematize this data from a general pathology perspective, particularly with regard to atherogenesis patterns in the context of both canonical and non-classical inflammation types. In this review, we analyze various typical phenomena and outcomes of cellular pro-inflammatory stress in atherosclerosis, as well as the role of endothelial dysfunction in local and systemic manifestations of low-grade inflammation. We also present the features of immune mechanisms in the development of productive inflammation in stable and unstable plaques, along with their similarities and differences compared to canonical inflammation. There are numerous factors that act as inducers of the inflammatory process in atherosclerosis, including vascular endothelium aging, metabolic dysfunctions, autoimmune, and in some cases, infectious damage factors. Life-critical complications of atherosclerosis, such as cardiogenic shock and severe strokes, are associated with the development of acute systemic hyperinflammation. Additionally, critical atherosclerotic ischemia of the lower extremities induces paracoagulation and the development of chronic systemic inflammation. Conversely, sepsis, other critical conditions, and severe systemic chronic diseases contribute to atherogenesis. In summary, atherosclerosis can be characterized as an independent form of inflammation, sharing similarities but also having fundamental differences from low-grade inflammation and various variants of canonical inflammation (classic vasculitis)."
"37154866","Associations of MTHFR Polymorphisms and Cytosine Modifications with Early-Gestational Diabetes Mellitus in Chinese Pregnant Women.","Reprod Sci","Early-Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (Early-GDM) is a complex condition that may cause complications in infants of affected mothers. The aim of this case-control study was to analyze the effects of genetic-epigenetic interaction on Early-GDM and fetal development with respect to cytosine modifications (i.e., 5mC, 5-methylcytosines; and 5hmC, 5-hydroxymethylcytosines) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of MTHFR, a key gene involving cytosine modifications. Peripheral blood samples were collected from 92 women in their first or second trimester of pregnancy (Early-GDM, n = 14; Controls, n = 78). Global DNA 5mC and 5hmC were quantified by HPLC-MS/MS, and MTHFR SNPs (rs1801133 C > T and rs1801131 A > C) were determined by TaqMan-qPCR. Association analysis suggested that MTHFR rs1801133 TT genotype was a risk factor of Early-GDM (OR [odds ratio] = 4.00; 95% CI [confidence interval]: 1.24, 12.86; p = 0.02). The C allele of rs1801131 appeared to be a protective factor for the 2-h OGTT (oral glucose tolerance test) (OR = -0.79; 95% CI: -1.48, -0.10; p = 0.03). Patients with Early-GDM had higher global 5mC and lower global 5hmC. The reduction of global 5hmC and the TT genotype of rs1801133 were associated with higher level of the 1st-FBG (fasting blood glucose in the first trimester) (p < 0.05). Additionally, global 5mC showed a positive correlation with birth weight, body length and head circumference of newborns, while global 5hmC showed a negative correlation with birth weight. The current study implicated MTHFR SNPs and cytosine modifications in the development of Early-GDM and potential complications in their newborns.© 2023.

"37188763","Single-nucleus multi-omics of human stem cell-derived islets identifies deficiencies in lineage specification.","Nat Cell Biol","Insulin-producing β cells created from human pluripotent stem cells have potential as a therapy for insulin-dependent diabetes, but human pluripotent stem cell-derived islets (SC-islets) still differ from their in vivo counterparts. To better understand the state of cell types within SC-islets and identify lineage specification deficiencies, we used single-nucleus multi-omic sequencing to analyse chromatin accessibility and transcriptional profiles of SC-islets and primary human islets. Here we provide an analysis that enabled the derivation of gene lists and activity for identifying each SC-islet cell type compared with primary islets. Within SC-islets, we found that the difference between β cells and awry enterochromaffin-like cells is a gradient of cell states rather than a stark difference in identity. Furthermore, transplantation of SC-islets in vivo improved cellular identities overtime, while long-term in vitro culture did not. Collectively, our results highlight the importance of chromatin and transcriptional landscapes during islet cell specification and maturation.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37146053","Matrix prior for data transfer between single cell data types in latent Dirichlet allocation.","PLoS Comput Biol","Single cell ATAC-seq (scATAC-seq) enables the mapping of regulatory elements in fine-grained cell types. Despite this advance, analysis of the resulting data is challenging, and large scale scATAC-seq data are difficult to obtain and expensive to generate. This motivates a method to leverage information from previously generated large scale scATAC-seq or scRNA-seq data to guide our analysis of new scATAC-seq datasets. We analyze scATAC-seq data using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), a Bayesian algorithm that was developed to model text corpora, summarizing documents as mixtures of topics defined based on the words that distinguish the documents. When applied to scATAC-seq, LDA treats cells as documents and their accessible sites as words, identifying ""topics"" based on the cell type-specific accessible sites in those cells. Previous work used uniform symmetric priors in LDA, but we hypothesized that nonuniform matrix priors generated from LDA models trained on existing data sets may enable improved detection of cell types in new data sets, especially if they have relatively few cells. In this work, we test this hypothesis in scATAC-seq data from whole C. elegans nematodes and SHARE-seq data from mouse skin cells. We show that nonsymmetric matrix priors for LDA improve our ability to capture cell type information from small scATAC-seq datasets.Copyright: © 2023 Min et al.

However, our understanding of the metastatic process, and thus our ability to prevent or eliminate metastases, remains frustratingly limited. This is largely due to the complexity of metastasis, which is a multistep process that likely differs across cancer types and is greatly influenced by many aspects of the in vivo microenvironment. In this Review, we discuss the key variables to consider when designing assays to study metastasis: which source of metastatic cancer cells to use and where to introduce them into mice to address different questions of metastasis biology. We also examine methods that are being used to interrogate specific steps of the metastatic cascade in mouse models, as well as emerging techniques that may shed new light on previously inscrutable aspects of metastasis. Finally, we explore approaches for developing and using anti-metastatic therapies, and how mouse models can be used to test them.© 2023. Springer Nature Limited."
"37162994","Chromatin structure and context-dependent sequence features control prime editing efficiency.","bioRxiv","Prime editor (PE) is a highly versatile CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing technique. The current constructs, however, have variable efficiency and may require laborious experimental optimization. This study presents statistical models for learning the salient epigenomic and sequence features of target sites modulating the editing efficiency and provides guidelines for designing optimal PEs. We found that both regional constitutive heterochromatin and local nucleosome occlusion of target sites impede editing, while position-specific G/C nucleotides in the primer binding site (PBS) and reverse transcription (RT) template regions of PE guide-RNA (pegRNA) yield high editing efficiency, especially for short PBS designs. The presence of G/C nucleotides was most critical immediately 5' to the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) site for all designs. The effects of different last templated nucleotides were quantified and seen to depend on both PBS and RT template lengths. Our models found AGG to be the preferred PAM and detected a guanine nucleotide four bases downstream of PAM to facilitate editing, suggesting a hitherto-unrecognized interaction with Cas9. A neural network interpretation method based on nonextensive statistical mechanics further revealed multi-nucleotide preferences, indicating dependency among several bases across pegRNA. Our work clarifies previous conflicting observations and uncovers context-dependent features important for optimizing PE designs."
"37139321","A pilot investigation of differential hydroxymethylation levels in patient-derived neural stem cells implicates altered cortical development in bipolar disorder.","Front Psychiatry","Bipolar disorder (BD) is a chronic mental illness characterized by recurrent episodes of mania and depression and associated with social and cognitive disturbances. Environmental factors, such as maternal smoking and childhood trauma, are believed to modulate risk genotypes and contribute to the pathogenesis of BD, suggesting a key role in epigenetic regulation during neurodevelopment. 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) is an epigenetic variant of particular interest, as it is highly expressed in the brain and is implicated in neurodevelopment, and psychiatric and neurological disorders.Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) were generated from the white blood cells of two adolescent patients with bipolar disorder and their same-sex age-matched unaffected siblings (n= 4). Further, iPSCs were differentiated into neuronal stem cells (NSCs) and characterized for purity using immuno-fluorescence. We used reduced representation hydroxymethylation profiling (RRHP) to perform genome-wide 5hmC profiling of iPSCs and NSCs, to model 5hmC changes during neuronal differentiation and assess their impact on BD risk. Functional annotation and enrichment testing of genes harboring differentiated 5hmC loci were performed with the online tool DAVID.Approximately 2 million sites were mapped and quantified, with the majority (68.8%) located in genic regions, with elevated 5hmC levels per site observed for 3' UTRs, exons, and 2-kb shorelines of CpG islands. Paired t-tests of normalized 5hmC counts between iPSC and NSC cell lines revealed global hypo-hydroxymethylation in NSCs and enrichment of differentially hydroxymethylated sites within genes associated with plasma membrane (FDR = 9.1 × 10-12) and axon guidance (FDR = 2.1 × 10-6), among other neuronal processes. The most significant difference was observed for a transcription factor binding site for theKCNK9gene (p= 8.8 × 10-6), encoding a potassium channel protein involved in neuronal activity and migration. Protein-protein-interaction (PPI) networking showed significant connectivity (p= 3.2 × 10-10) between proteins encoded by genes harboring highly differentiated 5hmC sites, with genes involved in axon guidance and ion transmembrane transport forming distinct sub-clusters. Comparison of NSCs of BD cases and unaffected siblings revealed additional patterns of differentiation in hydroxymethylation levels, including sites in genes with functions related to synapse formation and regulation, such asCUX2(p= 2.4 × 10-5) andDOK-7(p= 3.6 × 10-3), as well as an enrichment of genes involved in the extracellular matrix (FDR = 1.0 × 10-8).Together, these preliminary results lend evidence toward a potential role for 5hmC in both early neuronal differentiation and BD risk, with validation and more comprehensive characterization to be achieved through follow-up study.Copyright © 2023 Kumar, Kos, Roybal and Carless."

"37160307","Vitamin C protects retinal ganglion cells via SPP1 in glaucoma and after optic nerve damage.","Life Sci Alliance","Glaucoma is a common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by retinal ganglion cell death, astrocyte reactivity in the optic nerve, and vision loss. Currently, lowering the intraocular pressure (IOP) is the first-line treatment, but adjuvant neuroprotective approaches would be welcome. Vitamin C possesses neuroprotective activities that are thought to be related to its properties as a co-factor of enzymes and its antioxidant effects. Here, we show that vitamin C promotes a neuroprotective phenotype and increases gene expression related to neurotropic factors, phagocytosis, and mitochondrial ATP production. This effect is dependent on the up-regulation of secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1) in reactive astrocytes via the transcription factor E2F1. SPP1+astrocytes in turn promote retinal ganglion cell survival in a mouse model of glaucoma. In addition, oral administration of vitamin C lowers the IOP in mice. This study identifies an additional neuroprotective pathway for vitamin C and suggests a potential therapeutic role of vitamin C in neurodegenerative diseases such as glaucoma.© 2023 Li and Jakobs."
"37118537","Transcriptional memory of dFOXO activation in youth curtails later-life mortality through chromatin remodeling and Xbp1.","Nat Aging","A transient, homeostatic transcriptional response can result in transcriptional memory, programming subsequent transcriptional outputs. Transcriptional memory has great but unappreciated potential to alter animal aging as animals encounter a multitude of diverse stimuli throughout their lifespan. Here we show that activating an evolutionarily conserved, longevity-promoting transcription factor, dFOXO, solely in early adulthood of female fruit flies is sufficient to improve their subsequent health and survival in midlife and late life. This youth-restricted dFOXO activation causes persistent changes to chromatin landscape in the fat body and requires chromatin remodelers such as the SWI/SNF and ISWI complexes to program health and longevity. Chromatin remodeling is accompanied by a long-lasting transcriptional program that is distinct from that observed during acute dFOXO activation and includes induction of Xbp1. We show that this later-life induction of Xbp1 is sufficient to curtail later-life mortality. Our study demonstrates that transcriptional memory can profoundly alter how animals age.© 2022.

Targeting developmentally regulated genes in order to reactivate embryonic intrinsic axon growth capacity or targeting pro-growth tumor suppressor genes such as Pten promotes long-distance axon regeneration in only a small subset of injured retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), despite many RGCs regenerating short-distance axons. A recent study identified αRGCs as the primary type that regenerates short-distance axons in response to Pten inhibition, but the rare types which regenerate long-distance axons, and cellular features that enable such response, remained unknown. Here, we used a new method for capturing specifically the rare long-distance axon-regenerating RGCs, and also compared their transcriptomes with embryonic RGCs, in order to answer these questions. We found the existence of adult non-α intrinsically photosensitive M1 RGC subtypes that retained features of embryonic cell state, and showed that these subtypes partially dedifferentiated towards an embryonic state and regenerated long-distance axons in response to Pten inhibition. We also identified Pten inhibition-upregulated mitochondria-associated genes, Dynlt1a and Lars2, which promote axon regeneration on their own, and thus present novel therapeutic targets.© 2023.

Here, we develop a new transformer-based deep learning model called UNADON, which predicts the genome-wide cytological distance to a specific type of nuclear body, as measured by TSA-seq, using both sequence features and epigenomic signals. Evaluations of UNADON in four cell lines (K562, H1, HFFc6, HCT116) show high accuracy in predicting chromatin spatial positioning to nuclear bodies when trained on a single cell line. UNADON also performed well in an unseen cell type. Importantly, we reveal potential sequence and epigenomic factors that affect large-scale chromatin compartmentalization to nuclear bodies. Together, UNADON provides new insights into the principles between sequence features and large-scale chromatin spatial localization, which has important implications for understanding nuclear structure and function."

Human in vitro gametogenesis (IVG) has the hypothetical ability to offer a unique solution to individuals receiving treatment for cancer which subsequently shortens their reproductive lifespan. Through a simple skin punch biopsy, a patient's fertility could be restored via reprogramming of dermal fibroblast cells to induced pluripotent stem cells, then from primordial germ cell-like cells into viable oocytes and spermatocytes which could be used for embryogenesis. Induced pluripotent stem cells could also be used to form in vitro environments, similar to the ovary or testes, necessary for the maturation of oogonia. This would allow for the entire creation of embryos outside the body, ex vivo. While this area in stem cell biology research offers the potential to revolutionize reproduction as we know it, there are many critical barriers, both scientific and ethical, that need to be overcome to one day see this technology utilized clinically."
"37151874","Application of single-cell RNA sequencing on human testicular samples: a comprehensive review.","Int J Biol Sci","So far there has been no comprehensive review using systematic literature search strategies to show the application of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) in the human testis of the whole life cycle (from embryos to aging males). Here, we summarized the application of scRNA-seq analyses on various human testicular biological samples. A systematic search was conducted in PubMed and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), focusing on English researches published after 2009. Articles related to GEO data-series were also retrieved in PubMed or BioRxiv. 81 full-length studies were finally included in the review. ScRNA-seq has been widely used on different human testicular samples with various library strategies, and new cell subtypes such as State 0 spermatogonial stem cells (SSC) and stage_a/b/c Sertoli cells (SC) were identified. For the development of normal testes, scRNA-seq-based evidence showed dynamic transcriptional changes of both germ cells and somatic cells from embryos to adults. And dysregulated metabolic signaling or hedgehog signaling were revealed by scRNA-seq in aged SC or Leydig cells (LC), respectively. For infertile males, scRNA-seq studies revealed profound changes of testes, such as the increased proportion of immature SC/LC of Klinefelter syndrome, the somatic immaturity and altered germline autophagy of patients with non-obstructive azoospermia, and the repressed differentiation of SSC in trans-females receiving testosterone inhibition therapy. Besides, the re-analyzing of public scRNA-seq data made further discoveries such as the potential vulnerability of testicular SARS-CoV-2 infection, and both evolutionary conservatism and divergence among species. ScRNA-seq analyses would unveil mechanisms of testes' development and changes so as to help developing novel treatments for male infertility.© The author(s)."

"37173897","Novel Mechanisms and Future Opportunities for the Management of Radiation Necrosis in Patients Treated for Brain Metastases in the Era of Immunotherapy.","Cancers (Basel)","Radiation necrosis, also known as treatment-induced necrosis, has emerged as an important adverse effect following stereotactic radiotherapy (SRS) for brain metastases. The improved survival of patients with brain metastases and increased use of combined systemic therapy and SRS have contributed to a growing incidence of necrosis. The cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS) and stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway (cGAS-STING) represents a key biological mechanism linking radiation-induced DNA damage to pro-inflammatory effects and innate immunity. By recognizing cytosolic double-stranded DNA, cGAS induces a signaling cascade that results in the upregulation of type 1 interferons and dendritic cell activation. This pathway could play a key role in the pathogenesis of necrosis and provides attractive targets for therapeutic development. Immunotherapy and other novel systemic agents may potentiate activation of cGAS-STING signaling following radiotherapy and increase necrosis risk. Advancements in dosimetric strategies, novel imaging modalities, artificial intelligence, and circulating biomarkers could improve the management of necrosis. This review provides new insights into the pathophysiology of necrosis and synthesizes our current understanding regarding the diagnosis, risk factors, and management options of necrosis while highlighting novel avenues for discovery."

We aim to explore the effect of host genetic factors and comorbidities on severe COVID-19 risk.A total of 20,320 COVID-19 patients in the UK Biobank cohort were included. Genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) was used to identify host genetic factors in the progression of COVID-19 and a polygenic risk score (PRS) consisted of 86 SNPs was constructed to summarize genetic susceptibility. Colocalization analysis and Logistic regression model were used to assess the association of host genetic factors and comorbidities with COVID-19 severity. All cases were randomly split into training and validation set (1:1). Four algorithms were used to develop predictive models and predict COVID-19 severity. Demographic characteristics, comorbidities and PRS were included in the model to predict the risk of severe COVID-19. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was applied to assess the models' performance.We detected an association with rs73064425 at locus 3p21.31 reached the genome-wide level in GWAS (odds ratio: 1.55, 95% confidence interval: 1.36-1.78). Colocalization analysis found that two genes (SLC6A20 and LZTFL1) may affect the progression of COVID-19. In the predictive model, logistic regression models were selected due to simplicity and high performance. Predictive model consisting of demographic characteristics, comorbidities and genetic factors could precisely predict the patient's progression (AUROC = 82.1%, 95% CI 80.6-83.7%). Nearly 20% of severe COVID-19 events could be attributed to genetic risk.In this study, we identified two 3p21.31 genes as genetic susceptibility loci in patients with severe COVID-19. The predictive model includes demographic characteristics, comorbidities and genetic factors is useful to identify individuals who are predisposed to develop subsequent critical conditions among COVID-19 patients.© 2023.

"37208698","Comparative developmental genomics of sex-biased gene expression in early embryogenesis across mammals.","Biol Sex Differ","Mammalian gonadal sex is determined by the presence or absence of a Y chromosome and the subsequent production of sex hormones contributes to secondary sexual differentiation. However, sex chromosome-linked genes encoding dosage-sensitive transcription and epigenetic factors are expressed well before gonad formation and have the potential to establish sex-biased expression that persists beyond the appearance of gonadal hormones. Here, we apply a comparative bioinformatics analysis on a pair of published single-cell datasets from mouse and human during very early embryogenesis-from two-cell to pre-implantation stages-to characterize sex-specific signals and to assess the degree of conservation among early acting sex-specific genes and pathways.Clustering and regression analyses of gene expression across samples reveal that sex initially plays a significant role in overall gene expression patterns at the earliest stages of embryogenesis which potentially may be the byproduct of signals from male and female gametes during fertilization. Although these transcriptional sex effects rapidly diminish, sex-biased genes appear to form sex-specific protein-protein interaction networks across pre-implantation stages in both mammals providing evidence that sex-biased expression of epigenetic enzymes may establish sex-specific patterns that persist beyond pre-implantation. Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) on male and female transcriptomes generated clusters of genes with similar expression patterns across sex and developmental stages, including post-fertilization, epigenetic, and pre-implantation ontologies conserved between mouse and human. While the fraction of sex-differentially expressed genes (sexDEGs) in early embryonic stages is similar and functional ontologies are conserved, the genes involved are generally different in mouse and human.This comparative study uncovers much earlier than expected sex-specific signals in mouse and human embryos that pre-date hormonal signaling from the gonads. These early signals are diverged with respect to orthologs yet conserved in terms of function with important implications in the use of genetic models for sex-specific disease.© 2023. The Author(s)."

The ELGs were collected for RNA sequencing. LASSO regression was conducted to screen marker genes with the training set. Five genes were selected from 689 differentially expressed genes by LASSO regression, including Synm, Elovl6, Glcci1, Tnks and Ptprt. Expression of Synm was downregulated in ELGs of T2DM mice. Elovl6, Glcci1, Tnks, and Ptprt were upregulated in T2DM mice.

Bats form a particularly interesting group in this regard, as genomic data have helped unearth a vast spectrum of idiosyncrasies in bat genomes associated with bat biology, physiology, and evolution. Bats are important bioindicators and are keystone species to many eco-systems. They often live in proximity to humans and are frequently associated with emerging infectious diseases, including the COVID-19 pandemic. Nearly four dozen bat genomes have been published to date, ranging from drafts to chromosomal level assemblies. Genomic investigations in bats have also become critical towards our understanding of disease biology and host-pathogen coevolution. In addition to whole genome sequencing, low coverage genomic data like reduced representation libraries, resequencing data, etc. have contributed significantly towards our understanding of the evolution of natural populations, and their responses to climatic and anthropogenic perturbations. In this review, we discuss how genomic data have enhanced our understanding of physiological adaptations in bats (particularly related to ageing, immunity, diet, etc.), pathogen discovery, and host pathogen co-evolution. In comparison, the application of NGS towards population genomics, conservation, biodiversity assessment, and functional genomics has been appreciably slower.

Retrospective studies that estimated chronological age from neuroimaging have found accelerated brain aging in obesity, but it is unclear how this estimation would be affected by weight loss following a lifestyle intervention.In a sub-study of 102 participants of the Dietary Intervention Randomized Controlled Trial Polyphenols Unprocessed Study (DIRECT-PLUS) trial, we tested the effect of weight loss following 18 months of lifestyle intervention on predicted brain age based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-assessed resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC). We further examined how dynamics in multiple health factors, including anthropometric measurements, blood biomarkers, and fat deposition, can account for changes in brain age.To establish our method, we first demonstrated that our model could successfully predict chronological age from RSFC in three cohorts (n=291;358;102). We then found that among the DIRECT-PLUS participants, 1% of body weight loss resulted in an 8.9 months' attenuation of brain age. Attenuation of brain age was significantly associated with improved liver biomarkers, decreased liver fat, and visceral and deep subcutaneous adipose tissues after 18 months of intervention. Finally, we showed that lower consumption of processed food, sweets and beverages were associated with attenuated brain age.Successful weight loss following lifestyle intervention might have a beneficial effect on the trajectory of brain aging.The German Research Foundation (DFG), German Research Foundation - project number 209933838 - SFB 1052; B11, Israel Ministry of Health grant 87472511 (to I Shai); Israel Ministry of Science and Technology grant 3-13604 (to I Shai); and the California Walnuts Commission 09933838 SFB 105 (to I Shai).© 2023, Levakov, Kaplan et al."

We recover 221 k nonredundant structural variations (SVs) from the pangenomes, of which 135 k (61%) are common to all three. SVs derived from assembly-based calling show high agreement with the consensus calls from the pangenomes (96%), but validate only a small proportion of variations private to each graph. Pggb and cactus, which also incorporate base-level variation, have approximately 95% exact matches with assembly-derived small variant calls, which significantly improves the edit rate when realigning assemblies compared to minigraph. We use the three pangenomes to investigate 9566 variable number tandem repeats (VNTRs), finding 63% have identical predicted repeat counts in the three graphs, while minigraph can over or underestimate the count given its approximate coordinate system. We examine a highly variable VNTR locus and show that repeat unit copy number impacts the expression of proximal genes and non-coding RNA.Our findings indicate good consensus between the three pangenome methods but also show their individual strengths and weaknesses that need to be considered when analysing different types of variants from multiple input assemblies.© 2023.

LRS provides significant advantages over short-read sequencing approaches, including phasedde novogenome assembly, access to previously excluded genomic regions, and discovery of more complex structural variants (SVs) associated with disease. Limitations remain with respect to cost, scalability, and platform-dependent read accuracy and the tradeoffs between sequence coverage and sensitivity of variant discovery are important experimental considerations for the application of LRS. We compare the genetic variant calling precision and recall of Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) and PacBio HiFi platforms over a range of sequence coverages. For read-based applications, LRS sensitivity begins to plateau around 12-fold coverage with a majority of variants called with reasonable accuracy (F1 score above 0.5), and both platforms perform well for SV detection. Genome assembly increases variant calling precision and recall of SVs and indels in HiFi datasets with HiFi outperforming ONT in quality as measured by the F1 score of assembly-based variant callsets. While both technologies continue to evolve, our work offers guidance to design cost-effective experimental strategies that do not compromise on discovering novel biology."

Although the resolution of these regions in the first complete assembly of a human genome-the Telomere-to-Telomere Consortium's CHM13 assembly (T2T-CHM13)-provided a model of their homology3, it remained unclear whether these patterns were ancestral or maintained by ongoing recombination exchange. Here we show that acrocentric chromosomes contain pseudo-homologous regions (PHRs) indicative of recombination between non-homologous sequences. Utilizing an all-to-all comparison of the human pangenome from the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium4(HPRC), we find that contigs from all of the SAACs form a community. A variation graph5constructed from centromere-spanning acrocentric contigs indicates the presence of regions in which most contigs appear nearly identical between heterologous acrocentric chromosomes in T2T-CHM13. Except on chromosome 15, we observe faster decay of linkage disequilibrium in the pseudo-homologous regions than in the corresponding short and long arms, indicating higher rates of recombination6,7. The pseudo-homologous regions include sequences that have previously been shown to lie at the breakpoint of Robertsonian translocations8, and their arrangement is compatible with crossover in inverted duplications on chromosomes 13, 14 and 21. The ubiquity of signals of recombination between heterologous acrocentric chromosomes seen in the HPRC draft pangenome suggests that these shared sequences form the basis for recurrent Robertsonian translocations, providing sequence and population-based confirmation of hypotheses first developed from cytogenetic studies 50 years ago9.© 2023.

Here we constructed 1:1 unambiguous alignments spanning high-identity SDs across 102 human haplotypes and compared the pattern of SNVs between unique and duplicated regions3,4. We find that human SNVs are elevated 60% in SDs compared to unique regions and estimate that at least 23% of this increase is due to interlocus gene conversion (IGC) with up to 4.3 megabase pairs of SD sequence converted on average per human haplotype. We develop a genome-wide map of IGC donors and acceptors, including 498 acceptor and 454 donor hotspots affecting the exons of about 800 protein-coding genes. These include 171 genes that have 'relocated' on average 1.61 megabase pairs in a subset of human haplotypes. Using a coalescent framework, we show that SD regions are slightly evolutionarily older when compared to unique sequences, probably owing to IGC. SNVs in SDs, however, show a distinct mutational spectrum: a 27.1% increase in transversions that convert cytosine to guanine or the reverse across all triplet contexts and a 7.6% reduction in the frequency of CpG-associated mutations when compared to unique DNA. We reason that these distinct mutational properties help to maintain an overall higher GC content of SD DNA compared to that of unique DNA, probably driven by GC-biased conversion between paralogous sequences5,6.© 2023.

Expression of Klotho, a protein of age-related declines, was upregulated by parishin in serum and vascular tissue in naturally aged mice. Furthermore, FoxO1, on Klotho/FoxO1 signalling pathway, was increased in the parishin-intervened group, accompanied by the downregulated phosphorylated FoxO1.

In the realm of sporadic tauopathies, modelling the process of biological ageing in experimental animals forms the foundation of searching for the molecular origin of pathogenic tau and developing potential therapeutic interventions. Although prior research into transgenic tau models offers valuable lessons for studying how tau mutations and overexpression can drive tau pathologies, the underlying mechanisms by which ageing leads to abnormal tau accumulation remains poorly understood. Mutations associated with human progeroid syndromes have been proposed to be able to mimic an aged environment in animal models.

There are sex disparities in the prevalence and severity of asthma in males and females. Asthma prevalence is higher in males during childhood but increases in females in adulthood. The mechanisms underlying these sex differences are not well understood; nevertheless, genetic variations, hormonal changes, and environmental influences are thought to play important roles. This study aimed to identify sex-specific genetic variants associated with asthma using CLSA genomic and questionnaire data.First, we conducted a genome-wide SNP-by-sex interaction analysis on 23,323 individuals, examining 416,562 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) after quality control, followed by sex-stratified survey logistic regression of SNPs with interaction p-value less than 10¯5.Out of the 49 SNPs with interaction p-value less than 10-5, a sex-stratified survey logistic regression showed that five male-specific SNPs (rs6701638, rs17071077, rs254804, rs6013213, and rs2968822) in/near KIF26B, NMBR, PEPD, RTN4, and NFATC2 loci, and three female-specific SNPs (rs2968801, rs2864052, and rs9525931) in/near RTN4, and SERP2 loci were significantly associated with asthma after Bonferroni correction. An SNP (rs36213) in the EPHB1 gene was significantly associated with an increased risk of asthma in males [OR=1.35, 95% CI (1.14, 1.60)] but with a reduced risk of asthma in females [OR=0.84, 95% CI (0.76, 0.92)] after Bonferroni correction.We discovered novel sex-specific genetic markers in/near the KIF26B, RTN4, EPHB1, NMBR, SERP2, PEPD, and NFATC2 genes that could potentially shed light on the sex differences in asthma susceptibility in males and females. Future mechanistic studies are required to understand better the underlying sex-related pathways of the identified loci in asthma development.© 2023 Odimba et al."

However, risk factors for post-vaccination fatal COVID-19 are largely unknown. We comprehensively studied three large nursing home outbreaks (20-35% fatal cases among residents) by combining severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) aerosol monitoring, whole-genome phylogenetic analysis and immunovirological profiling of nasal mucosa by digital nCounter transcriptomics. Phylogenetic investigations indicated that each outbreak stemmed from a single introduction event, although with different variants (Delta, Gamma and Mu). SARS-CoV-2 was detected in aerosol samples up to 52 d after the initial infection. Combining demographic, immune and viral parameters, the best predictive models for mortality comprised IFNB1 or age, viral ORF7a and ACE2 receptor transcripts. Comparison with published pre-vaccine fatal COVID-19 transcriptomic and genomic signatures uncovered a unique IRF3 low/IRF7 high immune signature in post-vaccine fatal COVID-19 outbreaks. A multi-layered strategy, including environmental sampling, immunomonitoring and early antiviral therapy, should be considered to prevent post-vaccination COVID-19 mortality in nursing homes.© 2023.

"37208701","Osteoarthritis genetic risk acting on the galactosyltransferase gene COLGALT2 has opposing functional effects in articulating joint tissues.","Arthritis Res Ther","Investigation of cartilage and chondrocytes has revealed that the osteoarthritis risk marked by the independent DNA variants rs11583641 and rs1046934 mediate  their effects by decreasing the methylation status of CpG dinucleotides in enhancers and increasing the expression of shared target gene COLGALT2. We set out to investigate if these functional effects operate in a non-cartilaginous joint tissue.Nucleic acids were extracted from the synovium of osteoarthritis patients. Samples were genotyped, and DNA methylation was quantified by pyrosequencing at CpGs within the COLGALT2 enhancers. CpGs were tested for enhancer effects using a synovial cell line and a reporter gene assay. DNA methylation was altered using epigenetic editing, with the impact on gene expression determined using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. In silico analysis complemented laboratory experiments.The rs1046934 genotype did not associate with DNA methylation or COLGALT2 expression in the synovium, whereas the rs11583641 genotype did. Surprisingly, the effects for rs11583641 were opposite to those previously observed in cartilage. Epigenetic editing in synovial cells revealed that enhancer methylation is causally linked to COLGALT2 expression.This is the first direct demonstration for osteoarthritis genetic risk of a functional link between DNA methylation and gene expression operating in opposite directions between articular joint tissues. It highlights pleiotropy in the action of osteoarthritis risk and provides a cautionary note in the application of future genetically based osteoarthritis therapies: an intervention that decreases the detrimental effect of a risk allele in one joint tissue may inadvertently increase its detrimental effect in another joint tissue.© 2023.

"37193857","Hallmarks of cardiovascular ageing.","Nat Rev Cardiol","Normal circulatory function is a key determinant of disease-free life expectancy (healthspan). Indeed, pathologies affecting the cardiovascular system, which are growing in prevalence, are the leading cause of global morbidity, disability and mortality, whereas the maintenance of cardiovascular health is necessary to promote both organismal healthspan and lifespan. Therefore, cardiovascular ageing might precede or even underlie body-wide, age-related health deterioration. In this Review, we posit that eight molecular hallmarks are common denominators in cardiovascular ageing, namely disabled macroautophagy, loss of proteostasis, genomic instability (in particular, clonal haematopoiesis of indeterminate potential), epigenetic alterations, mitochondrial dysfunction, cell senescence, dysregulated neurohormonal signalling and inflammation. We also propose a hierarchical order that distinguishes primary (upstream) from antagonistic and integrative (downstream) hallmarks of cardiovascular ageing. Finally, we discuss how targeting each of the eight hallmarks might be therapeutically exploited to attenuate residual cardiovascular risk in older individuals.© 2023. Springer Nature Limited."
"37118538","Sexual identity of enterocytes regulates autophagy to determine intestinal health, lifespan and responses to rapamycin.","Nat Aging","Pharmacological attenuation of mTOR presents a promising route for delay of age-related disease. Here we show that treatment of Drosophila with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin extends lifespan in females, but not in males. Female-specific, age-related gut pathology is markedly slowed by rapamycin treatment, mediated by increased autophagy. Treatment increases enterocyte autophagy in females, via the H3/H4 histone-Bchs axis, whereas males show high basal levels of enterocyte autophagy that are not increased by rapamycin feeding. Enterocyte sexual identity, determined by transformerFemaleexpression, dictates sexually dimorphic cell size, H3/H4-Bchs expression, basal rates of autophagy, fecundity, intestinal homeostasis and lifespan extension in response to rapamycin. Dimorphism in autophagy is conserved in mice, where intestine, brown adipose tissue and muscle exhibit sex differences in autophagy and response to rapamycin. This study highlights tissue sex as a determining factor in the regulation of metabolic processes by mTOR and the efficacy of mTOR-targeted, anti-aging drug treatments.© 2022. The Author(s)."

However, most direct applications of DL will deliver models with limited transparency and explainability, which constrain their deployment in biomedical settings.This systematic review discusses DL models used to support inference in cancer biology with a particular emphasis on multi-omics analysis. It focuses on how existing models address the need for better dialogue with prior knowledge, biological plausibility and interpretability, fundamental properties in the biomedical domain. For this, we retrieved and analyzed 42 studies focusing on emerging architectural and methodological advances, the encoding of biological domain knowledge and the integration of explainability methods.We discuss the recent evolutionary arch of DL models in the direction of integrating prior biological relational and network knowledge to support better generalisation (e.g. pathways or Protein-Protein-Interaction networks) and interpretability. This represents a fundamental functional shift towards models which can integrate mechanistic and statistical inference aspects. We introduce a concept of bio-centric interpretability and according to its taxonomy, we discuss representational methodologies for the integration of domain prior knowledge in such models.The paper provides a critical outlook into contemporary methods for explainability and interpretability used in DL for cancer. The analysis points in the direction of a convergence between encoding prior knowledge and improved interpretability. We introduce bio-centric interpretability which is an important step towards formalisation of biological interpretability of DL models and developing methods that are less problem- or application-specific.© 2023.

Here, we performed single-cell sequencing (scRNA) on mouse kidneys with five common AKI etiologies (CP-Cisplatin, IRI-Ischemia-reperfusion injury, UUO-Unilateral ureteral obstruction, FA-Folic acid, and SO-Sodium oxalate). We constructed a potent multi-model AKI scRNA atlas containing 20 celltypes with 80,689 high-quality cells. The data suggest that compared to IRI and CP-AKI, FA- and SO-AKI exhibit injury characteristics more similar to UUO-AKI, which may due to tiny crystal-induced intrarenal obstruction. Through scRNA atlas, 7 different functional proximal tubular cell (PTC) subtypes were identified, we found that Maladaptive PTCs and classical Havcr1 PTCs but not novel Krt20 PTCs affect the pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic levels in different AKI models. And cell death and cytoskeletal remodeling events are widespread patterns of injury in PTCs. Moreover, we found that programmed cell death predominated in PTCs, whereas apoptosis and autophagy prevailed in the remaining renal tubules. We also identified S100a6 as a novel AKI-endothelial injury biomarker. Furthermore, we revealed that the dynamic and active immune (especially Arg1 Macro_2 cells) -parenchymal cell interactions are important features of AKI. Taken together, our study provides a potent resource for understanding the pathogenesis of AKI and early intervention in AKI progression at single-cell resolution.© 2023. The Author(s)."

As the variants of concern (VOC) loomed large, definitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 strains became a matter of utmost importance in epidemiological and clinical research. Besides, unveiling the disease pathogenesis at the molecular level and deciphering the therapeutic targets became key priorities since the emergence of the pandemic. Mass spectrometry has been largely used in this regard. A critical part of mass spectrometric analyses is the proteome database required for the identification of peptides. Presently, the mutational information on proteins available on SARS-CoV-2 databases cannot be used to analyze data extracted from mass spectrometers. Hence, we developed the novel Mutant Peptide Database (MPD) for the mass spectrometry (MS)-based identification of mutated peptides, which contains information from 11 proteins of SARS-CoV-2 from a total of 21,549 SARS-CoV-2 variants across different regions of India. The database was validated using clinical samples, and its applicability was also demonstrated with the mutated peptides extracted from the literature. We believe that MPD will support broad-spectrum MS-based studies like viral detection, disease pathogenesis, and therapeutics with respect to SARS-CoV-2 and its variants."
"37080568","Age-related changes in plasma biomarkers and their association with mortality in COVID-19.","Eur Respir J","COVID-19-induced mortality occurs predominantly in older patients. Several immunomodulating therapies seem less beneficial in these patients. The biological substrate behind these observations is unknown. The aim of this study was to obtain insight into the association between ageing, the host response, and mortality in patients with COVID-19.We determined 43 biomarkers reflective of alterations in four pathophysiological domains: endothelial cell and coagulation activation, inflammation and organ damage, and cytokine and chemokine release. We used mediation analysis to associate ageing-driven alterations in the host response with 30-day mortality. Biomarkers associated with both ageing and mortality were validated in an intensive care unit and external cohort.464 general ward patients with COVID-19 were stratified according to age decades. Increasing age was an independent risk factor for 30-day mortality. Ageing was associated with alterations in each of the host response domains, characterised by greater activation of the endothelium and coagulation system and stronger elevation of inflammation and organ damage markers, which was independent of an increase in age-related comorbidities. Soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor 1, soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1, and soluble thrombomodulin showed the strongest correlation with ageing and explained part of the ageing-driven increase in 30-day mortality (proportion mediated: 13.0%, 12.9% and 12.6%, respectively).Ageing is associated with a strong and broad modification of the host response to COVID-19, and specific immune changes likely contribute to increased mortality in older patients. These results may provide insight into potential age-specific immunomodulatory targets in COVID-19.Copyright ©The authors 2023."

Although CeD has been associated with a higher risk for cancer, the role of CeD as a risk factor for specific malignancies, such as enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma (EATL), remains controversial. Using two-sample Mendelian randomization (2SMR) methods and the summarized results of large genome-wide association studies from public repositories, we addressed the causal relationship between CeD and eight different malignancies. Eleven non-HLA SNPs were selected as instrumental variables (IVs), and causality estimates were obtained using four 2SMR methods: random-effects inverse variance-weighted, weighted median estimation, MR-Egger regression, and MR pleiotropy residual sum and outlier (MR-PRESSO). We identified a significant causal relationship between CeD and mature T/NK cell lymphomas. Under a multivariate Mendelian randomization model, we observed that the causal effect of CeD was not dependent on other known lymphoma risk factors. We found that the most instrumental IV was located in theTAGAP locus, suggesting that aberrant T cell activation might be relevant in the T/NK cell malignization process. Our findings provide new insights into the connection between immune imbalance and the development of severe comorbidities, such as EATL, in patients with CeD."

These disruptions accumulate with repeated exposures to stress over time, leading to progressive visual impairment and, in many cases, legal blindness. Despite decades of research, therapeutic options for the millions of patients suffering from these disorders remain severely limited, especially for treating earlier stages of pathogenesis when the opportunity to preserve the retinal structure and visual function is greatest. To address this urgent, unmet medical need, we employed a systems pharmacology platform for therapeutic development. Through integrative single-cell transcriptomics, proteomics, and phosphoproteomics, we identified universal molecular mechanisms across distinct models of age-related and inherited retinal degenerations, characterized by impaired physiological resilience to stress. Here, we report that selective, targeted pharmacological inhibition of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs), which serve as critical regulatory nodes that modulate intracellular second messenger signaling pathways, stabilized the transcriptome, proteome, and phosphoproteome through downstream activation of protective mechanisms coupled with synergistic inhibition of degenerative processes. This therapeutic intervention enhanced resilience to acute and chronic forms of stress in the degenerating retina, thus preserving tissue structure and function across various models of age-related and inherited retinal disease. Taken together, these findings exemplify a systems pharmacology approach to drug discovery and development, revealing a new class of therapeutics with potential clinical utility in the treatment or prevention of the most common causes of blindness."

The prognoses for patients with the same stage of EC can vary substantially. The progress of single-cell analysis technology has furthered the understanding of tumor heterogeneity. This paper aimed to apply single-cell analysis to explore the characteristics of the tumor environment of EC and provide a basis for personalized treatment.The latest gene expression data and clinical follow-up information of single-cell sequencing results of EC samples were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Genomic Data Commons (GDC) Application Programming Interface (API). A differential gene function analysis of the immune infiltration signature agents in the tumor microenvironment (TME) was performed using bioinformatics analytical methods, and potential molecular targets were sought.We identified specific cell subsets in the EC and paracancerous samples, including panel cells, natural killer (NK) cells, exhausted cluster of differentiation (CD)8+T cells, CD8+memory T (Tcm) cells, and effector memory T (Tem) cells, including B cell enrichment in the cancer samples. Differences were detected between B cells and monocytes in stage II and III tumors, which may be related to RNA transcription and degradation. The CXCL8 protein was identified as a valid potential prognostic marker.Cell groups with homogenous cell surface markers exhibit intercellular variations that exert a considerable effect on cell function. Our study will contribute to the understanding of the TME and cellular heterogeneity in EC patients and serve as a valuable resource for in-depth exploration of the pathogenesis of EC and the identification of potential therapeutic targets in the future.2023 Journal of Thoracic Disease.

Here, we apply single-cell RNA sequencing to profile transcriptional cell states of the acoel worm Hofstenia miamia during postembryonic development and regeneration. We identify cell types shared across stages and their associated gene expression dynamics during regeneration. Functional studies confirm that the aPSCs, also known as neoblasts, are the source of differentiated cells and reveal transcription factors needed for differentiation. Subclustering of neoblasts recovers transcriptionally distinct subpopulations, the majority of which are likely specialized to differentiated lineages. One neoblast subset, showing enriched expression of the histone variant H3.3, appears to lack specialization. Altogether, the cell states identified in this study facilitate comparisons to other species and enable future studies of stem cell fate potentials.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Here, we describe four transformation approaches based on the delta method, model residuals, inferred latent expression state and factor analysis. We compare their strengths and weaknesses and find that the latter three have appealing theoretical properties; however, in benchmarks using simulated and real-world data, it turns out that a rather simple approach, namely, the logarithm with a pseudo-count followed by principal-component analysis, performs as well or better than the more sophisticated alternatives.

The accumulating evidence suggests that AD involves a reconfiguration of the epigenetic landscape, including DNA methylation, post-translational modification of histone proteins, and chromatin remodeling. Along with environmental factors, individual specific genetic features play a considerable role in the formation of epigenetic architecture. In this study, we attempt to identify the non-coding regulatory SNPs (rSNPs) able to affect the epigenetic mechanisms in AD. To this end, the multi-omics approach is used. The GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus) available data (GSE153875) for AD patients and controls are integrated to reveal the rSNPs that display allele-specific features in both ChIP-seq profiles of four histone modifications and RNA-seq. Furthermore, we analyze the presence of rSNPs in the promoters of genes reported to be differentially expressed between AD and the normal brain (AD-related genes) and involved in epigenetic regulation according to the EpiFactors database. We also searched for the rSNPs in the promoters of the genes coding for transcription regulators of the identified AD-related genes. These regulators were selected based on the corresponding ChIP-seq peaks (ENCODE) in the promoter regions of these genes. Finally, we formed a panel of rSNPs localized to the promoters of genes that contribute to the epigenetic landscape in AD and, thus, to the genetic predisposition for this disease."

Thus, to improve clinical care of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients, we explored the role of age-related p16 epimutation in intestinal tumorigenesis.We established a mouse model that replicates two common genetic and epigenetic events observed in human CRCs: Apc mutation and p16 epimutation. We conducted long-term survival and histological analysis of tumor development and progression. Colonic epithelial cells and tumors were collected from mice and analyzed by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), quantitative PCR, and flow cytometry. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to characterize tumor-infiltrating immune cells throughout tumor progression. We tested whether anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy affects overall survival of tumor-bearing mice and whether inhibition of both epigenetic regulation and immune checkpoint is more efficacious.Mice carrying combined Apc mutation and p16 epimutation had significantly shortened survival and increased tumor growth compared to those with Apc mutation only. Intriguingly, colon tumors with p16 epimutation exhibited an activated interferon pathway, increased expression of programmed death-ligand 1 (Pdl1), and enhanced infiltration of immune cells. scRNA-seq further revealed the presence of Foxp3+Tregs and γδT17 cells, which contribute to an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Furthermore, we showed that a combined therapy using an inhibitor of DNA methylation and a PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitor is more effective for improving survival in tumor-bearing mice than blockade of either pathway alone.Our study demonstrated that age-dependent p16 epimutation creates a permissive microenvironment for malignant transformation of polyps to colon cancer.

Here, we performed comprehensive analyses of mutational signatures in 2.9 million somatic mutations across multiple non-cancerous tissues, stratified by early and late RT regions. We found that many mutational processes are active mainly or solely in early RT, such as SBS16 in hepatocytes and SBS88 in the colon, or in late RT, such as SBS4 in lung and hepatocytes, and SBS18 across many tissues. The two ubiquitous signatures, SBS1 and SBS5, showed late and early bias, respectively, across multiple tissues and in mutations representing germ cells. We also performed a direct comparison with cancer samples in 4 matched tissue-cancer types. Unexpectedly, while for most signatures the RT bias was consistent in normal tissue and in cancer, we found that SBS1's late RT bias is lost in cancer.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Could plastic ware used during ART trigger defects in the fetal development?Three groups of blastocysts were transferred to pseudopregnant mice. One was obtained after IVF and embryo development in plastic ware, the second in glass ware. The third, was obtained in vivo by natural mating. On day 16.5 of pregnancy, females were sacrificed and fetal organs collected for gene expression analysis. Fetal sex was determined by RT-PCR. RNA was extracted from a pool of five placental or brain samples coming from at least two litters from the same group and analyzed by hybridisation onto the mouse Affymetrix 430.2.0 GeneChips, confirmed by RT-qPCR for 22 genes.This study highlights a major impact of plastic ware on placental gene expression (1121 significantly deregulated genes), while glassware was much closer to in vivo offspring (only 200 significantly deregulated genes). Gene Ontology indicated that the modified placental genes were mostly involved in stress, inflammation and detoxification. A sex specific analysis revealed in addition a more drastic effect on female than male placentas. In the brains, whatever the comparison, less than 50 genes were found deregulated.Embryos incubated in plastic ware resulted in pregnancy with massive alterations of placental gene expression profile in concerted biological functions. There were no obvious effects on the brains. Besides other effects, this suggests that plastic ware in ART could be a cause of the increased level of pregnancy disorders observed recurrently in ART pregnancies.This study was funded by two grants from the Agence de la Biomedecine in 2017 and 2019.Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).

Here, we show that the conditional deletion of the X-linked Utx in germinal center (GC) derived cells collaborates with the activating BrafV600Emutation and promotes induction of lethal GC/post-GC B cell malignancies with MM-like plasma cell neoplasms being the most frequent. Mice that developed MM-like neoplasms showed expansion of clonal plasma cells in the bone marrow and extramedullary organs, serum M proteins, and anemia. Add-back of either wild-type UTX or a series of mutants revealed that cIDR domain, that forms phase-separated liquid condensates, is largely responsible for the catalytic activity-independent tumor suppressor function of UTX in MM cells. Utx loss in concert with BrafV600Eonly slightly induced MM-like profiles of transcriptome, chromatin accessibility, and H3K27 acetylation, however, it allowed plasma cells to gradually undergo full transformation through activation of transcriptional networks specific to MM that induce high levels of Myc expression. Our results reveal a tumor suppressor function of UTX in MM and implicate its insufficiency in the transcriptional reprogramming of plasma cells in the pathogenesis of MM.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Recent computing technologies, such as virtualization, have made it possible to reproduce workflow execution with ease. However, the reproducibility of results is not well discussed; that is, there is no standard way to verify whether the biological interpretation of reproduced results is the same. Therefore, it still remains a challenge to automatically evaluate the reproducibility of results.We propose a new metric, a reproducibility scale of workflow execution results, to evaluate the reproducibility of results. This metric is based on the idea of evaluating the reproducibility of results using biological feature values (e.g., number of reads, mapping rate, and variant frequency) representing their biological interpretation. We also implemented a prototype system that automatically evaluates the reproducibility of results using the proposed metric. To demonstrate our approach, we conducted an experiment using workflows used by researchers in real research projects and the use cases that are frequently encountered in the field of bioinformatics.Our approach enables automatic evaluation of the reproducibility of results using a fine-grained scale. By introducing our approach, it is possible to evolve from a binary view of whether the results are superficially identical or not to a more graduated view.

"37019109","Scalable mixed model methods for set-based association studies on large-scale categorical data analysis and its application to exome-sequencing data in UK Biobank.","Am J Hum Genet","The ongoing release of large-scale sequencing data in the UK Biobank allows for the identification of associations between rare variants and complex traits. SAIGE-GENE+ is a valid approach to conducting set-based association tests for quantitative and binary traits. However, for ordinal categorical phenotypes, applying SAIGE-GENE+ with treating the trait as quantitative or binarizing the trait can cause inflated type I error rates or power loss. In this study, we propose a scalable and accurate method for rare-variant association tests, POLMM-GENE, in which we used a proportional odds logistic mixed model to characterize ordinal categorical phenotypes while adjusting for sample relatedness. POLMM-GENE fully utilizes the categorical nature of phenotypes and thus can well control type I error rates while remaining powerful. In the analyses of UK Biobank 450k whole-exome-sequencing data for five ordinal categorical traits, POLMM-GENE identified 54 gene-phenotype associations.Copyright © 2023 American Society of Human Genetics.

"37176539","Prognostic Models Using Machine Learning Algorithms and Treatment Outcomes of Occult Breast Cancer Patients.","J Clin Med","Occult breast cancer (OBC) is an uncommon malignant tumor and the prognosis and treatment of OBC remain controversial. Currently, there exists no accurate prognostic clinical model for OBC, and the treatment outcomes of chemotherapy and surgery in its different molecular subtypes are still unknown.The SEER database provided the data used for this study's analysis (2010-2019). To identify the prognostic variables for patients with ODC, we conducted Cox regression analysis and constructed prognostic models using six machine learning algorithms to predict overall survival (OS) of OBC patients. A series of validation methods, including calibration curve and area under the curve (AUC value) of receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) were employed to validate the accuracy and reliability of the logistic regression (LR) models. The effectiveness of clinical application of the predictive models was validated using decision curve analysis (DCA). We also investigated the role of chemotherapy and surgery in OBC patients with different molecular subtypes, with the help of K-M survival analysis as well as propensity score matching, and these results were further validated by subgroup Cox analysis.The LR models performed best, with high precision and applicability, and they were proved to predict the OS of OBC patients in the most accurate manner (test set: 1-year AUC = 0.851, 3-year AUC = 0.790 and 5-year survival AUC = 0.824). Interestingly, we found that the N1 and N2 stage OBC patients had more favorable prognosis than N0 stage patients, but the N3 stage was similar to the N0 stage (OS: N0 vs. N1, HR = 0.6602, 95%CI 0.4568-0.9542,p< 0.05; N0 vs. N2, HR = 0.4716, 95%CI 0.2351-0.9464,p< 0.05; N0 vs. N3, HR = 0.96, 95%CI 0.6176-1.5844,p= 0.96). Patients aged >80 and distant metastases were also independent prognostic factors for OBC. In terms of treatment, our multivariate Cox regression analysis discovered that surgery and radiotherapy were both independent protective variables for OBC patients, but chemotherapy was not. We also found that chemotherapy significantly improved both OS and breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) only in the HR-/HER2+ molecular subtype (OS: HR = 0.15, 95%CI 0.037-0.57,p< 0.01; BCSS: HR = 0.027, 95%CI 0.027-0.81,p< 0.05). However, surgery could help only the HR-/HER2+ and HR+/HER2- subtypes improve prognosis.We analyzed the clinical features and prognostic factors of OBC patients; meanwhile, machine learning prognostic models with high precision and applicability were constructed to predict their overall survival. The treatment results in different molecular subtypes suggested that primary surgery might improve the survival of HR+/HER2- and HR-/HER2+ subtypes, however, only the HR-/HER2+ subtype could benefit from chemotherapy. The necessity of surgery and chemotherapy needs to be carefully considered for OBC patients with other subtypes."
"37175559","Mutation Hotspots Found in Bladder Cancer Aid Prediction of Carcinogenic Risk in Normal Urothelium.","Int J Mol Sci","More than 80,000 new cases of bladder cancer are estimated to be diagnosed in 2023. However, the 5-year survival rate for bladder cancer has not changed in decades, highlighting the need for prevention. Numerous cancer-causing mutations are present in the urothelium long before signs of cancer arise. Mutation hotspots in cancer-driving genes were identified in non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) and muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) tumor samples. Mutation burden within the hotspot regions was measured in normal urothelium with a low and high risk of cancer. A significant correlation was found between the mutation burden in normal urothelium and bladder cancer tissue within the hotspot regions. A combination of measured hotspot burden and personal risk factors was used to fit machine learning classification models. The efficacy of each model to differentiate between adjacent benign urothelium from bladder cancer patients and normal urothelium from healthy donors was measured. A random forest model using a combination of personal risk factors and mutations within MIBC hotspots yielded the highest AUC of 0.9286 for the prediction of high- vs. low-risk normal urothelium. Currently, there are no effective biomarkers to assess subclinical field disease and early carcinogenic progression in the bladder. Our findings demonstrate novel differences in mutation hotspots in NMIBC and MIBC and provide the first evidence for mutation hotspots to aid in the assessment of cancer risk in the normal urothelium. Early risk assessment and identification of patients at high risk of bladder cancer before the clinical presentation of the disease can pave the way for targeted personalized preventative therapy."
"37149669","Generalising uncertainty improves accuracy and safety of deep learning analytics applied to oncology.","Sci Rep","Uncertainty estimation is crucial for understanding the reliability of deep learning (DL) predictions, and critical for deploying DL in the clinic. Differences between training and production datasets can lead to incorrect predictions with underestimated uncertainty. To investigate this pitfall, we benchmarked one pointwise and three approximate Bayesian DL models for predicting cancer of unknown primary, using three RNA-seq datasets with 10,968 samples across 57 cancer types. Our results highlight that simple and scalable Bayesian DL significantly improves the generalisation of uncertainty estimation. Moreover, we designed a prototypical metric-the area between development and production curve (ADP), which evaluates the accuracy loss when deploying models from development to production. Using ADP, we demonstrate that Bayesian DL improves accuracy under data distributional shifts when utilising 'uncertainty thresholding'. In summary, Bayesian DL is a promising approach for generalising uncertainty, improving performance, transparency, and safety of DL models for deployment in the real world.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Consensus clustering was used to establish groups of ccRCC with distinct clinical outcomes. A prognostic signature based on two sets of DNA methylation regulators was established and validated in an independent cohort.Our analysis revealed that the expression levels of DNMT3B, MBD1, SMUG1, DNMT1, DNMT3A, TDG, TET3, MBD2, UHRF2, MBD3, UHRF1, and TET2 were significantly upregulated in ccRCC samples, while UNG, ZBTB4, TET1, ZBTB38, and MECP2 were markedly downregulated. UHRF1 was identified as a hub gene in the DNA methylation regulator interaction network. Significant differences were found regarding overall survival, gender, tumor status, and grade between ccRCC patients in the two risk groups. The prognostic signature, based on two sets of DNA methylation regulators, was an independent prognostic indicator, and these findings were validated in an external, independent cohort.The study provides evidence that DNA methylation regulators play a significant role in the prognosis of ccRCC and the developed DNA methylation regulator-based signature could effectively predict patient outcome.AJTR Copyright © 2023."

"37143893","Mechanically induced alterations in chromatin architecture guide the balance between cell plasticity and mechanical memory.","Front Cell Dev Biol","Phenotypic plasticity, or adaptability, of a cell determines its ability to survive and function within changing cellular environments. Changes in the mechanical environment, ranging from stiffness of the extracellular matrix (ECM) to physical stress such as tension, compression, and shear, are critical environmental cues that influence phenotypic plasticity and stability. Furthermore, an exposure to a prior mechanical signal has been demonstrated to play a fundamental role in modulating phenotypic changes that persist even after the mechanical stimulus is removed, creating stable mechanical memories. In this mini review, our objective is to highlight how the mechanical environment alters both phenotypic plasticity and stable memories through changes in chromatin architecture, mainly focusing on examples in cardiac tissue. We first explore how cell phenotypic plasticity is modulated in response to changes in the mechanical environment, and then connect the changes in phenotypic plasticity to changes in chromatin architecture that reflect short-term and long-term memories. Finally, we discuss how elucidating the mechanisms behind mechanically induced chromatin architecture that lead to cell adaptations and retention of stable mechanical memories could uncover treatment methods to prevent mal-adaptive permanent disease states.Copyright © 2023 Scott, Rafuse and Neu."

We employed a robust rank aggregation (RRA) algorithm to shortlist the key differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between Group I PAH patients and controls. An optimal diagnostic model was obtained by comparing seven machine learning algorithms and was verified in an independent dataset. The functional roles of key DEGs and biomarkers were analyzed using various in silico methods. Finally, the biomarkers and a set of key candidates were experimentally validated using patient samples and a cell line model. A total of 48 key DEGs with preferable diagnostic value were identified. A gradient boosting decision tree algorithm was utilized to build a diagnostic model with three biomarkers, PBRM1, CA1, and TXLNG. An immune-cell infiltration analysis revealed significant differences in the relative abundances of seven immune cells between controls and PAH patients and a correlation with the biomarkers. Experimental validation confirmed the upregulation of the three biomarkers in Group I PAH patients. In conclusion, machine learning and a bioinformatics analysis along with experimental techniques identified PBRM1, CA1, and TXLNG as potential biomarkers for Group I PAH."
"37159360","Substance use disorders: a comprehensive update of classification, epidemiology, neurobiology, clinical aspects, treatment and prevention.","World Psychiatry","Substance use disorders (SUDs) are highly prevalent and exact a large toll on individuals' health, well-being, and social functioning. Long-lasting changes in brain networks involved in reward, executive function, stress reactivity, mood, and self-awareness underlie the intense drive to consume substances and the inability to control this urge in a person who suffers from addiction (moderate or severe SUD). Biological (including genetics and developmental life stages) and social (including adverse childhood experiences) determinants of health are recognized factors that contribute to vulnerability for or resilience against developing a SUD. Consequently, prevention strategies that target social risk factors can improve outcomes and, when deployed in childhood and adolescence, can decrease the risk for these disorders. SUDs are treatable, and evidence of clinically significant benefit exists for medications (in opioid, nicotine and alcohol use disorders), behavioral therapies (in all SUDs), and neuromodulation (in nicotine use disorder). Treatment of SUDs should be considered within the context of a Chronic Care Model, with the intensity of intervention adjusted to the severity of the disorder and with the concomitant treatment of comorbid psychiatric and physical conditions. Involvement of health care providers in detection and management of SUDs, including referral of severe cases to specialized care, offers sustainable models of care that can be further expanded with the use of telehealth. Despite advances in our understanding and management of SUDs, individuals with these conditions continue to be stigmatized and, in some countries, incarcerated, highlighting the need to dismantle policies that perpetuate their criminalization and instead develop policies to ensure support and access to prevention and treatment.© 2023 World Psychiatric Association."
"37165057","Identification of a genomic DNA sequence that quantitatively modulates KLF1 transcription factor expression in differentiating human hematopoietic cells.","Sci Rep","The onset of erythropoiesis is under strict developmental control, with direct and indirect inputs influencing its derivation from the hematopoietic stem cell. A major regulator of this transition is KLF1/EKLF, a zinc finger transcription factor that plays a global role in all aspects of erythropoiesis. Here, we have identified a short, conserved enhancer element in KLF1 intron 1 that is important for establishing optimal levels of KLF1 in mouse and human cells. Chromatin accessibility of this site exhibits cell-type specificity and is under developmental control during the differentiation of human CD34+ cells towards the erythroid lineage. This site binds GATA1, SMAD1, TAL1, and ETV6. In vivo editing of this region in cell lines and primary cells reduces KLF1 expression quantitatively. However, we find that, similar to observations seen in pedigrees of families with KLF1 mutations, downstream effects are variable, suggesting that the global architecture of the site is buffered towards keeping the KLF1 genetic region in an active state. We propose that modification of intron 1 in both alleles is not equivalent to complete loss of function of one allele.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Emerging evidence supports the benefits of dietary interventions in PD due to their safety and practicality. Previously, dietary intake of α-ketoglutarate (AKG) was proved to extend the lifespan of various species and protect mice from frailty. However, the mechanism of dietary AKG's effects in PD remains undetermined. In the present study, we report that an AKG-based diet significantly ameliorated α-synuclein pathology, and rescued DA neuron degeneration and impaired DA synapses in adeno-associated virus (AAV)-loaded human α-synuclein mice and transgenic A53T α-synuclein (A53T α-Syn) mice. Moreover, AKG diet increased nigral docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) levels and DHA supplementation reproduced the anti-α-synuclein effects in the PD mouse model. Our study reveals that AKG and DHA induced microglia to phagocytose and degrade α-synuclein via promoting C1q and suppressed pro-inflammatory reactions. Furthermore, results indicate that modulating gut polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolism and microbiota Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group in the gut-brain axis may underlie AKG's benefits in treating α-synucleinopathy in mice. Together, our findings propose that dietary intake of AKG is a feasible and promising therapeutic approach for PD.© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

In recent years, the development of new high-throughput experimental and computational techniques has been a key driving force in discovering the properties of RNA modifications. Machine learning applications, such as for classification, clustering or de novo identification, have been critical in these advances. Nonetheless, various challenges remain before the full potential of machine learning for epitranscriptomics can be leveraged. In this review, we provide a comprehensive survey of machine learning methods to detect RNA modifications using diverse input data sources. We describe strategies to train and test machine learning methods and to encode and interpret features that are relevant for epitranscriptomics. Finally, we identify some of the current challenges and open questions about RNA modification analysis, including the ambiguity in predicting RNA modifications in transcript isoforms or in single nucleotides, or the lack of complete ground truth sets to test RNA modifications. We believe this review will inspire and benefit the rapidly developing field of epitranscriptomics in addressing the current limitations through the effective use of machine learning.© The Author(s) 2023.

Homocitrulline, isoleucine and 2-aminoadipic acid, eight triacylglycerol species, and lowered sphingomyelin 42:2;2 levels are predictive of faster progression towards insulin requirement. Of ~1,300 proteins examined in two cohorts, levels of GDF15/MIC-1, IL-18Ra, CRELD1, NogoR, FAS, and ENPP7 are associated with faster progression, whilst SMAC/DIABLO, SPOCK1 and HEMK2 predict lower progression rates. In an external replication, proteins and lipids are associated with diabetes incidence and prevalence. NogoR/RTN4R injection improved glucose tolerance in high fat-fed male mice but impaired it in male db/db mice. High NogoR levels led to islet cell apoptosis, and IL-18R antagonised inflammatory IL-18 signalling towards nuclear factor kappa-B in vitro. This comprehensive, multi-disciplinary approach thus identifies biomarkers with potential prognostic utility, provides evidence for possible disease mechanisms, and identifies potential therapeutic avenues to slow diabetes progression.© 2023.

This study aimed to explore the effect of CNP on CVD risk using the Mendelian randomization (MR) framework.Instrumental variables mimicking the effects of pharmacological intervention on CNP were identified as uncorrelated genetic variants located in the genes coding for its primary receptors, natriuretic peptide receptors-2 and 3 (NPR2 and NPR3), that associated with height. We performed MR and colocalization analyses to investigate the effects of NPR2 signalling and NPR3 function on CVD outcomes and risk factors. MR estimates were compared to those obtained when considering height variants from throughout the genome.Genetically-proxied reduced NPR3 function was associated with a lower risk of CVD, with odds ratio (OR) 0.74 per standard deviation (SD) higher NPR3-predicted height, and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.64-0.86. This effect was greater in magnitude than observed when considering height variants from throughout the genome. For CVD subtypes, similar MR associations for NPR3-predicted height were observed when considering the outcomes of coronary artery disease (0.75, 95% CI 0.60-0.92), stroke (0.69, 95% CI 0.50-0.95) and heart failure (0.77, 95% CI 0.58-1.02). Consideration of CVD risk factors identified systolic blood pressure (SBP) as a potential mediator of the NPR3-related CVD risk lowering. For stroke, we found that the MR estimate for NPR3 was greater in magnitude than could be explained by a genetically predicted SBP effect alone. Colocalization results largely supported the MR findings, with no evidence of results being driven by effects due to variants in linkage disequilibrium. There was no MR evidence supporting effects of NPR2 on CVD risk, although this null finding could be attributable to fewer genetic variants being identified to instrument this target.This genetic analysis supports the cardioprotective effects of pharmacologically inhibiting NPR3 receptor function, which is only partly mediated by an effect on blood pressure. There was unlikely sufficient statistical power to investigate the cardioprotective effects of NPR2 signalling.© 2023. The Author(s)."

While trials targeting IL-6 signaling are underway, any benefits must be balanced against an impaired host immune response. Dissecting the mechanisms that mediate the effects of IL-6 signaling on atherosclerosis could offer insights about novel drug targets with more specific effects.Leveraging data from 522,681 individuals, we constructed a genetic instrument of 26 variants in the gene encoding the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) that proxied for pharmacological IL-6R inhibition. Using Mendelian randomization (MR), we assessed its effects on 3,281 plasma proteins quantified with an aptamer-based assay in the INTERVAL cohort (n=3,301). Using mediation MR, we explored proteomic mediators of the effects of genetically proxied IL-6 signaling on coronary artery disease (CAD), large artery atherosclerotic stroke (LAAS), and peripheral artery disease (PAD). For significant mediators, we tested associations of their circulating levels with incident cardiovascular events in a population-based study (n=1,704) and explored the histological, transcriptomic, and cellular phenotypes correlated with their expression levels in samples from human atherosclerotic lesions.We found significant effects of genetically proxied IL-6 signaling on 70 circulating proteins involved in cytokine production/regulation and immune cell recruitment/differentiation, which correlated with the proteomic effects of pharmacological IL-6R inhibition in a clinical trial. Among the 70 significant proteins, genetically proxied circulating levels of CXCL10 were associated with risk of CAD, LAAS, and PAD with up to 67% of the effects of genetically downregulated IL-6 signaling on these endpoints mediated by decreases in CXCL10. Higher midlife circulating CXCL10 levels were associated with a larger number of cardiovascular events over 20 years, whereas higherCXCL10expression in human atherosclerotic lesions correlated with a larger lipid core and a transcriptomic profile reflecting immune cell infiltration, adaptive immune system activation, and cytokine signaling.Integrating multiomics data, we found a proteomic signature of IL-6 signaling activation and mediators of its effects on cardiovascular disease. Our analyses suggest the interferon-γ-inducible chemokine CXCL10 to be a potentially causal mediator for atherosclerosis in three vascular compartments and as such could serve as a promising drug target for atheroprotection."

Several studies have provided new evidence about the role of oral diseases, specifically periodontitis, in generating risk for various forms of cancers, including lung, colorectal, and pancreatic cancers.Incident lung cancer cases (n = 192) and matched controls (n = 192) were selected from participants of the CLUE I and CLUE II cohorts. Archived serum samples collected from participants in 1974 (in CLUE I) were analyzed using immunoblotting for immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody levels to 13 bacteria of the periodontium. Associations between antibody levels and lung cancer were estimated using conditional logistic regression.Most of the periodontal bacterial antibodies measured were inversely associated with lung cancer risk; of these, 3 were statistically significant (Prevotellaintermedia, Actinomyces naeslundii, and Veillonella parvula). A statistically significant positive association was observed for one of the Porphyromonas gingivalis strains after adjusting for P. intermedia. The sum of the logarithm of antibodies against the 13 measured bacteria was inversely associated with risk of lung cancer when the analysis was restricted to a longer follow-up (31-44 years after blood collection, highest vs lowest quartile: odds ratio = 0.26, 95% confidence interval = 0.08 to 0.84).Findings from this study highlight the complexity of using serum IgG antibodies to periodontal bacteria to identify associations between oral pathogens and risk of lung cancer. The inverse associations observed for antibodies to periodontal bacteria suggest that these may represent markers of immunity that provide some advantage in reducing the development of lung cancer.© The Author(s) 2023.

"37043983","Vitamin D: A master example of nutrigenomics.","Redox Biol","Nutrigenomics attempts to characterize and integrate the relation between dietary molecules and gene expression on a genome-wide level. One of the biologically active nutritional compounds is vitamin D3, which activates via its metabolite 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3(1,25(OH)2D3) the nuclear receptor VDR (vitamin D receptor). Vitamin D3can be synthesized endogenously in our skin, but since we spend long times indoors and often live at higher latitudes where for many winter months UV-B radiation is too low, it became a true vitamin. The ligand-inducible transcription factor VDR is expressed in the majority of human tissues and cell types, where it modulates the epigenome at thousands of genomic sites. In a tissue-specific fashion this results in the up- and downregulation of primary vitamin D target genes, some of which are involved in attenuating oxidative stress. Vitamin D affects a wide range of physiological functions including the control of metabolism, bone formation and immunity. In this review, we will discuss how the epigenome- and transcriptome-wide effects of 1,25(OH)2D3and its receptor VDR serve as a master example in nutrigenomics. In this context, we will outline the basis of a mechanistic understanding for personalized nutrition with vitamin D3.Copyright © 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

We estimated the effect of human milk (HM) and direct breastfeeding (BF) on outcomes including necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), infection-related complications, length of stay (LOS), and mortality.We analyzed the National Pediatric Cardiology Quality Improvement Collaborative registry (2016-2021), examining HM/BF groups during stage 1 (S1P) and stage 2 (S2P) palliations. We calculated propensity scores for feeding exposures, then fitted Poisson and logistic regression models to compare outcomes between propensity-matched cohorts.Participants included 2491 infants (68 sites). Estimates for all outcomes were better in HM/BF groups. Infants fed exclusive HM before S1P had lower odds of preoperative NEC (OR=0.37, 95% CI=0.17-0.84, p=0.017) and shorter S1P LOS (RR=0.87, 0.78-0.98, p=0.027). During the S1P hospitalization, infants with high HM had lower odds of postoperative NEC (OR=0.28, 0.15-0.50, p<0.001) and sepsis (0.29, 0.13-0.65, p=0.003), and shorter S1P LOS (RR=0.75, 0.66-0.86, p<0.001). At S2P, infants with any HM (0.82, 0.69-0.97, p=0.018) and any BF (0.71, 0.57-0.89, p=0.003) experienced shorter LOS.Infants with SV CHD in high HM and BF groups experienced multiple significantly better outcomes. Given our findings of improved health, strategies to increase the rates of HM/BF in these patients should be implemented. Future research should replicate these findings with granular feeding data and in broader CHD populations, and should examine mechanisms (eg, HM components; microbiome) by which HM/BF benefits these infants.What is new?:This is the first large, multisite study examining the impact of human milk and breastfeeding on outcomes for infants with single ventricle congenital heart disease.All outcome estimates were better in high human milk and breastfeeding groups, with significantly lower odds of necrotizing enterocolitis, sepsis, and infection-related complications; and significantly shorter length of stay at both the neonatal stage 1 palliation and the subsequent stage 2 palliation.All estimates of all-cause mortality were substantially lower in human milk and breastfeeding groups, with clinically important estimates of 75%-100% lower odds of mortality in direct breastfeeding groups.What are the clinical implications?:There is a critical need for improved, condition-specific lactation support to address the low prevalence of human milk and breastfeeding for infants with single ventricle congenital heart disease.Increasing the dose and duration of human milk and direct breastfeeding has strong potential to substantially improve the health outcomes of these vulnerable infants."

Based on our previous report disproving the conventional plasma isolation used for cirDNA analysis, this work enables a direct topological comparison of the circulating structures associated with nuclear DNA and mitochondrial cell-free DNA.Materials and methods:We used a Q-PCR and low-pass whole genome sequencing (LP-WGS) combination approach of cir-nDNA and cir-mtDNA, extracted using a procedure that eliminates platelet activation during the plasma isolation process to prevent mitochondria release in the extracellular milieu. Various physical procedures, such as filtration and differential centrifugation, were employed to infer their circulating structures.Results:DSP-S cir-mtDNA mean size profiles distributed on a slightly shorter range than SSP-S. SSP-S detected 40-fold more low-sized cir-mtDNA fragments (<90 bp/nt) and three-fold less long-sized fragments (>200 bp/nt) than DSP-S. The ratio of the fragment number below 90 bp over the fragment number above 200 bp was very homogenous among both DSP-S and SSP-S profiles, being 134-fold lower with DSP-S than with SSP-S. Cir-mtDNA and cir-nDNA DSP-S and SSP-S mean size profiles of healthy individuals ranged in different intervals with periodic sub-peaks only detectable with cir-nDNA. The very low amount of cir-mtDNA fragments of short size observed suggested that most of the cir-mtDNA is poorly fragmented and appearing longer than ∼1,000 bp, the readout limit of this LP-WGS method. Data suggested that cir-nDNA is, among DNA extracted in plasma, associated with ∼8.6% of large structures (apoptotic bodies, large extracellular vesicles (EVs), cell debris…), ∼27.7% in chromatin and small EVs and ∼63.7% mainly in oligo- and mono-nucleosomes. By contrast, cir-mtDNA appeared to be preponderantly (75.7%) associated with extracellular mitochondria, either in its free form or with large EVs; to a lesser extent, it was also associated with other structures: small EVs (∼18.4%), and exosomes or protein complexes (∼5.9%).Conclusion:This is the first study to directly compare the structural features of cir-nDNA and cir-mtDNA. The significant differences revealed between both are due to the DNA topological structure contained in the nucleus (chromatin) and in the mitochondria (plasmid) that determine their biological stability in blood. Although cir-nDNA and cir-mtDNA are principally associated with mono-nucleosomes and cell-free mitochondria, our study highlights the diversity of the circulating structures associated with cell-free DNA. They consequently have different pharmacokinetics as well as physiological functions. Thus, any accurate evaluation of their biological or diagnostic individual properties must relies on appropriate pre-analytics, and optimally on the isolation or enrichment of one category of their cirDNA associated structures.Copyright © 2023 Pisareva, Roch, Sanchez, Pastor, Mirandola, Diab-Assaf, Mazard, Prévostel, Al Amir Dache and Thierry."

However, nullipara lack a relevant history and are at higher risk for spontaneous (s)PTB ≤ 32 weeks compared to multipara. No available objective first-trimester screening test has proven a fair predictor of sPTB ≤ 32 weeks. We questioned whether a panel of maternal plasma cell-free (PCF) RNAs (PSME2,NAMPT,APOA1,APOA4, andHsa-Let-7g) previously validated at 16-20 weeks for the prediction of sPTB ≤ 32 weeks might be useful in first-trimester nullipara. Sixty (60) nulliparous women (40 with sPTB ≤ 32 weeks) who were free of comorbidities were randomly selected from the King's College Fetal Medicine Research Institute biobank. Total PCF RNA was extracted and the expression of panel RNAs was quantitated by qRT-PCR. The analysis employed, primarily, multiple regression with the main outcome being the prediction of subsequent sPTB ≤ 32 weeks. The test performance was judged by the area under the curve (AUC) using a single threshold cut point with observed detection rates (DRs) at three fixed false positive rates (FPR). The mean gestation was 12.9 ± 0.5 weeks (range 12.0-14.1 weeks). Two RNAs were differentially expressed in women destined for sPTB ≤ 32 weeks:APOA1(p< 0.001) andPSME2(p= 0.05).APOA1testing at 11-14 weeks predicted sPTB ≤ 32 weeks with fair to good accuracy. The best predictive model generated an AUC of 0.79 (95% CI 0.66-0.91) with observed DRs of 41%, 61%, and 79% for FPRs of 10%, 20%, and 30%, including crown-rump length, maternal weight, race, tobacco use, and age."
"37190033","On the Role of Glycolysis in Early Tumorigenesis-Permissive and Executioner Effects.","Cells","Reprogramming energy production from mitochondrial respiration to glycolysis is now considered a hallmark of cancer. When tumors grow beyond a certain size they give rise to changes in their microenvironment (e.g., hypoxia, mechanical stress) that are conducive to the upregulation of glycolysis. Over the years, however, it has become clear that glycolysis can also associate with the earliest steps of tumorigenesis. Thus, many of the oncoproteins most commonly involved in tumor initiation and progression upregulate glycolysis. Moreover, in recent years, considerable evidence has been reported suggesting that upregulated glycolysis itself, through its enzymes and/or metabolites, may play a causative role in tumorigenesis, either by acting itself as an oncogenic stimulus or by facilitating the appearance of oncogenic mutations. In fact, several changes induced by upregulated glycolysis have been shown to be involved in tumor initiation and early tumorigenesis: glycolysis-induced chromatin remodeling, inhibition of premature senescence and induction of proliferation, effects on DNA repair,O-linkedN-acetylglucosamine modification of target proteins, antiapoptotic effects, induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition or autophagy, and induction of angiogenesis. In this article we summarize the evidence that upregulated glycolysis is involved in tumor initiation and, in the following, we propose a mechanistic model aimed at explaining how upregulated glycolysis may play such a role."

Discovering the molecular mechanisms associated with cardiac aging is expected to provide new perspectives for delaying aging and related disease treatment.The samples in GEO database were divided into older group and younger group based on age. Age-associated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by limma package. Gene modules significantly associated with age were mined using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Protein-protein interaction networks (PPI) networks were developed using genes within modules, and topological analysis on the networks was performed to identify hub genes in cardiac aging. Pearson correlation was used to analyze the association among hub genes and immune and immune-related pathways. Molecular docking of hub genes and the anti-aging drug Sirolimus was performed to explore the potential role of hub genes in treating cardiac aging.We found a generally negative correlation between age and immunity, with a significant negative correlation between age and b_cell_receptor_signaling_pathway, fc_gamma_r_mediated_phagocytosis, chemokine signaling pathway, t-cell receptor signaling pathway, toll_like_receptor_signaling_pathway, and jak_stat_signaling_pathway, respectively. Finally, 10 cardiac aging-related hub genes including LCP2, PTPRC, RAC2, CD48, CD68, CCR2, CCL2, IL10, CCL5 and IGF1 were identified. 10-hub genes were closely associated with age and immune-related pathways. There was a strong binding interaction between Sirolimus-CCR2. CCR2 may be a key target for Sirolimus in the treatment of cardiac aging.The 10 hub genes may be potential therapeutic targets for cardiac aging, and our study provided new ideas for the treatment of cardiac aging.© 2023 Ping, Guan, Ning, Liu, Zhao, Zhu, Yang and Fu."

Among others, epigenetics has appeared as an attractive area of investigation by the cardiovascular research community, notably considering its association with disease development. Complex diseases such as cardiovascular diseases have to be tackled using methods integrating different omics levels, so called ""multi-omics"" approaches. These approaches combine and co-analyze different levels of disease regulation. In this review, we present and discuss the role of epigenetic mechanisms in regulating gene expression and provide an integrated view of how these mechanisms are interlinked and regulate the development of cardiac disease, with a particular attention to heart failure. We focus on DNA, histone, and RNA modifications, and discuss the current methods and tools used for data integration and analysis. Enhancing the knowledge of these regulatory mechanisms may lead to novel therapeutic approaches and biomarkers for precision healthcare and improved clinical outcomes.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Epigenetic alterations, especially DNA methylation, play important roles in bladder cancer development and are increasingly being investigated as biomarkers for diagnostic or prognostic predictions. However, little is known about hydroxymethylation since previous studies based on bisulfite-sequencing approaches could not differentiate between 5mC and 5hmC signals, resulting in entangled methylation results.Tissue samples of bladder cancer patients who underwent laparoscopic radical cystectomy (LRC), partial cystectomy (PC), or transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) were collected. We utilized a multi-omics approach to analyze both primary and recurrent bladder cancer samples. By integrating various techniques including RNA sequencing, oxidative reduced-representation bisulfite sequencing (oxRRBS), reduced-representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS), and whole exome sequencing, a comprehensive analysis of the genome, transcriptome, methylome, and hydroxymethylome landscape of these cancers was possible.By whole exome sequencing, we identified driver mutations involved in the development of UBC, including those in FGFR3, KDMTA, and KDMT2C. However, few of these driver mutations were associated with the down-regulation of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) or recurrence in UBC. By integrating RRBS and oxRRBS data, we identified fatty acid oxidation-related genes significantly enriched in 5hmC-associated transcription alterations in recurrent bladder cancers. We also observed a series of 5mC hypo differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in the gene body of NFATC1, which is highly involved in T-cell immune responses in bladder cancer samples with high expression of PD-L1. Since 5mC and 5hmC alternations are globally anti-correlated, RRBS-seq-based markers that combine the 5mC and 5hmC signals, attenuate cancer-related signals, and therefore, are not optimal as clinical biomarkers.By multi-omics profiling of UBC samples, we showed that epigenetic alternations are more involved compared to genetic mutations in the PD-L1 regulation and recurrence of UBC. As proof of principle, we demonstrated that the combined measurement of 5mC and 5hmC levels by the bisulfite-based method compromises the prediction accuracy of epigenetic biomarkers.© 2023.

Our study thus aimed to molecularly characterize colorectal cancer liver metastases (CRCLMs) and explore whether molecular profiles differ between Synchronous (SmCRC) and Metachronous (MmCRC) colorectal cancer. This characterization was performed by whole exome sequencing, whole transcriptome, whole methylome, and miRNAome. The most frequent somatic mutations were inAPC, SYNE1, TP53, andTTNgenes. Among the differently methylated and expressed genes were those involved in cell adhesion, extracellular matrix organization and degradation, neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction. The top up-regulated microRNAs were hsa-miR-135b-3p and -5p, and the hsa-miR-200-family while the hsa-miR-548-family belonged to the top down-regulated. MmCRC patients evinced higher tumor mutational burden, a wider median of duplications and deletions, and a heterogeneous mutational signature than SmCRC. Regarding chronicity, a significant down-regulation ofSMOC2andPPP1R9Agenes in SmCRC compared to MmCRC was observed. Two miRNAs were deregulated between SmCRC and MmCRC, hsa-miR-625-3p and has-miR-1269-3p. The combined data identified the IPO5 gene. Regardless of miRNA expression levels, the combined analysis resulted in 107 deregulated genes related to relaxin, estrogen, PI3K-Akt, WNT signaling pathways, and intracellular second messenger signaling. The intersection between our and validation sets confirmed the validity of our results. We have identified genes and pathways that may be considered as actionable targets in CRCLMs. Our data also provide a valuable resource for understanding molecular distinctions between SmCRC and MmCRC. They have the potential to enhance the diagnosis, prognostication, and management of CRCLMs by a molecularly targeted approach.Copyright © 2023 Horak, Kubecek, Siskova, Honkova, Chvojkova, Krupova, Manethova, Vodenkova, García-Mulero, John, Cecka, Vodickova, Petera, Filip and Vymetalkova."
"37159669","Systematic comparison of multi-omics survival models reveals a widespread lack of noise resistance.","Cell Rep Methods","As observed in several previous studies, integrating more molecular modalities in multi-omics cancer survival models may not always improve model accuracy. In this study, we compared eight deep learning and four statistical integration techniques for survival prediction on 17 multi-omics datasets, examining model performance in terms of overall accuracy and noise resistance. We found that one deep learning method, mean late fusion, and two statistical methods,PriorityLassoandBlockForest, performed best in terms of both noise resistance and overall discriminative and calibration performance. Nevertheless, all methods struggled to adequately handle noise when too many modalities were added. In summary, we confirmed that current multi-omics survival methods are not sufficiently noise resistant. We recommend relying on only modalities for which there is known predictive value for a particular cancer type until models that have stronger noise-resistance properties are developed.© 2023 The Author(s)."

Urine proteomic biomarkers which are creatinine, LYVE1, REG1B, and TFF1 present a promising non-invasive and inexpensive diagnostic method of the PDAC. Recent utilization of both microfluidics technology and artificial intelligence techniques enables accurate detection and analysis of these biomarkers. This paper proposes a new deep-learning model to identify urine biomarkers for the automated diagnosis of pancreatic cancers. The proposed model is composed of one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (1D-CNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM). It can categorize patients into healthy pancreas, benign hepatobiliary disease, and PDAC cases automatically.Experiments and evaluations have been successfully done on a public dataset of 590 urine samples of three classes, which are 183 healthy pancreas samples, 208 benign hepatobiliary disease samples, and 199 PDAC samples. The results demonstrated that our proposed 1-D CNN + LSTM model achieved the best accuracy score of 97% and the area under curve (AUC) of 98% versus the state-of-the-art models to diagnose pancreatic cancers using urine biomarkers.A new efficient 1D CNN-LSTM model has been successfully developed for early PDAC diagnosis using four proteomic urine biomarkers of creatinine, LYVE1, REG1B, and TFF1. This developed model showed superior performance on other machine learning classifiers in previous studies. The main prospect of this study is the laboratory realization of our proposed deep classifier on urinary biomarker panels for assisting diagnostic procedures of pancreatic cancer patients.© 2023.

"37158973","Comprehensive de novo mutation discovery with HiFi long-read sequencing.","Genome Med","Long-read sequencing (LRS) techniques have been very successful in identifying structural variants (SVs). However, the high error rate of LRS made the detection of small variants (substitutions and short indels < 20 bp) more challenging. The introduction of PacBio HiFi sequencing makes LRS also suited for detecting small variation. Here we evaluate the ability of HiFi reads to detect de novo mutations (DNMs) of all types, which are technically challenging variant types and a major cause of sporadic, severe, early-onset disease.We sequenced the genomes of eight parent-child trios using high coverage PacBio HiFi LRS (~ 30-fold coverage) and Illumina short-read sequencing (SRS) (~ 50-fold coverage). De novo substitutions, small indels, short tandem repeats (STRs) and SVs were called in both datasets and compared to each other to assess the accuracy of HiFi LRS. In addition, we determined the parent-of-origin of the small DNMs using phasing.We identified a total of 672 and 859 de novo substitutions/indels, 28 and 126 de novo STRs, and 24 and 1 de novo SVs in LRS and SRS respectively. For the small variants, there was a 92 and 85% concordance between the platforms. For the STRs and SVs, the concordance was 3.6 and 0.8%, and 4 and 100% respectively. We successfully validated 27/54 LRS-unique small variants, of which 11 (41%) were confirmed as true de novo events. For the SRS-unique small variants, we validated 42/133 DNMs and 8 (19%) were confirmed as true de novo event. Validation of 18 LRS-unique de novo STR calls confirmed none of the repeat expansions as true DNM. Confirmation of the 23 LRS-unique SVs was possible for 19 candidate SVs of which 10 (52.6%) were true de novo events. Furthermore, we were able to assign 96% of DNMs to their parental allele with LRS data, as opposed to just 20% with SRS data.HiFi LRS can now produce the most comprehensive variant dataset obtainable by a single technology in a single laboratory, allowing accurate calling of substitutions, indels, STRs and SVs. The accuracy even allows sensitive calling of DNMs on all variant levels, and also allows for phasing, which helps to distinguish true positive from false positive DNMs.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Current studies on CD8+T cell exhaustion have found that the mechanisms responsible for their heterogeneity and differential kinetics may be closely related to transcription factors and epigenetic regulation, which may serve as biomarkers and potential immunotherapeutic targets to guide treatment. Although the importance of T cell exhaustion in tumor immunotherapy cannot be overstated, studies have pointed out that gastric cancer tissues have a better anti-tumor T cell composition compared to other cancer tissues, which may indicate that gastrointestinal cancers have more promising prospects for the development of precision-targeted immunotherapy. Therefore, the present study will focus on the mechanisms involved in the development of CD8+T cell exhaustion, and then review the landscapes and mechanisms of T cell exhaustion in gastrointestinal cancer as well as clinical applications, which will provide a clear vision for the development of future immunotherapies.Copyright © 2023 Ding, Yang, Zhou, Huang, Li and Zong."

In some mouse strains, catalepsy can be induced by pinching the skin at the scruff of the neck. The main locus of hereditary catalepsy in mice has recently been linked to the 105-115 Mb fragment of mouse chromosome 13 by QTL analysis. We performed whole-genome sequencing of catalepsy-resistant and catalepsy-prone mouse strains in order to pinpoint the putative candidate genes related to hereditary catalepsy in mice. We remapped the previously described main locus for hereditary catalepsy in mice to the chromosome region 103.92-106.16 Mb. A homologous human region on chromosome 5 includes genetic and epigenetic variants associated with schizophrenia. Furthermore, we identified a missense variant in catalepsy-prone strains within the Nln gene. Nln encodes neurolysin, which degrades neurotensin, a peptide reported to induce catalepsy in mice. Our data suggest that Nln is the most probable candidate for the role of major gene of hereditary, pinch-induced catalepsy in mice and point to a shared molecular pathway between catalepsy in mice and human neuropsychiatric disorders.Copyright ® 2023 National Research University Higher School of Economics."
"37179335","Immunosenescence: molecular mechanisms and diseases.","Signal Transduct Target Ther","Infection susceptibility, poor vaccination efficacy, age-related disease onset, and neoplasms are linked to innate and adaptive immune dysfunction that accompanies aging (known as immunosenescence). During aging, organisms tend to develop a characteristic inflammatory state that expresses high levels of pro-inflammatory markers, termed inflammaging. This chronic inflammation is a typical phenomenon linked to immunosenescence and it is considered the major risk factor for age-related diseases. Thymic involution, naïve/memory cell ratio imbalance, dysregulated metabolism, and epigenetic alterations are striking features of immunosenescence. Disturbed T-cell pools and chronic antigen stimulation mediate premature senescence of immune cells, and senescent immune cells develop a proinflammatory senescence-associated secretory phenotype that exacerbates inflammaging. Although the underlying molecular mechanisms remain to be addressed, it is well documented that senescent T cells and inflammaging might be major driving forces in immunosenescence. Potential counteractive measures will be discussed, including intervention of cellular senescence and metabolic-epigenetic axes to mitigate immunosenescence. In recent years, immunosenescence has attracted increasing attention for its role in tumor development. As a result of the limited participation of elderly patients, the impact of immunosenescence on cancer immunotherapy is unclear. Despite some surprising results from clinical trials and drugs, it is necessary to investigate the role of immunosenescence in cancer and other age-related diseases.© 2023. The Author(s)."

To better comprehend its complex etiology, we use an integrative approach to build robust predictive (causal) network models using two large human multi-omics datasets. We delineate bulk-tissue gene expression into single cell-type gene expression and integrate clinical and pathologic traits, single nucleotide variation, and deconvoluted gene expression for the construction of cell type-specific predictive network models. Here, we focus on neuron-specific network models and prioritize 19 predicted key drivers modulating Alzheimer's pathology, which we then validate by knockdown in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons. We find that neuronal knockdown of 10 of the 19 targets significantly modulates levels of amyloid-beta and/or phosphorylated tau peptides, most notably JMJD6. We also confirm our network structure by RNA sequencing in the neurons following knockdown of each of the 10 targets, which additionally predicts that they are upstream regulators of REST and VGF. Our work thus identifies robust neuronal key drivers of the Alzheimer's-associated network state which may represent therapeutic targets with relevance to both amyloid and tau pathology in Alzheimer's disease.© 2023.

Cellular senescence (CS) is a stress response that accompanies permanent cell-cycle arrest, which has been reported to be a fundamental pathological mechanism of many age-related diseases. This study aims to explore biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets in MCI based on CS.The mRNA expression profiles of peripheral blood samples from patients in MCI and non-MCI group were download from gene expression omnibus (GEO) database (GSE63060 for training and GSE18309 for external validation), CS-related genes were obtained from CellAge database. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was conducted to discover the key relationships behind the co-expression modules. The differentially expressed CS-related genes would be obtained through overlapping among the above datasets. Then, pathway and GO enrichment analyses were performed to further elucidate the mechanism of MCI. The protein-protein interaction network was used to extract hub genes and the logistic regression was performed to distinguish the MCI patients from controls. The hub gene-drug network, hub gene-miRNA network as well as transcription factor-gene regulatory network were used to analyze potential therapeutic targets for MCI.Eight CS-related genes were identified as key gene signatures in MCI group, which were mainly enriched in the regulation of response to DNA damage stimulus, Sin3 complex and transcription corepressor activity. The receiver operating characteristic curves of logistic regression diagnostic model were constructed and presented great diagnostic value in both training and validation set.Eight CS-related hub genes - SMARCA4, GAPDH, SMARCB1, RUNX1, SRC, TRIM28, TXN, and PRPF19 - serve as candidate biomarkers for MCI and display the excellent diagnostic value. Furthermore, we also provide a theoretical basis for targeted therapy against MCI through the above hub genes.Copyright © 2023 Ma, Xia, Wang and Wang."
"37176144","Functions of Astrocytes under Normal Conditions and after a Brain Disease.","Int J Mol Sci","In the central nervous system (CNS) there are a greater number of glial cells than neurons (between five and ten times more). Furthermore, they have a greater number of functions (more than eight functions). Glia comprises different types of cells, those of neural origin (astrocytes, radial glia, and oligodendroglia) and differentiated blood monocytes (microglia). During ontogeny, neurons develop earlier (at fetal day 15 in the rat) and astrocytes develop later (at fetal day 21 in the rat), which could indicate their important and crucial role in the CNS. Analysis of the phylogeny reveals that reptiles have a lower number of astrocytes compared to neurons and in humans this is reversed, as there have a greater number of astrocytes compared to neurons. These data perhaps imply that astrocytes are important and special cells, involved in many vital functions, including memory, and learning processes. In addition, astrocytes are involved in different mechanisms that protect the CNS through the production of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory proteins and they clean the extracellular environment and help neurons to communicate correctly with each other. The production of inflammatory mediators is important to prevent changes in brain homeostasis. On the contrary, excessive, or continued production appears as a characteristic element in many diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), multiple sclerosis (MS), and in neurodevelopmental diseases, such as bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and autism. Furthermore, different drugs and techniques have been developed to reverse oxidative stress and/or excess of inflammation that occurs in many CNS diseases, but much remains to be investigated. This review attempts to highlight the functional relevance of astrocytes in normal and neuropathological conditions by showing the molecular and cellular mechanisms of their role in the CNS."

Heterogeneity has been found in most tumors representing one of the most challenging behaviors in cancer ecosystems. As one of the critical factors impairing the long-term efficacy of solid tumor therapy, heterogeneity leads to tumor resistance, more aggressive metastasizing, and recurrence.

As DKD features endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and nitric oxide depletion, soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) is a promising DKD drug target. sGC expression is specifically enriched in PT and stroma. In ZSF1 rats, pharmacological sGC activation confers considerable benefits over stimulation and is mechanistically related to improved oxidative stress regulation, resulting in enhanced downstream cGMP effects. Finally, we define sGC gene co-expression modules, which allow stratification of human kidney samples by DKD prevalence and disease-relevant measures such as kidney function, proteinuria, and fibrosis, underscoring the relevance of the sGC pathway to patients.Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).

The proposed framework was applied to the Wellcome Trust Case-Control Consortium (WTCCC), the UK National Blood Service (NBS) Control Group, and the 1958 British Birth Cohort (58C) datasets. The performance comparison of the proposed framework showed that the proposed approach outperformed the other methods in predicting disease risk, achieving an area under the curve (AUC) up to 0.94."
"37190212","Sequence-Based Platforms for Discovering Biomarkers in Liquid Biopsy of Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer.","Cancers (Basel)","Lung cancer detection and monitoring are hampered by a lack of sensitive biomarkers, which results in diagnosis at late stages and difficulty in tracking response to treatment. Recent developments have established liquid biopsies as promising non-invasive methods for detecting biomarkers in lung cancer patients. With concurrent advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies and bioinformatics tools, new approaches for biomarker discovery have emerged. In this article, we survey established and emerging biomarker discovery methods using nucleic acid materials derived from bodily fluids in the context of lung cancer. We introduce nucleic acid biomarkers extracted from liquid biopsies and outline biological sources and methods of isolation. We discuss next-generation sequencing (NGS) platforms commonly used to identify novel biomarkers and describe how these have been applied to liquid biopsy. We highlight emerging biomarker discovery methods, including applications of long-read sequencing, fragmentomics, whole-genome amplification methods for single-cell analysis, and whole-genome methylation assays. Finally, we discuss advanced bioinformatics tools, describing methods for processing NGS data, as well as recently developed software tailored for liquid biopsy biomarker detection, which holds promise for early diagnosis of lung cancer."
"37131664","A DRG genetic toolkit reveals molecular, morphological, and functional diversity of somatosensory neuron subtypes.","bioRxiv","Mechanical and thermal stimuli acting on the skin are detected by morphologically and physiologically distinct sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Achieving a holistic view of how this diverse neuronal population relays sensory information from the skin to the central nervous system (CNS) has been challenging with existing tools. Here, we used transcriptomic datasets of the mouse DRG to guide development and curation of a genetic toolkit to interrogate transcriptionally defined DRG neuron subtypes. Morphological analysis revealed unique cutaneous axon arborization areas and branching patterns of each subtype. Physiological analysis showed that subtypes exhibit distinct thresholds and ranges of responses to mechanical and/or thermal stimuli. The somatosensory neuron toolbox thus enables comprehensive phenotyping of most principal sensory neuron subtypes. Moreover, our findings support a population coding scheme in which the activation thresholds of morphologically and physiologically distinct cutaneous DRG neuron subtypes tile multiple dimensions of stimulus space."
"37180975","Paget's disease: a review of the epidemiology, etiology, genetics, and treatment.","Front Genet","Paget's disease of bone (PDB) is the second most prevalent metabolic bone disorder worldwide, with a prevalence rate of 1.5%-8.3%. It is characterized by localized areas of accelerated, disorganized, and excessive bone production and turnover. Typically, PDB develops in the later stages of life, particularly in the late 50s, and affects men more frequently than women. PDB is a complex disease influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. PDB has a complex genetic basis involving multiple genes, with SQSTM1 being the gene most frequently associated with its development. Mutations affecting the UBA domain of SQSTM1 have been detected in both familial and sporadic PDB cases, and these mutations are often associated with severe clinical expression. Germline mutations in other genes such as TNFRSF11A, ZNF687 and PFN1, have also been associated with the development of the disease. Genetic association studies have also uncovered several PDB predisposing risk genes contributing to the disease pathology and severity. Epigenetic modifications of genes involved in bone remodelling and regulation, including RANKL, OPG, HDAC2, DNMT1, and SQSTM1, have been implicated in the development and progression of Paget's disease of bone, providing insight into the molecular basis of the disease and potential targets for therapeutic intervention. Although PDB has a tendency to cluster within families, the variable severity of the disease across family members, coupled with decreasing incidence rates, indicates that environmental factors may also play a role in the pathophysiology of PDB. The precise nature of these environmental triggers and how they interact with genetic determinants remain poorly understood. Fortunately, majority of PDB patients can achieve long-term remission with an intravenous infusion of aminobisphosphonates, such as zoledronic acid. In this review, we discuss aspects like clinical characteristics, genetic foundation, and latest updates in PDB research.Copyright © 2023 Banaganapalli, Fallatah, Alsubhi, Shetty, Awan, Elango and Shaik."
"37118708","Clinical characteristics of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer after treatment with combined androgen blockade.","BMC Urol","Although the second-generation androgen receptor inhibitors and taxanes have recently been recommended for the initial treatment of metastatic prostate cancer, bicalutamide and flutamide are still used in a large number of cases. Therefore, it is important to elucidate the clinical characteristics of these treated CRPC cases and their sensitivity to the currently used therapeutic agents. We aimed to examine the outcomes of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer following combined androgen blockade as initial therapy at our institution.Ninety-four patients who developed metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer after hormonal treatment with combined nonsteroidal androgen receptor antagonists and continuous androgen deprivation therapy between January 2015 and December 2020 were included. The presence of visceral metastases, duration of efficacy of each treatment, and overall survival after castration-resistant prostate cancer were evaluated.Patients with a longer duration of castration-resistant prostate cancer tended to have a longer response duration to subsequent enzalutamide administration (p = 0.003). Patients who achieved a 90% reduction in prostate-specific antigen levels with enzalutamide had a significantly better castration-resistant prostate cancer prognosis (p = 0.002). Meanwhile, those with visceral metastases at the time of castration-resistant prostate cancer diagnosis had a significantly poorer prognosis (p < 0.001). A positive correlation was observed between the treatment efficacy of abiraterone and taxanes for castration-resistant prostate cancer.The study provides scientific evidence to support that patients with longer time to castration-resistant prostate cancer are more sensitive to enzalutamide, and the use of abiraterone between docetaxel and cabazitaxel has favorable prognostic impact. These findings provide instrumental evidence that can enable better treatment selection for prostate cancer patients.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37146219","Interventions from pregnancy to two years after birth for parents experiencing complex post-traumatic stress disorder and/or with childhood experience of maltreatment.","Cochrane Database Syst Rev","Acceptable, effective and feasible support strategies (interventions) for parents experiencing complex post-traumatic stress disorder (CPTSD) symptoms or with a history of childhood maltreatment may offer an opportunity to support parental recovery, reduce the risk of intergenerational transmission of trauma and improve life-course trajectories for children and future generations. However, evidence relating to the effect of interventions has not been synthesised to provide a comprehensive review of available support strategies. This evidence synthesis is critical to inform further research, practice and policy approaches in this emerging area.To assess the effects of interventions provided to support parents who were experiencing CPTSD symptoms or who had experienced childhood maltreatment (or both), on parenting capacity and parental psychological or socio-emotional wellbeing.In October 2021 we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, six other databases and two trials registers, together with checking references and contacting experts to identify additional studies.All variants of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any intervention delivered in the perinatal period designed to support parents experiencing CPTSD symptoms or with a history of childhood maltreatment (or both), to any active or inactive control. Primary outcomes were parental psychological or socio-emotional wellbeing and parenting capacity between pregnancy and up to two years postpartum.Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility of trials for inclusion, extracted data using a pre-designed data extraction form, and assessed risk of bias and certainty of evidence. We contacted study authors for additional information as required. We analysed continuous data using mean difference (MD) for outcomes using a single measure, and standardised mean difference (SMD) for outcomes using multiple measures, and risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous data. All data are presented with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We undertook meta-analyses using random-effects models.We included evidence from 1925 participants in 15 RCTs that investigated the effect of 17 interventions. All included studies were published after 2005. Interventions included seven parenting interventions, eight psychological interventions and two service system approaches. The studies were funded by major research councils, government departments and philanthropic/charitable organisations. All evidence was of low or very low certainty. Parenting interventions Evidence was very uncertain from a study (33 participants) assessing the effects of a parenting intervention compared to attention control on trauma-related symptoms, and psychological wellbeing symptoms (postpartum depression), in mothers who had experienced childhood maltreatment and were experiencing current parenting risk factors. Evidence suggested that parenting interventions may improve parent-child relationships slightly compared to usual service provision (SMD 0.45, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.96; I2= 60%; 2 studies, 153 participants; low-certainty evidence). There may be little or no difference between parenting interventions and usual perinatal service in parenting skills including nurturance, supportive presence and reciprocity (SMD 0.25, 95% CI -0.07 to 0.58; I2= 0%; 4 studies, 149 participants; low-certainty evidence). No studies assessed the effects of parenting interventions on parents' substance use, relationship quality or self-harm. Psychological interventions Psychological interventions may result in little or no difference in trauma-related symptoms compared to usual care (SMD -0.05, 95% CI -0.40 to 0.31; I2= 39%; 4 studies, 247 participants; low-certainty evidence). Psychological interventions may make little or no difference compared to usual care to depression symptom severity (8 studies, 507 participants, low-certainty evidence, SMD -0.34, 95% CI -0.66 to -0.03; I2= 63%). An interpersonally focused cognitive behavioural analysis system of psychotherapy may slightly increase the number of pregnant women who quit smoking compared to usual smoking cessation therapy and prenatal care (189 participants, low-certainty evidence). A psychological intervention may slightly improve parents' relationship quality compared to usual care (1 study, 67 participants, low-certainty evidence). Benefits for parent-child relationships were very uncertain (26 participants, very low-certainty evidence), while there may be a slight improvement in parenting skills compared to usual care (66 participants, low-certainty evidence). No studies assessed the effects of psychological interventions on parents' self-harm. Service system approaches One service system approach assessed the effect of a financial empowerment education programme, with and without trauma-informed peer support, compared to usual care for parents with low incomes. The interventions increased depression slightly (52 participants, low-certainty evidence). No studies assessed the effects of service system interventions on parents' trauma-related symptoms, substance use, relationship quality, self-harm, parent-child relationships or parenting skills.There is currently a lack of high-quality evidence regarding the effectiveness of interventions to improve parenting capacity or parental psychological or socio-emotional wellbeing in parents experiencing CPTSD symptoms or who have experienced childhood maltreatment (or both). This lack of methodological rigour and high risk of bias made it difficult to interpret the findings of this review. Overall, results suggest that parenting interventions may slightly improve parent-child relationships but have a small, unimportant effect on parenting skills. Psychological interventions may help some women stop smoking in pregnancy, and may have small benefits on parents' relationships and parenting skills. A financial empowerment programme may slightly worsen depression symptoms. While potential beneficial effects were small, the importance of a positive effect in a small number of parents must be considered when making treatment and care decisions. There is a need for further high-quality research into effective strategies for this population.Copyright © 2023 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."
"37189516","Pitfalls in the Diagnosis and Management of Hypercortisolism (Cushing Syndrome) in Humans; A Review of the Laboratory Medicine Perspective.","Diagnostics (Basel)","Biochemical confirmation of a diagnosis of hypercortisolism (Cushing syndrome) is vital to direct further investigations, especially given the overlap with non-autonomous conditions, such as pseudo-Cushing, and the morbidity associated with missed diagnoses. A limited narrative review was performed focusing on the laboratory perspective of the pitfalls of making a biochemical diagnosis of hypercortisolism in those presenting with presumed Cushing syndrome. Although analytically less specific, immunoassays remain cheap, quick, and reliable in most situations. Understanding cortisol metabolism can help with patient preparation, specimen selection (e.g., consideration of urine or saliva for those with possible elevations of cortisol binding globulin concentration), and method selection (e.g., mass spectrometry if there is a high risk of abnormal metabolites). Although more specific methods may be less sensitive, this can be managed. The reduction in cost and increasing ease of use makes techniques such as urine steroid profiles and salivary cortisone of interest in future pathway development. In conclusion, the limitations of current assays, particularly if well understood, do not impede diagnosis in most cases. However, in complex or borderline cases, there are other techniques to consider to aid in the confirmation of hypercortisolism."
"37205123","TLSEA: a tool for lncRNA set enrichment analysis based on multi-source heterogeneous information fusion.","Front Genet","Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play an important regulatory role in gene transcription and post-transcriptional modification, and lncRNA regulatory dysfunction leads to a variety of complex human diseases. Hence, it might be beneficial to detect the underlying biological pathways and functional categories of genes that encode lncRNA. This can be carried out by using gene set enrichment analysis, which is a pervasive bioinformatic technique that has been widely used. However, accurately performing gene set enrichment analysis of lncRNAs remains a challenge. Most conventional enrichment analysis methods have not exhaustively included the rich association information among genes, which usually affects the regulatory functions of genes. Here, we developed a novel tool for lncRNA set enrichment analysis (TLSEA) to improve the accuracy of the gene functional enrichment analysis, which extracted the low-dimensional vectors of lncRNAs in two functional annotation networks with the graph representation learning method. A novel lncRNA-lncRNA association network was constructed by merging lncRNA-related heterogeneous information obtained from multiple sources with the different lncRNA-related similarity networks. In addition, the random walk with restart method was adopted to effectively expand the lncRNAs submitted by users according to the lncRNA-lncRNA association network of TLSEA. In addition, a case study of breast cancer was performed, which demonstrated that TLSEA could detect breast cancer more accurately than conventional tools.

The incidence of POD after intracranial surgery is likely to be higher due to the pre-existing brain pathology and direct handling of the brain during neurosurgery. The primary objective of this study was to assess the incidence of POD after intracranial neurosurgery and our secondary objective was to identify the potential risk factors for its occurrence.This prospective observational study was conducted after the institutional ethics committee approval between october 2020 and march 2021. We included patients of either gender aged ≥ 18 years and undergoing elective intracranial neurosurgery. Exclusion criteria included patients aged below 18 years, undergoing emergency neurosurgery, patients with impaired consciousness and patients with psychiatric comorbidities or those taking psychotropic medications. We planned to exclude patients from analysis who were transferred to intensive care unit (ICU) or if they were not extubated after surgery. Our study outcome was development of POD as assessed by confusion assessment method (CAM).The overall incidence of POD during the three postoperative days was 19.2% (n=60/313). The incidence of POD on days 1, 2, and 3 were 19.2% (n=60/313), 17.2% (n=50/291), and 16.3% (n=39/239). Preoperative delirium and hyperactive Emergence Delirium were found to be the significant predictors of POD.Every one in five patients undergoing intracranial neurosurgery is vulnerable for the development of POD within first three days after surgery.

"37174697","Senescent Cells: A Therapeutic Target in Cardiovascular Diseases.","Cells","Senescent cell accumulation has been observed in age-associated diseases including cardiovascular diseases. Senescent cells lack proliferative capacity and secrete senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) factors that may cause or worsen many cardiovascular diseases. Therapies targeting senescent cells, especially senolytic drugs that selectively induce senescent cell removal, have been shown to delay, prevent, alleviate, or treat multiple age-associated diseases in preclinical models. Some senolytic clinical trials have already been completed or are underway for a number of diseases and geriatric syndromes. Understanding how cellular senescence affects the various cell types in the cardiovascular system, such as endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, immune cells, progenitor cells, and cardiomyocytes, is important to facilitate translation of senotherapeutics into clinical interventions. This review highlights: (1) the characteristics of senescent cells and their involvement in cardiovascular diseases, focusing on the aforementioned cardiovascular cell types, (2) evidence about senolytic drugs and other senotherapeutics, and (3) the future path and clinical potential of senotherapeutics for cardiovascular diseases."

Studies suggest that periodontitis, like other CVD risk factors, shows the persistence of increased CVD risk even after mitigation. We hypothesized that periodontitis induces epigenetic changes in hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow (BM), and such changes persist after the clinical elimination of the disease and underlie the increased CVD risk. We used a BM transplant approach to simulate the clinical elimination of periodontitis and the persistence of the hypothesized epigenetic reprogramming. Using the low-density lipoprotein receptor knockout (LDLRo) atherosclerosis mouse model, BM donor mice were fed a high-fat diet to induce atherosclerosis and orally inoculated withPorphyromonas gingivalis(Pg), a keystone periodontal pathogen; the second group was sham-inoculated. NaïveLDLRomice were irradiated and transplanted with BM from one of the two donor groups. Recipients of BM fromPg-inoculated donors developed significantly more atherosclerosis, accompanied by cytokine/chemokines that suggested BM progenitor cell mobilization and were associated with atherosclerosis and/or PD. Using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, 375 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and global hypomethylation in recipients of BM fromPg-inoculated donors were observed. Some DMRs pointed to the involvement of enzymes with major roles in DNA methylation and demethylation. In validation assays, we found a significant increase in the activity of ten-eleven translocase-2 and a decrease in the activity of DNA methyltransferases. Plasma S-adenosylhomocysteine levels were significantly higher, and the S-adenosylmethionine to S-adenosylhomocysteine ratio was decreased, both of which have been associated with CVD. These changes may be related to increased oxidative stress as a result ofPginfection. These data suggest a novel and paradigm-shifting mechanism in the long-term association between periodontitis and atherosclerotic CVD.© 2023 Omar, Alexiou, Rekhi, Lehmann, Bhardwaj, Delyea, Elahi and Febbraio."

A total of 12 clinical and 40 [18F]-FDG-PET-based radiomic characteristics were used to predict recurrences using 7 different ML algorithms, namely, decision tree, random forest (RF), neural network, k-nearest neighbors, naive Bayes, logistic regression, and support vector machine (SVM) with a 10-fold cross-validation and synthetic minority over-sampling technique. Three different ML models were created using clinical characteristics (clinical ML models), radiomic characteristics (radiomic ML models), and both clinical and radiomic characteristics (combined ML models). Each ML model was constructed using the top ten characteristics ranked by the decrease in Gini impurity. The areas under ROC curves (AUCs) and accuracies were used to compare predictive performances.In training cohorts, all 7 ML algorithms except for logistic regression algorithm in the radiomics ML model (AUC = 0.760) achieved AUC values of >0.80 for predicting recurrences with clinical (range, 0.892-0.999), radiomic (range, 0.809-0.984), and combined (range, 0.897-0.999) ML models. In testing cohorts, the RF algorithm of combined ML model achieved the highest AUC and accuracy (95.7% (22/23)) with similar classification performance between training and testing cohorts (AUC: training cohort, 0.999; testing cohort, 0.992). The important characteristics for modeling process of this RF algorithm were radiomic GLZLM_ZLNU and AJCC stage.ML analyses using both clinical and [18F]-FDG-PET-based radiomic characteristics may be useful for predicting recurrence in patients with breast cancers who underwent surgery.© 2023.

A bi-directional Mendelian randomization (MR) study was performed to explore the causal relationship between GM and IgAN. We used inverse variance weighted (IVW) method as the primary method to determine the causal relationship between exposure and outcome in our MR study. Besides, we used additional analysis (MR-Egger, weighted median) and sensitivity analysis (Cochrane's Q test, MR-Egger and MR-PRESSO) to select significant results, followed by Bayesian model averaging (MR-BMA) to test the results of MR study. Finally, a reverse MR analysis was conducted to estimate the probability of reverse causality.At the locus-wide significance level, the results of IVW method and additional analysis showed that Genus Enterorhabdus was a protective factor for IgAN [OR: 0.456, 95% CI: 0.238-0.875, p=0.023], while Genus butyricicoccus was a risk factor for IgAN [OR: 3.471, 95% CI: 1.671-7.209, p=0.0008]. In the sensitivity analysis, no significant pleiotropy or heterogeneity of the results was found.Our study revealed the causal relationship between GM and IgAN, and expanded the variety of bacterial taxa causally related to IgAN.

Integrating multi-omics data has been demonstrated to enhance the accuracy of analyzing and classifying complex diseases. This can be attributed to the highly correlated nature of the data with various diseases, as well as the comprehensive and complementary information it provides. However, integrating multi-omics data for complex diseases is challenged by data characteristics such as high imbalance, scale variation, heterogeneity, and noise interference. These challenges further emphasize the importance of developing effective methods for multi-omics data integration.We proposed a novel multi-omics data learning model called MODILM, which integrates multiple omics data to improve the classification accuracy of complex diseases by obtaining more significant and complementary information from different single-omics data. Our approach includes four key steps: 1) constructing a similarity network for each omics data using the cosine similarity measure, 2) leveraging Graph Attention Networks to learn sample-specific and intra-association features from similarity networks for single-omics data, 3) using Multilayer Perceptron networks to map learned features to a new feature space, thereby strengthening and extracting high-level omics-specific features, and 4) fusing these high-level features using a View Correlation Discovery Network to learn cross-omics features in the label space, which results in unique class-level distinctiveness for complex diseases. To demonstrate the effectiveness of MODILM, we conducted experiments on six benchmark datasets consisting of miRNA expression, mRNA, and DNA methylation data. Our results show that MODILM outperforms state-of-the-art methods, effectively improving the accuracy of complex disease classification.Our MODILM provides a more competitive way to extract and integrate important and complementary information from multiple omics data, providing a very promising tool for supporting decision-making for clinical diagnosis.© 2023.

These technologies, based on aging biomarkers, trace and measure molecular changes in order to monitor individuals' ""true"" biological age against their chronological age. Drawing on the concept of decay, and building on ethnographic fieldwork in an academic laboratory and a commercial firm, we analyze the implications of the development and commercialization of biological clocks that can identify when decay is ""out of tempo."" We show how the building of biological clocks rests on particular forms of knowing decay: In the academic laboratory, researchers focus on endo-processes of decay that are internal to the person, but when the technology moves to the market, the focus shifts as staff bracket decay as exo-processes, which are seen as resulting from a person's lifestyle. As the technology of biological clocks travels from the laboratory to the market of online testing of the consumer's biological age, we observe shifting visions of aging: from an inevitable trajectory of decline to a malleable and plastic one. While decay is an inevitable trajectory starting at birth and ending with death, the commercialization of biological clocks points to ways of stretching time between birth and death as individuals ""optimize"" their biological age through lifestyle changes. Regardless of admitted uncertainties about what is measured and the connection between maintenance and future health outcomes, the aging person is made responsible for their decaying body and for enacting maintenance to slow down decay. We show how the biological clock's way of ""knowing"" decay turns aging and its maintenance into a life-long concern and highlight the normative implications of framing decay as malleable and in need of intervention.Copyright © 2023 Pinel, Green and Svendsen."

Despite this, no effective treatment or accurate diagnosis currently exists. The negative impacts of invasive techniques and the failure of clinical trials have prompted a shift in research towards non-invasive treatments. In light of this, there is a growing need for early detection of AD through non-invasive approaches. The abundance of data generated by non-invasive techniques such as blood component monitoring, imaging, wearable sensors, and bio-sensors not only offers a platform for more accurate and reliable bio-marker developments but also significantly reduces patient pain, psychological impact, risk of complications, and cost. Nevertheless, there are challenges concerning the computational analysis of the large quantities of data generated, which can provide crucial information for the early diagnosis of AD. Hence, the integration of artificial intelligence and deep learning is critical to addressing these challenges.

"37164758","ALDH2 rs671 variant allele is associated with higher energy intake in middle-aged and elderly Japanese who routinely consume alcohol.","Environ Health Prev Med","According to recent reports, individuals with reduced aldehyde dehydrogenase activity may require more energy for the detoxification of aldehydes. Aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2), an ALDH isozyme, is responsible for detoxifying acetaldehyde, an intermediate metabolite of ethanol. Because the variant allele of the rs671 polymorphism of ALDH2 results in a substantial reduction in enzymatic activity, carriers of this variant allele may have a higher energy demand when consuming alcohol than non-carriers. However, no studies have evaluated this phenomenon to date.To test the hypothesis, we statistically examined the interactive effects between the rs671 and ethanol consumption on energy intake using cross-sectional data from a population-based cohort study, the Japan Multi-Institutional Collaborative Cohort Study, which was conducted in Saga city between 2005-2007 (N = 12,068).General linear regression models adjusted for age, sex, ethanol consumption, current smoking status, years of education, dietary restriction, medical history, and physical activity level revealed that energy intake was higher in variant allele carriers than in non-carriers among individuals with alcohol drinking habits, whereas no such correlation was observed among those without drinking habits (≤2 g ethanol/day) (p = 0.03 for interaction between rs671 and ethanol consumption). Energy intake excluding energy from alcoholic beverages, carbohydrate intake, protein intake, and fat intake, showed similar tendencies (p for interaction = 0.01, 0.01, 0.04, and 0.07, respectively).These findings support the hypothesis that increased energy intake is required for the detoxification of aldehydes in individuals with low ALDH activity. This epidemiological evidence provides a possible scientific basis for understanding aldehyde detoxification mechanisms and suggests a novel phenotype of the ALDH2 rs671 polymorphism."

The objective of this study was to determine the effect of prenatal and postnatal melatonin supplementation on overall calf performance and dam milking traits in relation to calves, molecular factors involved in growth and metabolism of calves, along with testicular physiology and fertility traits in subsequent bulls. On days 190, 220 and 250 of gestation, dams (N = 60) were administered either two subdermal ear melatonin implants (preMEL) or no implants (preCON). After parturition, birth weights were recorded and calves were blocked based on prenatal treatment and sex. Calves received either melatonin implants (posMEL) or none (posCON) on days 0, 30, and 60 of age. On day 60 of lactation, a subset of dams (N = 32) were selected based on age, weight, and calf sex for milk collection and analysis. At weaning, (day 210 postnatally) calf weight, morphometric data, liver samples, and loin samples were collected. At 12 mo of age, bull (N = 30) scrotal circumference, scrotal temperature, and testicular artery measurements were recorded. Milk yield and fat percent from dams tended to decrease in the preMEL group (P < 0.07) compared with preCON group. Prenatal melatonin administration did not affect (P = 0.95) calf birth weight and similarly calf weaning weight was unaffected (P < 0.10) by prenatal or postnatal melatonin supplementation. Blood analysis demonstrated that plasma concentrations of melatonin were not different (P = 0.12) in dams; however, an increase (P < 0.001) in plasma concentrations of melatonin was observed in posMEL vs. posCON calves. A tendency (P < 0.10) for decreased MYF5 and MYOD1 expression in loin muscle was observed in the posMEL calves. Prenatal and postnatal melatonin administration did not affect subsequent bull scrotal measurements or testicular hemodynamics (P ≥ 0.14). Administering supplemental melatonin via implants during the prenatal and postnatal phase did not alter performance characteristics in offspring. In this study, dams were implanted in winter months, whereas calves were implanted in the spring months. Seasonal differences involving photoperiod and ambient temperature might have attributed to a lack of differences in melatonin levels during the prenatal phase. In the postnatal period, the level of developmental plasticity appears to be too low for melatonin properties to be effective.© The Author(s) 2023.

"37205302","The Use of Single-Cell RNA-Sequencing and Spatial Transcriptomics in Understanding the Pathogenesis and Treatment of Skin Diseases.","JID Innov","The development of multiomic profiling tools has rapidly expanded in recent years, along with their use in profiling skin tissues in various contexts, including dermatologic diseases. Among these tools, single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics (ST) have emerged as widely adopted and powerful assays for elucidating key cellular components and their spatial arrangement within skin disease. In this paper, we review the recent biological insights gained from the use of scRNA-seq and ST and the advantages of combining both for profiling skin diseases, including aberrant wound healing, inflammatory skin diseases, and cancer. We discuss the role of scRNA-seq and ST in improving skin disease treatments and moving toward the goal of achieving precision medicine in dermatology, whereby patients can be optimally matched to treatments that maximize therapeutic response.© 2023 The Authors."
"37193183","Diagnostic value of human fecal SDC2 gene in colorectal cancer.","Am J Transl Res","To explore the clinical value of human fecal Syndecan-2 (SDC2) gene methylation in colorectal cancer screening.There were 30 patients with colorectal cancer receiving treatment in Zhangjiakou First Hospital from January 2019 to December 2019 collected as the tumor group. There were 30 healthy people determined by a physical examination in 2019 collected as the normal group. The methylation level of fecal SDC2 gene and the level of serum tumor markers including carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and Carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) were analyzed. The diagnostic effects of fecal SDC2 methylation and serum tumor markers on colorectal cancer were compared. The area under curve (AUC) of different methods for colorectal cancer diagnosis were evaluated based on the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.There was no distinction between the tumor group and the normal group in clinical basic data, including gender, age, and body mass index (P > 0.05), revealing the comparability between the two groups. The level of fecal SDC2 methylation in the tumor group was lower than that in the normal group (P < 0.05). CEA and CA19-9 in the tumor group were higher than those in the normal group (P < 0.05). Among the 30 colorectal cancers, 28 (93.33%) were positive for SDC2 gene methylation, 18 (60%) were positive for serum CEA, and 19 (63.33%) were positive for serum CA19-9. This indicated that the true positive rate of SDC2 gene methylation was higher than that of serum tumor markers (P < 0.05). The AUC of fecal SDC2 gene methylation was 0.981. These were higher than that of serum tumor markers (P < 0.05).Fecal SDC2 gene detection has a high sensitivity and specificity for colorectal cancer. It has a very ideal detection effect in detecting colorectal cancer patients in the population.AJTR Copyright © 2023."
"37197427","Quantitative proteomic studies addressing unmet clinical needs in sarcoma.","Front Oncol","Sarcoma is a rare and complex disease comprising over 80 malignant subtypes that is frequently characterized by poor prognosis. Challenges in clinical management include uncertainties in diagnosis and disease classification, limited prognostic and predictive biomarkers, incompletely understood disease heterogeneity among and within subtypes, lack of effective treatment options, and limited progress in identifying new drug targets and novel therapeutics. Proteomics refers to the study of the entire complement of proteins expressed in specific cells or tissues. Advances in proteomics have included the development of quantitative mass spectrometry (MS)-based technologies which enable analysis of large numbers of proteins with relatively high throughput, enabling proteomics to be studied on a scale that has not previously been possible. Cellular function is determined by the levels of various proteins and their interactions, so proteomics offers the possibility of new insights into cancer biology. Sarcoma proteomics therefore has the potential to address some of the key current challenges described above, but it is still in its infancy. This review covers key quantitative proteomic sarcoma studies with findings that pertain to clinical utility. Proteomic methodologies that have been applied to human sarcoma research are briefly described, including recent advances in MS-based proteomic technology. We highlight studies that illustrate how proteomics may aid diagnosis and improve disease classification by distinguishing sarcoma histologies and identify distinct profiles within histological subtypes which may aid understanding of disease heterogeneity. We also review studies where proteomics has been applied to identify prognostic, predictive and therapeutic biomarkers. These studies traverse a range of histological subtypes including chordoma, Ewing sarcoma, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, leiomyosarcoma, liposarcoma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, myxofibrosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, synovial sarcoma, osteosarcoma, and undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma. Critical questions and unmet needs in sarcoma which can potentially be addressed with proteomics are outlined.Copyright © 2023 Connolly, Grimison, Horvath, Robinson and Reddel."
"37126510","The MOV10 RNA helicase is a dosage-dependent host restriction factor for LINE1 retrotransposition in mice.","PLoS Genet","Transposable elements constitute nearly half of the mammalian genome and play important roles in genome evolution. While a multitude of both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms exist to silence transposable elements, control of transposition in vivo remains poorly understood. MOV10, an RNA helicase, is an inhibitor of mobilization of retrotransposons and retroviruses in cell culture assays. Here we report that MOV10 restricts LINE1 retrotransposition in mice. Although MOV10 is broadly expressed, its loss causes only incomplete penetrance of embryonic lethality, and the surviving MOV10-deficient mice are healthy and fertile. Biochemically, MOV10 forms a complex with UPF1, a key component of the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway, and primarily binds to the 3' UTR of somatically expressed transcripts in testis. Consequently, loss of MOV10 results in an altered transcriptome in testis. Analyses using a LINE1 reporter transgene reveal that loss of MOV10 leads to increased LINE1 retrotransposition in somatic and reproductive tissues from both embryos and adult mice. Moreover, the degree of LINE1 retrotransposition inhibition is dependent on the Mov10 gene dosage. Furthermore, MOV10 deficiency reduces reproductive fitness over successive generations. Our findings demonstrate that MOV10 attenuates LINE1 retrotransposition in a dosage-dependent manner in mice.Copyright: © 2023 Guan et al.

"37163096","Genome-wide analysis of CRISPR perturbations indicates that enhancers act multiplicatively and without epistatic-like interactions.","bioRxiv","A single gene may be regulated by multiple enhancers, but how they work in concert to regulate transcription is poorly understood. Prior studies have mostly examined enhancers at single loci and have reached inconsistent conclusions about whether epistatic-like interactions exist between them. To analyze enhancer interactions throughout the genome, we developed a statistical framework for CRISPR regulatory screens that utilizes negative binomial generalized linear models that account for variable guide RNA (gRNA) efficiency. We reanalyzed a single-cell CRISPR interference experiment that delivered random combinations of enhancer-targeting gRNAs to each cell and interrogated interactions between 3,808 enhancer pairs. We found that enhancers act multiplicatively with one another to control gene expression, but our analysis provides no evidence for interaction effects between pairs of enhancers regulating the same gene. Our findings illuminate the regulatory behavior of multiple enhancers and our statistical framework provides utility for future analyses studying interactions between enhancers."

"37147374","Genetic dissection of behavioral traits related to successful training of drug detection dogs.","Sci Rep","Drug detection dogs play integral roles in society. However, the interplay between their behaviors and genetic characteristics underlying their performance remains uninvestigated. Herein, more than 120,000 genetic variants were evaluated in 326 German Shepherd or Labrador Retriever dogs to profile the genetic traits associated with various behavioral traits related to the successful training of drug detection dogs. Behavioral breed differences were observed in 'friendliness to humans' and 'tolerance to dogs.' A genome-wide association study within both breeds identified 11 regions potentially associated with drug detection dog characteristics as well as 'interest in the target' and 'friendliness to humans,' which are related to drug detection abilities. Among them, 63 protein-coding genes, including Atat1 and Pfn2 known to be associated with anxiety-related or exploration behavior in mice, respectively, were located surrounding the identified candidate polymorphisms. This study highlights genetic characteristics associated with behavioral traits that are important for the successful training of drug detection dogs. Thus, these findings may facilitate improved breeding and training of these dogs.© 2023. The Author(s)."
