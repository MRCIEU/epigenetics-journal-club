No,20220411,cancer,35331302,Pan-cancer predictions of transcription factors mediating aberrant DNA methylation.,Epigenetics Chromatin,"Aberrant DNA methylation is a hallmark of cancer cells. However, the mechanisms underlying changes in DNA methylation remain elusive. Transcription factors initially thought to be repressed from binding by DNA methylation, have recently emerged as being able to shape DNA methylation patterns.Here, we integrated the massive amount of data available from The Cancer Genome Atlas to predict transcription factors driving aberrant DNA methylation in 13 cancer types. We identified differentially methylated regions between cancer and matching healthy samples, searched for transcription factor motifs enriched in those regions and selected transcription factors with corresponding changes in gene expression. We predict transcription factors known to be involved in cancer as well as novel candidates to drive hypo-methylated regions such as FOXA1 and GATA3 in breast cancer, FOXA1 and TWIST1 in prostate cancer and NFE2L2 in lung cancer. We also predict transcription factors that lead to hyper-methylated regions upon transcription factor loss such as EGR1 in several cancer types. Finally, we validate that FOXA1 and GATA3 mediate hypo-methylated regions in breast cancer cells.Our work highlights the importance of some transcription factors as upstream regulators shaping DNA methylation patterns in cancer.Â© 2022.

No,20220411,cancer,35354049,Genome-wide identification and analysis of prognostic features in human cancers.,Cell Rep,"Clinical decisions in cancer rely on precisely assessing patient risk. To improve our ability to identify the most aggressive malignancies, we constructed genome-wide survival models using gene expression, copy number, methylation, and mutation data from 10,884 patients. We identified more than 100,000 significant prognostic biomarkers and demonstrate that these genomic features can predict patient outcomes in clinically ambiguous situations. While adverse biomarkers are commonly believed to represent cancer driver genes and promising therapeutic targets, we show that cancer features associated with shorter survival times are not enriched for either oncogenes or for successful drug targets. Instead, the strongest adverse biomarkers represent widely expressed cell-cycle and housekeeping genes, and, correspondingly, nearly all therapies directed against these features have failed in clinical trials. In total, our analysis establishes a rich resource for prognostic biomarker analysis and clarifies the use of patient survival data in preclinical cancer research and therapeutic development.Copyright Â© 2022 The Authors.

No,20220411,chromatin,35332326,Chromatin domain alterations linked to 3D genome organization in a large cohort of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder brains.,Nat Neurosci,"Chromosomal organization, scaling from the 147-base pair (bp) nucleosome to megabase-ranging domains encompassing multiple transcriptional units, including heritability loci for psychiatric traits, remains largely unexplored in the human brain. In this study, we constructed promoter- and enhancer-enriched nucleosomal histone modification landscapes for adult prefrontal cortex from H3-lysine 27 acetylation and H3-lysine 4 trimethylation profiles, generated from 388 controls and 351 individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia (SCZ) or bipolar disorder (BD) (nâ€‰=â€‰739). We mapped thousands of cis-regulatory domains (CRDs), revealing fine-grained, 104-106-bp chromosomal organization, firmly integrated into Hi-C topologically associating domain stratification by open/repressive chromosomal environments and nuclear topography. Large clusters of hyper-acetylated CRDs were enriched for SCZ heritability, with prominent representation of regulatory sequences governing fetal development and glutamatergic neuron signaling. Therefore, SCZ and BD brains show coordinated dysregulation of risk-associated regulatory sequences assembled into kilobase- to megabase-scaling chromosomal domains.Â© 2022.

No,20220411,chromatin,35301427,Convergence of case-specific epigenetic alterations identify a confluence of genetic vulnerabilities tied to opioid overdose.,Mol Psychiatry,"Opioid use disorder is a highly heterogeneous disease driven by a variety of genetic and environmental risk factors which have yet to be fully elucidated. Opioid overdose, the most severe outcome of opioid use disorder, remains the leading cause of accidental death in the United States. We interrogated the effects of opioid overdose on the brain using ChIP-seq to quantify patterns of H3K27 acetylation in dorsolateral prefrontal cortical neurons isolated from 51 opioid-overdose cases and 51 accidental death controls. Among opioid cases, we observed global hypoacetylation and identified 388 putative enhancers consistently depleted for H3K27ac. Machine learning on H3K27ac patterns predicted case-control status with high accuracy. We focused on case-specific regulatory alterations, revealing 81,399 hypoacetylation events, uncovering vast inter-patient heterogeneity. We developed a strategy to decode this heterogeneity based on convergence analysis, which leveraged promoter-capture Hi-C to identify five genes over-burdened by alterations in their regulatory network or ""plexus"": ASTN2, KCNMA1, DUSP4, GABBR2, ENOX1. These convergent loci are enriched for opioid use disorder risk genes and heritability for generalized anxiety, number of sexual partners, and years of education. Overall, our multi-pronged approach uncovers neurobiological aspects of opioid use disorder and captures genetic and environmental factors perpetuating the opioid epidemic.Â© 2022.

No,20220411,dnam age,35313970,Genome-wide association studies identify novel genetic loci for epigenetic age acceleration among survivors of childhood cancer.,Genome Med,"Increased epigenetic age acceleration (EAA) in survivors of childhood cancer is associated with specific treatment exposures, unfavorable health behaviors, and presence of certain chronic health conditions. To better understand inter-individual variability, we investigated the genetic basis underlying EAA.Genome-wide association studies of EAA based on multiple epigenetic clocks (Hannum, Horvath, PhenoAge, and GrimAge) were performed. MethylationEPIC BeadChip array and whole-genome sequencing data were generated with blood-derived DNA from participants in the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort Study (discovery: 2138 pre-existing and 502 newly generated data, all survivors; exploratory: 282 community controls). Linear regression models were fit for each epigenetic age against the allelic dose of each genetic variant, adjusting for age at sampling, sex, and cancer treatment exposures. Fixed-effects meta-analysis was used to combine summary statistics from two discovery data sets. LD (Linkage disequilibrium) score regression was used to estimate single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based heritability.For EAA-Horvath, a genome-wide significant association was mapped to the SELP gene with the strongest SNP rs732314 (meta-GWAS: Î²=0.57, P=3.30Ã—10-11). Moreover, the stratified analysis of the association between rs732314 and EAA-Horvath showed a substantial heterogeneity between children and adults (meta-GWAS: Î²=0.97 vs. 0.51, I2=73.1%) as well as between survivors with and without chest/abdominal/pelvic-RT exposure (Î²=0.64 vs. 0.31, I2=66.3%). For EAA-Hannum, an association was mapped to the HLA locus with the strongest SNP rs28366133 (meta-GWAS: Î²=0.78, P=3.78Ã—10-11). There was no genome-wide significant hit for EAA-PhenoAge or EAA-GrimAge. Interestingly, among community controls, rs732314 was associated with EAA-Horvath (Î²=1.09, P=5.43Ã—10-5), whereas rs28366133 was not associated with EAA-Hannum (Î²=0.21, P=0.49). The estimated heritability was 0.33 (SE=0.20) for EAA-Horvath and 0.17 (SE=0.23) for EAA-Hannum, but close to zero for EAA-PhenoAge and EAA-GrimAge.We identified novel genetic variants in the SELP gene and HLA region associated with EAA-Horvath and EAA-Hannum, respectively, among survivors of childhood cancer. The new genetic variants in combination with other replicated known variants can facilitate the identification of survivors at higher risk in developing accelerated aging and potentially inform drug targets for future intervention strategies among vulnerable survivors.Â© 2022.

No,20220411,dnam age,35346416,Assessing the causal role of epigenetic clocks in the development of multiple cancers: a Mendelian randomization study.,Elife,"Background:Epigenetic clocks have been associated with cancer risk in several observational studies. Nevertheless, it is unclear whether they play a causal role in cancer risk or if they act as a non-causal biomarker.Methods:We conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study to examine the genetically predicted effects of epigenetic age acceleration as measured by HannumAge (9 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)), Horvath Intrinsic Age (24 SNPs), PhenoAge (11 SNPs) and GrimAge (4 SNPs) on multiple cancers (i.e., breast, prostate, colorectal, ovarian and lung cancer). We obtained genome-wide association data for biological ageing from a meta-analysis (N=34,710), and for cancer from the UK Biobank (N cases=2,671-13,879; N controls=173,493-372,016), FinnGen (N cases=719-8,401; N controls=74,685-174,006) and several international cancer genetic consortia (N cases=11,348-122,977; N controls=15,861-105,974). Main analyses were performed using multiplicative random effects inverse variance weighted (IVW) MR. Individual study estimates were pooled using fixed effect meta-analysis. Sensitivity analyses included MR-Egger, weighted median, weighted mode and Causal Analysis using Summary Effect Estimates (CAUSE) methods, which are robust to some of the assumptions of the IVW approach.Results:Meta-analysed IVW MR findings suggested that higher GrimAge acceleration increased the risk of colorectal cancer (OR=1.12 per year increase in GrimAge acceleration, 95%CI 1.04-1.20,p=0.002). The direction of the genetically predicted effects was consistent across main and sensitivity MR analyses. Among subtypes, the genetically predicted effect of GrimAge acceleration was greater for colon cancer (IVW OR=1.15, 95%CI 1.09-1.21,p=0.006), than rectal cancer (IVW OR=1.05, 95%CI 0.97-1.13,p=0.24). Results were less consistent for associations between other epigenetic clocks and cancers.Conclusions:GrimAge acceleration may increase the risk of colorectal cancer. Findings for other clocks and cancers were inconsistent.

We aimed to identify autosomal cis eQTMs in children's blood, using data from 832 children of the Human Early Life Exposome (HELIX) project.Blood DNA methylation and gene expression were measured with the Illumina 450K and the Affymetrix HTA v2 arrays, respectively. The relationship between methylation levels and expression of nearby genes (1 Mb window centered at the transcription start site, TSS) was assessed by fitting 13.6 M linear regressions adjusting for sex, age, cohort, and blood cell composition.We identified 39,749 blood autosomal cis eQTMs, representing 21,966 unique CpGs (eCpGs, 5.7% of total CpGs) and 8,886 unique transcript clusters (eGenes, 15.3% of total transcript clusters, equivalent to genes). In 87.9% of these cis eQTMs, the eCpG was located at <250 kb from eGene's TSS; and 58.8% of all eQTMs showed an inverse relationship between the methylation and expression levels. Only around half of the autosomal cis-eQTMs eGenes could be captured through annotation of the eCpG to the closest gene. eCpGs had less measurement error and were enriched for active blood regulatory regions and for CpGs reported to be associated with environmental exposures or phenotypic traits. In 40.4% of the eQTMs, the CpG and the eGene were both associated with at least one genetic variant. The overlap of autosomal cis eQTMs in children's blood with those described in adults was small (13.8%), and age-shared cis eQTMs tended to be proximal to the TSS and enriched for genetic variants.This catalogue of autosomal cis eQTMs in children's blood can help the biological interpretation of EWAS findings and is publicly available at https://helixomics.isglobal.org/ and at Dryad (doi:10.5061/dryad.fxpnvx0t0).The study has received funding from the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-206) under grant agreement no 308333 (HELIX project); the H2020-EU.3.1.2. - Preventing Disease Programme under grant agreement no 874583 (ATHLETE project); from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement no 733206 (LIFECYCLE project), and from the European Joint Programming Initiative ""A Healthy Diet for a Healthy Life"" (JPI HDHL and Instituto de Salud Carlos III) under the grant agreement no AC18/00006 (NutriPROGRAM project).

We aimed to identify and replicate previously published genomic loci where DNA methylation changes are attributable to in utero exposures in the NutriGen birth cohort studies Alliance.We reviewed the literature to identify differentially methylated sites of newborn DNA which are associated with the following five traits of interest maternal diabetes, pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), diet during pregnancy, smoking, and gestational age. We then attempted to replicate these published associations in the Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development (CHILD) and the South Asian birth cohort (START) cord blood epigenome-wide data.We screened 68 full-text articles and identified a total of 17 cord blood epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) of the traits of interest. Out of the 290 CpG sites reported, 19 were identified in more than one study; all of them associated with maternal smoking. In CHILD and START EWAS, thousands of sites associated with gestational age were identified and maintained significance after correction for multiple testing. In CHILD, there was differential methylation observed for 8 of the published maternal smoking sites. No other traits tested (i.e., folate levels, gestational diabetes, birthweight) replicated in the CHILD or START cohorts.Maternal smoking during pregnancy and gestational age are strongly associated with differential methylation in offspring cord blood, as assessed in the EWAS literature and our birth cohorts. There are a limited number of reported methylation sites associated in more than two independent studies related to pregnancy. Additional large studies of diverse populations with fine phenotyping are needed to produce robust epigenome-wide data in order to further elucidate the effect of intrauterine exposures on the infants' methylome.Â© 2022.

Yes,20220411,ewas,35317219,Association of prenatal acetaminophen use and acetaminophen metabolites with DNA methylation of newborns: analysis of two consecutive generations of the Isle of Wight birth cohort.,Environ Epigenet,"Acetaminophen is used by nearly two-thirds of pregnant women. Although considered safe, studies have demonstrated associations between prenatal acetaminophen use and adverse health outcomes in offspring. Since DNA methylation (DNAm) at birth may act as an early indicator of later health, assessments on whether DNAm of newborns is associated with gestational acetaminophen use or its metabolites are needed. Using data from three consecutive generations of the Isle of Wight cohort (F0-grandmothers, F1-mothers, and F2-offspring) we investigated associations between acetaminophen metabolites in F0 serum at delivery with epigenome-wide DNAm in F1 (Guthrie cards) and between acetaminophen use of F1 and F2-cord-serum levels with F2 cord blood DNAm. In epigenome-wide screening, we eliminated non-informative DNAm sites followed by linear regression of informative sites. Based on repeated pregnancies, indication bias analyses tested whether acetaminophen indicated maternal diseases or has a risk in its own right. Considering that individuals with similar intake process acetaminophen differently, metabolites were clustered to distinguish metabolic exposures. Finally, metabolite clusters from F1-maternal and F2-cord sera were tested for their associations with newborn DNAm (F1 and F2). Twenty-one differential DNAm sites in cord blood were associated with reported maternal acetaminophen intake in the F2 generation. For 11 of these cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites, an indication bias was excluded and five were replicated in F2 with metabolite clusters. In addition, metabolite clusters showed associations with 25 CpGs in the F0-F1 discovery analysis, of which five CpGs were replicated in the F2-generation. Our results suggest that prenatal acetaminophen use, measured as metabolites, may influence DNAm in newborns.Published by Oxford University Press 2022.

We evaluated smoking-associated DNAm signatures in the Costa Rican Study on Longevity and Healthy Aging (CRELES), including participants from the high longevity region of Nicoya.Â We measured genome-wide DNAm in leukocytes, tested Epigenetic Age Acceleration (EAA) from five clocks and estimates of telomere length (DNAmTL), and examined effect modification by the high longevity region.Â 489 participants had a mean (SD) age of 79.4 (10.8) years, and 18% were from Nicoya.

Recently, DNA methylation alterations were found in the blood of ICU patients, partially explaining long-term developmental impairment of critically ill children. As illness-induced aberrant DNA methylation theoretically could also be involved in long-term weakness, we investigated whether the DNA methylation signature in muscle of adult critically ill patients differs from that in muscle of healthy controls.Genome-wide methylation was determined (InfiniumÂ® HumanMethylationEPIC BeadChips) in DNA extracted from skeletal muscle biopsies that had been collected on Day 8Â Â±Â 1 in ICU from 172 EPaNIC-trial patients [66% male sex, median age 62.7Â years, median body mass index (BMI) 25.9Â kg/m2] and 20 matched healthy controls (70% male sex, median age 58.0Â years, median BMI 24.4Â kg/m2). Methylation status of individual cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites of patients and controls was compared with F-tests, using the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate to correct for multiple comparisons. Differential methylation of DNA regions was assessed with bump hunting, with 1000 permutations assessing uncertainty, expressed as family-wise error rate. Gene expression was investigated for 10 representative affected genes.In DNA from ICU patients, 565 CpG sites, associated with 400 unique genes, were differentially methylated as compared with controls (average difference 3.2Â Â±Â 0.1% ranging up to 16.9%, PÂ <Â 0.00005). Many of the associated genes appeared highly relevant for muscle structure and function/weakness, including genes involved in myogenesis, muscle regeneration, nerve/muscle membrane excitability, muscle denervation/re-innervation, axon guidance/myelination/degeneration/regeneration, synapse function, ion channelling with especially calcium signalling, metabolism (glucose, protein, and fat), insulin signalling, neuroendocrine hormone regulation, mitochondrial function, autophagy, apoptosis, oxidative stress, Wnt signalling, transcription regulation, muscle fat infiltration during regeneration, and fibrosis. In patients as compared with controls, we also identified two hypomethylated regions, spanning 18 and 3 CpG sites in the promoters of the HIC1 and NADK2 genes, respectively (average differences 5.8Â Â±Â 0.01% and 12.1Â Â±Â 0.04%, family-wise error rate <0.05). HIC1 and NADK2 play important roles in muscle regeneration and postsynaptic acetylcholine receptors and in mitochondrial processes, respectively. Nine of 10 investigated genes containing DNA methylation alterations were differentially expressed in patients as compared with controls (PÂ â‰¤Â 0.03).Critically ill patients present with a different DNA methylation signature in skeletal muscle as compared with healthy controls, which in theory could provide a biological basis for long-term persistence of weakness in ICU survivors.ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00512122, registered on 31 July 2007.Â© 2022 The Authors.

To examine this hypothesis, we performed an epigenome-wide association study of left-handedness. In a meta-analysis of 3914 adults of whole-blood DNA methylation, we observed that CpG sites located in proximity of handedness-associated genetic variants were more strongly associated with left-handedness than other CpG sites (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.04), but did not identify any differentially methylated positions. In longitudinal analyses of DNA methylation in peripheral blood and buccal cells from children (Nâ€‰=â€‰1737), we observed moderately stable associations across age (correlation range [0.355-0.578]), but inconsistent across tissues (correlation range [-â€‰0.384 to 0.318]). We conclude that DNA methylation in peripheral tissues captures little of the variance in handedness. Future investigations should consider other more targeted sources of tissue, such as the brain.Â© 2022. The Author(s)."

Blood DNA methylation has been shown to be associated with many other environmental exposures, but to our knowledge, no studies to date have examined the association between blood DNA methylation and glyphosate exposure.We conducted an epigenome-wide association study to identify DNA methylation loci associated with urinary glyphosate and its metabolite aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) levels. Secondary goals were to determine the association of epigenetic age acceleration with glyphosate and AMPA and develop blood DNA methylation indices to predict urinary glyphosate and AMPA levels.For 392 postmenopausal women, white blood cell DNA methylation was measured using the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip array. Glyphosate and AMPA were measured in two urine samples per participant using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Methylation differences at the probe and regional level associated with glyphosate and AMPA levels were assessed using a resampling-based approach. Probes and regions that had an false discovery rateq<0.1inâ‰¥90%of 1,000 subsamples of the study population were considered differentially methylated. Differentially methylated sites from the probe-specific analysis were combined into a methylation index. Epigenetic age acceleration from three epigenetic clocks and an epigenetic measure of pace of aging were examined for associations with glyphosate and AMPA.We identified 24 CpG sites whose methylation level was associated with urinary glyphosate concentration and two associated with AMPA. Four regions, within the promoters of theMSH4,KCNA6,ABAT, andNDUFAF2/ERCC8genes, were associated with glyphosate levels, along with an association betweenESR1promoter hypomethylation and AMPA. The methylation index accurately predicted glyphosate levels in an internal validation cohort. AMPA, but not glyphosate, was associated with greater epigenetic age acceleration.Glyphosate and AMPA exposure were associated with DNA methylation differences that could promote the development of cancer and other diseases. Further studies are warranted to replicate our results, determine the functional impact of glyphosate- and AMPA-associated differential DNA methylation, and further explore whether DNA methylation could serve as a biomarker of glyphosate exposure. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP10174."

DNA methylation is influenced by genetic variation but the association between polygenic risk of depression and DNA methylation is unknown.We investigated the association between polygenic risk scores (PRS) for depression and DNAm by conducting a methylome-wide association study (MWAS) in Generation Scotland (N = 8898, mean age = 49.8 years) with replication in the Lothian Birth Cohorts of 1921 and 1936 and adults in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) (Ncombined= 2049, mean age = 79.1, 69.6 and 47.2 years, respectively). We also conducted a replication MWAS in the ALSPAC children (N = 423, mean age = 17.1 years). Gene ontology analysis was conducted for the cytosine-guanine dinucleotide (CpG) probes significantly associated with depression PRS, followed by Mendelian randomisation (MR) analysis to infer the causal relationship between depression and DNAm.Widespread associations (NCpG= 71, pBonferroni< 0.05, p < 6.3 Ã— 10-8) were found between PRS constructed using genetic risk variants for depression and DNAm in CpG probes that localised to genes involved in immune responses and neural development. The effect sizes for the significant associations were highly correlated between the discovery and replication samples in adults (r = 0.79) and in adolescents (r = 0.82). Gene Ontology analysis showed that significant CpG probes are enriched in immunological processes in the human leukocyte antigen system. Additional MWAS was conducted for each lead genetic risk variant. Over 47.9% of the independent genetic risk variants included in the PRS showed associations with DNAm inÂ CpG probes located in both the same (cis) and distal (trans) locationsÂ to the genetic loci (pBonferroni< 0.045). Subsequent MR analysis showed that there are a greater number of causal effects found from DNAm to depression than vice versa (DNAm to depression: pFDRranged from 0.024 to 7.45 Ã— 10-30; depression to DNAm: pFDRranged from 0.028 to 0.003).PRS for depression, especially those constructed from genome-wide significant genetic risk variants, showed methylome-wide differences associated with immune responses. Findings from MR analysis provided evidence for causal effect of DNAm to depression.Â© 2022. The Author(s)."
Yes,20220411,ewas,35347270,Grandmaternal smoking during pregnancy is associated with differential DNA methylation in peripheral blood of their grandchildren.,Eur J Hum Genet,"The idea that information can be transmitted to subsequent generation(s) by epigenetic means has been studied for decades but remains controversial in humans. Epidemiological studies have established that grandparental exposures are associated with health outcomes in their grandchildren, often with sex-specific effects; however, the mechanism of transmission is still unclear. We conducted Epigenome Wide Association Studies (EWAS) to test whether grandmaternal smoking during pregnancy is associated with altered DNA methylation (DNAm) in peripheral blood from their adolescent grandchildren. We used data from a birth cohort, with discovery and replication datasets of up to 1225 and 708 individuals (respectively, for the maternal line), aged 15-17 years, and tested replication in the same individuals at birth and 7 years. We show for the first time that DNAm at a small number of loci in cord blood is associated with grandmaternal smoking in humans. In adolescents we see suggestive associations in regions of the genome which we hypothesised a priori could be involved in transgenerational transmission - we observe sex-specific associations at two sites on the X chromosome and one in an imprinting control region. All are within transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs), and we observe enrichment for TFBS among the CpG sites with the strongest associations; however, there is limited evidence that the associations we see replicate between timepoints. The implication of this work is that effects of smoking during pregnancy may induce DNAm changes in later generations and that these changes are often sex-specific, in line with epidemiological associations.Â© 2022.

Yes,20220411,ewas,35346352,Epigenome-wide DNA methylation profiling of conditioned pain modulation in individuals with non-specific chronic low back pain.,Clin Epigenetics,"The pathoanatomic cause of chronic low back pain (cLBP) cannot be identified for up to 90% of individuals. However, dysfunctional processing of endogenous nociceptive input, measured as conditioned pain modulation (CPM), has been associated with cLBP and may involve changes in neuronal gene expression. Epigenetic-induced changes such as DNA methylation (DNAm) have been associated with cLBP.In the present study, the relationship between CPM and DNAm changes in a sample of community-dwelling adults with nonspecific cLBP (nâ€‰=â€‰48) and pain-free controls (PFC; nâ€‰=â€‰50) was examined using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing. Gene ontology (GO) term enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis were applied to identify key pathways involved in efficient versus deficient CPM.Based on CPM efficiency, we identified 6006 and 18,305 differentially methylated CpG sites (DMCs) with q valuesâ€‰<â€‰0.01 among individuals with cLBP and PFCs, respectively. Most of the DMCs were hypomethylated and annotated to genes of relevance to pain, including OPRM1, ADRB2, CACNA2D3, GNA12, LPL, NAXD, and ASPHD1. In both cLBP and PFC groups, the DMCs annotated genes enriched many GO terms relevant to pain processing, including transcription regulation by RNA polymerase II, nervous system development, generation of neurons, neuron differentiation, and neurogenesis. Both groups also enriched the pathways involved in Rap1-signaling, cancer, and dopaminergic neurogenesis. However, MAPK-Ras signaling pathways were enriched in the cLBP, not the PFC group.This is the first study to investigate the genome-scale DNA methylation profiles of CPM phenotype in adults with cLBP and PFCs. Based on CPM efficiency, fewer DMC enrichment pathways were unique to the cLBP than the PFCs group. Our results suggest that epigenetically induced modification of neuronal development/differentiation pathways may affect CPM efficiency, suggesting novel potential therapeutic targets for central sensitization. However, CPM efficiency and the experience of nonspecific cLBP may be independent. Further mechanistic studies are required to confirm the relationship between CPM, central sensitization, and nonspecific cLBP.Â© 2022. The Author(s)."

Therefore, this study aimed to assess whether there is any association between the ambient concentrations of PM10and NO2and CpG methylation in the cord blood DNA by using a Korean birth cohort. The concentrations of the air pollutants were incorporated into the final LUR model by using the maternal address data. The methylation level was determined using HumanMethylationEPIC BeadChip and a linear regression analysis model. A multipollutant model including both PM10and NO2and models with single pollutants were used for each trimester exposure. The number of differentially methylated positions was the largest for midpregnancy exposure in both the single pollutant models and the multipollutant regression analysis. Additionally, gene-set analysis regarding midpregnancy exposure revealed four gene ontology terms (cellular response to staurosporine, positive regulation of cytoskeleton organization, neurotransmitter transport, and execution phase of apoptosis). In conclusion, these findings show an association between prenatal PM10and NO2exposure and DNA methylation in several CpG sites in cord blood cells, especially for midpregnancy exposure."
No,20220411,imprinting,35296332,Trans-acting genetic variants causing multilocus imprinting disturbance (MLID): common mechanisms and consequences.,Clin Epigenetics,"Imprinting disorders are a group of congenital diseases which are characterized by molecular alterations affecting differentially methylated regions (DMRs). To date, at least twelve imprinting disorders have been defined with overlapping but variable clinical features including growth and metabolic disturbances, cognitive dysfunction, abdominal wall defects and asymmetry. In general, a single specific DMR is affected in an individual with a given imprinting disorder, but there are a growing number of reports on individuals with so-called multilocus imprinting disturbances (MLID), where aberrant imprinting marks (most commonly loss of methylation) occur at multiple DMRs. However, as the literature is fragmented, we reviewed the molecular and clinical data of 55 previously reported or newly identified MLID families with putative pathogenic variants in maternal effect genes (NLRP2, NLRP5, NLRP7, KHDC3L, OOEP, PADI6) and in other candidate genes (ZFP57, ARID4A, ZAR1, UHRF1, ZNF445).In 55 families, a total of 68 different candidate pathogenic variants were identified (7 in NLRP2, 16 in NLRP5, 7 in NLRP7, 17 in PADI6, 15 in ZFP57, and a single variant in each of the genes ARID4A, ZAR1, OOEP, UHRF1, KHDC3L and ZNF445). Clinical diagnoses of affected offspring included Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome spectrum, Silver-Russell syndrome spectrum, transient neonatal diabetes mellitus, or they were suspected for an imprinting disorder (undiagnosed). Some families had recurrent pregnancy loss.Genomic maternal effect and foetal variants causing MLID allow insights into the mechanisms behind the imprinting cycle of life, and the spatial and temporal function of the different factors involved in oocyte maturation and early development. Further basic research together with identification of new MLID families will enable a better understanding of the link between the different reproductive issues such as recurrent miscarriages and preeclampsia in maternal effect variant carriers/families and aneuploidy and the MLID observed in the offsprings. The current knowledge can already be employed in reproductive and genetic counselling in specific situations.Â© 2022. The Author(s)."
No,20220411,metastable epialleles,35355955,Maternal tobacco smoke exposure is associated with increased DNA methylation at human metastable epialleles in infant cord blood.,Environ Epigenet,"Metastable epialleles (MEs) are genomic regions that are stochastically methylated prior to germ layer specification and exhibit high interindividual but low intra-individual variability across tissues. ME methylation is vulnerable to environmental stressors, including diet. Tobacco smoke (TS) exposure during pregnancy is associated with adverse impacts on fetal health and maternal micronutrient levels as well as altered methylation. Our objective was to determine if maternal smoke exposure impacts methylation at MEs. Consistent with prior studies, we observed reductions in one-carbon pathway micronutrients with gestational TS exposure, including maternal folate (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.02) and vitamins B6 (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.05) and B12 (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.007). We examined putative MEsBOLA3, PAX8,andZFYVE28in cord blood specimens from 85 Newborn Epigenetics STudy participants. Gestational TS exposure was associated with elevated DNA methylation atPAX8(+5.22% average methylation; 95% CI: 0.33% to 10.10%;Pâ€‰=â€‰0.037). In human conceptal kidney tissues, higherPAX8transcription was associated with lower methylation (Rsâ€‰=â€‰0.55;Pâ€‰=â€‰0.07), suggesting that the methylation levels established at MEs, and their environmentally induced perturbation, may have meaningful, tissue-specific functional consequences. This may be particularly important becausePAX8is implicated in several cancers, including pediatric kidney cancer. Our data are the first to indicate vulnerability of human ME methylation establishment to TS exposure, with a general trend of increasing levels of methylation at these loci. Further investigation is needed to determine how TS exposure-mediated changes in DNA methylation at MEs, and consequent expression levels, might affect smoking-related disease risk.Â© The Author(s) 2022.

We developed a technology called epigenetic MRI (eMRI) that enables noninvasive imaging of DNA methylation in the brain, a major epigenetic mechanism. eMRI reveals strong regional differences in global DNA methylation in pig brains, a model with stronger resemblance to human brains than are rodents. Given the noninvasive nature of eMRI, our results pave the way for a DNA-methylation imaging paradigm for living human brains. We expect eMRI to enable many studies to unravel the molecular control of brain function and disease."
No,20220411,methods,35361122,ENNGene: an Easy Neural Network model building tool for Genomics.,BMC Genomics,"The recent big data revolution in Genomics, coupled with the emergence of Deep Learning as a set of powerful machine learning methods, has shifted the standard practices of machine learning for Genomics. Even though Deep Learning methods such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are becoming widespread in Genomics, developing and training such models is outside the ability of most researchers in the field.Here we present ENNGene-Easy Neural Network model building tool for Genomics. This tool simplifies training of custom CNN or hybrid CNN-RNN models on genomic data via an easy-to-use Graphical User Interface. ENNGene allows multiple input branches, including sequence, evolutionary conservation, and secondary structure, and performs all the necessary preprocessing steps, allowing simple input such as genomic coordinates. The network architecture is selected and fully customized by the user, from the number and types of the layers to each layer's precise set-up. ENNGene then deals with all steps of training and evaluation of the model, exporting valuable metrics such as multi-class ROC and precision-recall curve plots or TensorBoard log files. To facilitate interpretation of the predicted results, we deploy Integrated Gradients, providing the user with a graphical representation of an attribution level of each input position. To showcase the usage of ENNGene, we train multiple models on the RBP24 dataset, quickly reaching the state of the art while improving the performance on more than half of the proteins by including the evolutionary conservation score and tuning the network per protein.As the role of DL in big data analysis in the near future is indisputable, it is important to make it available for a broader range of researchers. We believe that an easy-to-use tool such as ENNGene can allow Genomics researchers without a background in Computational Sciences to harness the power of DL to gain better insights into and extract important information from the large amounts of data available in the field.Â© 2022.

No,20220411,omics,2021.12.17.473125,Integration of public DNA methylation and expression networks via eQTMs improves prediction of functional gene–gene,biorxiv,"Gene co-expression networks can be used to infer functional relationships between genes, but they do not work well for all genes. We investigated whether DNA methylation can provide complementary information for such genes. We first carried out an eQTM meta-analysis of 3,574 gene expression and methylation samples from blood, brain and nasal epithelial brushed cells to identify links between methylated CpG sites and genes. This revealed 6,067 significant eQTM genes, and we observed that histone modification information is predictive of both eQTM direction and presence, enabling us to link many CpG sites to genes. We then generated a co-methylation network – MethylationNetwork – using 27,720 publicly available methylation profiles and integrated it with a public RNA-seq co-expression dataset of 31,499 samples. Here, we observed that MethylationNetwork can identify experimentally validated interacting pairs of genes that could not be identified in the RNA-seq datasets. We then developed a novel integration pipeline based on CCA and used the integrated methylation and gene networks to predict gene pairs reported in the STRING database. The integrated network showed significantly improved prediction performance compared to using a DNA co-methylation or a gene co-expression network alone. This is the first study to integrate data from two -omics layers from unmatched public samples across different tissues and diseases, and our results highlight the issues and potential of integrating public datasets from multiple molecular phenotypes. The eQTMs we identified can be used as an annotation resource for epigenome-wide association, and we believe that our integration pipeline can be used as a framework for future -omics integration analyses of public datasets.

We provide supporting materials and results, including the harmonized DNA methylation data from multiple tissues and diseases in https://data.harmjanwestra.nl/comethylation/, the discovered and predicted eQTMs, the corresponding CCA components and the trained prediction models in a Zenodo repository (https://zenodo.org/record/4666994).

No,20220411,omics,35259029,Multi-Omics Integration in a Twin Cohort and Predictive Modeling of Blood Pressure Values.,OMICS,"Abnormal blood pressure is strongly associated with risk of high-prevalence diseases, making the study of blood pressure a major public health challenge. Although biological mechanisms underlying hypertension at the single omic level have been discovered, multi-omics integrative analyses using continuous variations in blood pressure values remain limited. We used a multi-omics regression-based method, called sparse multi-block partial least square, for integrative, explanatory, and predictive interests in study of systolic and diastolic blood pressure values. Various datasets were obtained from the Finnish Twin Cohort for up to 444 twins. Blocks of omics-including transcriptomic, methylation, metabolomic-data as well as polygenic risk scores and clinical data were integrated into the modeling and supported by cross-validation. The predictive contribution of each omics block when predicting blood pressure values was investigated using external participants from the Young Finns Study. In addition to revealing interesting inter-omics associations, we found that each block of omics heterogeneously improved the predictions of blood pressure values once the multi-omics data were integrated. The modeling revealed a plurality of clinical, transcriptomic, and metabolomic factors consistent with the literature and that play a leading role in explaining unit variations in blood pressure. These findings demonstrate (1) the robustness of our integrative method to harness results obtained by single omics discriminant analyses, and (2) the added value of predictive and exploratory gains of a multi-omics approach in studies of complex phenotypes such as blood pressure."

Reliable methods for genome-wide measurement at scale have led to the proliferation of epigenome-wide association studies and subsequently to the development of DNA methylation-based predictors across a wide range of health-related applications, from the identification of risk factors or exposures, such as age and smoking, to early detection of disease or progression in cancer, cardiovascular and neurological disease. This Review evaluates the progress of existing DNA methylation-based predictors, including the contribution of machine learning techniques, and assesses the uptake of key statistical best practices needed to ensure their reliable performance, such as data-driven feature selection, elimination of data leakage in performance estimates and use of generalizable, adequately powered training samples.Â© 2022.

No,20220411,prediction,35283726,DNA Methylation Markers and Prediction Model for Depression and Their Contribution for Breast Cancer Risk.,Front Mol Neurosci,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) has become a leading cause of disability worldwide. However, the diagnosis of the disorder is dependent on clinical experience and inventory. At present, there are no reliable biomarkers to help with diagnosis and treatment. DNA methylation patterns may be a promising approach for elucidating the etiology of MDD and predicting patient susceptibility. Our overarching aim was to identify biomarkers based on DNA methylation, and then use it to propose a methylation prediction score for MDD, which we hope will help us evaluate the risk of breast cancer.Methylation data from 533 samples were extracted from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, of which, 324 individuals were diagnosed with MDD. Statistical difference of DNA Methylation between Promoter and Other body region (SIMPO) score for each gene was calculated based on the DNA methylation data. Based on SIMPO scores, we selected the top genes that showed a correlation with MDD in random resampling, then proposed a methylation-derived Depression Index (mDI) by combining the SIMPO of the selected genes to predict MDD. A validation analysis was then performed using additional DNA methylation data from 194 samples extracted from the GEO database. Furthermore, we applied the mDI to construct a prediction model for the risk of breast cancer using stepwise regression and random forest methods.The optimal mDI was derived from 426 genes, which included 245 positive and 181 negative correlations. It was constructed to predict MDD with high predictive power (AUC of 0.88) in the discovery dataset. In addition, we observed moderate power for mDI in the validation dataset with an OR of 1.79. Biological function assessment of the 426 genes showed that they were functionally enriched in Eph Ephrin signaling and beta-catenin Wnt signaling pathways. The mDI was then used to construct a predictive model for breast cancer that had an AUC ranging from 0.70 to 0.67.Our results indicated that DNA methylation could help to explain the pathogenesis of MDD and assist with its diagnosis.Copyright Â© 2022 Wang, Sun, Pang, Zheng, Liang, He, Tang, Yu, Xiong and Chang."
No,20220411,reference,35277705,A pan-tissue DNA methylation atlas enables in silico decomposition of human tissue methylomes at cell-type resolution.,Nat Methods,"Bulk-tissue DNA methylomes represent an average over many different cell types, hampering our understanding of cell-type-specific contributions to disease development. As single-cell methylomics is not scalable to large cohorts of individuals, cost-effective computational solutions are needed, yet current methods are limited to tissues such as blood. Here we leverage the high-resolution nature of tissue-specific single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets to construct a DNA methylation atlas defined for 13 solid tissue types and 40 cell types. We comprehensively validate this atlas in independent bulk and single-nucleus DNA methylation datasets. We demonstrate that it correctly predicts the cell of origin of diverse cancer types and discovers new prognostic associations in olfactory neuroblastoma and stage 2 melanoma. In brain, the atlas predicts a neuronal origin for schizophrenia, with neuron-specific differential DNA methylation enriched for corresponding genome-wide association study risk loci. In summary, the DNA methylation atlas enables the decomposition of 13 different human tissue types at a high cellular resolution, paving the way for an improved interpretation of epigenetic data.Â© 2022.

No,20220411,translation,35337378,Ethical implications of epigenetics in the era of personalized medicine.,Clin Epigenetics,"Given the increasing research activity on epigenetics to monitor human diseases and its connection with lifestyle and environmental expositions, the field of epigenetics has attracted a great deal of interest also at the ethical and societal level. In this review, we will identify and discuss current ethical, legal and social issues of epigenetics research in the context of personalized medicine. The review covers ethical aspects such as how epigenetic information should impact patient autonomy and the ability to generate an intentional and voluntary decision, the measures of data protection related to privacy and confidentiality derived from epigenome studies (e.g., risk of discrimination, patient re-identification and unexpected findings) or the debate in the distribution of responsibilities for health (i.e., personal versus public responsibilities). We pay special attention to the risk of social discrimination and stigmatization as a consequence of inferring information related to lifestyle and environmental exposures potentially contained in epigenetic data. Furthermore, as exposures to the environment and individual habits do not affect all populations equally, the violation of the principle of distributive justice in the access to the benefits of clinical epigenetics is discussed. In this regard, epigenetics represents a great opportunity for the integration of public policy measures aimed to create healthier living environments. Whether these public policies will coexist or, in contrast, compete with strategies reinforcing the personalized medicine interventions needs to be considered. The review ends with a reflection on the main challenges in epigenetic research, some of them in a technical dimension (e.g., assessing causality or establishing reference epigenomes) but also in the ethical and social sphere (e.g., risk to add an epigenetic determinism on top of the current genetic one). In sum, integration into life science investigation of social experiences such as exposure to risk, nutritional habits, prejudice and stigma, is imperative to understand epigenetic variation in disease. This pragmatic approach is required to locate clinical epigenetics out of the experimental laboratories and facilitate its implementation into society.Â© 2022. The Author(s)."
No,20220411,twins,35301182,Early life affects late-life health through determining DNA methylation across the lifespan: A twin study.,EBioMedicine,"Previous findings for the genetic and environmental contributions to DNA methylation variation were for limited age ranges only. We investigated the lifespan contributions and their implications for human health for the first time.1,720 monozygotic twin (MZ) pairs and 1,107 dizygotic twin (DZ) pairs aged 0-92 years were included. Familial correlations (i.e., correlations between twins) for 353,681 methylation sites were estimated and modelled as a function of twin pair cohabitation history.The methylome average familial correlation was around zero at birth (MZ pair: -0.01; DZ pair: -0.04), increased with the time of twins living together during childhood at rates of 0.16 (95%CI: 0.12-0.20) for MZ pairs and 0.13 (95%CI: 0.07-0.20) for DZ pairs per decade, and decreased with the time of living apart during adulthood at rates of 0.026 (95%CI: 0.019-0.033) for MZ pairs and 0.027 (95%CI: 0.011-0.043) for DZ pairs per decade. Neither the increasing nor decreasing rate differed by zygosity (both P>0.1), consistent with cohabitation environment shared by twins, rather than genetic factors, influencing the methylation familial correlation changes. Familial correlations for 6.6% (23,386/353,681) sites changed with twin pair cohabitation history. These sites were enriched for high heritability, proximal promoters, and epigenetic/genetic associations with various early-life factors and late-life health conditions.Early life strongly influences DNA methylation variation across the lifespan, and the effects are stronger for heritable sites and sites biologically relevant to the regulation of gene expression. Early life could affect late-life health through influencing DNA methylation.Victorian Cancer Agency, Cancer Australia, Cure Cancer Foundation.Copyright Â© 2022 The Authors.
