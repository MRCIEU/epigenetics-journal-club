"35334376","Maternal exposure to cadmium during pregnancy is associated with changes in DNA methylation that are persistent at 9 years of age.","Environ Int","Cadmium (Cd) exposure during gestation has been associated with altered DNA methylation at birth, but it is not known if the changes in methylation persist into childhood.To evaluate whether gestational Cd-related changes of DNA methylation persist from birth to 9 years of age.We studied mother-child dyads in a longitudinal cohort in rural Bangladesh. Cadmium concentrations in maternal blood (erythrocyte fraction; Ery-Cd) at gestational week 14 and in child urine (U-Cd, long-term exposure marker) at 9 years were measured using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The epigenome-wide DNA methylation was measured in mononuclear cells (PBMCs) prepared from cord blood and peripheral blood at 9 years in 71 children (hereafter referred to as the explorative group) by Infinium HumanMethylation450K BeadChip. Replication of one differentially methylated region (DMR; 9 CpG sites) was performed in PBMCs of 160 9-year-old children (validation group) by EpiTyper MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry.The median maternal Ery-Cd concentration was 1.24 µg/kg (range 0.35, 4.55) in the explorative group and 0.83 µg/kg (0.08, 2.97) in the validation group. The median U-Cd concentration in the 9-year-old children was 0.26 µg/L (0.09, 1.06) in the explorative group and 0.32 µg/L (0.07, 1.33) in the validation group. In the explorative group, we identified ten DMRs, both in cord blood and in PBMCs at 9 years, that were associated with maternal Ery-Cd. Eight out of the ten DMRs were hypomethylated and three of the hypomethylated DMRs were located in the HLA region on chromosome 6. One of the DMRs (hypomethylated) in the HLA region (upstream of the zinc finger protein 57 homolog, ZFP57 gene) was replicated in the validation group, and we found that it was hypomethylated in relation to maternal Ery-Cd, but not child U-Cd.Gestational exposure to Cd appears to be associated with regional changes, especially hypomethylated, in DNA methylation that linger from birth up to prepubertal age.Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).

"35333354","H3K56 deacetylation and H2A.Z deposition are required for aberrant heterochromatin spreading.","Nucleic Acids Res","Crucial mechanisms are required to restrict self-propagating heterochromatin spreading within defined boundaries and prevent euchromatic gene silencing. In the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa, the JmjC domain protein DNA METHYLATION MODULATOR-1 (DMM-1) prevents aberrant spreading of heterochromatin, but the molecular details remain unknown. Here, we revealed that DMM-1 is highly enriched in a well-defined 5-kb heterochromatin domain upstream of the cat-3 gene, hereby called 5H-cat-3 domain, to constrain aberrant heterochromatin spreading. Interestingly, aberrant spreading of the 5H-cat-3 domain observed in the dmm-1KO strain is accompanied by robust deposition of histone variant H2A.Z, and deletion of H2A.Z abolishes aberrant spreading of the 5H-cat-3 domain into adjacent euchromatin. Furthermore, lysine 56 of histone H3 is deacetylated at the expanded heterochromatin regions, and mimicking H3K56 acetylation with an H3K56Q mutation effectively blocks H2A.Z-mediated aberrant spreading of the 5H-cat-3 domain. Importantly, genome-wide analyses demonstrated the general roles of H3K56 deacetylation and H2A.Z deposition in aberrant spreading of heterochromatin. Together, our results illustrate a previously unappreciated regulatory process that mediates aberrant heterochromatin spreading.© The Author(s) 2022.

"35332262","Molecular landscape of pediatric type IDH wildtype, H3 wildtype hemispheric glioblastomas.","Lab Invest","The WHO (2021) Classification classified a group of pediatric-type high-grade gliomas as IDH wildtype, H3 wildtype but as of currently, they are characterized only by negative molecular features of IDH and H3. We recruited 35 cases of pediatric IDH wildtype and H3 wildtype hemispheric glioblastomas. We evaluated them with genome-wide methylation profiling, targeted sequencing, RNAseq, TERT promoter sequencing, and FISH. The median survival of the cohort was 27.6 months. With Capper et al.'s36methylation groups as a map, the cases were found to be epigenetically heterogeneous and were clustered in proximity or overlay of methylation groups PXA-like (n = 8), LGG-like (n = 10), GBM_MYCN (n = 9), GBM_midline (n = 5), and GBM_RTKIII (n = 3). Histology of the tumors in these groups was not different from regular glioblastomas. Methylation groups were not associated with OS. We were unable to identify groups specifically characterized by EGFR or PDGFRA amplification as proposed by other authors. EGFR, PDGFRA, and MYCN amplifications were not correlated with OS. 4/9 cases of the GBM_MYCN cluster did not show MYCN amplification; the group was also enriched for EGFR amplification (4/9 cases) and the two biomarkers overlapped in two cases. Overall, PDGFRA amplification was found in only four cases and they were not restricted to any groups. Cases in proximity to GBM_midline were all hemispheric and showed loss of H3K27me3 staining. Fusion genes ALK/NTRK/ROS1/MET characteristic of infantile glioblastomas were not identified in 17 cases successfully sequenced. BRAF V600E was only found in the PXA group but CDKN2A deletion could be found in other methylation groups. PXA-like cases did not show PXA histological features similar to findings by other authors. No case showed TERT promoter mutation. Mutations of mismatch repair (MMR) genes were poor prognosticators in single (p ≤ 0.001) but not in multivariate analyses (p = 0.229). MGMT had no survival significance in this cohort. Of the other common biomarkers, only TP53 and ATRX mutations were significant poor prognosticators and only TP53 mutation was significant after multivariate analyses (p = 0.024). We conclude that IDH wildtype, H3 wildtype pediatric hemispheric glioblastomas are molecularly heterogeneous and in routine practice, TP53, ATRX, and MMR status could profitably be screened for risk stratification in laboratories without ready access to methylation profiling.© 2022.

DNA methylation (DNAm) alterations may be a mechanism underlying these effects, but prior investigations of prenatal exposure to phthalates and neonatal DNAm profiles are limited to placental tissue and umbilical cord blood.Conduct an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of the associations between prenatal exposure to phthalates and DNAm in two accessible infant tissues, venous buffy coat blood and buccal epithelial cells (BECs).Participants included 152 maternal-infant pairs from the Alberta Pregnancy Outcomes and Nutrition (APrON) study. Maternal second trimester urine samples were analyzed for nine phthalate metabolites. Blood (n = 74) or BECs (n = 78) were collected from 3-month-old infants and profiled for DNAm using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 (450K) BeadChip. Robust linear regressions were used to investigate the associations between high (HMWPs) and low molecular weight phthalates (LMWPs) and change in methylation levels at variable Cytosine-phosphate-Guanine (CpG) sites in infant tissues, as well as the sensitivity of associations to potential confounders.One candidate CpG in gene RNF39 reported by a previous study examining prenatal exposure to phthalates and cord blood DNAm was replicated. The EWAS identified 12 high-confidence CpGs in blood and another 12 in BECs associated with HMWPs and/or LMWPs. Prenatal exposure to bisphenol A (BPA) associated with two of the CpGs associated with HMWPs in BECs.Prenatal exposure to phthalates was associated with DNAm variation at CpGs annotated to genes associated with endocrine hormone activity (i.e., SLCO4A1, TPO), immune pathways and DNA damage (i.e., RASGEF1B, KAZN, HLA-A, MYO18A, DIP2C, C1or109), and neurodevelopment (i.e., AMPH, NOTCH3, DNAJC5). Future studies that characterize the stability of these associations in larger samples, multiple cohorts, across tissues, and investigate the potential associations between these biomarkers and relevant health and neurodevelopmental outcomes are needed.Copyright © 2022.

"35325123","Whole-genome sequence and methylome profiling of the almond (Prunus dulcis [Mill.] D.A.Webb) cultivar 'Nonpareil'.","G3 (Bethesda)","Almond (Prunus dulcis [Mill.] D.A. Webb) is an economically important, specialty nut crop grown almost exclusively in the United States. Breeding and improvement efforts worldwide have led to the development of key, productive cultivars, including 'Nonpareil,' which is the most widely grown almond cultivar. Thus far, genomic resources for this species have been limited, and a whole-genome assembly for 'Nonpareil' is not currently available despite its economic importance and use in almond breeding worldwide. We generated a 571X coverage genome sequence using Illumina, PacBio, and optical mapping technologies. Gene prediction revealed 49,321 putative genes using MinION Oxford nanopore and Illumina RNA sequencing, and genome annotation found that 68% of predicted models are associated with at least one biological function. Further, epigenetic signatures of almond, namely DNA cytosine methylation, have been implicated in a variety of phenotypes including self-compatibility, bud dormancy, and development of non-infectious bud failure. In addition to the genome sequence and annotation, this report also provides the complete methylome of several almond tissues, including leaf, flower, endocarp, mesocarp, exocarp, and seed coat. Comparisons between methylation profiles in these tissues revealed differences in genome-wide weighted percent methylation and chromosome-level methylation enrichment.© The Author(s) 2022.

"35324388","Non-Alcoholic fatty liver disease-associated DNA methylation and gene expression alterations in the livers of Collaborative Cross mice fed an obesogenic high-fat and high-sucrose diet.","Epigenetics","Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a highly prevalent chronic liver disease, and patient susceptibility to its onset and progression is influenced by several factors. In this study, we investigated whether altered hepatic DNA methylation in liver tissue correlates with the degree of severity of NAFLD-like liver injury induced by a high-fat and high-sucrose (HF/HS) diet in Collaborative Cross (CC) mice. Using genome-wide targeted bisulphite DNA methylation next-generation sequencing, we found that mice with different non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) phenotypes could be distinguished by changes in hepatic DNA methylation profiles. Specifically, NAFL-prone male CC042 mice exhibited more prominent DNA methylation changes compared with male CC011 mice and female CC011 and CC042 mice that developed only a mild NAFL phenotype. Moreover, these mouse strains demonstrated different patterns of DNA methylation. While the HF/HS diet induced both DNA hypomethylation and DNA hypermethylation changes in all the mouse strains, the NAFL-prone male CC042 mice demonstrated a global predominance of DNA hypermethylation, whereas a more pronounced DNA hypomethylation pattern developed in the mild-NAFL phenotypic mice. In a targeted analysis of selected genes that contain differentially methylated regions (DMRs), we identified NAFL phenotype-associated differences in DNA methylation and gene expression of theApoa4, Gls2, andApomgenes in severe NAFL-prone mice but not in mice with mild NAFL phenotypes. These changes in the expression ofApoa4andGls2coincided with similar findings in a human in vitro cell model of diet-induced steatosis and in patients with NAFL. These results suggest that changes in the expression and DNA methylation status of these three genes may serve as a set of predictive markers for the development of NAFLD."
"35322029","Unveiling RCOR1 as a rheostat at transcriptionally permissive chromatin.","Nat Commun","RCOR1 is a known transcription repressor that recruits and positions LSD1 and HDAC1/2 on chromatin to erase histone methylation and acetylation. However, there is currently an incomplete understanding of RCOR1's range of localization and function. Here, we probe RCOR1's distribution on a genome-wide scale and unexpectedly find that RCOR1 is predominantly associated with transcriptionally active genes. Biochemical analysis reveals that RCOR1 associates with RNA Polymerase II (POL-II) during transcription and deacetylates its carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) at lysine 7. We provide evidence that this non-canonical RCOR1 activity is linked to dampening of POL-II productive elongation at actively transcribing genes. Thus, RCOR1 represses transcription in two ways-first, via a canonical mechanism by erasing transcriptionally permissive histone modifications through associating with HDACs and, second, via a non-canonical mechanism that deacetylates RNA POL-II's CTD to inhibit productive elongation. We conclude that RCOR1 is a transcription rheostat.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35317219","Association of prenatal acetaminophen use and acetaminophen metabolites with DNA methylation of newborns: analysis of two consecutive generations of the Isle of Wight birth cohort.","Environ Epigenet","Acetaminophen is used by nearly two-thirds of pregnant women. Although considered safe, studies have demonstrated associations between prenatal acetaminophen use and adverse health outcomes in offspring. Since DNA methylation (DNAm) at birth may act as an early indicator of later health, assessments on whether DNAm of newborns is associated with gestational acetaminophen use or its metabolites are needed. Using data from three consecutive generations of the Isle of Wight cohort (F0-grandmothers, F1-mothers, and F2-offspring) we investigated associations between acetaminophen metabolites in F0 serum at delivery with epigenome-wide DNAm in F1 (Guthrie cards) and between acetaminophen use of F1 and F2-cord-serum levels with F2 cord blood DNAm. In epigenome-wide screening, we eliminated non-informative DNAm sites followed by linear regression of informative sites. Based on repeated pregnancies, indication bias analyses tested whether acetaminophen indicated maternal diseases or has a risk in its own right. Considering that individuals with similar intake process acetaminophen differently, metabolites were clustered to distinguish metabolic exposures. Finally, metabolite clusters from F1-maternal and F2-cord sera were tested for their associations with newborn DNAm (F1 and F2). Twenty-one differential DNAm sites in cord blood were associated with reported maternal acetaminophen intake in the F2 generation. For 11 of these cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites, an indication bias was excluded and five were replicated in F2 with metabolite clusters. In addition, metabolite clusters showed associations with 25 CpGs in the F0-F1 discovery analysis, of which five CpGs were replicated in the F2-generation. Our results suggest that prenatal acetaminophen use, measured as metabolites, may influence DNAm in newborns.Published by Oxford University Press 2022.

"35310665","Phenotypic and Methylome Responses to Salt Stress in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> Natural Accessions.","Front Plant Sci","Salt stress threatens plant growth, development and crop yields, and has become a critical global environmental issue. Increasing evidence has suggested that the epigenetic mechanism such as DNA methylation can mediate plant response to salt stress through transcriptional regulation and transposable element (TE) silencing. However, studies exploring genome-wide methylation dynamics under salt stress remain limited, in particular, for studies on multiple genotypes. Here, we adopted four natural accessions of the model speciesArabidopsis thalianaand investigated the phenotypic and genome-wide methylation responses to salt stress through whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS). We found that salt stress significantly changed plant phenotypes, including plant height, rosette diameter, fruit number, and aboveground biomass, and the change in biomass tended to depend on accessions. Methylation analysis revealed that genome-wide methylation patterns depended primarily on accessions, and salt stress caused significant methylation changes in ∼ 0.1% cytosines over the genomes. About 33.5% of these salt-induced differential methylated cytosines (DMCs) were located to transposable elements (TEs). These salt-induced DMCs were mainly hypermethylated and accession-specific. TEs annotated to have DMCs (DMC-TEs) across accessions were found mostly belonged to the superfamily ofGypsy, a type II transposon, indicating a convergent DMC dynamic on TEs across different genetic backgrounds. Moreover, 8.0% of salt-induced DMCs were located in gene bodies and their proximal regulatory regions. These DMCs were also accession-specific, and genes annotated to have DMCs (DMC-genes) appeared to be more accession-specific than DMC-TEs. Intriguingly, both accession-specific DMC-genes and DMC-genes shared by multiple accessions were enriched in similar functions, including methylation, gene silencing, chemical homeostasis, polysaccharide catabolic process, and pathways relating to shifts between vegetative growth and reproduction. These results indicate that, across different genetic backgrounds, methylation changes may have convergent functions in post-transcriptional, physiological, and phenotypic modulation under salt stress. These convergent methylation dynamics across accession may be autonomous from genetic variation or due to convergent genetic changes, which requires further exploration. Our study provides a more comprehensive picture of genome-wide methylation dynamics under salt stress, and highlights the importance of exploring stress response mechanisms from diverse genetic backgrounds.Copyright © 2022 Lin, Zhou, Yao, Li and Zhang."
"35309147","Genome-Wide Analysis for the Regulation of Gene Alternative Splicing by DNA Methylation Level in Glioma and its Prognostic Implications.","Front Genet","Glioma is a primary high malignant intracranial tumor with poorly understood molecular mechanisms. Previous studies found that both DNA methylation modification and gene alternative splicing (AS) play a key role in tumorigenesis of glioma, and there is an obvious regulatory relationship between them. However, to date, no comprehensive study has been performed to analyze the influence of DNA methylation level on gene AS in glioma on a genome-wide scale. Here, we performed this study by integrating DNA methylation, gene expression, AS, disease risk methylation at position, and clinical data from 537 low-grade glioma (LGG) and glioblastoma (GBM) individuals. We first conducted a differential analysis of AS events and DNA methylation positions between LGG and GBM subjects, respectively. Then, we evaluated the influence of differential methylation positions on differential AS events. Further, Fisher's exact test was used to verify our findings and identify potential key genes in glioma. Finally, we performed a series of analyses to investigate influence of these genes on the clinical prognosis of glioma. In total, we identified 130 glioma-related genes whose AS significantly affected by DNA methylation level. Eleven of them play an important role in glioma prognosis. In short, these results will help to better understand the pathogenesis of glioma.Copyright © 2022 Yang, He, Wang, Huang, Tang, He, Chen and Han."
"35308237","DNA Methylation Aberrant in Atherosclerosis.","Front Pharmacol","Atherosclerosis (AS) is a pathological process involving lipid oxidation, immune system activation, and endothelial dysfunction. The activated immune system could lead to inflammation and oxidative stress. Risk factors like aging and hyperhomocysteinemia also promote the progression of AS. Epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation, histone modification, and non-coding RNA, are involved in the modulation of genes between the environment and AS formation. DNA methylation is one of the most important epigenetic mechanisms in the pathogenesis of AS. However, the relationship between the progression of AS and DNA methylation is not completely understood. This review will discuss the abnormal changes of DNA methylation in AS, including genome-wide hypermethylation dominating in AS with an increase of age, hypermethylation links with methyl supply and generating hyperhomocysteinemia, and the influence of oxidative stress with the demethylation process by interfering with the hydroxyl-methylation of TET proteins. The review will also summarize the current status of epigenetic treatment, which may provide new direction and potential therapeutic targets for AS.Copyright © 2022 Dai, Chen and Xu."

A potential mechanism of toxicity for PFASs is via epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation. Previous studies have evaluated associations between PFAS exposure and DNA methylation among newborns and adults. However, no study has evaluated how PFASs influence DNA methylation among children of school age. In this exploratory study with school-age children exposed to PFASs through drinking water highly contaminated from firefighting foams, we aimed to investigate whether exposure to PFASs was associated with alteration in DNA methylation and epigenetic age acceleration. Sixty-three children aged 7-11 years from the Ronneby Biomarker Cohort (Sweden) were included. The children were either controls with only background exposure (n = 32; perfluorooctane sulfonic acid: median 2.8 and range 1-5 ng/ml) or those exposed to very high levels of PFASs (n = 31; perfluorooctane sulfonic acid: median 295 and range 190-464 ng/ml). These two groups were matched on sex, age, and body mass index. Genome-wide methylation of whole-blood DNA was analyzed using the Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip kit. Epigenetic age acceleration was derived from the DNA methylation data. Twelve differentially methylated positions and seven differentially methylated regions were found when comparing the high-exposure group to the control group. There were no differences in epigenetic age acceleration between these two groups (P = 0.66). We found that PFAS exposure was associated with DNA methylation at specific genomic positions and regions in children at school age, which may indicate a possible mechanism for linking PFAS exposure to health effects.© The Author(s) 2022.

"35307512","DNA methylation-based diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive biomarkers in colorectal cancer.","Biochim Biophys Acta Rev Cancer","DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism regulating gene expression. Changes in DNA methylation were suggested to be useful biomarkers for diagnosis, and for the determination of prognosis and treatment response. Here, we provide an overview of methylation-based biomarkers in colorectal cancer. First, we start with the two methylation-based diagnostic biomarkers already approved for colorectal cancer, SEPT9 and the combination of NDRG4 and BMP3. Then, we provide a list-based overview of new biomarker candidates depending on the sample source including plasma, stool, urine, and surgically removed tumor tissues. The most often identified markers like SDC2, VIM, APC, MGMT, SFRP1, SFRP2, and NDRG4 have distinct functions previously linked to tumor progression. Although numerous studies have identified tumor-specific methylation changes, most of these alterations were observed in a single study only. The lack of validation in independent samples means low reproducibility and is a major limitation. The genome-wide determination of methylation status (methylome) can provide data to solve these issues. In the third section of the review, methylome studies focusing on different aspects related to CRC, including precancerous lesions, CRC-specific changes, molecular subtypes, aging, and chemotherapy response are summarized. Notably, techniques simultaneously analyzing a large set of regions can also uncover epigenetic regulation of genes which have not yet been associated with tumorigenesis previously. A remaining constraint of studies published to date is the low patient number utilized in these preventing the identification of clinically valuable biomarker candidates. Either future large-scale studies or the integration of already available methylome-level data will be necessary to uncover biomarkers sufficiently robust for clinical application.Copyright © 2021.

However, the biological function of this complex in rice (Oryza sativa) is unclear. Here, we report the identification of two members of the rice COMPASS-like complex, OsASHL1 and OsASHL2, and the characterization of their functions in growth and development. The osashl1 osashl2 double mutant shows a dwarf and late-flowering phenotype. Lower expression of Ehd1, OsVIL4, and OsMADS51 in the osashl1 osashl2 double mutant background accompanies a delayed vegetative growth phase and photoperiod-sensitive phase compared to that in wild type. Notably, there is less H3K4 mono-, di- and trimethylation genome-wide in the double mutant, in particular less H3K4 trimethylation at OsVIL4. Consistent with this result, knockout of OsVIL4 gives rise to a late-flowering phenotype similar to that of the osashl1 osashl2 double mutant, suggesting that OsVIL4 is a target of the COMPASS-like complex. In addition, the expression of key genes in brassinosteroid and gibberellic acid metabolism is altered in the osashl1 osashl2 double mutant, suggesting that the COMPASS-like complex regulates plant growth and development by modulating the levels of these two phytohormones. In summary, we demonstrate that OsASHL1 and OsASHL2 are important for floral transition and plant development.Copyright © 2022. Published by Elsevier Ltd."

We then attempted to replicate these published associations in the Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development (CHILD) and the South Asian birth cohort (START) cord blood epigenome-wide data.We screened 68 full-text articles and identified a total of 17 cord blood epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) of the traits of interest. Out of the 290 CpG sites reported, 19 were identified in more than one study; all of them associated with maternal smoking. In CHILD and START EWAS, thousands of sites associated with gestational age were identified and maintained significance after correction for multiple testing. In CHILD, there was differential methylation observed for 8 of the published maternal smoking sites. No other traits tested (i.e., folate levels, gestational diabetes, birthweight) replicated in the CHILD or START cohorts.Maternal smoking during pregnancy and gestational age are strongly associated with differential methylation in offspring cord blood, as assessed in the EWAS literature and our birth cohorts. There are a limited number of reported methylation sites associated in more than two independent studies related to pregnancy. Additional large studies of diverse populations with fine phenotyping are needed to produce robust epigenome-wide data in order to further elucidate the effect of intrauterine exposures on the infants' methylome.© 2022.

However, the CD group overlaps with the ITB group in DNA methylation, suggesting a stable epigenetic profile between the two diseases. The pathway enrichment analysis showed the alternation in inflammation-related pathway, immune system, and signal transduction. Focused on the DMPs located in the promoter region, further analysis indicated hypermethylation of cg03122532 (5'UTR of KCNJ15) could be a potential CD-specific biomarker.We identified specific differential methylation loci related to CD and ITB in blood DNA.

"35303396","Pairing structural reconstruction with catalytic competence to evaluate the mechanisms of key enzymes in the folate-mediated one-carbon pathway.","FEBS J","Mammalian metabolism comprises a series of interlinking pathways that include two major cycles: the folate and methionine cycles. The folate-mediated metabolic cycle uses several oxidation states of tetrahydrofolate to carry activated one-carbon units to be readily used and interconverted within the cell, which are required for nucleotide synthesis, methylation and metabolism, particularly for proliferation of cancer cells. Based on the latest progress in genome-wide CRISPR loss-of-function viability screening of 789 cell lines, we focus on the most cancer dependent enzymes in this pathway, especially those that are hyperactivated in cancer, to provide new insight into the chemical basis for cancer drug development. Since the complete 3D structure of several of these enzymes in their active form are not available, we used homology modeling integrated with the interpretation of the reaction mechanism, and have reconstructed the most likely scenario for the reactions to take place paired with their catalytic cycle that provides a testable framework for this pathway.This article is protected by copyright.

Epitranscriptomic mRNA biology involves RNA methyltransferases (so called ""writers""), RNA demethylases (""erasers""), and RNA-binding proteins (""readers"") that interact with methylation sites to determine the functional outcome of the modification. In this review, we discuss the role of a specific RNA demethylase encoded by the fat mass and obesity associated gene (FTO) in cancer. FTO initially became known as the strongest genetic link for human obesity. Only in 2010, 16 years after its discovery, was its enzymatic function as a demethylase clarified, and only recently has its role in the development of cancer been revealed. FTO functions are challenging to study and interpret because of its genome-wide effects on transcript turnover and translation. We review the discovery of FTO and its enzymatic function, the tumor-promoting and suppressive roles of FTO in selected cancer types, and its potential as a therapeutic target."

We aimed to identify autosomal cis eQTMs in children's blood, using data from 832 children of the Human Early Life Exposome (HELIX) project.Blood DNA methylation and gene expression were measured with the Illumina 450K and the Affymetrix HTA v2 arrays, respectively. The relationship between methylation levels and expression of nearby genes (1 Mb window centered at the transcription start site, TSS) was assessed by fitting 13.6 M linear regressions adjusting for sex, age, cohort, and blood cell composition.We identified 39,749 blood autosomal cis eQTMs, representing 21,966 unique CpGs (eCpGs, 5.7% of total CpGs) and 8,886 unique transcript clusters (eGenes, 15.3% of total transcript clusters, equivalent to genes). In 87.9% of these cis eQTMs, the eCpG was located at <250 kb from eGene's TSS; and 58.8% of all eQTMs showed an inverse relationship between the methylation and expression levels. Only around half of the autosomal cis-eQTMs eGenes could be captured through annotation of the eCpG to the closest gene. eCpGs had less measurement error and were enriched for active blood regulatory regions and for CpGs reported to be associated with environmental exposures or phenotypic traits. In 40.4% of the eQTMs, the CpG and the eGene were both associated with at least one genetic variant. The overlap of autosomal cis eQTMs in children's blood with those described in adults was small (13.8%), and age-shared cis eQTMs tended to be proximal to the TSS and enriched for genetic variants.This catalogue of autosomal cis eQTMs in children's blood can help the biological interpretation of EWAS findings and is publicly available at https://helixomics.isglobal.org/ and at Dryad (doi:10.5061/dryad.fxpnvx0t0).The study has received funding from the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-206) under grant agreement no 308333 (HELIX project); the H2020-EU.3.1.2. - Preventing Disease Programme under grant agreement no 874583 (ATHLETE project); from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement no 733206 (LIFECYCLE project), and from the European Joint Programming Initiative ""A Healthy Diet for a Healthy Life"" (JPI HDHL and Instituto de Salud Carlos III) under the grant agreement no AC18/00006 (NutriPROGRAM project).

"35299870","Genome-wide alteration of histone methylation profiles associated with cognitive changes in response to developmental arsenic exposure in mice.","Toxicol Rep","Inorganic arsenic is a xenobiotic entering the body primarily through contaminated drinking water and food. There are defined mechanisms that describe arsenic's association with increased cancer incidence, however mechanisms explaining arsenic exposure and neurodevelopmental or aging disorders are poorly defined. In recent years, arsenic effects on epigenome have become a particular focus. We hypothesize that human relevant arsenic exposure during particular developmental windows, or long-term exposure later in life induce pathophysiological neural changes through epigenomic alterations, in particular histone methylation profile, manifesting as cognitive decline. C57BL/6 wild-type mice were continually exposed to sodium arsenite (100 µg/L) in drinking water prior to mating through weaning of the experimental progeny. A second cohort of aged APP/PS mice were chronically exposed to the same level of arsenic. Cognitive testing, histological examination of brains and genome-wide methylation levels of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 examined after ChIP-seq were used to determine the effects of arsenic exposure. Developmental arsenic exposure caused significantly diminished cognition in wild-type mice. The analysis of ChIP-seq data and experiments with mouse embryonic stem cells demonstrated that epigenetic changes induced by arsenic exposure translated into gene expression alterations associated with neuronal development and neurological disease. Increased hippocampal amyloid plaques levels of APP/PS mice and cognitive decline provided evidence that arsenic exposure aggravated an existing Alzheimer's disease-like phenotype. We show developmental arsenic exposure significantly impacts histone modifications in brain which remain present into adulthood and provide a potential mechanism by which developmental arsenic exposure influences cognitive functions. We also show that human relevant, chronic arsenic exposure has deleterious effects on adult APP/PS mice and exacerbates existing Alzheimer's disease-like symptoms. The results demonstrate how developmental arsenic exposure impacts the brain epigenome, leading to altered gene expression later in life.© 2022 The Authors."
"35297449","Single-molecule analysis of genome-wide DNA methylation by fiber FISH coupled with atomic force microscopy.","Analyst","DNA methylation (mainly at 5-methylcytosine, 5mC) plays an essential role in embryonic development and cellular biology. Alterations in DNA methylation are associated with disease development, especially hematologic malignancies. To investigate the potential of 5mC for diagnosis and treatment, accurate determination of 5mC is essential. Standard bisulfite sequencing-based methodologies or various optical/electrochemical biosensors for identifying 5mC have limitations, such as high cost, severe DNA degradation, over-estimation of the true 5mC level, being able to only display the average 5mC level,etc. Here we propose a single-molecule strategy for the direct identification of whole-genome 5mC by the combination of DNA fiber-based fluorescencein situhybridization (DNA fiber FISH) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Using extended DNA fibers and anti-5mC antibody for the detection of 5mC, it is possible to map the physical location of 5mC within the genome DNA. Together with AFM, this method can present the morphology of anti-5mC-DNA complexes and detailed spacing distribution of two neighboring 5mC sites on a single DNA molecule. Furthermore, this approach can be used for reporting other epigenetic modifications, not limited to 5mC or one single epigenetic modification. It can be anticipated to contribute to the development of clinical diagnosis of epigenetic-related diseases."
"35296809","Targeting histone demethylase LSD1 for treatment of deficits in autism mouse models.","Mol Psychiatry","Large-scale genetic studies have revealed that the most prominent genes disrupted in autism are chromatin regulators mediating histone methylation/demethylation, suggesting the central role of epigenetic dysfunction in this disorder. Here, we show that histone lysine 4 dimethylation (H3K4me2), a histone mark linked to gene activation, is significantly decreased in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of autistic human patients and mutant mice with the deficiency of top-ranking autism risk factor Shank3 or Cul3. A brief treatment of the autism models with highly potent and selective inhibitors of the H3K4me2 demethylase LSD1 (KDM1A) leads to the robust rescue of core symptoms of autism, including social deficits and repetitive behaviors. Concomitantly, LSD1 inhibition restores NMDA receptor function in PFC and AMPA receptor-mediated currents in striatum of Shank3-deficient mice. Genome-wide RNAseq and ChIPseq reveal that treatment of Shank3-deficient mice with the LSD1 inhibitor restores the expression and H3K4me2 occupancy of downregulated genes enriched in synaptic signaling and developmental processes. The immediate early gene tightly linked to neuronal plasticity, Egr1, is on the top list of rescued genes. The diminished transcription of Egr1 is recapitulated in PFC of autistic human patients. Overexpression of Egr1 in PFC of Shank3-deficient mice ameliorates social preference deficits. These results have for the first time revealed an important role of H3K4me2 abnormality in ASD pathophysiology, and the therapeutic potential of targeting H3K4me2 demethylase LSD1 or the downstream molecule Egr1 for ASD.© 2022.

"35295148","Effects of Prenatal Exposure to Titanium Dioxide Nanoparticles on DNA Methylation and Gene Expression Profile in the Mouse Brain.","Front Toxicol","Background and Objectives:Titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2-NP) are important materials used in commercial practice. Reportedly, TiO2-NP exposure during pregnancy can affect the development of the central nervous system in mouse offspring; however, the underlying mechanism remains unknown. In the present study, we investigated the impact of prenatal TiO2-NP exposure on global DNA methylation and mRNA expression patterns in the brains of neonatal mice.Materials and Methods:Pregnant C57BL/6J mice were intratracheally administered a TiO2-NP suspension (100 μg/mouse) on gestational day 10.5, and brains were collected from male and female offspring at day 1 postpartum. After extraction of methylated DNA by immunoprecipitation, the DNA methylation profile was analyzed using a mouse CpG island microarray. Total RNA was obtained, and mRNA expression profiles were comprehensively assessed using microarray analysis.Results:Among genes in the CpG island microarray, DNA methylation was increased in 614 and 2,924 genes and decreased in 6,220 and 6,477 genes in male and female offspring, respectively. Combined with mRNA microarray analysis, 88 and 89 genes were upregulated (≥1.5-fold) accompanied by demethylation of CpG islands, whereas 13 and 33 genes were downregulated (≤0.67-fold) accompanied by methylation of CpG islands in male and female offspring mice, respectively. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) revealed that these genes were enriched in gene ontology terms related to the regulation of transcription factors, cell proliferation, and organism development. Additionally, MeSH terms related to stem cells and morphogenesis were enriched.Conclusion:Prenatal TiO2-NP exposure induced genome-wide alterations in DNA methylation and mRNA expression in the brains of male and female offspring. Based on GSEA findings, it can be speculated that prenatal TiO2-NP exposure causes adverse effects on brain functions by altering the DNA methylation state of the fetal brain, especially neural stem cells, resulting in the subsequent abnormal regulation of transcription factors that modulate development and differentiation.Copyright © 2021 Tachibana, Kawazoe, Onoda, Umezawa and Takeda."

The TAVAREC trial was a randomized, open-label phase 2 trial assessing the benefit of the addition of the angiogenesis inhibitor bevacizumab to treatment with temozolomide in patients with a first enhancing recurrence of WHO grade 2 or 3 glioma without 1p/19q codeletion. We evaluated the prognostic significance of genome wide DNA methylation profiles and copy number variations on the TAVAREC trial samples.IDH-mutation status was determined via Sanger sequencing and immunohistochemistry. DNA methylation analysis was performed using the MethylationEPIC BeadChip (Illumina) from which 1p/19q codeletion, MGMT promoter methylation (MGMT-STP27) and homozygous deletion of CDKN2A/B were determined. DNA-methylation classes were determined according to classifiers developed in Heidelberg and TCGA (""Heidelberg"" and ""TCGA"" classifier respectively).DNA methylation profiles of 122 samples were successfully determined. As expected, most samples were IDH-mutant (89/122) and MGMT promotor methylated (89/122). Methylation classes were prognostic for time to progression. However, Heidelberg methylation classes determined at time of diagnosis were no longer prognostic following enhancing recurrence of the tumor. In contrast, TCGA methylation classes of primary samples remained prognostic also following enhancing recurrence. Homozygous deletions in CDKN2A/B were found in 10/87 IDH-mutated samples and were prognostically unfavorable at recurrence.DNA methylome Heidelberg classification at time of diagnosis is no longer of prognostic value at the time of enhancing recurrence. CDKN2A/B deletion status was predictive of survival from progression of IDH-mutated tumors."

The long noncoding RNA HOTAIR (HOX Transcript Antisense Intergenic RNA) is an important epigenetic regulator with fat depot-specific expression. Its functional roles and epigenetic regulation in abdominal adipogenesis remain uncertain.We collected different fat depots from healthy, severely obese, and uraemic subjects to measure fat-depot specific gene expression and quantify regional adiposity via dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). HOTAIR was overexpressed to evaluate its functional roles. Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS), RNA-sequencing, real-time qPCR and RNA/chromatin immunoprecipitation were performed to analyse HOTAIR-mediated epigenetic regulation.A negative correlation between adipose tissue HOTAIR expression (arm or abdominal subcutaneous fat depots) and regional adiposity under the status of severe obesity or uraemia was observed. HOTAIR overexpression using human immortalized abdominal preadipocytes further revealed its anti-adipogenic effects. Integrative analysis of genome-wide DNA methylation by reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) and gene expression was performed. Overall, the differentially methylated genes were functionally enriched for nervous system development, suggesting that HOTAIR may be epigenetically associated with cell lineage commitment. We specifically identified HOTAIR-mediated genes showing strong changes in both DNA methylation and gene expression during abdominal adipogenesis. We found that two HOTAIR-repressed genes, SLITRK4 and PITPNC1, present an obesity-driven fat-depot specific expression pattern that is positively correlated with the central body fat distribution.Our study indicated that HOTAIR is a key regulator of abdominal adipogenesis via intricate DNA methylation and is likely to be associated with the transcriptional regulation of genes involved in nervous system development and lipid metabolism, such as SLITRK4 and PITPNC1.Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).

Here, we knock out all five known DNA methyltransferases in Arabidopsis, generating DNA methylation-free plants. This quintuple mutant exhibits a suite of developmental defects, unequivocally demonstrating that DNA methylation is essential for multiple aspects of plant development. We show that CG methylation and non-CG methylation are required for a plethora of biological processes, including pavement cell shape, endoreduplication, cell death, flowering, trichome morphology, vasculature and meristem development, and root cell fate determination. Moreover, we find that DNA methylation has a strong dose-dependent effect on gene expression and repression of transposable elements. Taken together, our results demonstrate that DNA methylation is dispensable for Arabidopsis survival but essential for the proper regulation of multiple biological processes.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35288370","Active DNA demethylation regulates MAMP-triggered immune priming in Arabidopsis.","J Genet Genomics","Plants recognize microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) to activate immune responses and defense priming to defend against pathogen infections. Transcriptional regulation of gene expression is crucial for plant immunity and is mediated by multiple factors, including DNA methylation. However, it remains unknown whether and how DNA demethylation contributes to immune responses in MAMP-triggered immunity. Here, we showed active DNA demethylation is required for MAMP-triggered immunity to bacterial pathogens. The rdd-2 triple mutant carrying mutations in ROS1, DML2, and DML3 that encode DNA glycosylases, which are key DNA demethylation enzymes, exhibited compromised immune responses triggered by the MAMPs flg22 and elf18. Genome-wide methylome analysis revealed flg22 induced rapid and specific DNA demethylation in an RDD-dependent manner. The expression levels of salicylic acid signaling-related and phytoalexin biosynthesis-related genes were tightly associated with the flg22-induced promoter demethylation. The compromised accumulation of priming compounds and antimicrobial metabolites ultimately led to a defense priming defect in the rdd-2 mutant. Our results revealed the critical role of active DNA demethylation in the MAMP-triggered immune response and provide novel insight into the molecular mechanism of flg22-modulated DNA demethylation.Copyright © 2022 Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Genetics Society of China.

To assess methylation profiles in the main COPD target organ, we performed an epigenome-wide association study on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells. Bronchoscopies were performed in 18 COPD subjects and 15 controls (ex- and current smokers). DNA methylation was measured with Illumina MethylationEPIC BeadChip covering >850,000 CpGs. Differentially methylated positions (DMPs) were examined for 1) enrichment in pathways and functional gene relationships using Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes and Gene Ontology; 2) accelerated aging using Horvath's epigenetic clock; 3) correlation with gene expression; and 4) co-localization with genetic variation. We found 1,155 Bonferroni significant (P < 6.74 × 10-8) DMPs associated with COPD, many with large effect sizes. Functional analysis identified biologically plausible pathways and gene relationships, including enrichment for transcription factor activity. Strong correlation was found between COPD and chronological age, but not with accelerated epigenetic aging. For 79 unique DMPs, DNA methylation correlated significantly with gene expression in BAL cells. Thirty-nine percent of DMPs were co-localized with COPD-associated SNPs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first EWAS of COPD on BAL cells, and our analyses revealed many differential methylation sites. Integration with mRNA data showed a strong functional readout for relevant genes, identifying sites where DNA methylation might directly impact expression. Almost half of DMPs were co-located with SNPs identified in previous GWAS of COPD, suggesting joint genetic and epigenetic pathways related to disease."
"35281115","How to Translate DNA Methylation Biomarkers Into Clinical Practice.","Front Cell Dev Biol","Recent advances in sequencing technologies provide unprecedented opportunities for epigenetic biomarker development. Particularly the DNA methylation pattern-which is modified at specific sites in the genome during cellular differentiation, aging, and disease-holds high hopes for a wide variety of diagnostic applications. While many epigenetic biomarkers have been described, only very few of them have so far been successfully translated into clinical practice and almost exclusively in the field of oncology. This discrepancy might be attributed to the different demands of either publishing a new finding or establishing a standardized and approved diagnostic procedure. This is exemplified for epigenetic leukocyte counts and epigenetic age-predictions. To ease later clinical translation, the following hallmarks should already be taken into consideration when designing epigenetic biomarkers: 1) Identification of best genomic regions, 2) pre-analytical processing, 3) accuracy of DNA methylation measurements, 4) identification of confounding parameters, 5) accreditation as diagnostic procedure, 6) standardized data analysis, 7) turnaround time, and 8) costs and customer requirements. While the initial selection of relevant genomic regions is usually performed on genome wide DNA methylation profiles, it might be advantageous to subsequently establish targeted assays that focus on specific genomic regions. Development of an epigenetic biomarker for clinical application is a long and cumbersome process that is only initiated with the identification of an epigenetic signature.Copyright © 2022 Wagner."

Previous epigenetic studies have indicated that alterations in host DNA methylation may modify the inflammatory response to bacterial infection. However, to date, genome-wide analysis of the DNA methylome during meningitis caused byG. parasuisinfection is still lacking. In this study, we employed an unbiased approach using deep sequencing to profile the DNA methylome and transcriptome fromG. parasuisinfected porcine brain (cerebrum) and integrated the data to identify key differential methylation regions/sites involved in the regulation of the inflammatory response. Results showed that DNA methylation patterns and gene expression profiles from porcine brain were changed afterG. parasuisinfection. The majority of the altered DNA methylation regions were found in the intergenic regions and introns and not associated with CpG islands, with only a low percentage occurring at promoter or exon regions. Integrated analysis of the DNA methylome and transcriptome identified a number of inversely and positively correlated genes between DNA methylation and gene expression, following the criteria of |log2FC| > 0.5, |diffMethy| > 0.1, andP< 0.05. Differential expression and methylation of two significant genes, semaphoring 4D (SEMA4D) and von Willebrand factor A domain containing 1 (VWA1), were validated by qRT-PCR and bisulfite sequencing. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses demonstrated that DNA methylation inversely correlated genes inG. parasuisinfected porcine brains were mainly involved with cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), bacterial invasion of epithelial cells, RIG-1-like receptor signaling pathways, and hematopoietic cell lineage signaling pathways. In addition, a protein-protein interaction network of differentially methylated genes found potential candidate molecular interactions relevant to the pathology ofG. parasuisinfection. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to integrate the DNA methylome and transcriptome data fromG. parasuisinfected porcine brains. Our findings will help understanding the contribution of genome-wide DNA methylation to the pathogenesis of meningitis in pigs and developing epigenetic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for the treatment ofG. parasuisinduced meningitis.Copyright © 2022 Guo, Cheng, Fu, Liu, Zhang, Qiu and Chen."
"35278634","Methyl-CpG binding proteins (MBD) family evolution and conservation in plants.","Gene","DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism that acts on cytosine residues. The methyl-CpG-binding domain proteins (MBD) are involved in the recognition of methyl-cytosines by activating a signaling cascade that induces the formation of heterochromatin or euchromatin, thereby regulating gene expression. In this study, we analyzed the evolution and conservation of MBD proteins in plants. First, we performed a genome-wide identification and analysis of the MBD family in common bean and soybean, since they have experienced one and two whole-genome duplication events, respectively. We found one pair of MBD paralogs in soybean (GmMBD2) has subfunctionalized after their recent divergence, which was corroborated with their expression profile. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that classes of MBD proteins clustered with human MBD. Interestingly, the MBD9 may have emerged after the hexaploidization event in eudicots. We found that plants and humans share a great similarity in MBDs' binding affinity in the mCpG context. MBD2 and MBD4 from different plant species have the conserved four amino acid residues -Arg (R), Asp (D), Tyr (Y) and Arg (R)- reported to be responsible for MBD-binding in the mCpG. However, MBD8, MBD9, MBD10, and MBD11 underwent substitutions in these residues, suggesting the non-interaction in the mCpG context, but a heterochromatin association as MBD5 and MBD6 from human. This study represents the first genome-wide analysis of the MBD gene family in eurosids I - soybean and common bean.

As single-cell methylomics is not scalable to large cohorts of individuals, cost-effective computational solutions are needed, yet current methods are limited to tissues such as blood. Here we leverage the high-resolution nature of tissue-specific single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets to construct a DNA methylation atlas defined for 13 solid tissue types and 40 cell types. We comprehensively validate this atlas in independent bulk and single-nucleus DNA methylation datasets. We demonstrate that it correctly predicts the cell of origin of diverse cancer types and discovers new prognostic associations in olfactory neuroblastoma and stage 2 melanoma. In brain, the atlas predicts a neuronal origin for schizophrenia, with neuron-specific differential DNA methylation enriched for corresponding genome-wide association study risk loci. In summary, the DNA methylation atlas enables the decomposition of 13 different human tissue types at a high cellular resolution, paving the way for an improved interpretation of epigenetic data.© 2022.

Recently, DNA methylation alterations were found in the blood of ICU patients, partially explaining long-term developmental impairment of critically ill children. As illness-induced aberrant DNA methylation theoretically could also be involved in long-term weakness, we investigated whether the DNA methylation signature in muscle of adult critically ill patients differs from that in muscle of healthy controls.Genome-wide methylation was determined (Infinium® HumanMethylationEPIC BeadChips) in DNA extracted from skeletal muscle biopsies that had been collected on Day 8 ± 1 in ICU from 172 EPaNIC-trial patients [66% male sex, median age 62.7 years, median body mass index (BMI) 25.9 kg/m2] and 20 matched healthy controls (70% male sex, median age 58.0 years, median BMI 24.4 kg/m2). Methylation status of individual cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites of patients and controls was compared with F-tests, using the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate to correct for multiple comparisons. Differential methylation of DNA regions was assessed with bump hunting, with 1000 permutations assessing uncertainty, expressed as family-wise error rate. Gene expression was investigated for 10 representative affected genes.In DNA from ICU patients, 565 CpG sites, associated with 400 unique genes, were differentially methylated as compared with controls (average difference 3.2 ± 0.1% ranging up to 16.9%, P < 0.00005). Many of the associated genes appeared highly relevant for muscle structure and function/weakness, including genes involved in myogenesis, muscle regeneration, nerve/muscle membrane excitability, muscle denervation/re-innervation, axon guidance/myelination/degeneration/regeneration, synapse function, ion channelling with especially calcium signalling, metabolism (glucose, protein, and fat), insulin signalling, neuroendocrine hormone regulation, mitochondrial function, autophagy, apoptosis, oxidative stress, Wnt signalling, transcription regulation, muscle fat infiltration during regeneration, and fibrosis. In patients as compared with controls, we also identified two hypomethylated regions, spanning 18 and 3 CpG sites in the promoters of the HIC1 and NADK2 genes, respectively (average differences 5.8 ± 0.01% and 12.1 ± 0.04%, family-wise error rate <0.05). HIC1 and NADK2 play important roles in muscle regeneration and postsynaptic acetylcholine receptors and in mitochondrial processes, respectively. Nine of 10 investigated genes containing DNA methylation alterations were differentially expressed in patients as compared with controls (P ≤ 0.03).Critically ill patients present with a different DNA methylation signature in skeletal muscle as compared with healthy controls, which in theory could provide a biological basis for long-term persistence of weakness in ICU survivors.ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00512122, registered on 31 July 2007.© 2022 The Authors.

The aim of this report was to describe the genomic data included in CLSA.A total of 26 622 individuals from the CLSA Comprehensive cohort of men and women aged 45-85 recruited between 2010 and 2015 underwent genome-wide genotyping of DNA samples collected from blood. Comprehensive quality control metrics were measured for genetic markers and samples, respectively. The genotypes were imputed to the TOPMed reference panel. Sex chromosome abnormalities were identified by copy number profiling. Classical human leukocyte antigen gene haplotypes were imputed at two-field (four-digit).Of the 26 622 genotyped participants, 24 655 (92.6%) were identified as having European ancestry. These genomic data were linked to physical, lifestyle, medical, economic, environmental and psychosocial factors collected longitudinally in CLSA. The combined analysis, including CLSA genomic data, uncovered over 100 novel loci associated with key parameters to define glaucoma. The CLSA genomic dataset validated the contribution of a polygenic risk score to screen individuals with high fracture risk. It is also a valuable resource to directly identify common genetic variations associated with conditions related to complex traits. Taking advantage of the comprehensive interview and physical information collected in CLSA, this genomic dataset has been linked to psychosocial factors to investigate both the independent and interactive effects on cardiovascular disease.The CLSA overall is ongoing. Follow-up data will continue to be collected from participants in the current genomic subcohort, including the DNA methylation and metabolomic data.

"35301312","Oncogenic gene expression and epigenetic remodeling of cis-regulatory elements in ASXL1-mutant chronic myelomonocytic leukemia.","Nat Commun","Myeloid neoplasms are clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorders driven by the sequential acquisition of recurrent genetic lesions. Truncating mutations in the chromatin remodeler ASXL1 (ASXL1MT) are associated with a high-risk disease phenotype with increased proliferation, epigenetic therapeutic resistance, and poor survival outcomes. We performed a multi-omics interrogation to define gene expression and chromatin remodeling associated with ASXL1MTin chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). ASXL1MTare associated with a loss of repressive histone methylation and increase in permissive histone methylation and acetylation in promoter regions. ASXL1MTare further associated with de novo accessibility of distal enhancers binding ETS transcription factors, targeting important leukemogenic driver genes. Chromatin remodeling of promoters and enhancers is strongly associated with gene expression and heterogenous among overexpressed genes. These results provide a comprehensive map of the transcriptome and chromatin landscape of ASXL1MTCMML, forming an important framework for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting oncogenic cis interactions.© 2022.

"35294436","Methylation pattern of polymorphically imprinted nc886 is not conserved across mammalia.","PLoS One","In humans, the nc886 locus is a polymorphically imprinted metastable epiallele. Periconceptional conditions have an effect on the methylation status of nc886, and further, this methylation status is associated with health outcomes in later life, in line with the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) hypothesis. Animal models would offer opportunities to study the associations between periconceptional conditions, nc886 methylation status and metabolic phenotypes further. Thus, we set out to investigate the methylation pattern of the nc886 locus in non-human mammals.We obtained DNA methylation data from the data repository GEO for mammals, whose nc886 gene included all three major parts of nc886 and had sequency similarity of over 80% with the human nc886. Our final sample set consisted of DNA methylation data from humans, chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, orangutangs, baboons, macaques, vervets, marmosets and guinea pigs.In human data sets the methylation pattern of nc886 locus followed the expected bimodal distribution, indicative of polymorphic imprinting. In great apes, we identified a unimodal DNA methylation pattern with 50% methylation level in all individuals and in all subspecies. In Old World monkeys, the between individual variation was greater and methylation on average was close to 60%. In guinea pigs the region around the nc886 homologue was non-methylated. Results obtained from the sequence comparison of the CTCF binding sites flanking the nc886 gene support the results on the DNA methylation data.Our results indicate that unlike in humans, nc886 is not a polymorphically imprinted metastable epiallele in non-human primates or in guinea pigs, thus implying that animal models are not applicable for nc886 research. The obtained data suggests that the nc886 region may be classically imprinted in great apes, and potentially also in Old World monkeys, but not in guinea pigs."
"35274198","Applying Mendelian randomization to appraise causality in relationships between nutrition and cancer.","Cancer Causes Control","Dietary factors are assumed to play an important role in cancer risk, apparent in consensus recommendations for cancer prevention that promote nutritional changes. However, the evidence in this field has been generated predominantly through observational studies, which may result in biased effect estimates because of confounding, exposure misclassification, and reverse causality. With major geographical differences and rapid changes in cancer incidence over time, it is crucial to establish which of the observational associations reflect causality and to identify novel risk factors as these may be modified to prevent the onset of cancer and reduce its progression. Mendelian randomization (MR) uses the special properties of germline genetic variation to strengthen causal inference regarding potentially modifiable exposures and disease risk. MR can be implemented through instrumental variable (IV) analysis and, when robustly performed, is generally less prone to confounding, reverse causation and measurement error than conventional observational methods and has different sources of bias (discussed in detail below). It is increasingly used to facilitate causal inference in epidemiology and provides an opportunity to explore the effects of nutritional exposures on cancer incidence and progression in a cost-effective and timely manner. Here, we introduce the concept of MR and discuss its current application in understanding the impact of nutritional factors (e.g., any measure of diet and nutritional intake, circulating biomarkers, patterns, preference or behaviour) on cancer aetiology and, thus, opportunities for MR to contribute to the development of nutritional recommendations and policies for cancer prevention. We provide applied examples of MR studies examining the role of nutritional factors in cancer to illustrate how this method can be used to help prioritise or deprioritise the evaluation of specific nutritional factors as intervention targets in randomised controlled trials. We describe possible biases when using MR, and methodological developments aimed at investigating and potentially overcoming these biases when present. Lastly, we consider the use of MR in identifying causally relevant nutritional risk factors for various cancers in different regions across the world, given notable geographical differences in some cancers. We also discuss how MR results could be translated into further research and policy. We conclude that findings from MR studies, which corroborate those from other well-conducted studies with different and orthogonal biases, are poised to substantially improve our understanding of nutritional influences on cancer. For such corroboration, there is a requirement for an interdisciplinary and collaborative approach to investigate risk factors for cancer incidence and progression.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35269551","The Dynamic Regulation of G-Quadruplex DNA Structures by Cytosine Methylation.","Int J Mol Sci","It is well known that certain non B-DNA structures, including G-quadruplexes, are key elements that can regulate gene expression. Here, we explore the theory that DNA modifications, such as methylation of cytosine, could act as a dynamic switch by promoting or alleviating the structural formation of G-quadruplex structures in DNA or RNA. The interaction between epigenetic DNA modifications, G4 formation, and the 3D architecture of the genome is a complex and developing area of research. Although there is growing evidence for such interactions, a great deal still remains to be discovered. In vivo, the potential effect that cytosine methylation may have on the formation of DNA structures has remained largely unresearched, despite this being a potential mechanism through which epigenetic factors could regulate gene activity. Such interactions could represent novel mechanisms for important biological functions, including altering nucleosome positioning or regulation of gene expression. Furthermore, promotion of strand-specific G-quadruplex formation in differentially methylated genes could have a dynamic role in directing X-inactivation or the control of imprinting, and would be a worthwhile focus for future research."

The essential strategy to prevent PTB is the accurate identification of threatened preterm labor (TPTL) women who will have PTB in a short time (< 7 days). Here, we aim to propose a clinical model to contribute to the effective prediction, precise prevention, and personalized medical treatment for PTB < 7 days in TPTL women through bioinformatics analysis and prospective cohort studies. In this study, the 1090 key genes involved in PTB < 7 days in the peripheral blood of TPTL women were ascertained using WGCNA. Based on this, the biological basis of immune-inflammatory activation (e.g., IFNγ and TNFα signaling) as well as immune cell disorders (e.g., monocytes and Th17 cells) in PTB < 7 days were revealed. Then, four core genes (JOSD1, IDNK, ZMYM3, and IL1B) that best represent their transcriptomic characteristics were screened by SVM and LASSO algorithm. Therefore, a prediction model with an AUC of 0.907 was constructed, which was validated in a larger population (AUC = 0.783). Moreover, the predictive value (AUC = 0.957) and clinical feasibility of this model were verified through the clinical prospective cohort we established. In conclusion, in the context of Predictive, Preventive, and Personalized Medicine (3PM), we have developed and validated a model to predict PTB < 7 days in TPTL women. This is promising to greatly improve the accuracy of clinical prediction, which would facilitate the personalized management of TPTL women to precisely prevent PTB < 7 days and improve maternal-fetal outcomes.© The Author(s), under exclusive licence to European Association for Predictive, Preventive and Personalised Medicine (EPMA) 2022."
"35269389","Pseudotime Analysis Reveals Exponential Trends in DNA Methylation Aging with Mortality Associated Timescales.","Cells","The epigenetic trajectory of DNA methylation profiles has a nonlinear relationship with time, reflecting rapid changes in DNA methylation early in life that progressively slow with age. In this study, we use pseudotime analysis to determine the functional form of these trajectories. Unlike epigenetic clocks that constrain the functional form of methylation changes with time, pseudotime analysis orders samples along a path, based on similarities in a latent dimension, to provide an unbiased trajectory. We show that pseudotime analysis can be applied to DNA methylation in human blood and brain tissue and find that it is highly correlated with the epigenetic states described by the Epigenetic Pacemaker. Moreover, we show that the pseudotime trajectory can be modeled with respect to time, using a sum of two exponentials, with coefficients that are close to the timescales of human age-associated mortality. Thus, for the first time, we can identify age-associated molecular changes that appear to track the exponential dynamics of mortality risk."
"35313970","Genome-wide association studies identify novel genetic loci for epigenetic age acceleration among survivors of childhood cancer.","Genome Med","Increased epigenetic age acceleration (EAA) in survivors of childhood cancer is associated with specific treatment exposures, unfavorable health behaviors, and presence of certain chronic health conditions. To better understand inter-individual variability, we investigated the genetic basis underlying EAA.Genome-wide association studies of EAA based on multiple epigenetic clocks (Hannum, Horvath, PhenoAge, and GrimAge) were performed. MethylationEPIC BeadChip array and whole-genome sequencing data were generated with blood-derived DNA from participants in the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort Study (discovery: 2138 pre-existing and 502 newly generated data, all survivors; exploratory: 282 community controls). Linear regression models were fit for each epigenetic age against the allelic dose of each genetic variant, adjusting for age at sampling, sex, and cancer treatment exposures. Fixed-effects meta-analysis was used to combine summary statistics from two discovery data sets. LD (Linkage disequilibrium) score regression was used to estimate single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based heritability.For EAA-Horvath, a genome-wide significant association was mapped to the SELP gene with the strongest SNP rs732314 (meta-GWAS: β=0.57, P=3.30×10-11). Moreover, the stratified analysis of the association between rs732314 and EAA-Horvath showed a substantial heterogeneity between children and adults (meta-GWAS: β=0.97 vs. 0.51, I2=73.1%) as well as between survivors with and without chest/abdominal/pelvic-RT exposure (β=0.64 vs. 0.31, I2=66.3%). For EAA-Hannum, an association was mapped to the HLA locus with the strongest SNP rs28366133 (meta-GWAS: β=0.78, P=3.78×10-11). There was no genome-wide significant hit for EAA-PhenoAge or EAA-GrimAge. Interestingly, among community controls, rs732314 was associated with EAA-Horvath (β=1.09, P=5.43×10-5), whereas rs28366133 was not associated with EAA-Hannum (β=0.21, P=0.49). The estimated heritability was 0.33 (SE=0.20) for EAA-Horvath and 0.17 (SE=0.23) for EAA-Hannum, but close to zero for EAA-PhenoAge and EAA-GrimAge.We identified novel genetic variants in the SELP gene and HLA region associated with EAA-Horvath and EAA-Hannum, respectively, among survivors of childhood cancer. The new genetic variants in combination with other replicated known variants can facilitate the identification of survivors at higher risk in developing accelerated aging and potentially inform drug targets for future intervention strategies among vulnerable survivors.© 2022.

"35313610","Accelerated epigenetic aging mediates link between adverse childhood experiences and depressive symptoms in older adults: Results from the Health and Retirement Study.","SSM Popul Health","Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) increase risk for depression at subsequent ages and have been linked to accelerated biological aging. We hypothesize that accelerated epigenetic aging may partially mediate the link between ACEs and depression. This study examines 3 three second-generation epigenetic aging measures (viz., GrimAge, PhenoAge, and DunedinPoAm38) as mediators of the link between ACEs and depressive symptoms in older adulthood. We utilize structural equation modeling to assess mediation in the Health and Retirement Study (N = 2672). Experiencing ACEs is significantly associated with an older GrimAge and a faster pace of aging via the DunedinPoAm38. Having an older GrimAge and faster DunedinPoAm38 pace of aging were also significantly associated with more depressive symptoms. PhenoAge was not significantly associated with depressive symptoms and was only associated with experiencing three ACEs. These associations were reduced by socioeconomic and lifestyle factors, including obesity and substance use. GrimAge explained between 9 and 14% of the association between ACEs and adult depressive symptoms, and DunedinPoAm38 explained between 2 and 7% of the association between ACEs and adult depressive symptoms. Findings indicate accelerated aging, as measured by GrimAge and DunedinPoAm38, is associated with ACEs and with depressive symptoms in older Americans. Findings also show these epigenetic aging measures mediate a portion of the association between ACEs and adult depressive symptoms. Epigenetic aging may represent a physiological mechanism underlying the link between early life adversity and adult depression. Weight maintenance and substance use are potentially important areas for intervention.© 2022 The Authors."
"35309114","Epigenetic Clock Deceleration and Maternal Reproductive Efforts: Associations With Increasing Gray Matter Volume of the Precuneus.","Front Genet","Reproductive efforts, such as pregnancy, delivery, and interaction with children, make maternal brains optimized for child-rearing. However, extensive studies in non-human species revealed a tradeoff between reproductive effort and life expectancy. In humans, large demographic studies have shown that this is the case for the most part; however, molecular marker studies regarding aging remain controversial. There are no studies simultaneously evaluating the relationship between reproductive effort, aging, and brain structures. We therefore examined the associations between reproductive efforts (parity status, number of deliveries, motherhood period, and cumulative motherhood period), DNA methylation age (mAge) acceleration (based on Horvath's multi-tissue clock and the skin & blood clock), and the regional gray matter volumes (obtained through brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using voxel-based morphometry) in 51 mothers aged 27-46 years of children in early childhood. We found that increasing reproductive efforts were significantly associated with decelerated aging in mothers with one to four children, even after adjusting for the confounding effects in the multiple linear regression models. We also found that the left precuneus gray matter volume was larger as deceleration of aging occurred; increasing left precuneus gray matter volume, on the other hand, mediates the relationship between parity status and mAge deceleration. Our findings suggest that mothers of children in early childhood, who have had less than four children, may benefit from deceleration of aging mediated via structural changes in the precuneus.Copyright © 2022 Nishitani, Kasaba, Hiraoka, Shimada, Fujisawa, Okazawa and Tomoda."
"35295196","Increased Rate of Epigenetic Aging in Men Living With HIV Prior to Treatment.","Front Genet","Background:Epigenetic aging is accelerated in tissues of persons living with HIV (PLWH) and may underlie the early onset of age-related illnesses. This study examines the rate-of-change in epigenetic age in PLWH following HIV infection but before HAART, using archived longitudinal samples from the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study.Methods:DNA was isolated from cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 101 men living with HIV, with baseline visit <2.5 years after HIV seroconversion (Visit 1) and follow-up visit <1.5 years before the initiation of HAART (Visit 2), and 100 HIV-uninfected men matched on age and visits with comparable time intervals. DNA methylation (DNAm) age was estimated for five clocks (Pan-tissue, Extrinsic, Phenotypic, Grim, and Skin & Blood age), and a DNAm-based estimate of telomere length (DNAmTL). Multivariate linear regression models were used to examine baseline factors associated with rate-of-aging, defined as (DNAm age visit 2-DNAm age visit 1)/(age visit 2-age visit 1).Results:Epigenetic age increased approximately twice as fast in PLWH as uninfected controls (Pan-tissue, Extrinsic, and Phenotypic clocks). Shortening of DNAmTL was nearly 3-fold faster in PLWH than controls. Faster rate-of-aging was associated with HIV status (Pan-Tissue, Extrinsic, Phenotypic, and DNAmTL), white race (Extrinsic, DNAmTL), higher cumulative HIV viral load (Grim), and lower baseline DNAm age (Phenotypic, Skin & Blood).Conclusion:Epigenetic rates-of-aging were significantly faster for untreated PLWH. Our findings expand on the important impact of HIV infection on biologic aging, both in elevating epigenetic age and increasing the rate-of-aging in the years following infection.Copyright © 2022 Sehl, Breen, Shih, Chen, Wang, Horvath, Bream, Duggal, Martinson, Wolinsky, Martinez-Maza, Ramirez and Jamieson."

There is an urgent need to identify biological aging markers in mid-life before symptoms of age-related dementia present for early intervention to delay the cognitive decline and the onset of dementia. In this cohort study involving 1,676 healthy participants (mean age 40) with up to 15 years of follow up, we evaluated the associations between cognitive function and two classes of novel biological aging markers: blood-based epigenetic aging and neuroimaging-based brain aging. Both accelerated epigenetic aging and brain aging were prospectively associated with worse cognitive outcomes. Specifically, every year faster epigenetic or brain aging was on average associated with 0.19-0.28 higher (worse) Stroop score, 0.04-0.05 lower (worse) RAVLT score, and 0.23-0.45 lower (worse) DSST (all false-discovery-rate-adjusted p <0.05). While epigenetic aging is a more stable biomarker with strong long-term predictive performance for cognitive function, brain aging biomarker may change more dynamically in temporal association with cognitive decline. The combined model using epigenetic and brain aging markers achieved the highest accuracy (AUC: 0.68, p<0.001) in predicting global cognitive function status. Accelerated epigenetic age and brain age at midlife may aid timely identification of individuals at risk for accelerated cognitive decline and promote the development of interventions to preserve optimal functioning across the lifespan."
"35283726","DNA Methylation Markers and Prediction Model for Depression and Their Contribution for Breast Cancer Risk.","Front Mol Neurosci","Major depressive disorder (MDD) has become a leading cause of disability worldwide. However, the diagnosis of the disorder is dependent on clinical experience and inventory. At present, there are no reliable biomarkers to help with diagnosis and treatment. DNA methylation patterns may be a promising approach for elucidating the etiology of MDD and predicting patient susceptibility. Our overarching aim was to identify biomarkers based on DNA methylation, and then use it to propose a methylation prediction score for MDD, which we hope will help us evaluate the risk of breast cancer.Methylation data from 533 samples were extracted from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, of which, 324 individuals were diagnosed with MDD. Statistical difference of DNA Methylation between Promoter and Other body region (SIMPO) score for each gene was calculated based on the DNA methylation data. Based on SIMPO scores, we selected the top genes that showed a correlation with MDD in random resampling, then proposed a methylation-derived Depression Index (mDI) by combining the SIMPO of the selected genes to predict MDD. A validation analysis was then performed using additional DNA methylation data from 194 samples extracted from the GEO database. Furthermore, we applied the mDI to construct a prediction model for the risk of breast cancer using stepwise regression and random forest methods.The optimal mDI was derived from 426 genes, which included 245 positive and 181 negative correlations. It was constructed to predict MDD with high predictive power (AUC of 0.88) in the discovery dataset. In addition, we observed moderate power for mDI in the validation dataset with an OR of 1.79. Biological function assessment of the 426 genes showed that they were functionally enriched in Eph Ephrin signaling and beta-catenin Wnt signaling pathways. The mDI was then used to construct a predictive model for breast cancer that had an AUC ranging from 0.70 to 0.67.Our results indicated that DNA methylation could help to explain the pathogenesis of MDD and assist with its diagnosis.Copyright © 2022 Wang, Sun, Pang, Zheng, Liang, He, Tang, Yu, Xiong and Chang."

We proposed that the physiological health status and biological age, beyond the chronological age itself, could be the driving trends affecting COVID-19 severity and mortality. A total of 155 participants hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 aged 26-94 years were recruited for the study. Four different physiological summary indices were calculated: Klemera and Doubal's biological age, PhenoAge, physiological dysregulation (PD; globally and in specific systems), and integrated albunemia. All of these indices significantly predicted the risk of death (p < 0.01) after adjusting for chronological age and sex. In all models, men were 2.4-4.4-times more likely to die than women. The global PD was shown to be a good predictor of deterioration, with the odds of deterioration increasing by 41.7% per 0.5-unit increase in the global PD. As for death, the odds also increased by 68.3% per 0.5-unit increase in the global PD. Our results are partly attributed to common chronic diseases that aggravate COVID-19, but they also suggest that the underlying physiological state could capture vulnerability to severe COVID-19 and serve as a tool for prognosis that would, in turn, help inpatient management."

There are difficulties involved in diagnosing NAFLD early and for this reason there are challenges involved in its treatment. Furthermore, no drugs are currently approved to alleviate complications, a fact which highlights the need for further insight into disease mechanisms. NAFLD pathogenesis is associated with complex cellular changes, including hepatocyte steatosis, immune cell infiltration, endothelial dysfunction, hepatic stellate cell activation, and epithelial ductular reaction. Many of these cellular changes are controlled by dramatic changes in gene expression orchestrated by the cis-regulatory genome and associated transcription factors. Thus, to understand disease mechanisms, we need extensive insights into the gene regulatory mechanisms associated with tissue remodeling. Mapping cis-regulatory regions genome-wide is a step towards this objective and several current and emerging technologies allow detection of accessible chromatin and specific histone modifications in enriched cell populations of the liver, as well as in single cells. Here, we discuss recent insights into the cis-regulatory genome in NAFLD both at the organ-level and in specific cell populations of the liver. Moreover, we highlight emerging technologies that enable single-cell resolved analysis of the cis-regulatory genome of the liver."
"35211719","Fully exploiting SNP arrays: a systematic review on the tools to extract underlying genomic structure.","Brief Bioinform","Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are the most abundant type of genomic variation and the most accessible to genotype in large cohorts. However, they individually explain a small proportion of phenotypic differences between individuals. Ancestry, collective SNP effects, structural variants, somatic mutations or even differences in historic recombination can potentially explain a high percentage of genomic divergence. These genetic differences can be infrequent or laborious to characterize; however, many of them leave distinctive marks on the SNPs across the genome allowing their study in large population samples. Consequently, several methods have been developed over the last decade to detect and analyze different genomic structures using SNP arrays, to complement genome-wide association studies and determine the contribution of these structures to explain the phenotypic differences between individuals. We present an up-to-date collection of available bioinformatics tools that can be used to extract relevant genomic information from SNP array data including population structure and ancestry; polygenic risk scores; identity-by-descent fragments; linkage disequilibrium; heritability and structural variants such as inversions, copy number variants, genetic mosaicisms and recombination histories. From a systematic review of recently published applications of the methods, we describe the main characteristics of R packages, command-line tools and desktop applications, both free and commercial, to help make the most of a large amount of publicly available SNP data.© The Author(s) 2022.

"35269453","Synergistic Anti-Ageing through Senescent Cells Specific Reprogramming.","Cells","In this review, we seek a novel strategy for establishing a rejuvenating microenvironment through senescent cells specific reprogramming. We suggest that partial reprogramming can produce a secretory phenotype that facilitates cellular rejuvenation. This strategy is desired for specific partial reprogramming under control to avoid tumour risk and organ failure due to loss of cellular identity. It also alleviates the chronic inflammatory state associated with ageing and secondary senescence in adjacent cells by improving the senescence-associated secretory phenotype. This manuscript also hopes to explore whether intervening in cellular senescence can improve ageing and promote damage repair, in general, to increase people's healthy lifespan and reduce frailty. Feasible and safe clinical translational protocols are critical in rejuvenation by controlled reprogramming advances. This review discusses the limitations and controversies of these advances' application (while organizing the manuscript according to potential clinical translation schemes) to explore directions and hypotheses that have translational value for subsequent research."

Notably, partial and reversible reprogramming does not change cell identity but can reverse markers of aging in cells, improve the capacity of aged mice to repair tissue injuries, and extend longevity in progeroid mice. However, little is known about the mechanisms involved. Here, we have studied changes in the DNA methylome, transcriptome, and metabolome in naturally aged mice subject to a single period of transient OSKM expression. We found that this is sufficient to reverse DNA methylation changes that occur upon aging in the pancreas, liver, spleen, and blood. Similarly, we observed reversion of transcriptional changes, especially regarding biological processes known to change during aging. Finally, some serum metabolites and biomarkers altered with aging were also restored to young levels upon transient reprogramming. These observations indicate that a single period of OSKM expression can drive epigenetic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic changes toward a younger configuration in multiple tissues and in the serum.© 2022 The Authors.

However, the underlying mechanism of m6A regulation in intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD) remains elusive. Here, we show that methylation of the lncRNA NORAD significantly increases in senescent nucleus pulposus cells (NPCs) by m6A sequencing. Subsequent loss- and gain-of-function experiments reveal WTAP is increased in senescent NPCs due to an epigenetic increase in H3K4me3 of the promoter mediated by KDM5a, and significantly promotes NORAD m6A modification. Furthermore, YTHDF2-mediated decay of NORAD is enhanced in senescent NPCs, and then deficiency of NORAD results in less sequestraion of PUMILIO proteins, contributing to the augmented activity of PUM1/2, thus repressing the expression of target E2F3 mRNAs and promoting the cellular senescence. Here, we show interruption of NORAD m6A modification or the NORAD/PUMILIO/E2F3 axis could serve as a potential therapeutic target to inhibit the senescence of NPCs and development of IVDD.© 2022.

The location and nature of the expansion have been proven to contribute to transcriptional repression ofFXNby decreasing the rate of polymerase II (RNA polymerase II) progression and increasing the presence of histone modifications associated with a heterochromatin-like state. Targeting impairedFXNtranscription appears as a feasible option for therapeutic intervention, while no cure currently exists. We created a novel reporter cell line containing anFXN-Nanoluciferase (FXN-NLuc) fusion in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) reprogrammed from the fibroblasts of patients with FRDA, thus allowing quantification of endogenousFXNexpression. The use of iPSCs provides the opportunity to differentiate these cells into disease-relevant neural progenitor cells (NPCs). NPCs derived from the FXN-NLuc line responded to treatments with a knownFXNinducer, RG109. Results were validated by quantitative PCR and Western blot in multiple FRDA NPC lines. We then screened a commercially available library of compounds consisting of molecules targeting various enzymes and pathways critical for silencing or activation of gene expression. Only selected histone deacetylase inhibitors were capable of partial reactivation ofFXNexpression. This endogenous, FRDA iPSC-derived reporter can be utilized for high-throughput campaigns performed in cells most relevant to disease pathology in search ofFXNtranscription activators.Copyright © 2022 Schreiber, Li, Chen, Napierala and Napierala."

Nevertheless, genes crucial for understanding the molecular mechanisms of depression and effective antidepressant drug targets are largely unknown. Addressing this, we aimed to highlight potentially causal genes by systematically integrating the brain and blood protein and expression quantitative trait loci (QTL) data with a depression GWAS dataset via a statistical framework including Mendelian randomization (MR), Bayesian colocalization, and Steiger filtering analysis. In summary, we identified three candidate genes (TMEM106B, RAB27B, and GMPPB) based on brain data and two genes (TMEM106B and NEGR1) based on blood data with consistent robust evidence at both the protein and transcriptional levels. Furthermore, the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network provided new insights into the interaction between brain and blood in depression. Collectively, four genes (TMEM106B, RAB27B, GMPPB, and NEGR1) affect depression by influencing protein and gene expression level, which could guide future researches on candidate genes investigations in animal studies as well as prioritize antidepressant drug targets.© 2022.

Referrals of children by EHS staff to community agencies were recorded. The association between parental ACEs score, developmental outcomes and referrals was analyzed. Parental ACEs score of 4 or more was associated with failing at least 1 domain on the Brigance screen (P = .02) especially adaptive/cognitive domain (P = .05), and increased risk of referral to community resources (P < .001). However, there was no association between ACEs scores and failing DECA screens. We identified an intergenerational association between parental exposure to ACEs and risk for childhood developmental delay and referrals to community services. Parental adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) have intergenerational effects on offspring. In our study, parental ACEs are associated with offspring developmental delays and referral to community resources. Screening for parental adverse childhood experiences, a key social determinant of health, is imperative and should be incorporated into primary care and early childhood settings to identify children at risk for developmental delay."
"35239404","Social Determinants of Cardiovascular Disease.","Circ Res","Social determinants of health (SDoH), which encompass the economic, social, environmental, and psychosocial factors that influence health, play a significant role in the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors as well as CVD morbidity and mortality. The COVID-19 pandemic and the current social justice movement sparked by the death of George Floyd have laid bare long-existing health inequities in our society driven by SDoH. Despite a recent focus on these structural drivers of health disparities, the impact of SDoH on cardiovascular health and CVD outcomes remains understudied and incompletely understood. To further investigate the mechanisms connecting SDoH and CVD, and ultimately design targeted and effective interventions, it is important to foster interdisciplinary efforts that incorporate translational, epidemiological, and clinical research in examining SDoH-CVD relationships. This review aims to facilitate research coordination and intervention development by providing an evidence-based framework for SDoH rooted in the lived experiences of marginalized populations. Our framework highlights critical structural/socioeconomic, environmental, and psychosocial factors most strongly associated with CVD and explores several of the underlying biologic mechanisms connecting SDoH to CVD pathogenesis, including excess stress hormones, inflammation, immune cell function, and cellular aging. We present landmark studies and recent findings about SDoH in our framework, with careful consideration of the constructs and measures utilized. Finally, we provide a roadmap for future SDoH research focused on individual, clinical, and policy approaches directed towards developing multilevel community-engaged interventions to promote cardiovascular health."

Epigenetic variation, especially DNA methylation, has been shown to be involved in almost all the stages of the pathology of RA, from autoantibody production to various self-effector T cells and the defects of protective T cells that can lead to chronic inflammation and erosion of bones and joints. Given the critical role of T cells in the pathology of RA, the regulatory functions of DNA methylation in T cell biology remain unclear. In this review, we elaborate on the relationship between RA pathogenesis and DNA methylation in the context of different T cell populations. We summarize the relevant methylation events in T cell development, differentiation, and T cell-related genes in disease prediction and drug efficacy. Understanding the epigenetic regulation of T cells has the potential to profoundly translate preclinical results into clinical practice and provide a framework for the development of novel, individualized RA therapeutics.Copyright © 2022 Zhao, Wei, Chang, Xu, Jiang, Guo, Schrodi and He."
"35301622","Epigenetics of pregnancy: looking beyond the DNA code.","J Assist Reprod Genet","Epigenetics is the branch of genetics that studies the different mechanisms that influence gene expression without direct modification of the DNA sequence. An ever-increasing amount of evidence suggests that such regulatory processes may play a pivotal role both in the initiation of pregnancy and in the later processes of embryonic and fetal development, thus determining long-term effects even in adult life. In this narrative review, we summarize the current knowledge on the role of epigenetics in pregnancy, from its most studied and well-known mechanisms to the new frontiers of epigenetic regulation, such as the role of ncRNAs and the effects of the gestational environment on fetal brain development. Epigenetic mechanisms in pregnancy are a dynamic phenomenon that responds both to maternal-fetal and environmental factors, which can influence and modify the embryo-fetal development during the various gestational phases. Therefore, we also recapitulate the effects of the most notable environmental factors that can affect pregnancy and prenatal development, such as maternal nutrition, stress hormones, microbiome, and teratogens, focusing on their ability to cause epigenetic modifications in the gestational environment and ultimately in the fetus. Despite the promising advancements in the knowledge of epigenetics in pregnancy, more experience and data on this topic are still needed. A better understanding of epigenetic regulation in pregnancy could in fact prove valuable towards a better management of both physiological pregnancies and assisted reproduction treatments, other than allowing to better comprehend the origin of multifactorial pathological conditions such as neurodevelopmental disorders.© 2022.

"35316269","Incorporating regulatory interactions into gene-set analyses for GWAS data: A controlled analysis with the MAGMA tool.","PLoS Comput Biol","To date, genome-wide association studies have identified thousands of statistically-significant associations between genetic variants, and phenotypes related to a myriad of traits and diseases. A key goal for human-genetics research is to translate these associations into functional mechanisms. Popular gene-set analysis tools, like MAGMA, map variants to genes they might affect, and then integrate genome-wide association study data (that is, variant-level associations for a phenotype) to score genes for association with a phenotype. Gene scores are subsequently used in competitive gene-set analyses to identify biological processes that are enriched for phenotype association. By default, variants are mapped to genes in their proximity. However, many variants that affect phenotypes are thought to act at regulatory elements, which can be hundreds of kilobases away from their target genes. Thus, we explored the idea of augmenting a proximity-based mapping scheme with publicly-available datasets of regulatory interactions. We used MAGMA to analyze genome-wide association study data for ten different phenotypes, and evaluated the effects of augmentation by comparing numbers, and identities, of genes and gene sets detected as statistically significant between mappings. We detected several pitfalls and confounders of such ""augmented analyses"", and introduced ways to control for them. Using these controls, we demonstrated that augmentation with datasets of regulatory interactions only occasionally strengthened the enrichment for phenotype association amongst (biologically-relevant) gene sets for different phenotypes. Still, in such cases, genes and regulatory elements responsible for the improvement could be pinpointed. For instance, using brain regulatory-interactions for augmentation, we were able to implicate two acetylcholine receptor subunits involved in post-synaptic chemical transmission, namely CHRNB2 and CHRNE, in schizophrenia. Collectively, our study presents a critical approach for integrating regulatory interactions into gene-set analyses for genome-wide association study data, by introducing various controls to distinguish genuine results from spurious discoveries."
"35281804","MiR-208b Regulates the Conversion of Skeletal Muscle Fiber Types by Inhibiting Mettl8 Expression.","Front Genet","Skeletal muscle, the main source of animal meat products, contains muscle fiber as a key unit. It is well known that transformation takes place between different types of muscle fibers, however, the conversion mechanism is not clear. In a previous study, our lab has demonstrated that there is a decrease in type I muscle fibers and an increase in type IIB muscle fibers in skeletal muscle of myostatin gene-edited Meishan pigs. Very interestingly, we observed the down regulation of miR-208b expression and an increase in expression the predicted target gene Mettl8 (Methyltransferase like 8) in skeletal muscle of MSTN gene-edited Meishan pigs. These results reveal that there is a potential connection between the conversion of skeletal muscle fiber types and miR-208b and Mettl8 expression. In this study, we first explored the expression patterns of miR-208b and Mettl8 in skeletal muscle in Meishan pigs; and then C2C12 cells were used to simulate the development and maturation of muscle fibers. Our results indicated that Myh4 expression level decreased and Myh7 expression level increased following overexpression of miR-208b in C2C12 cells. We therefore speculate that miR-208b can promote the conversion of fast-twitch fibers to slow-twitch fibers. The targeting relationship between Mettl8 and miR-208b was confirmed by results obtained using dual luciferase assay, RT-qPCR, and WB analysis. Following the transfection of Mettl8 siRNA into C2C12 cells, we observed that Mettl8 expression decreased significantly while Myh7 expression increased and Myh4 expression decreased, indicating that Mettl8 promotes the conversion of slow muscle fibers to fast muscle fibers. Additionally, changes in skeletal muscle fiber types are observed in those mice where miR-208b and Mettl8 genes are knocked out. The miR-208b knockout inhibits the formation of slow muscle fibers, and the Mettl8 knockout inhibits the formation of fast muscle fibers. In conclusion, our research results show that miR-208b regulates the conversion of different muscle fiber types by inhibiting Mettl8 expression.Copyright © 2022 Li, Bi, Xie and Cui."

The aim of the present study was to examine the quality of mothers' behaviour during mother-infant interaction in the early postpartum period by comparing mothers of twins and mothers of singletons during face-to-face interaction with their infants. Demographic and clinical information was collected by trained research psychologists from the mothers' and the childrens' clinical records and from interviews with the mothers. At three months (corrected for prematurity), the interactions of the dyads (11 mother-twin infant dyads and 11 mother-singleton dyads) were filmed at participants' homes in accordance with the procedure of the Global Rating Scales. Maternal behaviour during interactions was assessed and rated by two trained research psychologists. With regard to the mothers' interaction with each twin, no differences were found between mothers' scores in every GRS subscale, indicating that mothers did not interact differently with their twins. Comparisons between mothers of MC twins and mothers of singletons showed that the quality of maternal sensitive behaviour during the interactions were lower in mothers of twins (0.35) Mothers of twins were also more distant during interactions with their babies and more likely to experience depression symptoms than mothers of singletons (0.05). Future research should examine mother-infant relationships following twin birth with larger samples. Such research will be especially useful in evaluating the potential benefits of interventions to promote positive mother-infant interactions."
"35305552","mRNA expression analysis of the hippocampus in a vervet monkey model of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder.","J Neurodev Disord","Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are common, yet preventable developmental disorders that stem from prenatal exposure to alcohol. This exposure leads to a wide array of behavioural and physical problems with a complex and poorly defined biological basis. Molecular investigations to date predominantly use rodent animal models, but because of genetic, developmental and social behavioral similarity, primate models are more relevant. We previously reported reduced cortical and hippocampal neuron levels in an Old World monkey (Chlorocebus sabaeus) model with ethanol exposure targeted to the period of rapid synaptogenesis and report here an initial molecular study of this model. The goal of this study was to evaluate mRNA expression of the hippocampus at two different behavioural stages (5 months, 2 years) corresponding to human infancy and early childhood.Offspring of alcohol-preferring or control dams drank a maximum of 3.5 g ethanol per kg body weight or calorically matched sucrose solution 4 days per week during the last 2 months of gestation. Total mRNA expression was measured with the Affymetrix GeneChip Rhesus Macaque Genome Array in a 2 × 2 study design that interrogated two independent variables, age at sacrifice, and alcohol consumption during gestation.Statistical analysis identified a preferential downregulation of expression when interrogating the factor 'alcohol' with a balanced effect of upregulation vs. downregulation for the independent variable 'age'. Functional exploration of both independent variables shows that the alcohol consumption factor generates broad functional annotation clusters that likely implicate a role for epigenetics in the observed differential expression, while the variable age reliably produced functional annotation clusters predominantly related to development. Furthermore, our data reveals a novel connection between EFNB1 and the FASDs; this is highly plausible both due to the role of EFNB1 in neuronal development as well as its central role in craniofrontal nasal syndrome (CFNS). Fold changes for key genes were subsequently confirmed via qRT-PCR.Prenatal alcohol exposure leads to global downregulation in mRNA expression. The cellular interference model of EFNB1 provides a potential clue regarding how genetically susceptible individuals may develop the phenotypic triad generally associated with classic fetal alcohol syndrome.© 2022.

Rodent studies show that cortical CRH is mostly expressed in GABAergic interneurons; however, the characteristic features of CRH+ cells in human brain cortex and their association with MDD are largely unknown.Subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) of human subjects without brain disorders were labeled using fluorescentin situhybridization (FISH) for CRH and markers of excitatory (SLC17A7), inhibitory (GAD1) neurons, as well as markers of other interneuron subpopulations (PVALB, SST, VIP). MDD-associated changes in CRH+ cell density and cellular CRH expression (n= 6/group) were analyzed. RNA-sequencing was performed on sgACC CRH+ interneurons from comparison and MDD subjects (n= 6/group), and analyzed for group differences. The effect of reduced BDNF on CRH expression was tested in mice with blocked TrkB function.About 80% of CRH+ cells were GABAergic and 17.5% were glutamatergic. CRH+ GABAergic interneurons co-expressed VIP (52%), SST (7%), or PVALB (7%). MDD subjects displayed lower CRH mRNA levels in GABAergic interneurons relative to comparison subjects without changes in cell density. CRH+ interneurons show transcriptomic profile suggesting lower excitability and less GABA release and reuptake. Further analyses suggested that these molecular changes are not mediated by altered glucocorticoid feedback and potentially occur downstream for a common modulator of neurotrophic function.CRH+ cells in human sgACC are a heterogeneous population of GABAergic interneurons, although largely co-expressing VIP. Our data suggest that MDD is associated with reduced markers of inhibitory function in sgACC CRH+ interneurons, and provide further evidence for impaired GABAergic function in the cortex in MDD.Copyright © 2022 Oh, Newton, Lewis and Sibille."

However, it remains unclear how they modulate human brain function and disease risk. Here we report 170,996 SVs discovered using 1,760 short-read whole genomes from aged adults and individuals with Alzheimer's disease. By applying quantitative trait locus (SV-xQTL) analyses, we quantified the impact of cis-acting SVs on histone modifications, gene expression, splicing and protein abundance in postmortem brain tissues. More than 3,200 SVs were associated with at least one molecular phenotype. We found reproducibility of 65-99% SV-eQTLs across cohorts and brain regions. SV associations with mRNA and proteins shared the same direction of effect in more than 87% of SV-gene pairs. Mediation analysis showed ~8% of SV-eQTLs mediated by histone acetylation and ~11% by splicing.

We used data on measured height and weight, genetic information, and sociodemographic factors from the Nord-Trøndelag Health Studies (HUNT), and individual-level registry data on healthcare costs, educational level, registration status, and biological relatives. We studied associations between BMI and general practitioner (GP)-, specialist-, and total healthcare costs in the Norwegian setting using instrumental variable (IV) regressions, and compared our findings with effect estimates from ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions. The sensitivity of our findings to underlying IV-assumptions was explored using two-sample Mendelian randomization methods, non-linear analyses, sex-, healthcare provider-, and age-specific analyses, within-family analyses, and outlier removal. We also conducted power calculations to assess the likelihood of detecting an effect given our sample 60,786 individuals.We found that increased BMI resulted in significantly higher GP costs; however, the IV-based effect estimate was smaller than the OLS-based estimate. We found no evidence of an association between BMI and specialist or total healthcare costs.Elevated BMI leads to higher GP costs, and more studies are needed to understand the causal mechanisms between BMI and specialist costs.© 2022.

It is a complex disease, influenced by multiple factors including genetic variants and environmental factors. Maternal smoking during pregnancy may influence the risk for diseases during adulthood, potentially through epigenetic modifications including methylation.In this work, we explore the fetal origins of COPD by utilizing lung DNA methylation marks associated with in utero smoke (IUS) exposure, and evaluate the network relationships between methylomic and transcriptomic signatures associated with adult lung tissue from former smokers with and without COPD. To identify potential pathobiological mechanisms that may link fetal lung, smoke exposure and adult lung disease, we study the interactions (physical and functional) of identified genes using protein-protein interaction networks.We build IUS-exposure and COPD modules, which identify connected subnetworks linking fetal lung smoke exposure to adult COPD. Studying the relationships and connectivity among the different modules for fetal smoke exposure and adult COPD, we identify enriched pathways, including the AGE-RAGE and focal adhesion pathways.The modules identified in our analysis add new and potentially important insights to understanding the early life molecular perturbations related to the pathogenesis of COPD. We identify AGE-RAGE and focal adhesion as two biologically plausible pathways that may reveal lung developmental contributions to COPD. We were not only able to identify meaningful modules but were also able to study interconnections between smoke exposure and lung disease, augmenting our knowledge about the fetal origins of COPD.© 2022.

"35310213","Embodied Prevention.","Front Psychol","Evidence-based recommendations for lifestyles to promote healthy cognitive aging (exercise, education, non-smoking, balanced diet, etc.) root in reductionistic studies of mostly physical measurable factors with large effect sizes. In contrast, most people consider factors like autonomy, purpose, social participation and engagement, etc. as central to a high quality of life in old age. Evidence for a direct causal impact of these factors on healthy cognitive aging is still limited, albeit not absent. Ultimately, however, individual lifestyle is a complex composite of variables relating to both body and mind as well as to receiving input and generating output. The physical interventions are tied to the more subjective and mind-related aspects of lifestyle and wellbeing in the idea of the ""embodied mind,"" which states that the mind is shaped by and requires the body. The causality is reciprocal and the process is dynamic, critically requiring movement: the ""embodied mind"" is a ""embodied mind in motion.""

To characterize the contributions of these different types of genetic effects to heritable traits, we use a double barcoding system to generate and phenotype a panel of ~200,000 diploid yeast strains that can be partitioned into hundreds of interrelated families. This experiment enables the detection of thousands of epistatic loci, many whose effects vary across families. Here, we show traits are largely specified by a small number of hub loci with major additive and dominance effects, and pervasive epistasis. Genetic background commonly influences both the additive and dominance effects of loci, with multiple modifiers typically involved. The most prominent dominance modifier in our data is the mating locus, which has no effect on its own.

Genome-wide association was performed using Firth bias-corrected logistic regression. Semi-parsimonious logistic regression was used to create polygenic risk scores and reduced regression to determine the genetic variants independently associated with sepsis.2261 patients had sepsis and 13,068 control patients did not.

High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and, more recently, the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) are important inflammatory biomarkers predictive of CV disease and CV disease-associated mortality. Here, we report the effect of interleukin (IL)-17A inhibition with secukinumab on CV risk parameters in patients with psoriasis, PsA, and axSpA over 1 year of treatment.This was a post hoc analysis of pooled data from phase 3/4 secukinumab studies in psoriasis, PsA, and axSpA. CV-related exclusion criteria included uncontrolled hypertension and congestive heart failure. Traditional risk factors assessed were body mass index (BMI) > 25, high fasting glucose and blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), and high cholesterol (low-density lipoproteins [LDL], total cholesterol/HDL ratio, and triglycerides). Inflammatory CV risk parameters assessed were hsCRP and NLR. Statistical analysis was descriptive. Subgroup analyses were performed in high-risk patients defined as having baseline hsCRP > 4 mg/L (patients with psoriasis) and > 10 mg/L (patients with PsA/axSpA).In total, 9197 patients from 19 clinical trials (8 in psoriasis, n = 4742; 5 in PsA, n = 2475; 6 in axSpA, n = 1980) were included. All traditional CV risk parameters remained stable in secukinumab-treated patients through 1 year. Secukinumab rapidly reduced both hsCRP and the NLR compared with placebo at week 12 (psoriasis) or week 16 (PsA/axSpA) in the overall population and in high-risk patients (all P < 0.01). This reduction was maintained for at least 1 year of secukinumab therapy in all indications.Secukinumab led to a rapid and sustained reduction in hsCRP and the NLR in patients with IMIDs with a high systemic inflammatory burden. Traditional CV risk factors remained stable for at least 1 year in patients with psoriasis, PsA, and axSpA. Taken together, secukinumab had a favorable effect on systemic inflammation without impact on traditional CV risk factors.ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01365455, NCT01358578, NCT01406938, NCT01555125, NCT01636687, NCT02752776, NCT02074982, NCT02826603, NCT01752634, NCT01989468, NCT02294227, NCT02404350, NCT02745080, NCT01863732, NCT01649375, NCT02008916, NCT02159053, NCT02896127, NCT02696031.© 2022.

Here, we characterized the whole-genome distribution of methyl-CpG and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) in mouse innate lymphoid cell 3 (ILC3), ILC2 and natural killer (NK) cells. We identified differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and differentially hydroxymethylated regions (DHMRs) between ILC and NK cell subsets and correlated them with transcriptional signatures. We associated lineage-determining transcription factors (LDTFs) with demethylation and demonstrated unique patterns of DNA methylation/hydroxymethylation in relationship to open chromatin regions (OCRs), histone modifications and TF-binding sites. We further identified an association between hydroxymethylation and NK cell superenhancers (SEs). Using mice lacking the DNA hydroxymethylase TET2, we showed the requirement for TET2 in optimal production of hallmark cytokines by ILC3s and interleukin-17A (IL-17A) by inflammatory ILC2s. These findings provide a powerful resource for studying innate lymphocyte epigenetic regulation and decode the regulatory logic governing their identity.© 2022. Springer Nature America, Inc."
"35304452","CD4 expression in effector T cells depends on DNA demethylation over a developmentally established stimulus-responsive element.","Nat Commun","The epigenetic patterns that are established during early thymic development might determine mature T cell physiology and function, but the molecular basis and topography of the genetic elements involved are not fully known. Here we show, using the Cd4 locus as a paradigm for early developmental programming, that DNA demethylation during thymic development licenses a novel stimulus-responsive element that is critical for the maintenance of Cd4 gene expression in effector T cells. We document the importance of maintaining high CD4 expression during parasitic infection and show that by driving transcription, this stimulus-responsive element allows for the maintenance of histone H3K4me3 levels during T cell replication, which is critical for preventing de novo DNA methylation at the Cd4 promoter. A failure to undergo epigenetic programming during development leads to gene silencing during effector T cell replication. Our study thus provides evidence of early developmental events shaping the functional fitness of mature effector T cells.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35337378","Ethical implications of epigenetics in the era of personalized medicine.","Clin Epigenetics","Given the increasing research activity on epigenetics to monitor human diseases and its connection with lifestyle and environmental expositions, the field of epigenetics has attracted a great deal of interest also at the ethical and societal level. In this review, we will identify and discuss current ethical, legal and social issues of epigenetics research in the context of personalized medicine. The review covers ethical aspects such as how epigenetic information should impact patient autonomy and the ability to generate an intentional and voluntary decision, the measures of data protection related to privacy and confidentiality derived from epigenome studies (e.g., risk of discrimination, patient re-identification and unexpected findings) or the debate in the distribution of responsibilities for health (i.e., personal versus public responsibilities). We pay special attention to the risk of social discrimination and stigmatization as a consequence of inferring information related to lifestyle and environmental exposures potentially contained in epigenetic data. Furthermore, as exposures to the environment and individual habits do not affect all populations equally, the violation of the principle of distributive justice in the access to the benefits of clinical epigenetics is discussed. In this regard, epigenetics represents a great opportunity for the integration of public policy measures aimed to create healthier living environments. Whether these public policies will coexist or, in contrast, compete with strategies reinforcing the personalized medicine interventions needs to be considered. The review ends with a reflection on the main challenges in epigenetic research, some of them in a technical dimension (e.g., assessing causality or establishing reference epigenomes) but also in the ethical and social sphere (e.g., risk to add an epigenetic determinism on top of the current genetic one). In sum, integration into life science investigation of social experiences such as exposure to risk, nutritional habits, prejudice and stigma, is imperative to understand epigenetic variation in disease. This pragmatic approach is required to locate clinical epigenetics out of the experimental laboratories and facilitate its implementation into society.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35301182","Early life affects late-life health through determining DNA methylation across the lifespan: A twin study.","EBioMedicine","Previous findings for the genetic and environmental contributions to DNA methylation variation were for limited age ranges only. We investigated the lifespan contributions and their implications for human health for the first time.1,720 monozygotic twin (MZ) pairs and 1,107 dizygotic twin (DZ) pairs aged 0-92 years were included. Familial correlations (i.e., correlations between twins) for 353,681 methylation sites were estimated and modelled as a function of twin pair cohabitation history.The methylome average familial correlation was around zero at birth (MZ pair: -0.01; DZ pair: -0.04), increased with the time of twins living together during childhood at rates of 0.16 (95%CI: 0.12-0.20) for MZ pairs and 0.13 (95%CI: 0.07-0.20) for DZ pairs per decade, and decreased with the time of living apart during adulthood at rates of 0.026 (95%CI: 0.019-0.033) for MZ pairs and 0.027 (95%CI: 0.011-0.043) for DZ pairs per decade. Neither the increasing nor decreasing rate differed by zygosity (both P>0.1), consistent with cohabitation environment shared by twins, rather than genetic factors, influencing the methylation familial correlation changes. Familial correlations for 6.6% (23,386/353,681) sites changed with twin pair cohabitation history. These sites were enriched for high heritability, proximal promoters, and epigenetic/genetic associations with various early-life factors and late-life health conditions.Early life strongly influences DNA methylation variation across the lifespan, and the effects are stronger for heritable sites and sites biologically relevant to the regulation of gene expression.

The present study aimed to construct dual prognostic indices based on pyroptosis-associated and immune-associated genes and to investigate the impact of the biological signatures of these genes on Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma (KIRC).Materials and Methods:All the KIRC samples from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were randomly and equally divided into the training and testing datasets. Cox and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression analysis were used to screen crucial pyroptosis-associated genes (PAGs), and a pyroptosis-associated genes prognostic index (PAGsPI) was constructed. Immune-associated genes (IAGs) related to PAGs were identified, and then screened through Cox and LASSO regression analyses, and an immune-associated genes prognostic index (IAGsPI) was developed. These two prognostic indices were verified by using the testing and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets and an independent cohort. The patients' response to immunotherapy was analyzed. A nomogram was constructed and calibrated. qRT-PCR was used to detect the expression of PAGs and IAGs in the tumor tissues and normal tissues. Functional experiment was carried out.Results:86 PAGs and 1,774 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were obtained. After intersecting PAGs with DEGs, 22 differentially expressed PAGs (DEPAGs) were included in Cox and LASSO regression analyses, identifying 5 crucial PAGs. The PAGsPI was generated. Patients in the high-PAGsPI group had a poor prognosis. 82 differentially expressed IAGs (DEIAGs) were highly correlated with DEPAGs. 7 key IAGs were screened out, and an IAGsPI was generated. Patients in the high-IAGsPI group had a poor prognosis. PAGsPI and IAGsPI were verified to be robust and reliable. The results revealed patients in low-PAGsPI group and high-IAGsPI group may be more sensitive to immunotherapy. The calibrated nomogram was proved to be reliable. An independent cohort study also proved that PAGsPI and IAGsPI performed well in prognosis prediction. We found that the expression of AIM2 may affect proliferation of KIRC cells.Conclusion:PAGsPI and IAGsPI could be regarded as potential biomarkers for predicting the prognosis of patients with KIRC.Copyright © 2022 Lin, Feng, Zhan, Yang, Niu and Li."

These sites had not been studied for their association with cardiovascular disease (CVD) deaths. Thus, we aimed to assess the associations independent of genes, shared environment, and traditional CVD risk factors. Nineteen white, male, monozygotic twin pairs discordant for CVD deaths were included from the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute Twin Study (NHLBI) initiated in 1969. Data on vital status was collected through December 31, 2014. Methylation of buffy coat DNA at exam 3 (1986-87) was measured using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. Principal component analysis was used to generate a score representing blood leukocyte composition and baseline CVD risk factors and predominated with natural killer cells, CD4+ T cells, and Framingham risk score. Conditional logistic regression demonstrated that methylation at the four CpG sites was not associated with CVD deaths before (all p > 0.05, bootstrapped p > 0.05) and after adjustment for the score (all p > 0.05). Joint influences of cg16936953 and the score were statistically significant (p < 0.05). In conclusion, joint influences of methylation at the site cg16936953 and the score are prospectively associated with CVD deaths independent of germline and common environment.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier for NHLBI Twin Study: NCT00005124.© 2022.

While the patterns and functions of DNA methylation have been extensively studied in mouse and human, their conservation in other vertebrates remains poorly explored. In this study, we interrogated the distribution and function of DNA methylation in primary fibroblasts of seven vertebrate species including bio-medical models and livestock species (human, mouse, rabbit, dog, cow, pig, and chicken).Our data highlight both divergence and conservation of DNA methylation patterns and functions. We show that the chicken genome is hypomethylated compared to other vertebrates. Furthermore, compared to mouse, other species show a higher frequency of methylation of CpG-rich DNA. We reveal the conservation of large unmethylated valleys and patterns of DNA methylation associated with X-chromosome inactivation through vertebrate evolution and make predictions of conserved sets of imprinted genes across mammals. Finally, using chemical inhibition of DNA methylation, we show that the silencing of germline genes and endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are conserved functions of DNA methylation in vertebrates.Our data highlight conserved properties of DNA methylation in vertebrate genomes but at the same time point to differences between mouse and other vertebrate species.© 2022.

"35276890","Dietary Carotenoids in Head and Neck Cancer-Molecular and Clinical Implications.","Nutrients","Head and neck cancer (HNC) is one of the most common cancers in the world according to GLOBCAN. In 2018, it was reported that HNC accounts for approximately 3% of all human cancers (51,540 new cases) and is the cause of nearly 1.5% of all cancer deaths (10,030 deaths). Despite great advances in treatment, HNC is indicated as a leading cause of death worldwide. In addition to having a positive impact on general health, a diet rich in carotenoids can regulate stages in the course of carcinogenesis; indeed, strong epidemiological associations exist between dietary carotenoids and HNS, and it is presumed that diets with carotenoids can even reduce cancer risk. They have also been proposed as potential chemotherapeutic agents and substances used in chemoprevention of HNC. The present review discusses the links between dietary carotenoids and HNC. It examines the prospective anticancer effect of dietary carotenoids against intracellular cell signalling and mechanisms, oxidative stress regulation, as well as their impact on apoptosis, cell cycle progression, cell proliferation, angiogenesis, metastasis, and chemoprevention; it also provides an overview of the limited preclinical and clinical research published in this arena. Recent epidemiological, key opinion-forming systematic reviews, cross-sectional, longitudinal, prospective, and interventional studies based on in vitro and animal models of HNC also indicate that high carotenoid content obtained from daily supplementation has positive effects on the initiation, promotion, and progression of HNC. This article presents these results according to their increasing clinical credibility."
"35331339","DNA methylation-based age acceleration observed in IDH wild-type glioblastoma is associated with better outcome-including in elderly patients.","Acta Neuropathol Commun","Elderly patients represent a growing proportion of individuals with glioblastoma, who however, are often excluded from clinical trials owing to poor expected prognosis. We aimed at identifying age-related molecular differences that would justify and guide distinct treatment decisions in elderly glioblastoma patients. The combined DNA methylome (450 k) of four IDH wild-type glioblastoma datasets, comprising two clinical trial cohorts, was interrogated for differences based on the patients' age, DNA methylation (DNAm) age acceleration (DNAm age ""Horvath-clock"" minus patient age), DNA methylation-based tumor classification (Heidelberg), entropy, and functional methylation of DNA damage response (DDR) genes. Age dependent methylation included 19 CpGs (p-value ≤ 0.1, Bonferroni corrected), comprising a CpG located in the ELOVL2 gene that is part of a 13-gene forensic age predictor. Most of the age related CpGs (n = 16) were also associated with age acceleration that itself was associated with a large number of CpGs (n = 50,551). Over 70% age acceleration-associated CpGs (n = 36,348) overlapped with those associated with the DNA methylation based tumor classification (n = 170,759). Gene set enrichment analysis identified associated pathways, providing insights into the biology of DNAm age acceleration and respective commonalities with glioblastoma classification. Functional methylation of several DDR genes, defined as correlation of methylation with gene expression (r ≤ -0.3), was associated with age acceleration (n = 8), tumor classification (n = 12), or both (n = 4), the latter including MGMT. DNAm age acceleration was significantly associated with better outcome in both clinical trial cohorts, whereof one comprised only elderly patients. Multivariate analysis included treatment (RT, RT/TMZ→TMZ; TMZ, RT), MGMT promoter methylation status, and interaction with treatment. In conclusion, DNA methylation features of age acceleration are an integrative part of the methylation-based tumor classification (RTK I, RTK II, MES), while patient age seems hardly reflected in the glioblastoma DNA methylome. We found no molecular evidence justifying other treatments in elderly patients, not owing to frailty or co-morbidities.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35288711","Genetic associations at regulatory phenotypes improve fine-mapping of causal variants for 12 immune-mediated diseases.","Nat Genet","The resolution of causal genetic variants informs understanding of disease biology. We used regulatory quantitative trait loci (QTLs) from the BLUEPRINT, GTEx and eQTLGen projects to fine-map putative causal variants for 12 immune-mediated diseases. We identify 340 unique loci that colocalize with high posterior probability (≥98%) with regulatory QTLs and apply Bayesian frameworks to fine-map associations at each locus. We show that fine-mapping credible sets derived from regulatory QTLs are smaller compared to disease summary statistics. Further, they are enriched for more functionally interpretable candidate causal variants and for putatively causal insertion/deletion (INDEL) polymorphisms. Finally, we use massively parallel reporter assays to evaluate candidate causal variants at the ITGA4 locus associated with inflammatory bowel disease. Overall, our findings suggest that fine-mapping applied to disease-colocalizing regulatory QTLs can enhance the discovery of putative causal disease variants and enhance insights into the underlying causal genes and molecular mechanisms.© 2022.

This allele associates with a large increase in body mass index (BMI) but with significantly lower risk of type-2 diabetes (T2D). It remains unclear whether the increased BMI is driven by increased adiposity or by increased lean mass.We undertook body composition analysis using DXA in 189 young men of Māori and Pacific descent living in Aotearoa New Zealand. Further investigation was carried out in two orthologous Arg458Gln knockin mouse models on FVB/NJ and C57BL/6j backgrounds.The rs373863828 A allele was associated with lower fat mass when adjusted for BMI (p < 0.05) and was associated with significantly lower circulating levels of the muscle inhibitory hormone myostatin (p < 0.05). Supporting the human data, significant reductions in adipose tissue mass were observed in the knockin mice. This was more significant in older mice in both backgrounds and appeared to be the result of reduced age-associated increases in fat mass. The older male knockin mice on C57BL/6j background also had increased grip strength (p < 0.01) and lower levels of myostatin (p < 0.05).Overall, these results prove that the rs373863828 A-allele is associated with a reduction of myostatin levels which likely contribute to an age-dependent lowering of fat mass, at least in males.Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).

Here, we analyze sequence data for 34,129 colorectal cancer (CRC) patients, capturing 3,434 PTEN mutations. We identify specific patterns of PTEN mutation associated with microsatellite stability/instability (MSS/MSI), tumor mutational burden (TMB), patient age, and tumor location. Within groups separated by MSS/MSI status, this identifies distinct profiles of nucleotide hotspots, and suggests differing profiles of protein-damaging effects of mutations. Moreover, discrete categories of PTEN mutations display non-identical patterns of co-occurrence with mutations in other genes important in CRC pathogenesis, including KRAS, APC, TP53, and PIK3CA. These data provide context for clinical targeting of proteins upstream and downstream of PTEN in distinct CRC cohorts.© 2022. The Author(s)."

Breast cancers in women of African ancestry (AA) are more likely to be TNBC and have somatic TP53 mutations than cancers in non-Hispanic White (NHW) women. Missense driver mutations in TP53 have varied functional impact including loss-of-function (LOF) or gain-of-function (GOF) activity, and dominant negative (DNE) effects. We aimed to determine if there were differences in somatic TP53 mutation types by patient ancestry or TNBC status.We identified breast cancer datasets with somatic TP53 mutation data, ancestry, age, and hormone receptor status. Mutations were classified for functional impact using published data and type of mutation. We assessed differences using Fisher's exact test.From 96 breast cancer studies, we identified 2964 women with somatic TP53 mutations: 715 (24.1%) Asian, 258 (8.7%) AA, 1931 (65.2%) NHW, and 60 (2%) Latina. The distribution of TP53 mutation type was similar by ancestry. However, 35.8% of tumors from NHW individuals had GOF mutations compared to 29% from AA individuals (p = 0.04). Mutations with DNE activity were positively associated with TNBC (OR 1.37, p = 0.03) and estrogen receptor (ER) negative status (OR 1.38; p = 0.005).Somatic TP53 mutation types did not differ by ancestry overall, but GOF mutations were more common in NHW women than AA women. ER-negative and TNBC tumors are less likely to have DNE+ TP53 mutations which could reflect biological processes. Larger cohorts and functional studies are needed to further elucidate these findings.© 2022. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."

These mutational signatures reflect the exogenous and endogenous origins of genetic damage as well as the capacity of hepatobiliary cells to repair and replicate DNA. Genomic analysis of thousands of patients with hepatobiliary cancers has highlighted the diversity of mutagenic processes active in these malignancies, highlighting a prominent source of the inter-cancer-type, inter-patient, intertumour and intratumoural heterogeneity that is observed clinically. However, a substantial proportion of mutational signatures detected in hepatocellular carcinoma and biliary tract cancer remain of unknown cause, emphasizing the important contribution of processes yet to be identified.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified risk loci, but some loci are associated with co-morbidities and are not specific to host-virus interactions. Here, we identify and experimentally validate a link between reduced expression of EXOSC2 and reduced SARS-CoV-2 replication. EXOSC2 was one of 332 host proteins examined, all of which interact directly with SARS-CoV-2 proteins; EXOSC2 interacts with Nsp8 which forms part of the viral RNA polymerase. Lung-specific eQTLs were identified from GTEx (v7) for each of the 332 host proteins. Aggregating COVID-19 GWAS statistics for gene-specific eQTLs revealed an association between increased expression ofEXOSC2and higher risk of clinical COVID-19 which survived stringent multiple testing correction. EXOSC2 is a component of the RNA exosome and indeed, LC-MS/MS analysis of protein pulldowns demonstrated an interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase and the majority of human RNA exosome components. CRISPR/Cas9 introduction of nonsense mutations withinEXOSC2in Calu-3 cells reduced EXOSC2 protein expression, impeded SARS-CoV-2 replication and upregulated oligoadenylate synthase (OAS)genes, which have been linked to a successful immune response against SARS-CoV-2. Reduced EXOSC2 expression did not reduce cellular viability. OAS gene expression changes occurred independent of infection and in the absence of significant upregulation of other interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Targeted depletion or functional inhibition of EXOSC2 may be a safe and effective strategy to protect at-risk individuals against clinical COVID-19."

Alarmingly, over the last several decades, the mean age at menarche (AAM) has decreased. Environmental endocrine disruptors (EEDs) are chemicals that may interfere with the endocrine system, resulting in adverse developmental, immunological, neurological, and reproductive effects in humans. Thus, the effects of EEDs on fertility and reproduction are growing concerns in modern societies. In this study, we aimed to determine the influence of genetic and environmental factors on AAM. We used data from an AAM genome-wide association study of 329,345 women to conduct a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) with FUSION software. As references, we determined the gene-expression levels in the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, ovaries, uterus, and whole blood. We performed Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analyses using the significantly dysregulated genes identified by the TWAS. Using the STRING database, we also generated a protein-protein-interaction network to analyze common AAM-specific genes identified by the TWAS with different tissues. We performed chemical-related gene set enrichment analysis (CGSEA) and identified significant TWAS genes to uncover relationships between different chemicals and AAM. The TWAS identified 9,848 genes; among these, 1580 genes were significant (P< 0.05), and 11 genes were significant among the hypothalamus, pituitary, ovary, uterus, and whole blood. CGSEA identified 1,634 chemicals, including 120 chemicals significantly correlated with AAM. In summary, we performed a TWAS (for genetic factors) and CGSEA (for environmental factors) focusing on AAM and identified several AAM-associated genes and EEDs. The results of this study expand our understanding of genetic and environmental factors related to the onset of female puberty.Copyright © 2022 Lu, Feng, Qin, Deng, Lian, Yin and Xiao."
"35235357","Likelihood-based Mendelian randomization analysis with automated instrument selection and horizontal pleiotropic modeling.","Sci Adv","Mendelian randomization (MR) is a common tool for identifying causal risk factors underlying diseases. Here, we present a method, MR with automated instrument determination (MRAID), for effective MR analysis. MRAID borrows ideas from fine-mapping analysis to model an initial set of candidate single-nucleotide polymorphisms that are in potentially high linkage disequilibrium with each other and automatically selects among them the suitable instruments for causal inference. MRAID also explicitly models both uncorrelated and correlated horizontal pleiotropic effects that are widespread for complex trait analysis. MRAID achieves both tasks through a joint likelihood framework and relies on a scalable sampling-based algorithm to compute calibratedPvalues. Comprehensive and realistic simulations show that MRAID can provide calibrated type I error control and reduce false positives while being more powerful than existing approaches. We illustrate the benefits of MRAID for an MR screening analysis across 645 trait pairs in U.K. Biobank, identifying multiple lifestyle causal risk factors of cardiovascular disease-related traits."

One such regulator is Krüppel-associated box (KRAB)-associated protein 1 (KAP1: also named TRIM28 or TIF1β), which has been extensively studied in the past three decades. Here we offer an up-to date review of its various functions in a diversity of contexts. We first summarize the discovery of KAP1 repression of endogenous retroviruses during development. We then deliberate evidence in the literature suggesting KAP1 is both an activator and repressor of HIV-1 transcription and discuss experimental differences and limitations of previous studies. Finally, we discuss KAP1 regulation of DNA and RNA viruses, and then expand on KAP1 control of cellular responses and immune functions. While KAP1 positive and negative regulation of viral and cellular transcriptional programs is vastly documented, our mechanistic understanding remains narrow. We thus propose that precision genetic tools to reveal direct KAP1 functions in gene regulation will be required to not only illuminate new biology but also provide the foundation to translate the basic discoveries from the bench to the clinics.Copyright © 2022 Randolph, Hyder and D’Orso."

However, the mechanisms underlying changes in DNA methylation remain elusive. Transcription factors initially thought to be repressed from binding by DNA methylation, have recently emerged as being able to shape DNA methylation patterns.Here, we integrated the massive amount of data available from The Cancer Genome Atlas to predict transcription factors driving aberrant DNA methylation in 13 cancer types. We identified differentially methylated regions between cancer and matching healthy samples, searched for transcription factor motifs enriched in those regions and selected transcription factors with corresponding changes in gene expression. We predict transcription factors known to be involved in cancer as well as novel candidates to drive hypo-methylated regions such as FOXA1 and GATA3 in breast cancer, FOXA1 and TWIST1 in prostate cancer and NFE2L2 in lung cancer. We also predict transcription factors that lead to hyper-methylated regions upon transcription factor loss such as EGR1 in several cancer types. Finally, we validate that FOXA1 and GATA3 mediate hypo-methylated regions in breast cancer cells.Our work highlights the importance of some transcription factors as upstream regulators shaping DNA methylation patterns in cancer.© 2022.

"35295547","An exposomic framework to uncover environmental drivers of aging.","Exposome","The exposome, the environmental complement of the genome, is an omics level characterization of an individual's exposures. There is growing interest in uncovering the role of the environment in human health using an exposomic framework that provides a systematic and unbiased analysis of the non-genetic drivers of health and disease. Many environmental toxicants are associated with molecular hallmarks of aging. An exposomic framework has potential to advance understanding of these associations and how modifications to the environment can promote healthy aging in the population. However, few studies have used this framework to study biological aging. We provide an overview of approaches and challenges in using an exposomic framework to investigate environmental drivers of aging. While capturing exposures over a life course is a daunting and expensive task, the use of historical data can be a practical way to approach this research.© The Author(s) 2022.

In this study, we constructed promoter- and enhancer-enriched nucleosomal histone modification landscapes for adult prefrontal cortex from H3-lysine 27 acetylation and H3-lysine 4 trimethylation profiles, generated from 388 controls and 351 individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia (SCZ) or bipolar disorder (BD) (n = 739). We mapped thousands of cis-regulatory domains (CRDs), revealing fine-grained, 104-106-bp chromosomal organization, firmly integrated into Hi-C topologically associating domain stratification by open/repressive chromosomal environments and nuclear topography. Large clusters of hyper-acetylated CRDs were enriched for SCZ heritability, with prominent representation of regulatory sequences governing fetal development and glutamatergic neuron signaling. Therefore, SCZ and BD brains show coordinated dysregulation of risk-associated regulatory sequences assembled into kilobase- to megabase-scaling chromosomal domains.© 2022.

Evidence from genetics, single-cell transcriptomics, and pharmacological studies suggest an important, but untested, overlap between genes involved in the etiology of schizophrenia and the cellular mechanisms of action of antipsychotics. To directly compare genes with antipsychotic-induced differential expression to genes involved in schizophrenia, we applied single-cell RNA-sequencing to striatal samples from male C57BL/6 J mice chronically exposed to a typical antipsychotic (haloperidol), an atypical antipsychotic (olanzapine), or placebo. We identified differentially expressed genes in three cell populations identified from the single-cell RNA-sequencing (medium spiny neurons [MSNs], microglia, and astrocytes) and applied multiple analysis pipelines to contextualize these findings, including comparison to GWAS results for schizophrenia. In MSNs in particular, differential expression analysis showed that there was a larger share of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from mice treated with olanzapine compared with haloperidol. DEGs were enriched in loci implicated by genetic studies of schizophrenia, and we highlighted nine genes with convergent evidence. Pathway analyses of gene expression in MSNs highlighted neuron/synapse development, alternative splicing, and mitochondrial function as particularly engaged by antipsychotics. In microglia, we identified pathways involved in microglial activation and inflammation as part of the antipsychotic response. In conclusion, single-cell RNA sequencing may provide important insights into antipsychotic mechanisms of action and links to findings from psychiatric genomic studies.© 2022.

"35301427","Convergence of case-specific epigenetic alterations identify a confluence of genetic vulnerabilities tied to opioid overdose.","Mol Psychiatry","Opioid use disorder is a highly heterogeneous disease driven by a variety of genetic and environmental risk factors which have yet to be fully elucidated. Opioid overdose, the most severe outcome of opioid use disorder, remains the leading cause of accidental death in the United States. We interrogated the effects of opioid overdose on the brain using ChIP-seq to quantify patterns of H3K27 acetylation in dorsolateral prefrontal cortical neurons isolated from 51 opioid-overdose cases and 51 accidental death controls. Among opioid cases, we observed global hypoacetylation and identified 388 putative enhancers consistently depleted for H3K27ac. Machine learning on H3K27ac patterns predicted case-control status with high accuracy. We focused on case-specific regulatory alterations, revealing 81,399 hypoacetylation events, uncovering vast inter-patient heterogeneity. We developed a strategy to decode this heterogeneity based on convergence analysis, which leveraged promoter-capture Hi-C to identify five genes over-burdened by alterations in their regulatory network or ""plexus"": ASTN2, KCNMA1, DUSP4, GABBR2, ENOX1. These convergent loci are enriched for opioid use disorder risk genes and heritability for generalized anxiety, number of sexual partners, and years of education. Overall, our multi-pronged approach uncovers neurobiological aspects of opioid use disorder and captures genetic and environmental factors perpetuating the opioid epidemic.© 2022.

"35296864","A single-cell atlas of human and mouse white adipose tissue.","Nature","White adipose tissue, once regarded as morphologically and functionally bland, is now recognized to be dynamic, plastic and heterogenous, and is involved in a wide array of biological processes including energy homeostasis, glucose and lipid handling, blood pressure control and host defence1. High-fat feeding and other metabolic stressors cause marked changes in adipose morphology, physiology and cellular composition1, and alterations in adiposity are associated with insulin resistance, dyslipidemia and type 2 diabetes2. Here we provide detailed cellular atlases of human and mouse subcutaneous and visceral white fat at single-cell resolution across a range of body weight. We identify subpopulations of adipocytes, adipose stem and progenitor cells, vascular and immune cells and demonstrate commonalities and differences across species and dietary conditions. We link specific cell types to increased risk of metabolic disease and provide an initial blueprint for a comprehensive set of interactions between individual cell types in the adipose niche in leanness and obesity. These data comprise an extensive resource for the exploration of genes, traits and cell types in the function of white adipose tissue across species, depots and nutritional conditions.© 2022.

"35267208","Evaluating risk for alcohol use disorder: Polygenic risk scores and family history.","Alcohol Clin Exp Res","Early identification of individuals at high risk for alcohol use disorder (AUD) coupled with prompt interventions could reduce the incidence of AUD. In this study, we investigated whether Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS) can be used to evaluate the risk for AUD and AUD severity (as measured by the number of DSM-5 AUD diagnostic criteria met) and compared their performance with a measure of family history of AUD.We studied individuals of European ancestry from the Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism (COGA). DSM-5 diagnostic criteria were available for 7203 individuals, of whom 3451 met criteria for DSM-IV alcohol dependence or DSM-5 AUD and 1616 were alcohol-exposed controls aged ≥21 years with no history of AUD or drug dependence. Further, 4842 individuals had a positive first-degree family history of AUD (FH+), 2722 had an unknown family history (FH?), and 336 had a negative family history (FH-). PRS were derived from a meta-analysis of a genome-wide association study of AUD from the Million Veteran Program and scores from the problem subscale of the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test in the UK Biobank. We used mixed models to test the association between PRS and risk for AUD and AUD severity.AUD cases had higher PRS than controls with PRS increasing as the number of DSM-5 diagnostic criteria increased (p-values ≤ 1.85E-05) in the full COGA sample, the FH+ subsample, and the FH? subsample. Individuals in the top decile of PRS had odds ratios (OR) for developing AUD of 1.96 (95% CI: 1.54 to 2.51, p-value = 7.57E-08) and 1.86 (95% CI: 1.35 to 2.56, p-value = 1.32E-04) in the full sample and the FH+ subsample, respectively. These values are comparable to previously reported ORs for a first-degree family history (1.91 to 2.38) estimated from national surveys. PRS were also significantly associated with the DSM-5 AUD diagnostic criterion count in the full sample, the FH+ subsample, and the FH? subsample (p-values ≤6.7E-11). PRS remained significantly associated with AUD and AUD severity after accounting for a family history of AUD (p-values ≤6.8E-10).Both PRS and family history were associated with AUD and AUD severity, indicating that these risk measures assess distinct aspects of liability to AUD traits.© 2022 by the Research Society on Alcoholism."
"35295982","Association Between Adipose Tissue Proton Density Fat Fraction, Resting Metabolic Rate and FTO Genotype in Humans.","Front Endocrinol (Lausanne)","The difference of proton density fat fraction (PDFF) between supraclavicular and gluteal adipose tissue might indicate the presence of brown adipose tissue (BAT). Aim of this cross-sectional study was to investigate the association between PDFF over the supraclavicular fat region as a proxy of BAT proportion and resting metabolic rate (RMR). In addition, the association between the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1421085 at thefat mass and obesity associated(FTO) gene locus and both PDFF and RMR was investigated.Anthropometric, clinical, and lifestyle data from 92 healthy adults (66.3% females, mean age: 36.2 ± 13.0 years, mean body mass index: 24.9 ± 5.4 kg/m2) were included in the analysis. The RMR was measured by indirect calorimetry. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used for the measurement of visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue (VAT, SAT) volumes and for the measurement of adipose tissue PDFF.Mean RMR of the whole group was 1 474.8 ± 242.2 kcal. Genotype data was available for 90 participants. After adjustment for age, sex, weight change and fat-free mass (FFM), no association was found between supraclavicular PDFF (p = 0.346) and gluteal PDFF (p = 0.252), respectively, and RMR, whereas statistically significant evidence for a negative association between delta PDFF (difference between gluteal PDFF and supraclavicular PDFF) and RMR (p = 0.027) was obtained. No statistically significant evidence was observed for perFTOrisk allele change in RMR, gluteal and supraclavicular PDFF maps or volumes of VAT and SAT.Supraclavicular PDFF as a surrogate marker of BAT presence is not a determinant of RMR under basal conditions. In the present study, theFTOrs1421085 variant is not associated with either RMR or PDFF. Further studies are needed to elucidate the effect of BAT on RMR.Copyright © 2022 Drabsch, Junker, Bayer, Wu, Held, Karampinos, Hauner and Holzapfel."
"35273399","Prediction of histone post-translational modification patterns based on nascent transcription data.","Nat Genet","The role of histone modifications in transcription remains incompletely understood. Here, we examine the relationship between histone modifications and transcription using experimental perturbations combined with sensitive machine-learning tools. Transcription predicted the variation in active histone marks and complex chromatin states, like bivalent promoters, down to single-nucleosome resolution and at an accuracy that rivaled the correspondence between independent ChIP-seq experiments. Blocking transcription rapidly removed two punctate marks, H3K4me3 and H3K27ac, from chromatin indicating that transcription is required for active histone modifications. Transcription was also required for maintenance of H3K27me3, consistent with a role for RNA in recruiting PRC2. A subset of DNase-I-hypersensitive sites were refractory to prediction, precluding models where transcription initiates pervasively at any open chromatin. Our results, in combination with past literature, support a model in which active histone modifications serve a supportive, rather than an essential regulatory, role in transcription.© 2022.

"35338122","Characterizing mood disorders in the AFFECT study: a large, longitudinal, and phenotypically rich genetic cohort in the US.","Transl Psychiatry","There has recently been marked progress in identifying genetic risk factors for major depression (MD) and bipolar disorder (BD); however, few systematic efforts have been made to elucidate heterogeneity that exists within and across these diagnostic taxa. The Affective disorders, Environment, and Cognitive Trait (AFFECT) study presents an opportunity to identify and associate the structure of cognition and symptom-level domains across the mood disorder spectrum in a prospective study from a diverse US population.Participants were recruited from the 23andMe, Inc research participant database and through social media; self-reported diagnosis of MD or BD by a medical professional and medication status data were used to enrich for mood-disorder cases. Remote assessments were used to acquire an extensive range of phenotypes, including mood state, transdiagnostic symptom severity, task-based measures of cognition, environmental exposures, personality traits. In this paper we describe the study design, and the demographic and clinical characteristics of the cohort. In addition we report genetic ancestry, SNP heritability, and genetic correlations with other large cohorts of mood disorders.A total of 48,467 participants were enrolled: 14,768 with MD, 9864 with BD, and 23,835 controls. Upon enrollment, 47% of participants with MD and 27% with BD indicated being in an active mood episode. Cases reported early ages of onset (mean = 13.2 and 14.3 years for MD and BD, respectively), and high levels of recurrence (78.6% and 84.9% with >5 episodes), psychotherapy, and psychotropic medication use. SNP heritability on the liability scale for the ascertained MD participants (0.19-0.21) was consistent with the high level of disease severity in this cohort, while BD heritability estimates (0.16-0.22) were comparable to reports in other large scale genomic studies of mood disorders. Genetic correlations between the AFFECT cohort and other large-scale cohorts were high for MD but not for BD. By incorporating transdiagnostic symptom assessments, repeated measures, and genomic data, the AFFECT study represents a unique resource for dissecting the structure of mood disorders across multiple levels of analysis. In addition, the fully remote nature of the study provides valuable insights for future virtual and decentralized clinical trials within mood disorders.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35332129","A genome-wide meta-analysis identifies 50 genetic loci associated with carpal tunnel syndrome.","Nat Commun","Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most common entrapment neuropathy and has a largely unknown underlying biology. In a genome-wide association study of CTS (48,843 cases and 1,190,837 controls), we found 53 sequence variants at 50 loci associated with the syndrome. The most significant association is with a missense variant (p.Glu366Lys) in SERPINA1 that protects against CTS (P = 2.9 × 10-24, OR = 0.76). Through various functional analyses, we conclude that at least 22 genes mediate CTS risk and highlight the role of 19 CTS variants in the biology of the extracellular matrix. We show that the genetic component to the risk is higher in bilateral/recurrent/persistent cases than nonrecurrent/nonpersistent cases. Anthropometric traits including height and BMI are genetically correlated with CTS, in addition to early hormonal-replacement therapy, osteoarthritis, and restlessness. Our findings suggest that the components of the extracellular matrix play a key role in the pathogenesis of CTS.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35321746","The relationships between women's reproductive factors: a Mendelian randomisation analysis.","BMC Med","Women's reproductive factors include their age at menarche and menopause, the age at which they start and stop having children and the number of children they have. Studies that have linked these factors with disease risk have largely investigated individual reproductive factors and have not considered the genetic correlation and total interplay that may occur between them. This study aimed to investigate the nature of the relationships between eight female reproductive factors.We used data from the UK Biobank and genetic consortia with data available for the following reproductive factors: age at menarche, age at menopause, age at first birth, age at last birth, number of births, being parous, age first had sexual intercourse and lifetime number of sexual partners. Linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC) was performed to investigate the genetic correlation between reproductive factors. We then applied Mendelian randomisation (MR) methods to estimate the causal relationships between these factors. Sensitivity analyses were used to investigate directionality of the effects, test for evidence of pleiotropy and account for sample overlap.LDSC indicated that most reproductive factors are genetically correlated (rgrange: |0.06-0.94|), though there was little evidence for genetic correlations between lifetime number of sexual partners and age at last birth, number of births and ever being parous (rg< 0.01). MR revealed potential causal relationships between many reproductive factors, including later age at menarche (1 SD increase) leading to a later age at first sexual intercourse (beta (B) = 0.09 SD, 95% confidence intervals (CI) = 0.06,0.11), age at first birth (B = 0.07 SD, CI = 0.04,0.10), age at last birth (B = 0.06 SD, CI = 0.04,0.09) and age at menopause (B = 0.06 SD, CI = 0.03,0.10). Later age at first birth was found to lead to a later age at menopause (B = 0.21 SD, CI = 0.13,0.29), age at last birth (B = 0.72 SD, CI = 0.67, 0.77) and a lower number of births (B = -0.38 SD, CI = -0.44, -0.32).This study presents evidence that women's reproductive factors are genetically correlated and causally related. Future studies examining the health sequelae of reproductive factors should consider a woman's entire reproductive history, including the causal interplay between reproductive factors.© 2022.

"35304435","Phenotypic and genetic analysis of a wellbeing factor score in the UK Biobank and the impact of childhood maltreatment and psychiatric illness.","Transl Psychiatry","Wellbeing is an important aspect of mental health that is moderately heritable. Specific wellbeing-related variants have been identified via GWAS meta-analysis of individual questionnaire items. However, a multi-item within-subject index score has potential to capture greater heritability, enabling improved delineation of genetic and phenotypic relationships across traits and exposures that are not possible on aggregate-data. This research employed data from the UK Biobank resource, and a wellbeing index score was derived from indices of happiness and satisfaction with family/friendship/finances/health, using principal component analysis. GWAS was performed in Caucasian participants (N = 129,237) using the derived wellbeing index, followed by polygenic profiling (independent sample; N = 23,703). The wellbeing index, its subcomponents, and negative indicators of mental health were compared via phenotypic and genetic correlations, and relationships with psychiatric disorders examined. Lastly, the impact of childhood maltreatment on wellbeing was investigated. Five independent genome-wide significant loci for wellbeing were identified. The wellbeing index had SNP-heritability of ~8.6%, and stronger phenotypic and genetic correlations with its subcomponents (0.55-0.77) than mental health phenotypes (-0.21 to -0.39). The wellbeing score was lower in participants reporting various psychiatric disorders compared to the total sample. Childhood maltreatment exposure was also associated with reduced wellbeing, and a moderate genetic correlation (rg = ~-0.56) suggests an overlap in heritability of maltreatment with wellbeing. Thus, wellbeing is negatively associated with both psychiatric disorders and childhood maltreatment. Although notable limitations, biases and assumptions are discussed, this within-cohort study aids the delineation of relationships between a quantitative wellbeing index and indices of mental health and early maltreatment.© 2022.

Current studies to identify which single-nucleotide polymorphism has undergone selection suffer from limited sample sizes and large uncertainties in the timing of selection. In this study, we advance the field by showing that a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on infant mortality rate can identify recent selection signals. Our study produces well-powered genome-wide maps for selection. It replicates two selection signals that were detected in a previous study using ancient DNA, substantially improves the resolution on the timing of selection, and provides evidence for very recent selection during World War II. It also provides fundamental insights into how to interpret GWAS results."
"35288712","An integrated framework for local genetic correlation analysis.","Nat Genet","Genetic correlation (rg) analysis is used to identify phenotypes that may have a shared genetic basis. Traditionally, rgis studied globally, considering only the average of the shared signal across the genome, although this approach may fail when the rgis confined to particular genomic regions or in opposing directions at different loci. Current tools for local rganalysis are restricted to analysis of two phenotypes. Here we introduce LAVA, an integrated framework for local rganalysis that, in addition to testing the standard bivariate local rgs between two phenotypes, can evaluate local heritabilities and analyze conditional genetic relations between several phenotypes using partial correlation and multiple regression. Applied to 25 behavioral and health phenotypes, we show considerable heterogeneity in the bivariate local rgs across the genome, which is often masked by the global rgpatterns, and demonstrate how our conditional approaches can elucidate more complex, multivariate genetic relations.© 2022.

"35200038","A large-scale genetic correlation scan between rheumatoid arthritis and human plasma protein.","Bone Joint Res","The aim of this study was to explore the genetic correlation and causal relationship between blood plasma proteins and rheumatoid arthritis (RA).Based on the genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary statistics of RA from European descent and the GWAS summary datasets of 3,622 plasma proteins, we explored the relationship between RA and plasma proteins from three aspects. First, linkage disequilibrium score regression (LD score regression) was applied to detect the genetic correlation between RA and plasma proteins. Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was then used to evaluate the causal association between RA and plasma proteins. Finally, GEO2R was used to screen the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between patients with RA and healthy controls.We found that seven kinds of plasma proteins had genetic correlations with RA, such as Soluble Receptor for Advanced Glycation End Products (sRAGE) (correlation coefficient = 0.2582, p = 0.049), vesicle transport protein USE1 (correlation coefficient = 0.1337, p = 0.018), and spermatogenesis-associated protein 20 (correlation coefficient = 0.3706, p = 0.018). There was a significant causal relationship between sRAGE and RA. By comparing the genes encoding seven plasma proteins, we found that only USE1 was a DEG associated with RA.Our study identified a set of candidate plasma proteins that showed signals correlated with RA. Since the results of this study need further experimental verification, they should be interpreted with caution. However, we hope that this paper will provide new insights for the discovery of pathogenic genes and RA pathogenesis in the future. Cite this article:Bone Joint Res 2022;11(2):134-142."

Here, we identify 46 loci associated with early childhood body mass index at specific ages, matching different child growth phases, and representing four major trajectory patterns. We perform genome-wide association studies across 12 time points from birth to 8 years in 28,681 children and their parents (27,088 mothers and 26,239 fathers) in the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study. Monogenic obesity genes are overrepresented near identified loci, and several complex association signals near LEPR, GLP1R, PCSK1 and KLF14 point towards a major influence for common variation affecting the leptin-melanocortin system in early life, providing a link to putative treatment strategies. We also demonstrate how different polygenic risk scores transition from birth to adult profiles through early child growth. In conclusion, our results offer a fine-grained characterization of a changing genetic landscape sustaining early childhood growth.© 2022.

"35299951","Genome-Wide Association Studies Provide Insight Into the Genetic Determination for Hyperpigmentation of the Visceral Peritoneum in Broilers.","Front Genet","Hyperpigmentation of the visceral peritoneum (HVP) has been becoming one of the most challenging problems in yellow-feathered chicken production, which seriously affected chicken carcass quality traits. Detecting which genes dominantly impact pigmentation in the peritoneum tissues is of great benefit to the genetic improvement of HVP. To investigate the genetic mechanism of HVP in yellow-feathered broilers, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) were conducted in the F2generation of a cross broiler population with 395 birds. A total of 115,706 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of 122,415 were retained to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated to HVP in chicken. The GWAS results based on the logistic mixed model (LMM) revealed that a narrow genomic location on chromosomes 1 (49.2-51.3 Mb) was significantly associated (p≤ 4.32 × 10-7) with HVP, which contained 23 SNP makers related to 14 functional genes (MFNG,POLDIP3,POLR2F,PICK1,PDXP,SGSM3,RANGAP1,MYH9,RPL3,GALP3,LGALS1,MICALL1,ATF4, andCYP2D6). Four highly associated (p< 10-5) haplotype blocks of 0.80 kb (two SNPs), 0.06 kb (two SNPs), 0.95 kb (two SNPs), and 0.03 kb (two SNPs) were identified with two, two, four, and four distinct haplotypes, respectively. As a melanoma-associated gene,CYP2D6were also possibly involved in the development of HVP occurring in chicken with two significant variations (rs314284996 and rs317955795) in the promoter regions. Further tests revealed that the expression ofCYP2D6was obviously higher in the visceral peritoneum tissue of chicken with HVP than that in the normal group (p< 0.05). Our results provide a novel clue to understand the genetic mechanism of HVP generation in chicken, and the mapped QTL or candidate genes might serve for genomic selection to improve carcass quality in the yellow-feathered chicken industry.Copyright © 2022 Zhou, Liu, Wang, Qu, Shu, Jia and Luo."
"35296640","Familial co-aggregation and shared heritability between depression, anxiety, obesity and substance use.","Transl Psychiatry","Depression, anxiety, obesity and substance use are heritable and often co-occur. However, the mechanisms underlying this co-occurrence are not fully understood. We estimated their familial aggregation and co-aggregation as well as heritabilities and genetic correlations to improve etiological understanding. Data came from the multi-generational population-based Lifelines Cohort Study (n = 162,439). Current depression and anxiety were determined using the MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview. Smoking, alcohol and drug use were assessed by self-report questionnaires. Body mass index (BMI) and obesity were calculated by measured height and weight. Modified Cox proportional hazards models estimated recurrence risk ratios (λR), and restricted maximum likelihood variance decomposition methods estimated heritabilities (h2) and genetic correlations (rG). All analyses were adjusted for age, age2, and sex. Depression, anxiety, obesity and substance use aggregated within families (λR first-degree relative = 1.08-2.74) as well as between spouses (λR = 1.11-6.60). All phenotypes were moderately heritable (from h2depression = 0.25 to h2BMI = 0.53). Depression, anxiety, obesity and smoking showed positive familial co-aggregation. That is, each of these traits confers increased risk on the other ones within families, consistent with the positive genetic correlations between these phenotypes (rG = 0.16-0.94). The exception was obesity, which showed a negative co-aggregation with alcohol and drug use and vice versa, consistent with the negative genetic correlations of BMI with alcohol (rG = -0.14) and soft drug use (rG = -0.10). Patterns of cross-phenotype recurrence risk highlight the co-occurrence among depression, anxiety, obesity and substance use within families. Patterns of genetic overlap between these phenotypes provide clues to uncovering the mechanisms underlying familial co-aggregation.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35235365","Tet-mediated DNA demethylation regulates specification of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells during mammalian embryogenesis.","Sci Adv","Ten-eleven translocation (Tet) enzymes promote DNA demethylation by oxidizing 5-methylcytosine. They are expressed during development and are essential for mouse gastrulation. However, their postgastrulation functions are not well established. We find that global or endothelial-specific loss of all three Tet enzymes immediately after gastrulation leads to reduced number of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) and lethality in mid-gestation mouse embryos. This is due to defects in specification of HSPCs from endothelial cells (ECs) that compromise primitive and definitive hematopoiesis. Mechanistically, loss of Tet enzymes in ECs led to hypermethylation and down-regulation of NFκB1 and master hematopoietic transcription factors (Gata1/2, Runx1, and Gfi1b). Restoring Tet catalytic activity or overexpression of these factors in Tet-deficient ECs rescued hematopoiesis defects. This establishes Tet enzymes as activators of hematopoiesis programs in ECs for specification of HSPCs during embryogenesis, which is distinct from their roles in adult hematopoiesis, with implications in deriving HSPCs from pluripotent cells."
"35337371","Considerations and challenges for sex-aware drug repurposing.","Biol Sex Differ","Sex differences are essential factors in disease etiology and manifestation in many diseases such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, and neurodegeneration [33]. The biological influence of sex differences (including genomic, epigenetic, hormonal, immunological, and metabolic differences between males and females) and the lack of biomedical studies considering sex differences in their study design has led to several policies. For example, the National Institute of Health's (NIH) sex as a biological variable (SABV) and Sex and Gender Equity in Research (SAGER) policies to motivate researchers to consider sex differences [204]. However, drug repurposing, a promising alternative to traditional drug discovery by identifying novel uses for FDA-approved drugs, lacks sex-aware methods that can improve the identification of drugs that have sex-specific responses [7, 11, 14, 33]. Sex-aware drug repurposing methods either select drug candidates that are more efficacious in one sex or deprioritize drug candidates based on if they are predicted to cause a sex-bias adverse event (SBAE), unintended therapeutic effects that are more likely to occur in one sex. Computational drug repurposing methods are encouraging approaches to develop for sex-aware drug repurposing because they can prioritize sex-specific drug candidates or SBAEs at lower cost and time than traditional drug discovery. Sex-aware methods currently exist for clinical, genomic, and transcriptomic information [1, 7, 155]. They have not expanded to other data types, such as DNA variation, which has been beneficial in other drug repurposing methods that do not consider sex [114]. Additionally, some sex-aware methods suffer from poorer performance because a disproportionate number of male and female samples are available to train computational methods [7]. However, there is development potential for several different categories (i.e., data mining, ligand binding predictions, molecular associations, and networks). Low-dimensional representations of molecular association and network approaches are also especially promising candidates for future sex-aware drug repurposing methodologies because they reduce the multiple hypothesis testing burden and capture sex-specific variation better than the other methods [151, 159]. Here we review how sex influences drug response, the current state of drug repurposing including with respect to sex-bias drug response, and how model organism study design choices influence drug repurposing validation.© 2022.

"35321220","Identifying large-scale interaction atlases using probabilistic graphs and external knowledge.","J Clin Transl Sci","Reconstruction of gene interaction networks from experimental data provides a deep understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms. The noisy nature of the data and the large size of the network make this a very challenging task. Complex approaches handle the stochastic nature of the data but can only do this for small networks; simpler, linear models generate large networks but with less reliability.We propose a divide-and-conquer approach using probabilistic graph representations and external knowledge. We cluster the experimental data and learn an interaction network for each cluster, which are merged using the interaction network for the representative genes selected for each cluster.We generated an interaction atlas for 337 human pathways yielding a network of 11,454 genes with 17,777 edges. Simulated gene expression data from this atlas formed the basis for reconstruction. Based on the area under the curve of the precision-recall curve, the proposed approach outperformed the baseline (random classifier) by ∼15-fold and conventional methods by ∼5-17-fold. The performance of the proposed workflow is significantly linked to the accuracy of the clustering step that tries to identify the modularity of the underlying biological mechanisms.We provide an interaction atlas generation workflow optimizing the algorithm/parameter selection. The proposed approach integrates external knowledge in the reconstruction of the interactome using probabilistic graphs. Network characterization and understanding long-range effects in interaction atlases provide means for comparative analysis with implications in biomarker discovery and therapeutic approaches.

"35278209","Distinct Epileptogenic Mechanisms Associated with Seizures in Wolf-Hirschhorn Syndrome.","Mol Neurobiol","Seizures are one of the clinical hallmarks of Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome (WHS), causing a significant impact on the life quality, still in the first years of life. Even that the knowledge about WHS-related seizure candidate genes has grown, cumulative evidence suggests synergic haploinsufficiency of distinct genes within cellular networks that should be better elucidated. Herein, we evaluated common mechanisms between candidate genes from WHS seizure-susceptibility regions (SSR) and genes globally associated with epilepsy. For this purpose, data from 94 WHS patients delineated by chromosomal microarray analysis were integrated into a tissue-specific gene network with gene expression, drugs, and biological processes. We found functional modules and signaling pathways involving candidate and new genes with potential involvement in the WHS-related seizure phenotype. The proximity among the previous reported haploinsufficient candidate genes (PIGG, CPLX1, CTBP1, LETM1) and disease genes associated with epilepsy suggests not just one, but different impaired mechanisms in cellular networks responsible for the balance of neuronal activity in WHS patients, from which neuron communication is the most impaired in WHS-related seizures.

"35310998","Association Between Extraversion Personality With the Blood Pressure Level in Adolescents.","Front Cardiovasc Med","The association between extraversion personality and high blood pressure (BP) has not been well-studied. This study aims to explore the association between extraversion personality and the BP level in a large sample of adolescents.As an ongoing study, 5,246 children aged 6-9 years were recruited using a stratified cluster sampling method in 2014. The extraversion personality trait, assessed by the Eysenck personality questionnaire (EPQ, answered by adolescents) in 2019, was used in the main analysis. A total of 3,407 participants were eligible and included in this analysis.The EPQ extraversion score was negatively associated with a systolic BP, a diastolic BP, and mean arterial pressure (MAP) in a univariate analysis. After adjusting for other covariates, high extraversion score was negatively associated with systolic BP (β = -0.026; 95% CI = -0.047, -0.004;p= 0.002). There was an interaction between regions and the extraversion score on systolic BP (Pinteraction= 0.037). The stratified analysis showed that, in rural areas, the extraversion score was negatively associated with systolic BP (β = -0.050; 95% CI = -0.081, -0.016;p= 0.004). However, we did find an association between the extraversion score and systolic BP in urban areas (β = 0.000; 95% CI = -0.028, 0.028;p= 0.996). Similar results were observed for the extraversion assessed by parents.We observed that extraversion personality was negatively associated with high BP in adolescents, especially for those who were living in rural areas. Our results suggested that a comprehensive intervention should be implemented to promote psychological health in adolescents.Copyright © 2022 Liang, Hao, Xiao, Luo, Zhang, Tang, Qu and Li."
"35296236","Extensive evaluation of ATAC-seq protocols for native or formaldehyde-fixed nuclei.","BMC Genomics","The ""Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin sequencing"" (ATAC-seq) is an efficient and easy to implement protocol to measure chromatin accessibility that has been widely used in multiple applications studying gene regulation. While several modifications or variants of the protocol have been published since it was first described, there has not yet been an extensive evaluation of the effects of specific protocol choices head-to-head in a consistent experimental setting. In this study, we tested multiple protocol options for major ATAC-seq components (including three reaction buffers, two reaction temperatures, two enzyme sources, and the use of either native or fixed nuclei) in a well-characterized cell line. With all possible combinations of components, we created 24 experimental conditions with four replicates for each (a total of 96 samples). In addition, we tested the 12 native conditions in a primary sample type (mouse lung tissue) with two different input amounts. Through these extensive comparisons, we were able to observe the effect of different ATAC-seq conditions on data quality and to examine the utility and potential redundancy of various quality metrics.In general, native samples yielded more peaks (particularly at loci not overlapping transcription start sites) than fixed samples, and the temperature at which the enzymatic reaction was carried out had a major impact on data quality metrics for both fixed and native nuclei. However, the effect of various conditions tested was not always consistent between the native and fixed samples. For example, the Nextera and Omni buffers were largely interchangeable across all other conditions, while the THS buffer resulted in markedly different profiles in native samples. In-house and commercial enzymes performed similarly.We found that the relationship between commonly used measures of library quality differed across temperature and fixation, and so evaluating multiple metrics in assessing the quality of a sample is recommended. Notably, we also found that these choices can bias the functional class of elements profiled and so we recommend evaluating several formulations in any new experiments. Finally, we hope the ATAC-seq workflow formulated in this study on crosslinked samples will help to profile archival clinical specimens.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35286690","The Concept of Immunogenetics.","Adv Exp Med Biol","Genetics plays a major role in shaping the immune responses in both physiological and pathological states such as psoriasis, alopecia areata, and other immune-mediated dermatological conditions. The genes encoding the elements of the immune system and its regulators are among the most polymorphous loci in the genome. Subtle variations in these genes can thus alter the balanced defensive responses of the immune system and make an individual liable to diseases and environmental triggers. Immunogenetics deals with finding the precise set of liability genes involved in the pathogenesis of specific complex diseases. In this chapter, we will briefly discuss the basic principles of genetic polymorphisms, the methods used in scanning these polymorphisms, and the strategies employed to find the role of these polymorphisms in complex diseases.© 2022.

Since the percentage of multi-exon genes that undergo alternative splicing is very high, identifying splice junctions is an attractive research topic with important implications.The aim of this paper is to develop a deep learning model capable of identifying splice junctions in RNA sequences using 13,666 unique sequences of primate RNA.A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network model is developed that classifies a given sequence as EI (Exon-Intron splice), IE (Intron-Exon splice), or N (No splice). The model is trained with groups of trinucleotides and its performance is tested using validation and test data to prevent bias.Model performance was measured using accuracy and f-score in test data. The finalized model achieved an average accuracy of 91.34% with an average f-score of 91.36% over 50 runs.Comparisons show a highly competitive model to recent Convolutional Neural Network structures.

However, the systematic topological classification of pairwise CTCF-CTCF interactions has not been yet explored. Here, we developed a computational pipeline able to classify all CTCF-CTCF pairs according to their chromatin interactions from Hi-C experiments. The interaction profiles of all CTCF-CTCF pairs were further structurally clustered using self-organizing feature maps and their functionality characterized by their epigenetic states. The resulting clusters were then input to a convolutional neural network aiming at thede novodetecting chromatin loops from Hi-C interaction matrices. Our new method, called LOOPbit, is able to automatically detect significant interactions with a higher proportion of enhancer-promoter loops compared to other callers. Our highly specific loop caller adds a new layer of detail to the link between chromatin structure and function.© The Author(s) 2022.

"35273803","A growth area: A review of the value of clinical studies of child growth for palaeopathology.","Evol Med Public Health","Studies of living children demonstrate that early life stress impacts linear growth outcomes. Stresses affecting linear growth may also impact later life health outcomes, including increased cardiometabolic disease risk. Palaeopathologists also assess the growth of children recovered from bioarchaeological contexts. Early life stresses are inferred to affect linear growth outcomes, and measurements of skeletal linear dimensions alongside other bioarchaeological information may indicate the types of challenges faced by past groups. In clinical settings, the impacts of stress on growing children are typically measured by examining height. Palaeopathologists are limited to examining bone dimensions directly and must grapple with incomplete pictures of childhood experiences that may affect growth. Palaeopathologists may use clinical growth studies to inform observations among past children; however, there may be issues with this approach. Here, we review the relationship between contemporary and palaeopathological studies of child and adolescent growth. We identify approaches to help bridge the gap between palaeopathological and biomedical growth studies. We advocate for: the creation of bone-specific growth reference information using medical imaging and greater examination of limb proportions; the inclusion of children from different global regions and life circumstances in contemporary bone growth studies; and greater collaboration and dialogue between palaeopathologists and clinicians as new studies are designed to assess linear growth past and present. We advocate for building stronger bridges between these fields to improve interpretations of growth patterns across human history and to potentially improve interventions for children living and growing today.© The Author(s) 2022.

"35338115","Complex roles of nicotinamide N-methyltransferase in cancer progression.","Cell Death Dis","Nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT) is an intracellular methyltransferase, catalyzing the N-methylation of nicotinamide (NAM) to form 1-methylnicotinamide (1-MNAM), in which S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) is the methyl donor. High expression of NNMT can alter cellular NAM and SAM levels, which in turn, affects nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)-dependent redox reactions and signaling pathways, and remodels cellular epigenetic states. Studies have revealed that NNMT plays critical roles in the occurrence and development of various cancers, and analysis of NNMT expression levels in different cancers from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset indicated that NNMT might be a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for tumor diagnosis and treatment. This review provides a comprehensive understanding of recent advances on NNMT functions in different tumors and deciphers the complex roles of NNMT in cancer progression.© 2022. The Author(s)."

In prion diseases, the profound associations with human aging, the effects of cell type and differentiation on in vitro susceptibility, and recently identified human risk factors, all implicate causal epigenetic mechanisms. Here, we review the current state of the art of epigenetics in prion diseases and its interaction with genetic determinants.

If unresolved, this leads to cell death. We report a role for iRhom pseudoproteases in controlling apoptosis due to persistent ER stress. Loss of iRhoms causes cells to be resistant to ER stress-induced apoptosis. iRhom1 and iRhom2 interact with IP3receptors, critical mediators of intracellular Ca2+signalling, and regulate ER stress-induced transport of Ca2+into mitochondria, a primary trigger of mitochondrial membrane depolarisation and cell death. iRhoms also bind to the anti-apoptotic regulator BCL-2, attenuating the inhibitory interaction between BCL-2 and IP3receptors, which promotes ER Ca2+release. The discovery of the participation of iRhoms in the control of ER stress-induced cell death further extends their potential pathological significance to include diseases dependent on protein misfolding and aggregation.© 2022.

"35281989","Molecular Mechanisms of Immunosenescene and Inflammaging: Relevance to the Immunopathogenesis and Treatment of Multiple Sclerosis.","Front Neurol","Aging is characterized, amongst other features, by a complex process of cellular senescence involving both innate and adaptive immunity, called immunosenescence and associated to inflammaging, a low-grade chronic inflammation. Both processes fuel each other and partially explain increasing incidence of cancers, infections, age-related autoimmunity, and vascular disease as well as a reduced response to vaccination. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a lifelong disease, for which considerable progress in disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) and management has improved long-term survival. However, disability progression, increasing with age and disease duration, remains. Neurologists are now involved in caring for elderly MS patients, with increasing comorbidities. Aging of the immune system therefore has relevant implications for MS pathogenesis, response to DMTs and the risks mediated by these treatments. We propose to review current evidence regarding markers and molecular mechanisms of immunosenescence and their relevance to understanding MS pathogenesis. We will focus on age-related changes in the innate and adaptive immune system in MS and other auto-immune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. The consequences of these immune changes on MS pathology, in interaction with the intrinsic aging process of central nervous system resident cells will be discussed. Finally, the impact of immunosenescence on disease evolution and on the safety and efficacy of current DMTs will be presented.Copyright © 2022 Perdaens and van Pesch."

The aim of this study was to (1) compare global DNA (gDNA) methylation and histone acetylation at LBP onset between the aLBP and cLBP participants, (2) compare mRNA expression of genes with known roles in the transduction, maintenance, and/or modulation of pain between the aLBP and cLBP participants, (3) compare somatosensory function and pain ratings in our participants, and (4) determine if the aforementioned measurements were associated.Methods:A total of 220 participants were recruited for this prospective observational study following recent onset of an episode of LBP. We retained 45 individuals whose gDNA was of sufficient quality for analysis. The final sample included 14 participants whose pain resolved within 6 weeks of onset (aLBP),15 participants that reported pain for 6 months (cLBP), and 16 healthy controls. Participants were subjected to quantitative sensory testing (QST), blood was drawn via venipuncture, gDNA isolated, and global DNA methylation and histone acetylation, as well as mRNA expression of 84 candidate genes, were measured.Results:Individuals that develop cLBP display multimodal somatosensory hypersensitivity relative to aLBP participants. cLBP participants also had significantly lower global DNA methylation, which was negatively correlated with interleukin-2 (IL2)mRNA expression.Discussion:cLBP is characterized by somatosensory hypersensitivity, lower global DNA methylation, and higherIL2expression level compared to those whose pain will resolve quickly (aLBP). These results suggest potential diagnostic and therapeutic relevance for global DNA methylation andIL2expression in the pathology underlying the transition from acute to chronic LBP.Copyright © 2021 Eller, Glidden, Knight, McKearney, Perry, Bernier Carney, Starkweather, Young and Baumbauer."

Revelations of behavioral outcomes after maternal deprivation in primates were followed by discoveries of systemic and brain growth factors mediated by the caregiver-offspring relationship in rodents. More recently, much of the genetic/epigenetic bases of maternal care has been defined and positively linked to adult health and cognitive ability in senescence. The history of this field is both tragic and fascinating. The early primate work, while informative, was abusive. The initial rodent work was ridiculed before its importance was recognized.

We designed this study to explore the prognostic value of ARGs and establish an ARG-based prognosis signature for LUSC patients. RNA-sequencing and corresponding clinicopathological data of patients with LUSC were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). The ARG risk signature was developed on the basis of results of LASSO and multivariate Cox analysis in the TCGA training dataset (n= 492). Furthermore, the GSE73403 dataset (n= 69) validated the prognostic performance of this ARG signature. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining was used to verify the expression of the ARGs in the signature. A five ARG-based signature, including A2M, CHEK2, ELN, FOS, and PLAU, was constructed in the TCGA dataset, and stratified patients into low- and high-risk groups with significantly different overall survival (OS) rates. The ARG risk score remained to be considered as an independent indicator of OS in the multivariate Cox regression model for LUSC patients. Then, a prognostic nomogram incorporating the ARG risk score with T-, N-, and M-classification was established. It achieved a good discriminative ability with a C-index of 0.628 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.586-0.671) in the TCGA cohort and 0.648 (95% CI: 0.535-0.762) in the GSE73403 dataset. Calibration curves displayed excellent agreement between the actual observations and the nomogram-predicted survival. The IHC staining discovered that these five ARGs were overexpression in LUSC tissues. Besides, the immune infiltration analysis in the TCGA cohort represented a distinctly differentiated infiltration of anti-tumor immune cells between the low- and high-risk groups. We identified a novel ARG-related prognostic signature, which may serve as a potential biomarker for individualized survival predictions and personalized therapeutic recommendation of anti-tumor immunity for patients with LUSC.Copyright © 2022 Zhai, Duan, Chen, Wang, Zhao, Wang, Rao, Lin and Long."

Extracellular RNAs (exRNAs) are one of the most diverse classes of molecular cargo, easily assayed by sequencing and with expressions that rapidly change in response to subject status. Despite diverse exRNA cargo, most evaluations from biofluids have focused on small RNA sequencing and analysis, specifically on microRNAs (miRNAs). Another goal of characterizing circulating molecular information, is to correlate expression to injuries associated with specific tissues of origin. Biomarker candidates are often described as being specific, enriched in a particular tissue or associated with a disease process. Likewise, miRNA data is often reported to be specific, enriched for a tissue, without rigorous testing to support the claim. Here we provide a tissue atlas of small RNAs from 30 different tissues and three different blood cell types. We analyzed the tissues for enrichment of small RNA sequences and assessed their expression in biofluids: plasma, cerebrospinal fluid, urine, and saliva. We employed published data sets representing physiological (resting vs. acute exercise) and pathologic states (early- vs. late-stage liver fibrosis, and differential subtypes of stroke) to determine differential tissue-enriched small RNAs. We also developed an online tool that provides information about exRNA sequences found in different biofluids and tissues. The data can be used to better understand the various types of small RNA sequences in different tissues as well as their potential release into biofluids, which should help in the validation or design of biomarker studies.Copyright © 2022 Alsop, Meechoovet, Kitchen, Sweeney, Beach, Serrano, Hutchins, Ghiran, Reiman, Syring, Hsieh, Courtright-Lim, Valkov, Whitsett, Rakela, Pockros, Rozowsky, Gallego, Huentelman, Shah, Nakaji, Kalani, Laurent, Das and Van Keuren-Jensen."

In germline tissues, piRNAs are amplified via a ""ping-pong cycle"" to produce secondary piRNAs, which act in transposon silencing. In contrast, the role of somatic-derived piRNAs remains obscure. Here, we investigated the identity and distribution of piRNAs in human somatic tissues to determine their function and potential role in Parkinson's disease (PD). Human datasets were curated from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and a workflow was developed to identify piRNAs, which revealed 902 somatic piRNAs of which 527 were expressed in the brain. These were mainly derived from chromosomes 1, 11, and 19 compared to the germline tissues, which were from 15 and 19. Approximately 20% of somatic piRNAs mapped to transposon 3' untranslated regions (UTRs), but a large proportion were sensed to the transcript in contrast to germline piRNAs. Gene set enrichment analysis suggested that somatic piRNAs function in neurodegenerative disease. piRNAs undergo dysregulation in different PD subtypes (PD and Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD)) and stages (premotor and motor). piR-has-92056, piR-hsa-150797, piR-hsa-347751, piR-hsa-1909905, piR-hsa-2476630, and piR-hsa-2834636 from blood small extracellular vesicles were identified as novel biomarkers for PD diagnosis using a sparse partial least square discriminant analysis (sPLS-DA) (accuracy: 92%, AUC = 0.89).

"35310547","The Effects of 30 Minutes of Artificial Gravity on Cognitive and Sensorimotor Performance in a Spaceflight Analog Environment.","Front Neural Circuits","The altered vestibular signaling and somatosensory unloading of microgravity result in sensory reweighting and adaptation to conflicting sensory inputs. Aftereffects of these adaptive changes are evident postflight as impairments in behaviors such as balance and gait. Microgravity also induces fluid shifts toward the head and an upward shift of the brain within the skull; these changes are well-replicated in strict head-down tilt bed rest (HDBR), a spaceflight analog environment. Artificial gravity (AG) is a potential countermeasure to mitigate these effects of microgravity. A previous study demonstrated that intermittent (six, 5-mins bouts per day) daily AG sessions were more efficacious at counteracting orthostatic intolerance in a 5 day HDBR study than continuous daily AG. Here we examined whether intermittent daily AG was also more effective than continuous dosing for mitigating brain and behavioral changes in response to 60 days of HDBR. Participants (n= 24) were split evenly between three groups. The first received 30 mins of continuous AG daily (cAG). The second received 30 mins of intermittent AG daily (6 bouts of 5 mins; iAG). The third received no AG (Ctrl). We collected a broad range of sensorimotor, cognitive, and brain structural and functional assessments before, during, and after the 60 days of HDBR. We observed no significant differences between the three groups in terms of HDBR-associated changes in cognition, balance, and functional mobility. Interestingly, the intermittent AG group reported less severe motion sickness symptoms than the continuous group during centrifugation; iAG motion sickness levels were not elevated above those of controls who did not undergo AG. They also had a shorter duration of post-AG illusory motion than cAG. Moreover, the two AG groups performed the paced auditory serial addition test weekly while undergoing AG; their performance was more accurate than that of controls, who performed the test while in HDBR. Although AG did not counteract HDBR-induced gait and balance declines, iAG did not cause motion sickness and was associated with better self-motion perception during AG ramp-down. Additionally, both AG groups had superior cognitive performance while undergoing AG relative to controls; this may reflect attention or motivation differences between the groups.Copyright © 2022 Tays, McGregor, Lee, Beltran, Kofman, De Dios, Mulder, Bloomberg, Mulavara, Wood and Seidler."

Mitochondria are the most important energy metabolism organelles, and some studies demonstrate that the areospace microgravity environment can cause mitochondrial dysfunction. However, the relationships between cognitive function decline and mitochondrial dysfunction in the microgravity environment have not been elucidated. In this study, we simulated the microgravity environment in the Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats by -30° tail suspension for 28 days. We then investigated the changes of mitochondrial morphology and proteomics in the hippocampus. The electron microscopy results showed that the 28-day tail suspension increased the mitochondria number and size of rat hippocampal neuronal soma. Using TMT-based proteomics analysis, we identified 163 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) between tail suspension and control samples, and among them, 128 proteins were upregulated and 35 proteins were downregulated. Functional and network analyses of the DEPs indicated that several of mitochondrial metabolic processes including the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle were altered by simulating microgravity (SM). We verified 3 upregulated proteins, aconitate hydratase (ACO2), dihydrolipoamide S-succinyltransferase (DLST), and citrate synthase (CS), in the TCA cycle process by western blotting and confirmed their differential expressions between tail suspension and control samples. Taken together, our results demonstrate that 28-day tail suspension can cause changes in the morphology and metabolic function of hippocampus mitochondria, which might represent a mechanism of cognitive disorder caused by aerospace microgravity."

This review presents gut microbiota as a real ""orchestra conductor"" in the host's physio(patho)logy due to its implications in many aspects of health and disease. Reciprocally, gut microbiota composition and activity are influenced by many different factors, such as diet and physical activity. Literature data have shown that macro- and micro-nutrients influence gut microbiota composition. Cumulative data indicate that gut bacteria are sensitive to modulation by physical activity, as shown by studies using training and hypoactivity models. Sports performance studies have also presented interesting and promising results. Therefore, gut microbiota could be considered a ""pivotal"" organ for health and sports performance, leading to a new concept: the nutrition-microbiota-physical activity triad. The next challenge for the scientific and medical communities is to test this concept in clinical studies. The long-term aim is to find the best combination of the three elements of this triad to optimize treatments, delay disease onset, or enhance sports performance.

However, the lengths of jagged ends in urinary DNA remained undetermined, as a previous method used for urinary DNA jagged end sequencing analysis (Jag-seq) relied on unmethylation at CpG sites, limiting the resolution. Here, we performed high-resolution Jag-seq analysis using methylation at non-CpG cytosine sites, allowing determination of exact length of jagged ends. The urinary DNA bore longer jagged ends (~26-nt) than plasma DNA (~17-nt). The jagged end length distribution displayed 10-nt periodicities in urinary DNA, which were much less observable in plasma DNA. Amplitude of the 10-nt periodicities increased in patients with renal cell carcinoma. Heparin treatment of urine diminished the 10-nt periodicities. The urinary DNA jagged ends often extended into nucleosomal cores, suggesting potential interactions with histones. This study has thus advanced our knowledge of jagged ends in urine DNA.© 2022.

This study aims to identify FC-specific methylation patterns that could distinguish between pre-malignant lesions and tumor tissues in NSCLC.We enrolled 52 patients with resectable NSCLC and collected resected tumor (TUM), tumor-adjacent (ADJ) and tumor-distant normal (DIS) tissue samples, among whom 36 qualified for subsequent analyses. Methylation levels were profiled by bisulfite sequencing using a custom lung-cancer methylation panel.ADJ and DIS samples demonstrated similar methylation profiles, which were distinct from distinct from that of TUM. Comparison of TUM and DIS profiles led to identification of 1740 tumor-specific differential methylated regions (DMRs), including 1675 hypermethylated and 65 hypomethylated (adjusted P < 0.05). Six of the top 10 tumor-specific hypermethylated regions were associated with cancer development. We then compared the TUM, ADJ, and DIS to further identify the progressively aggravating aberrant methylations during cancer initiation and early development. A total of 332 DMRs were identified, including a predominant proportion of 312 regions showing stepwise increase in methylation levels as the sample drew nearer to the tumor (i.e. DIS < ADJ < TUM) and 20 regions showing a stepwise decrease pattern. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) for KEGG and GO terms consistently suggested enrichment of DMRs located in transcription factor genes, suggesting a central role of epigenetic regulation of transcription factors in FC and tumorigenesis.We revealed distinct methylation patterns between pre-malignant lesions and malignant tumors, suggesting the essential role of DNA methylation as an early step in pre-malignant field defects. Moreover, our study also identified differentially methylated genes, especially transcription factors, that could potentially be used as markers for lung cancer screening and for mechanistic studies of FC and early cancer development.© 2022.

"35281787","Trained immunity: A Yin-Yang balance.","MedComm (2020)","Traditionally, immune memory is regarded as an exclusive hallmark of adaptive immunity. However, a growing body of evidence suggesting that innate immune cells show adaptive characteristics has challenged this dogma. In the past decade, trained immunity, a de facto innate immune memory, has been defined as a long-term functional reprogramming of cells of the innate immune system: the reprogramming is evoked by endogenous or exogenous insults, the cells return to a nonactivated state and subsequently show altered inflammatory responses against a second challenge. Trained immunity became regarded as a mechanism selected in evolution to protect against infection; however, a maladaptive effect might result in hyperinflammation. This dual effect is consistent with the Yin-Yang theory in traditional Chinese philosophy, in which Yang represents active, positive, and aggressive factors, whereas Yin represents passive, negative, and inhibitory factors. In this review, we give a brief overview of history and latest progress about trained immunity, including experimental models, inductors, molecular mechanisms, clinical application and so on. Moreover, this is the first time to put forward the theory of Yin-Yang balance to understand trained immunity. We envision that more efforts will be focused on developing novel immunotherapies targeting trained immunity in the coming years.© 2022 The Authors.

"35296667","Targeting SOX10-deficient cells to reduce the dormant-invasive phenotype state in melanoma.","Nat Commun","Cellular plasticity contributes to intra-tumoral heterogeneity and phenotype switching, which enable adaptation to metastatic microenvironments and resistance to therapies. Mechanisms underlying tumor cell plasticity remain poorly understood. SOX10, a neural crest lineage transcription factor, is heterogeneously expressed in melanomas. Loss of SOX10 reduces proliferation, leads to invasive properties, including the expression of mesenchymal genes and extracellular matrix, and promotes tolerance to BRAF and/or MEK inhibitors. We identify the class of cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein-1/2 (cIAP1/2) inhibitors as inducing cell death selectively in SOX10-deficient cells. Targeted therapy selects for SOX10 knockout cells underscoring their drug tolerant properties. Combining cIAP1/2 inhibitor with BRAF/MEK inhibitors delays the onset of acquired resistance in melanomas in vivo. These data suggest that SOX10 mediates phenotypic switching in cutaneous melanoma to produce a targeted inhibitor tolerant state that is likely a prelude to the acquisition of resistance. Furthermore, we provide a therapeutic strategy to selectively eliminate SOX10-deficient cells.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35295813","Profiling of diverse tumor types establishes the broad utility of VHL-based ProTaCs and triages candidate ubiquitin ligases.","iScience","The success of small molecule therapeutics that promotes degradation of critical cancer targets has fueled an intense effort to mimic this activity with bispecific molecules called PROTACs (proteolysis targeting chimeras). The simultaneous binding of PROTACs to a ligase and target can induce proximity-driven ubiquitination and degradation. VHL and CRBN are the two best characterized PROTAC ligases, but the rules governing their cellular activities remain unclear. To establish these requirements and extend them to new ligases, we screened a panel of 56 cell lines with two potent PROTACs that utilized VHL, MZ1, or CRBN, dBET1 to induce degradation of BRD4. With notable exceptions, MZ1 was broadly active in the panel whereas dBET1 was frequently inactive. A search for predictive biomarkers of PROTAC activity found that expression and mutation of VHL and CRBN were themselves predictors of PROTAC activity in the cell line panel.© 2022 The Author(s)."
"35286311","A network-based approach to integrate nutrient microenvironment in the prediction of synthetic lethality in cancer metabolism.","PLoS Comput Biol","Synthetic Lethality (SL) is currently defined as a type of genetic interaction in which the loss of function of either of two genes individually has limited effect in cell viability but inactivation of both genes simultaneously leads to cell death. Given the profound genomic aberrations acquired by tumor cells, which can be systematically identified with -omics data, SL is a promising concept in cancer research. In particular, SL has received much attention in the area of cancer metabolism, due to the fact that relevant functional alterations concentrate on key metabolic pathways that promote cellular proliferation. With the extensive prior knowledge about human metabolic networks, a number of computational methods have been developed to predict SL in cancer metabolism, including the genetic Minimal Cut Sets (gMCSs) approach. A major challenge in the application of SL approaches to cancer metabolism is to systematically integrate tumor microenvironment, given that genetic interactions and nutritional availability are interconnected to support proliferation. Here, we propose a more general definition of SL for cancer metabolism that combines genetic and environmental interactions, namely loss of gene functions and absence of nutrients in the environment. We extend our gMCSs approach to determine this new family of metabolic synthetic lethal interactions. A computational and experimental proof-of-concept is presented for predicting the lethality of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) inhibition in different environments. Finally, our approach is applied to identify extracellular nutrient dependences of tumor cells, elucidating cholesterol and myo-inositol depletion as potential vulnerabilities in different malignancies."
"35277192","Recent advances in the developmental origin of neuroblastoma: an overview.","J Exp Clin Cancer Res","Neuroblastoma (NB) is a pediatric tumor that originates from neural crest-derived cells undergoing a defective differentiation due to genomic and epigenetic impairments. Therefore, NB may arise at any final site reached by migrating neural crest cells (NCCs) and their progeny, preferentially in the adrenal medulla or in the para-spinal ganglia.NB shows a remarkable genetic heterogeneity including several chromosome/gene alterations and deregulated expression of key oncogenes that drive tumor initiation and promote disease progression.NB substantially contributes to childhood cancer mortality, with a survival rate of only 40% for high-risk patients suffering chemo-resistant relapse. Hence, NB remains a challenge in pediatric oncology and the need of designing new therapies targeted to specific genetic/epigenetic alterations become imperative to improve the outcome of high-risk NB patients with refractory disease or chemo-resistant relapse.In this review, we give a broad overview of the latest advances that have unraveled the developmental origin of NB and its complex epigenetic landscape.Single-cell RNA sequencing with spatial transcriptomics and lineage tracing have identified the NCC progeny involved in normal development and in NB oncogenesis, revealing that adrenal NB cells transcriptionally resemble immature neuroblasts or their closest progenitors. The comparison of adrenal NB cells from patients classified into risk subgroups with normal sympatho-adrenal cells has highlighted that tumor phenotype severity correlates with neuroblast differentiation grade.Transcriptional profiling of NB tumors has identified two cell identities that represent divergent differentiation states, i.e. undifferentiated mesenchymal (MES) and committed adrenergic (ADRN), able to interconvert by epigenetic reprogramming and to confer intra-tumoral heterogeneity and high plasticity to NB.Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing has disclosed the existence of two super-enhancers and their associated transcription factor networks underlying MES and ADRN identities and controlling NB gene expression programs.The discovery of NB-specific regulatory circuitries driving oncogenic transformation and maintaining the malignant state opens new perspectives on the design of innovative therapies targeted to the genetic and epigenetic determinants of NB. Remodeling the disrupted regulatory networks from a dysregulated expression, which blocks differentiation and enhances proliferation, toward a controlled expression that prompts the most differentiated state may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for NB.© 2022.

IQGAP3 plays a crucial part in the development and progression of several types of cancer. However, the prognostic, upstream-regulatory, and immunological roles of IQGAP3 in human cancer types are not known. We found that IQGAP3 expression was increased in different types of human cancer. The high expression of IQGAP3 was correlated with tumor stage, lymph node metastasis, and a poor prognosis in diverse types of human cancer. The DNA methylation of IQGAP3 was highly and negatively correlated with IQGAP3 expression in diverse cancer types. High DNA methylation in IQGAP3 was correlated with better overall survival in human cancer types. High mRNA expression of IQGAP3 was associated with tumor mutational burden, microsatellite instability, immune cell infiltration, and immune modulators. Analyses of signaling pathway enrichment showed that IQGAP3 was involved in the cell cycle. IQGAP3 expression was associated with sensitivity to a wide array of drugs in cancer cells lines. We revealed that polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 (PTBP1) and an IQGAP3-associated lncRNA (IQGAP3AR)/let-7c-5p axis were potential regulations for IQGAP3 expression. We provided the first evidence to show that an IQGAP3AR/let-7c-5p/IQGAP3 axis has indispensable roles in the progression and immune response in different types of human cancer.Copyright © 2022 Yuan, Jiang, Tang, Yang, Wang, Zhang and Duan."
"35264626","Computational identification of new potential transcriptional partners of ERRα in breast cancer cells: specific partners for specific targets.","Sci Rep","Estrogen related receptors are orphan members of the nuclear receptor superfamily acting as transcription factors (TFs). In contrast to classical nuclear receptors, the activities of the ERRs are not controlled by a natural ligand. Regulation of their activities thus relies on availability of transcriptional co-regulators. In this paper, we focus on ERRα, whose involvement in cancer progression has been broadly demonstrated. We propose a new approach to identify potential co-activators, starting from previously identified ERRα-activated genes in a breast cancer (BC) cell line. Considering mRNA gene expression from two sets of human BC cells as major endpoint, we used sparse partial least squares modeling to uncover new transcriptional regulators associated with ERRα. Among them, DDX21, MYBBP1A, NFKB1, and SETD7 are functionally relevant in MDA-MB-231 cells, specifically activating the expression of subsets of ERRα-activated genes. We studied SET7 in more details and showed its co-localization with ERRα and its ERRα-dependent transcriptional and phenotypic effects. Our results thus demonstrate the ability of a modeling approach to identify new transcriptional partners from gene expression. Finally, experimental results show that ERRα cooperates with distinct co-regulators to control the expression of distinct sets of target genes, thus reinforcing the combinatorial specificity of transcription.© 2022.

"35225231","Global and context-specific transcriptional consequences of oncogenic Fbw7 mutations.","Elife","The Fbw7 ubiquitin ligase targets many proteins for proteasomal degradation, which include oncogenic transcription factors (TFs) (e.g., c-Myc, c-Jun, and Notch). Fbw7 is a tumor suppressor and tumors often contain mutations inFBXW7, the gene that encodes Fbw7. The complexity of its substrate network has obscured the mechanisms of Fbw7-associated tumorigenesis, yet this understanding is needed for developing therapies. We used an integrated approach employing RNA-Seq and high-resolution mapping (cleavage under target and release using nuclease) of histone modifications and TF occupancy (c-Jun and c-Myc) to examine the combinatorial effects of misregulated Fbw7 substrates in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells with engineered tumor-associatedFBXW7null or missense mutations. Both Fbw7 mutations caused widespread transcriptional changes associated with active chromatin and altered TF occupancy: some were common to both Fbw7 mutant cell lines, whereas others were mutation specific. We identified loci where both Jun and Myc were coregulated by Fbw7, suggesting that substrates may have synergistic effects. One coregulated gene wasCIITA, the master regulator of MHC Class II gene expression. Fbw7 loss increased MHC Class II expression and Fbw7 mutations were correlated with increased CIITA expression in TCGA colorectal tumors and cell lines, which may have immunotherapeutic implications for Fbw7-associated cancers. Analogous studies in neural stem cells in whichFBXW7had been acutely deleted closely mirrored the results in CRC cells. Gene set enrichment analyses revealed Fbw7-associated pathways that were conserved across both cell types that may reflect fundamental Fbw7 functions. These analyses provide a framework for understanding normal and neoplastic context-specific Fbw7 functions.© 2022, Thirmanne et al."

The induction of severe neuropathy entails the dose reduction or complete elimination of bortezomib (BTZ). Interestingly, discontinuation of BTZ mostly results in a reduction or complete resolution of peripheral neuropathy (PN) symptoms. Therefore, it is likely that the BiPN mechanisms are based on temporary/reversible changes such as epigenetic alterations. In this study, we examined the effect of treating nerve cells, differentiated from the Lund human mesencephalic (dLUHMES) cell line, with several low-dose BTZ (0.15 nM) applications. We showed a significant decrease in global histone H3 acetylation as well as histone H3 lysine 9 acetylation. Moreover, analysis of the genetic microarray showed changes mainly in epigenetic processes related to chromatin rearrangement, chromatin silencing, and gene silencing. GSEA analysis revealed three interesting signaling pathways (SIRT1, B-WICH and, b-Catenin) that may play a pivotal role in PN development. We also performed an analysis of the miRNA microarray which showed the interactions of miR-6810-5p with the genesMSN, FOXM1, TSPAN9,andSLC1A5, which are directly involved in neuroprotective processes, neuronal differentiation, and signal transduction. The study confirmed the existence of BTZ-induced complex epigenetic alterations in nerve cells. However, further studies are necessary to assess the reversibility of epigenetic changes and their potential impact on the induction/resolution of PN."

Sleep disturbance resulting in daytime sleepiness is common in patients with NAFLD, but the effect of daytime sleepiness on HRQoL in NAFLD is unclear. The prevalence and natural history of NAFLD vary in different ethnic groups, but there has been limited ethnic diversity in HrQoL studies to date. We aimed to assess whether daytime sleepiness is independently associated with reduced HRQoL in an ethnically diverse UK population. We conducted HRQoL assessments using SF-36 version 2 and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) questionnaires in 192 people with NAFLD. Multivariate linear regression was used to identify factors independently affecting HRQoL scales. People with NAFLD reported significantly reduced physical health-related SF-36 scores compared to the general UK population. South Asian NAFLD patients reported impairment in physical health, but not mental health, approximately a decade before White NAFLD patients. In multivariate linear regression, daytime sleepiness (ESS score > 10), was the most significant independent predictor of reduced physical health. Age, BMI and liver stiffness score were also significantly associated. HRQoL is impaired earlier in patients of South Asian ethnicity. ESS score > 10, indicative of excessive daytime sleepiness, is an independent predictor of reduced HRQoL in people with NAFLD regardless of ethnicity. Daytime sleepiness should be considered as a contributing factor to reduced HRQoL in clinical practice and when evaluating patient-related outcomes in clinical trials.© 2022. The Author(s)."

Despite bulk studies focusing on intracellular mechanisms of PD inside DaNs, few studies have explored the pathogeneses outside DaNs, or between DaNs and other cells. Here, we set out to probe the implication of intercellular communication involving DaNs in the pathogeneses of PD at a systemic level with bioinformatics methods. We harvested three online published single-cell/single-nucleus transcriptomic sequencing (sc/snRNA-seq) datasets of human SN (GSE126838, GSE140231, and GSE157783) from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, and integrated them with one of the latest integration algorithms called Harmony. We then applied CellChat, the latest cell-cell communication analytic algorithm, to our integrated dataset. We first found that the overall communication quantity was decreased while the overall communication strength was enhanced in PD sample compared with control sample. We then focused on the intercellular communication where DaNs are involved, and found that the communications between DaNs and other cell types via certain signaling pathways were selectively altered in PD, including some growth factors, neurotrophic factors, chemokines, etc. pathways. Our bioinformatics analysis showed that the alteration in intercellular communications involving DaNs might be a previously underestimated aspect of PD pathogeneses with novel translational potential.Copyright © 2022 Huang, Xu, Liu, Huang, Tan and Chen."

The objective of this study is to review literature involved in AP-PE fields to perform a knowledge-map analysis and explore the collaborations, current hotspots, physiological applications, and future perspectives. Herein, cluster, co-citation, and co-occurrence analysis were applied using CiteSpace and VOSviewer software. The results demonstrated that AP-PE domains have been springing up and in rapid growth since the 21st century. Subsequently, active countries and institutions were identified, and the productive institutions were mainly located in USA, China, UK, Spain, and Canada. Developed countries seemed to be the major promoters. Additionally, subject analysis found that environmental science, public health, and sports medicine were the core subjects, and multidimensional communications were forming. Thereafter, a holistic presentation of reference co-citation clusters was conducted to discover the research topics and trace the development focuses. Youth, elite athletes, and rural population were regarded as the noteworthy subjects. Commuter exposure and moderate aerobic exercise represented the common research context and exercise strategy, respectively. Simultaneously, the research hotspots and application fields were elaborated by keyword co-occurrence distribution. It was noted that physiological adaptations including respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic, and mental health were the major themes; oxidative stress and inflammatory response were the mostly referred mechanisms. Finally, several challenges were proposed, which are beneficial to promote the development of the research field. Molecular mechanisms and specific pathways are still unknown and the equilibrium points and dose-effect relationships remain to be further explored.

Although few changes were shown between LCL and blood genotypes (SNPs) validating their use in genetics, more were highlighted for other genomic features and/or in their transcriptome and epigenome. This could render them less appropriate for these studies, notably when blood DNA could still be available. Here we developed a simple, high-throughput and cost-effective real-time PCR approach allowing to distinguish blood from LCL DNA samples based on the presence of EBV relative load and rearranged T-cell receptors γ and β. Our approach was able to achieve 98.5% sensitivity and 100% specificity on DNA of known origin (458 blood and 316 LCL DNA). It was further applied to 1957 DNA samples from the CEPH Aging cohort comprising DNA of uncertain origin, identifying 784 blood and 1016 LCL DNA. A subset of these DNA was further analyzed with an epigenetic clock indicating that DNA extracted from blood should be preferred to LCL for DNA methylation-based age prediction analysis.

To date, no studies have investigated genomic differences in hippocampal subregions, namely the dorsal (dHPC) and ventral (vHPC) hippocampus, in preclinical models treated with exogenous glucocorticoids. Chronic oral corticosterone (CORT) in mouse is a pharmacological approach that disrupts the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, increases affective behavior, and induces genomic changes after stress in the HPC of wildtype (WT) mice and mice heterozygous for the gene coding for brain-derived neurotrophic factor Val66Met (hMet), a variant associated with genetic susceptibility to stress. Using RNA-sequencing, we investigated the genomic signatures of oral CORT in the dHPC and vHPC of WT and hMet male and female mice, and examined sex and genotype differences in response to oral CORT. Males under CORT showed lower glycemia and increased anxiety- and depression-like behavior compared to females that showed instead opposite affective behavior in response to CORT. Rank-rank-hypergeometric overlap (RRHO) was used to identify genes from a continuous gradient of significancy that were concordant across groups. RRHO showed that CORT-induced differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in WT mice and hMet mice converged in the dHPC of males and females, while in the vHPC, DEGs converged in males and diverged in females. The vHPC showed a higher number of DEGs compared to the dHPC and exhibited sex differences related to glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-binding genes and epigenetic modifiers. Methyl-DNA-immunoprecipitation in the vHPC revealed differential methylation of the exons 1Cand 1Fof the GR gene (Nr3c1) in hMet females. Together, we report behavioral and endocrinological sex differences in response to CORT, as well as epigenetic signatures that i) differ in the dHPC and vHPC,ii) are distinct in males and females, and iii) implicate differential methylation of Nr3c1 selectively in hMet females.© 2022.

This study aimed to determine the plasticity of skeletal muscle DNA methylation in response to 8 weeks of supervised exercise training in volunteers with a range of insulin sensitivities. We studied 13 sedentary participants and performed euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamps with basal vastus lateralis muscle biopsies and peak aerobic activity (VO2 peak) tests before and after training. We extracted DNA from the muscle biopsies and performed global methylation using Illumina's Methylation EPIC 850K BeadChip. Training significantly increased peak aerobic capacity and insulin-stimulated glucose disposal. Fasting serum insulin and insulin levels during the steady state of the clamp were significantly lower post-training. Insulin clearance rates during the clamp increased following the training. We identified 13 increased and 90 decreased differentially methylated cytosines (DMCs) in response to 8 weeks of training. Of the 13 increased DMCs, 2 were within the following genes,FSTL3, andRP11-624M8.1. Of the 90 decreased DMCs, 9 were within the genesCNGA1,FCGR2A,KIF21A,MEIS1,NT5DC1,OR4D1,PRPF4B,SLC26A7, andZNF280C. Moreover, pathway analysis showed an enrichment in metabolic and actin-cytoskeleton pathways for the decreased DMCs, and for the increased DMCs, an enrichment in signal-dependent regulation of myogenesis, NOTCH2 activation and transmission, and SMAD2/3: SMAD4 transcriptional activity pathways.

DysregulatedFUBP1expression was observed in most cancer types, and highFUBP1expression suggests poor prognosis in cancers such as ACC, KICH, LIHC, LUAD, LUSC, SARC, CESC, and SKCM. Missense mutation is the most common type of FUBP1 mutation, and R430 in KH_4 is a predominant mutation site. Enhanced phosphorylation of FUBP1 at the S120 site has been observed in clear cell RCC, lung adenocarcinoma, and pediatric brain cancer specimens from African-American and Asian individuals. The expression ofFUBP1was found to be negatively correlated with the infiltration of CD8+T lymphocytes in GBM, HNSC-HPV- and UCEC but positively correlated with that of tumor-associated fibroblasts in CESC, ESCA, HNSC, LIHC, LUAD, PAAD, and THYM. Furthermore, RNA splicing and spliceosome signaling were predominantly enriched in both GO and KEGG analyses of the functional mechanism of FUBP1.

The rapid development of next-generation and single-cell sequencing technologies is now allowing the study of genetic mosaicism in normal tissues, revealing unprecedented insights into their clonal architecture and physiology. The somatic variant repertoire of an adult human neuron is the result of somatic mutations that accumulate in the brain by different mechanisms and at different rates during development and ageing. Non-pathogenic developmental mutations function as natural barcodes that once identified in deep bulk or single-cell sequencing can be used to retrospectively reconstruct human lineages. This approach has revealed novel insights into the clonal structure of the human brain, which is a mosaic of clones traceable to the early embryo that contribute differentially to the brain and distinct areas of the cortex. Some of the mutations happening during development, however, have a pathogenic effect and can contribute to some epileptic malformations of cortical development and autism spectrum disorder.

We have applied geoP to map eQTLs in 28 human tissues using the data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. We demonstrate that using ASE data not only substantially improve the power to detect eQTLs, but also allow us to quantify individual-specific genetic effects, which can be used to study the variation of eQTL effect sizes with respect to other covariates. We also compared two popular methods for eQTL mapping with ASE: TReCASE and RASQUAL. TReCASE is ten times or more faster than RASQUAL and it provides more robust type I error control."

We describe the significance of 5-hmC in DNA demethylation, the importance of substrates and cofactors in TET-mediated DNA hydroxymethylation, the regulation ofTETsand related genes (isocitrate dehydrogenases, fumarate hydratase, and succinate dehydrogenase), the cell-type dependency and genomic distribution of 5-hmC, and the functional role of 5-hmC in the epigenetic regulation of transcription. We showcase examples of studies on three major smoking-associated cancers, including lung, bladder, and colorectal cancers, to summarize the current state of knowledge, outstanding questions, and future direction in the field."

Although more than 200 SCZ-associated genes have been identified, the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we generated a Setd1a (SET domain containing 1A) haploinsufficiency mouse model to understand how this SCZ-associated epigenetic factor affects gene expression in brain regions highly relevant to SCZ. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that Setd1a heterozygosity causes highly variable transcriptional adaptations across different cell types in prefrontal cortex (PFC) and striatum. TheFoxp2+neurons exhibit the most prominent gene expression changes among the different neuron subtypes in PFC, which correlate with changes in histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation. Many of the genes dysregulated in Setd1a+/-mice are involved in neuron morphogenesis and synaptic function. Consistently, Setd1a+/-mice exhibit certain behavioral features of patients with SCZ. Collectively, our study establishes Setd1a+/-mice as a model for understanding SCZ and uncovers a complex brain region- and cell type-specific dysregulation that potentially underlies SCZ pathogenesis."

Meta-analyses of the DEGs were performed using the online analysis database ""NetworkAnalyst"". Aberrantly methylated gene loci were obtained from the GEO2R. Aberrantly methylated DEGs were obtained from Venn diagrams. The enrichment analysis was carried out on the ""Metascape"" website, and the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network construction, network analysis, and visualization of the analysis results were carried out on the ""String"" website using ""Cytoscape"" software.In total, 544 hypomethylation high-expression genes and 164 hypermethylation low-expression genes were obtained. The enrichment and PPI network analyses suggested that several pathways and hub genes with abnormal gene expression accompanied by methylation change, including inositol-trisphosphate 3-kinase B (ITPKB), G protein subunit beta 5 (GNB5), FYN proto-oncogene, Src family tyrosine kinase (FYN), LCK proto-oncogene, Src family tyrosine kinase (LCK), nuclear factor of activated T cells 1 (NFATC1), GNAS complex locus (GNAS), protein kinase C beta (PRKCB), zeta chain of T cell receptor associated protein kinase 70 (ZAP70), lysophosphatidic acid receptor 1 (LPAR1), protein kinase C epsilon (PRKCE), tumor protein p53 (TP53), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), fibronectin 1 (FN1), cyclin D1 (CCND1), vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), HRas proto-oncogene, GTPase (HRAS), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), amyloid beta precursor protein (APP), and matrix metallopeptidase 2 (MMP2), may be related to the occurrence of nasopharyngeal carcinoma .The identification of novel and important pathways and hub genes and their roles in the occurrence and development of NPC will guide clinical research and the development of pharmaceutical targets.2022 Annals of Translational Medicine.

"35272635","Genetic variants associated mRNA stability in lung.","BMC Genomics","Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) analyses have been widely used to identify genetic variants associated with gene expression levels to understand what molecular mechanisms underlie genetic traits. The resultant eQTLs might affect the expression of associated genes through transcriptional or post-transcriptional regulation. In this study, we attempt to distinguish these two types of regulation by identifying genetic variants associated with mRNA stability of genes (stQTLs).Here, we presented a computational framework that takes advantage of recently developed methods to infer the mRNA stability of genes based on RNA-seq data and performed association analysis to identify stQTLs. Using the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) lung RNA-Seq data, we identified a total of 142,801 stQTLs for 3942 genes and 186,132 eQTLs for 4751 genes from 15,122,700 genetic variants for 13,476 genes on the autosomes, respectively. Interestingly, our results indicated that stQTLs were enriched in the CDS and 3'UTR regions, while eQTLs are enriched in the CDS, 3'UTR, 5'UTR, and upstream regions. We also found that stQTLs are more likely than eQTLs to overlap with RNA binding protein (RBP) and microRNA (miRNA) binding sites. Our analyses demonstrate that simultaneous identification of stQTLs and eQTLs can provide more mechanistic insight on the association between genetic variants and gene expression levels.© 2022.

The present study sought to explore the relationship between TyG index and the incidence of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) in non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) patients implanted with drug-eluting stents (DESs).A total of 1108 participants were recruited to the study and assigned to two groups based on occurrence of CIN. TyG index was calculated as ln [fasting triglycerides (mg/dL) × fasting blood glucose (mg/dL)/2]. Baseline characteristics and incidence of CIN were compared between the two groups. Logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the relationship between TyG index and CIN.The results showed that 167 participants (15.1%) developed CIN. Subjects in the CIN group had a significantly higher TyG index compared with subjects in the non-CIN group (8.9 ± 0.7 vs. 9.3 ± 0.7, P<0.001). TyG index was significantly correlated with increased risk of CIN after adjusting for confounding factors irrespective of diabetes mellitus status and exhibited a J-shaped non-linear association. Subgroup analysis showed a significant gender difference in the relationship between TyG index and CIN. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis indicated that the risk assessment performance of TyG index was superior compared with other single metabolic indexes. Addition of TyG index to the baseline model increased the area under the curve from 0.713 (0.672-0.754) to 0.742 (0.702-0.782) and caused a reclassification improvement of 0.120 (0.092-0.149).The findings from the present study show that a high TyG index is significantly and independently associated with incidence of CIN in NSTE-ACS patients firstly implanted with DESs. Routine preoperative assessment of TyG index can alleviate CIN and TyG index provides a potential target for intervention in prevention of CIN.Copyright © 2022 Li, Li, Qin, Luo, Wang, Qiao, Tang and Yan."

Multiple studies have shown that procollagen lysyl-hydroxylase (PLOD) family genes were closely related to tumor progression and metastasis in a variety of human cancers. This study aimed to explore the prognosis and biological role of PLOD family genes in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD).GEPIA, GEO, HPA, CCLE, Kaplan-Meier plotter, cBioPortal, LinkedOmics, DAVID6.8, STRING, and TIMER were employed to determine the prognostic values and biological function of PLOD family members in PAAD.The mRNA and protein expression patterns of PLOD family members were noticeably up-regulated in PAAD compared with normal tissues. PLOD family gene expression was also up-regulated in pancreatic cancer cell lines. PLOD1 was correlated with histological and pathological grades of pancreatic cancer. PLOD2 was related to histological grade. The high expression of PLOD1-2 was correlated with the poor overall survival rate and relapse-free survival rate in patients with PAAD. Additionally, PLODs showed high sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing pancreatic cancer from normal tissues. Through the functional enrichment analysis of PLOD-related genes in PAAD, we found that PLODs were enriched in collagen fiber tissue structure, lysine degradation, and collagen biosynthesis. Pathway analysis confirmed that PLODs regulated the proliferation, migration, and metastasis of pancreatic cancer through the RalGEF-Ral signaling pathway. Furthermore, the level of expression of PLOD1-2 was positively correlated with the activity of tumor-infiltrating immune cells, including CD8+T cells, neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells. The level of expression of PLOD3 was inversely correlated with the level of infiltration of CD8+T cells. PLOD1 and PLOD2 were highly expressed in pancreatic cancer tissues with TP53 and KRAS mutations, respectively. However, the level of expression of PLOD3 in SMAD4 wild-type pancreatic cancer was increased.The findings showed that individual PLOD genes or PLOD family genes could be potential prognostic biomarkers for PAAD.© 2022 Zhang et al."

Classification models, including least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest, were adopted for identifying candidate ICM-specific genes for ICM. Immune cell infiltrates were estimated using the CIBERSORT method. Expressions of candidate genes were verified in ICM and healthy myocardial tissuesviaWestern blotting. JC-1 staining, flow cytometry, and TUNEL staining were presented in hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R)-stimulated H9C2 cells with TRMT5 deficiency.Results:Following the integration of three feature selection methods, we identified seven candidate ICM-specific genes including ASPN, TRMT5, LUM, FCN3, CNN1, PCNT, and HOPX. ROC curves confirmed the excellent diagnostic efficacy of this combination of previous candidate genes in ICM. Most of them presented prominent interactions with immune cell infiltrates. Their deregulations were confirmed in ICM than healthy myocardial tissues. TRMT5 expressions were remarkedly upregulated in H/R-stimulated H9C2 cells.

However, the underlying genetic pathophysiology of otologic disorders in TS is mostly unclear.Methods:Ear-related genes of TS (TSEs) were identified by analyzing differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in two Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)-derived expression profiles and ear-genes in the Comparative Toxicogenomic Database (CTD). Subsequently, Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and Disease Ontology (DO) analyses; Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA); and Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) were adopted to study biological functions. Moreover, hub genes within the TSEs were identified by assessing protein-protein interaction (PPI), gene-microRNA, and gene-transcription factor (TF) networks. Drug-Gene Interaction Database (DGIdb) analysis was performed to predict molecular drugs for TS. Furthermore, three machine-learning analysis outcomes were comprehensively compared to explore optimal biomarkers of otologic disorders in TS. Finally, immune cell infiltration was analyzed.Results:The TSEs included 30 significantly upregulated genes and 14 significantly downregulated genes. Enrichment analyses suggested that TSEs play crucial roles in inflammatory responses, phospholipid and glycerolipid metabolism, transcriptional processes, and epigenetic processes, such as histone acetylation, and their importance for inner ear development. Subsequently, we described three hub genes in the PPI network and confirmed their involvement in Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and immune cell regulation and roles in maintaining normal auditory function. We also constructed gene-microRNA and gene-TF networks. A novel biomarker (SLC25A6) of the pathogenesis of otologic disorders in TS was identified by comprehensive comparisons of three machine-learning analyses with the best predictive performance. Potential therapeutic agents in TS were predicted using the DGIdb.

"35234913","GREEN-DB: a framework for the annotation and prioritization of non-coding regulatory variants from whole-genome sequencing data.","Nucleic Acids Res","Non-coding variants have long been recognized as important contributors to common disease risks, but with the expansion of clinical whole genome sequencing, examples of rare, high-impact non-coding variants are also accumulating. Despite recent advances in the study of regulatory elements and the availability of specialized data collections, the systematic annotation of non-coding variants from genome sequencing remains challenging. Here, we propose a new framework for the prioritization of non-coding regulatory variants that integrates information about regulatory regions with prediction scores and HPO-based prioritization. Firstly, we created a comprehensive collection of annotations for regulatory regions including a database of 2.4 million regulatory elements (GREEN-DB) annotated with controlled gene(s), tissue(s) and associated phenotype(s) where available. Secondly, we calculated a variation constraint metric and showed that constrained regulatory regions associate with disease-associated genes and essential genes from mouse knock-outs. Thirdly, we compared 19 non-coding impact prediction scores providing suggestions for variant prioritization. Finally, we developed a VCF annotation tool (GREEN-VARAN) that can integrate all these elements to annotate variants for their potential regulatory impact. In our evaluation, we show that GREEN-DB can capture previously published disease-associated non-coding variants as well as identify additional candidate disease genes in trio analyses.© The Author(s) 2022.

"35338361","Histone post-translational modifications - cause and consequence of genome function.","Nat Rev Genet","Much has been learned since the early 1960s about histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) and how they affect DNA-templated processes at the molecular level. This understanding has been bolstered in the past decade by the identification of new types of histone PTM, the advent of new genome-wide mapping approaches and methods to deposit or remove PTMs in a locally and temporally controlled manner. Now, with the availability of vast amounts of data across various biological systems, the functional role of PTMs in important processes (such as transcription, recombination, replication, DNA repair and the modulation of genomic architecture) is slowly emerging. This Review explores the contribution of histone PTMs to the regulation of genome function by discussing when these modifications play a causative (or instructive) role in DNA-templated processes and when they are deposited as a consequence of such processes, to reinforce and record the event. Important advances in the field showing that histone PTMs can exert both direct and indirect effects on genome function are also presented.© 2022. Springer Nature Limited."
"35245449","Selective chemical tracking of Dnmt1 catalytic activity in live cells.","Mol Cell","Enzymatic methylation of cytosine to 5-methylcytosine in DNA is a fundamental epigenetic mechanism involved in mammalian development and disease. DNA methylation is brought about by collective action of three AdoMet-dependent DNA methyltransferases, whose catalytic interactions and temporal interplay are poorly understood. We used structure-guided engineering of the Dnmt1 methyltransferase to enable catalytic transfer of azide tags onto DNA from a synthetic cofactor analog, Ado-6-azide, in vitro. We then CRISPR-edited the Dnmt1 locus in mouse embryonic stem cells to install the engineered codon, which, following pulse internalization of the Ado-6-azide cofactor by electroporation, permitted selective azide tagging of Dnmt1-specific genomic targets in cellulo. The deposited covalent tags were exploited as ""click"" handles for reading adjoining sequences and precise genomic mapping of the methylation sites. The proposed approach, Dnmt-TOP-seq, enables high-resolution temporal tracking of the Dnmt1 catalysis in mammalian cells, paving the way to selective studies of other methylation pathways in eukaryotic systems.Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).

"35259165","THUNDER: A reference-free deconvolution method to infer cell type proportions from bulk Hi-C data.","PLoS Genet","Hi-C data provide population averaged estimates of three-dimensional chromatin contacts across cell types and states in bulk samples. Effective analysis of Hi-C data entails controlling for the potential confounding factor of differential cell type proportions across heterogeneous bulk samples. We propose a novel unsupervised deconvolution method for inferring cell type composition from bulk Hi-C data, the Two-step Hi-c UNsupervised DEconvolution appRoach (THUNDER). We conducted extensive simulations to test THUNDER based on combining two published single-cell Hi-C (scHi-C) datasets. THUNDER more accurately estimates the underlying cell type proportions compared to reference-free methods (e.g., TOAST, and NMF) and is more robust than reference-dependent methods (e.g. MuSiC). We further demonstrate the practical utility of THUNDER to estimate cell type proportions and identify cell-type-specific interactions in Hi-C data from adult human cortex tissue samples. THUNDER will be a useful tool in adjusting for varying cell type composition in population samples, facilitating valid and more powerful downstream analysis such as differential chromatin organization studies. Additionally, THUNDER estimated contact profiles provide a useful exploratory framework to investigate cell-type-specificity of the chromatin interactome while experimental data is still rare."

Telomere length and mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNAcn) are sensitive to oxidative stress damage.Objective:To study the association between prenatal exposure to ambient nitrogen oxides (NOx, a marker for traffic-related air pollution), and PE, as well as potential mediation effects by placental telomere length and mtDNAcn.Methods:This is a cross-sectional study of 42 preeclamptic and 95 arbitrarily selected normotensive pregnant women with gestational ambient NOxexposure assessment in southern Scania, Sweden. Hourly concentrations of NOxwere estimated at the residential addresses by a Gaussian-plume dispersion model with 100 × 100 m spatial resolutions and aggregated into trimester-specific mean concentrations. Placental relative mtDNAcn and telomere length were measured using qPCR. Linear and logistic regression models were used to investigate associations, adjusted for perinatal and seasonal characteristics.Results:Exposure was categorized into low and high exposures by median cut-offs during first [11.9 μg/m3; interquartile range (IQR) 7.9, 17.9], second (11.6 μg/m3; IQR: 7.1, 21.1), third trimesters (11.9 μg/m3; IQR: 7.7, 19.5) and entire pregnancy (12.0 μg/m3; IQR: 7.6, 20.1). Increased risk of PE was found for high prenatal NOxexposure during the first trimester (OR 4.0; 95% CI: 1.4, 11.1;p= 0.008), and entire pregnancy (OR 3.7; 95% CI: 1.3, 10.4;p= 0.012). High exposed group during the first trimester had lower placental relative mtDNAcn compared with low exposed group (-0.20; 95% CI: -0.36, -0.04;p= 0.01). Changes in relative mtDNAcn did not mediate the association between prenatal NOxexposure and PE. No statistically significant association was found between placental relative telomere length, prenatal NOxexposure and PE.Conclusion:In this region with relatively low levels of air pollution, ambient NOxexposure during the first trimester was associated with reduced placental relative mtDNAcn and an increased risk of PE. However, we did not find any evidence that mtDNAcn or TL mediated the association between air pollution and PE. Future research should further investigate the role of mtDNAcn for pregnancy complications in relation to exposure to ambient air pollution during pregnancy.Copyright © 2021 Mandakh, Oudin, Erlandsson, Isaxon, Hansson, Broberg and Malmqvist."

With Nanopore technology, differential methylation modifications including 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and 6-methyladenine (6mA) can be identified. 5mC is the most important modification in mammals, although 6mA may also function in growth and development as well as in pathogenesis. While the role of 5mC at CpG islands in promoter regions associated with transcriptional regulation has been well studied, but the relationship between 6mA and transcription is still unclear. Thus, we collected two pairs of tumor tissues and adjacent normal tissues from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) surgical samples for Nanopore sequencing and transcriptome sequencing. It was found that 2,373 genes had both 5mC and 6mA, along with up- and down-regulated methylation sites. These genes were regarded as unstable methylation genes. Compared with 6mA, 5mC had more inclined distribution of unstable methylation sites. Chi-square test showed that the levels of 5mC were consistent with both up- and down-regulated genes, but 6mA was not significant. Moreover, the top three unstable methylation genes, TBC1D3H, CSMD1, and ROBO2, were all related to cancer. Transcriptome and survival analyses revealed four potential tumor suppressor genes including KCNIP4, CACNA1C, PACRG, and ST6GALNAC3. In this study, we firstly proposed to combine 5mC and 6mA methylation sites to explore functional genes, and further research found top of these unstable methylation genes might be functional and some of them could serve as potential tumor suppressor genes.

The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) has, however, been able to determine whether there are associations between grandparental exposures and their grandchildren's development. Several of our studies, including sensitivity to loud noise, have shown associations between a grandmother smoking in pregnancy and the phenotype of the grandchild. These results were mostly specific to the sex of the grandchild and to whether the prenatal (i.e. during pregnancy) smoking occurred in the maternal or paternal grandmother. Here, we have used ancestral data on prenatal smoking among the grandmothers of the ALSPAC index children to examine possible effects on the grandchild's ability to detect the bitter taste of PROP (6 n-propylthiouracil), distinguishing between the 10% deemed 'extreme tasters', and the rest of the population (totalN = 4656 children). We showed that grandchildren whose paternal (but not maternal) grandmothers had smoked in pregnancy were more likely than those of non-smoking grandmothers to be extreme tasters [odds ratio (OR) 1.28; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03, 1.59] and that this was more likely in granddaughters (OR 1.42; 95% CI 1.03, 1.95) than grandsons (OR 1.18; 95% CI 0.88, 1.60). This pattern of association between paternal foetal exposure and the granddaughter's development has been found with several other outcomes, suggesting that investigations should be undertaken to investigate possible mechanisms.© The Author(s) 2022.

"35269539","A Mechanistic Theory of Development-Aging Continuity in Humans and Other Mammals.","Cells","There is consensus among biogerontologists that aging occurs either as the result of a purposeful genome-based, evolved program or due to spontaneous, randomly occurring, maladaptive events. Neither concept has yet identified a specific mechanism to explain aging's emergence and acceleration during mid-life and beyond. Presented herein is a novel, unifying mechanism with empirical evidence that describes how aging becomes continuous with development. It assumes that aging emerges from deterioration of a regulatory process that directs morphogenesis and morphostasis. The regulatory system consists of a genome-wide ""backbone"" within which its specific genes are differentially expressed by the local epigenetic landscapes of cells and tissues within which they reside, thereby explaining its holistic nature. Morphostasis evolved in humans to ensure the nurturing of dependent offspring during the first decade of young adulthood when peak parental vitality prevails in the absence of aging. The strict redundancy of each morphostasis regulatory cycle requires sensitive dependence upon initial conditions to avoid initiating deterministic chaos behavior. However, when natural selection declines as midlife approaches, persistent, progressive, and specific DNA damage and misrepair changes the initial conditions of the regulatory process, thereby compromising morphostasis regulatory redundancy, instigating chaos, initiating senescence, and accelerating aging thereafter."

Parkinson's disease (PD) heterogeneity among individuals proves the existence of disease subtypes, so subgrouping patients is vital for better understanding disease mechanisms and designing precise treatment. The purpose of this study was to identify PD subtypes using RNA-Seq data in a combined pipeline including unsupervised machine learning, bioinformatics, and network analysis. Two hundred and ten post mortem brain RNA-Seq samples from PD (n= 115) and normal controls (NCs,n= 95) were obtained with systematic data retrieval following PRISMA statements and a fully data-driven clustering pipeline was performed to identify PD subtypes. Bioinformatics and network analyses were performed to characterize the disease mechanisms of the identified PD subtypes and to identify target genes for drug repurposing. Two PD clusters were identified and 42 DEGs were found (padjusted ≤ 0.01). PD clusters had significantly different gene network structures (p&lt; 0.0001) and phenotype-specific disease mechanisms, highlighting the differential involvement of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway regulating adult neurogenesis.NEUROD1was identified as a key regulator of gene networks and ISX9 and PD98059 were identified asNEUROD1-interacting compounds with disease-modifying potential, reducing the effects of dopaminergic neurodegeneration. This hybrid data analysis approach could enable precision medicine applications by providing insights for the identification and characterization of pathological subtypes. This workflow has proven useful on PD brain RNA-Seq, but its application to other neurodegenerative diseases is encouraged."

It is a long time since the researchers used cancer cell lines and animals as the study subject. However, these models possess various limitations to reflect the cancer progression in the human body. Organoids have more clinical significance than cell lines, and they also bridge the gap between animal models and humans. Patient-derived organoids are three-dimensional cultures that simulate the tumor characteristicsin vivoand recapitulate tumor cell heterogeneity. Therefore, the emergence of colorectal cancer organoids provides an unprecedented opportunity for colorectal cancer research. It retains the molecular and cellular composition of the original tumor and has a high degree of homology and complexity with patient tissues. Patient-derived colorectal cancer organoids, as personalized tumor organoids, can more accurately simulate colorectal cancer patients' occurrence, development, metastasis, and predict drug response in colorectal cancer patients. Colorectal cancer organoids show great potential for application, especially preclinical drug screening and prediction of patient response to selected treatment options. Here, we reviewed the application of colorectal cancer organoids in disease model construction, basic biological research, organoid biobank construction, drug screening and personalized medicine, drug development, drug toxicity and safety, and regenerative medicine. In addition, we also displayed the current limitations and challenges of organoids and discussed the future development direction of organoids in combination with other technologies.

The intrinsic ability to maintain genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity of tumours allows for the reconciliation of shortcomings in traditional cancer models. While their utility in preclinical studies have been well established, little progress has been made in translational research and clinical trials. In this review, we identify the major bottlenecks preventing patient-derived tumour organoids (PDTOs) from being used in clinical setting. Unsuitable methods of tissue acquisition, disparities in establishment rates and a lengthy timeline are the limiting factors for use of PDTOs in clinical application. Potential strategies to overcome this include liquid biopsies via circulating tumour cells (CTCs), an automated organoid platform and optical metabolic imaging (OMI). These proposed solutions accelerate and optimize the workflow of a clinical organoid drug screening.

In mouse models, reduction of the stroma increased the proportion of poorly differentiated PDAC with a worse prognosis. Here, we aimed to clarify the effects of stroma on PDAC that may define the PDAC phenotype and induce distinct therapeutic responses.The molecular features of PDAC based on differentiation grade were clarified by genome and transcriptome analysis using PDAC organoids (PDOs). We identified the dependency on niche factors that might regulate the differentiation grade. A three-dimensional co-culture model with cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) was generated to determine whether CAFs provide niche factors essential for differentiated PDAC. PDOs were subtyped based on niche factor dependency, and the therapeutic responses for each subtype were compared.The expression profiles of PDOs differed depending on the differentiation grade. Consistent with the distinct profiles, well differentiated types showed high niche dependency, while poorly differentiated types showed low niche dependency. The three-dimensional co-culture model revealed that well differentiated PDOs were strongly dependent on CAFs for growth, and moderately differentiated PDOs showed plasticity to change morphology depending on CAFs. Differentiated PDOs upregulated the expression of mevalonate pathway-related genes correlated with the niche dependency and were more sensitive to simvastatin than poorly differentiated PDOs.Our findings suggest that CAFs maintain the differentiated PDAC phenotype through secreting niche factors and induce distinct drug responses.

However, biomarkers towards pathogenesis or novel drug targets are still limited. Our study aims to provide a comprehensive investigation of the causal effects of the plasma proteome on ASD, ADHD, and TS using the two-sample Mendelian Randomization (MR) approach.Genetic associations with 2994 plasma proteins were selected as exposures and genome-wide association data of ASD, ADHD, TS were utilized as outcomes. MR analyses were carried out using the inverse-variance weighted method, and the MR-Egger and weighted median methods were used for sensitivity analysis.Using single-nucleotide polymorphisms as instruments, the study suggested increased levels of MAPKAPK3 (OR: 1.09; 95% CI: 1.05-1.13; P = 1.43 × 10-6) and MRPL33 (OR: 1.07; 95% CI: 1.04-1.11; P = 5.37 × 10-6) were causally associated with a higher risk of ASD, and increased MANBA level was associated with a lower risk of ADHD (OR: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.88-0.95; P = 8.97 × 10-6). The causal associations were robust in sensitivity analysis, leave-one-out analysis and Multivariable MR, and no pleiotropy was observed. No significant risk protein was identified for TS.The study findings support the idea that the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway and mitochondrial dysfunction are involved in the pathogenesis of ASD, while a deficiency in beta-mannosidase might play a role in the development of ADHD.Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).

"35275240","Diabetes, GDF-15 and incident heart failure: the atherosclerosis risk in communities study.","Diabetologia","Elevated circulating growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15), a marker of cellular stress, is associated with both heart failure (HF) and diabetes. However, it is unclear to what extent GDF-15 is associated with HF among individuals with and without diabetes.We evaluated 10,570 participants free of HF at Visit 3 (1993-1995) of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study. We used Cox regression to evaluate the joint associations of GDF-15 and diabetes with incident HF. Models were adjusted for traditional cardiovascular risk factors.Among a total of 10,570 individuals (mean age of 60.0 years, 54% women, 27% black adults), elevated GDF-15 (≥75th percentile) was more common in people with diabetes compared with those without diabetes (32.8% vs 23.6%, p<0.0001). During 23 years of follow-up, there were 2429 incident HF events. GDF-15 (in quartiles) was independently associated with HF among those with and without diabetes, with a stronger association among individuals with diabetes (p-for-diabetes-GDF-15 interaction = 0.034): HR for highest vs lowest GDF-15 quartile (reference): 1.64 (95% CI 1.41, 1.91) among those without diabetes and 1.72 (95% CI 1.32, 2.23) among those with diabetes. Individuals with diabetes and elevated GDF-15 had the highest risk of incident HF (HR 2.46; 95% CI 1.99, 3.03). After accounting for HF risk factors, GDF-15 provided additional prognostic information among participants with diabetes (ΔC statistic for model with vs model without GDF-15: +0.008, p = 0.001) and among those without diabetes (+0.006, p<0.0001).In a community-based sample of US adults, GDF-15 provided complementary prognostic information on the HF risk, especially among individuals with diabetes.© 2022.

"35309325","A Systematic Review of Tissue and Single Cell Transcriptome/Proteome Studies of the Brain in Multiple Sclerosis.","Front Immunol","Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating and degenerative disease of the central nervous system (CNS). Although inflammatory responses are efficiently treated, therapies for progression are scarce and suboptimal, and biomarkers to predict the disease course are insufficient. Cure or preventive measures for MS require knowledge of core pathological events at the site of the tissue damage. Novelties in systems biology have emerged and paved the way for a more fine-grained understanding of key pathological pathways within the CNS, but they have also raised questions still without answers. Here, we systemically review the power of tissue and single-cell/nucleus CNS omics and discuss major gaps of integration into the clinical practice. Systemic search identified 49 transcriptome and 11 proteome studies of the CNS from 1997 till October 2021. Pioneering molecular discoveries indicate that MS affects the whole brain and all resident cell types. Despite inconsistency of results, studies imply increase in transcripts/proteins of semaphorins, heat shock proteins, myelin proteins, apolipoproteins and HLAs. Different lesions are characterized by distinct astrocytic and microglial polarization, altered oligodendrogenesis, and changes in specific neuronal subtypes. In all white matter lesion types,CXCL12, SCD, CD163are highly expressed, and STAT6- and TGFβ-signaling are increased. In the grey matter lesions, TNF-signaling seems to drive cell death, and especiallyCUX2-expressing neurons may be susceptible to neurodegeneration. The vast heterogeneity at both cellular and lesional levels may underlie the clinical heterogeneity of MS, and it may be more complex than the current disease phenotyping in the clinical practice. Systems biology has not solved the mystery of MS, but it has discovered multiple molecules and networks potentially contributing to the pathogenesis. However, these results are mostly descriptive; focused functional studies of the molecular changes may open up for a better interpretation. Guidelines for acceptable quality or awareness of results from low quality data, and standardized computational and biological pipelines may help to overcome limited tissue availability and the ""snap shot"" problem of omics. These may help in identifying core pathological events and point in directions for focus in clinical prevention.Copyright © 2022 Elkjaer, Röttger, Baumbach and Illes."
"35282162","Distinct gene expression in demyelinated white and grey matter areas of patients with multiple sclerosis.","Brain Commun","Demyelination of the central nervous system is a prominent pathological hallmark of multiple sclerosis and affects both white and grey matter. However, demyelinated white and grey matter exhibit clear pathological differences, most notably the presence or absence of inflammation and activated glial cells in white and grey matter, respectively. In order to gain more insight into the differential pathology of demyelinated white and grey matter areas, we micro-dissected neighbouring white and grey matter demyelinated areas as well as normal-appearing matter from leucocortical lesions of human post-mortem material and used these samples for RNA sequencing. Our data show that even neighbouring demyelinated white and grey matter of the same leucocortical have a distinct gene expression profile and cellular composition. We propose that, based on their distinct expression profile, pathological processes in neighbouring white and grey matter are likely different which could have implications for the efficacy of treating grey matter lesions with current anti-inflammatory-based multiple sclerosis drugs.© The Author(s) 2022.

"35273209","Causal biological network models for reactive astrogliosis: a systems approach to neuroinflammation.","Sci Rep","Astrocytes play a central role in the neuroimmune response by responding to CNS pathologies with diverse molecular and morphological changes during the process of reactive astrogliosis. Here, we used a computational biological network model and mathematical algorithms that allow the interpretation of high-throughput transcriptomic datasets in the context of known biology to study reactive astrogliosis. We gathered available mechanistic information from the literature into a comprehensive causal biological network (CBN) model of astrocyte reactivity. The CBN model was built in the Biological Expression Language, which is both human-readable and computable. We characterized the CBN with a network analysis of highly connected nodes and demonstrated that the CBN captures relevant astrocyte biology. Subsequently, we used the CBN and transcriptomic data to identify key molecular pathways driving the astrocyte phenotype in four CNS pathologies: samples from mouse models of lipopolysaccharide-induced endotoxemia, Alzheimer's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; and samples from multiple sclerosis patients. The astrocyte CBN provides a new tool to identify causal mechanisms and quantify astrogliosis based on transcriptomic data.© 2022. The Author(s)."

Reactive astrocytes upregulate junctional adhesion molecule-A, an immunoglobulin-like cell surface receptor that binds to T cells via its ligand, the integrin, lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1. Here, we tested the role of astrocytic junctional adhesion molecule-A in regulating CNS autoinflammatory disease. In cell co-cultures, we found that junctional adhesion molecule-A-mediated signalling between astrocytes and T cells increases levels of matrix metalloproteinase-2, C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, pro-inflammatory factors driving lymphocyte entry and pathogenicity in multiple sclerosis and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, an animal model of CNS autoimmune disease. In experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, mice with astrocyte-specificJAM-Adeletion (mGFAP:CreJAM-Afl/fl) exhibit decreased levels of matrix metalloproteinase-2, reduced ability of T cells to infiltrate the CNS parenchyma from the perivascular spaces and a milder histopathological and clinical course of disease compared with wild-type controls (JAM-Afl/fl). Treatment of wild-type mice with intraperitoneal injection of soluble junctional adhesion molecule-A blocking peptide decreases the severity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, highlighting the potential of contact-mediated astrocyte-immune cell signalling as a novel translational target against neuroinflammatory disease.© The Author(s) 2022.

Recent studies suggest that a combination of genetic susceptibility and environmental insult contributes to its pathogenesis. Many candidate genes have been discovered to modulate susceptibility for developing MS by genome wide association studies (GWAS); these include major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes and non-MHC genes. MS cases in the context of genetic diseases may provide different approaches and clues towards identifying novel genes and pathways involved in MS pathogenesis. Here, we present a case series of two related patients with concomitant Von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHLD) and MS.We present two patients, a mother (case 1) and daughter (case 2), who developed superimposed relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis in the background of the autosomal dominant genetic disorder VHLD. Several tumors characteristic of VHLD developed in both cases with pancreatic and renal neoplasms and cerebellar hemangioblastomas. In addition, both patients developed clinical symptoms consistent with multiple sclerosis, supported by radiologic lesions disseminating in time and space.Though non-MHC susceptibility genes remain elusive in MS, we present the striking finding of superimposed multiple sclerosis in a mother and daughter with VHLD. The VHL gene is known to be the primary regulator of Nrf2, the well-established target of the FDA-approved therapeutic dimethyl fumarate. These cases provide support for further studies to determine whether VHLD pathway related genes represent a novel genetic link in multiple sclerosis.© 2022. The Author(s)."

Therefore, this study aimed to develop and validate a new simple functional score based on self-reported cognitive and physical function in the older Chinese population.The development sample included 3,929 older adults aged 60-95 years from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS). The validation sample included 1,345 older adults aged 60-87 years from the Rugao Longitudinal Aging study (RLAS). Logistic regression models and receiver operating characteristic curves were used to examine the associations of the new functional score with all-cause mortality risk.Six items were selected to construct the new functional score in CHARLS. This functional score was associated with all-cause mortality risk, with an adjusted odds ratio of 1.10 (95% confidence interval = 1.07, 1.13). This functional score presented additional predictive utility beyond age and sex, as demonstrated by the significantly increased C-statistic, integrated discrimination improvement (IDI), and continuous net reclassification improvement (NRI) (allP< 0.001). Furthermore, this functional score was further validated in RLAS, such that adding the new functional score to a model of age and sex improved all-cause mortality risk discrimination (IDI = 0.036,P< 0.001; NRI = 0.485,P< 0.001). To facilitate the quick screening of the older population with deteriorations in cognitive and physical function, we introduced a publicly available online tool designed for this new functional score.A new functional score based on six self-reported items was developed and validated in the older Chinese population, and was demonstrated to be a simple and practical tool to assess functional deterioration, showing good feasibility, and performance.Copyright © 2022 Cao, Chen, He, Zheng, Zhang, Hoogendijk, Liu, Li, Wang, Zhu and Liu."

Here, we aimed to characterize the immune phenotype of aged CD4+T cells in this tissue as compared with lymphoid organs. To perform this, we sorted regulatory T cells (Tregs, CD4+CD25+GITR+) and non-Tregs (CD4+CD25negGITRneg) in lymphoid organs from female C57BL/6J mice and subjected these cells to an immunology NanoString® panel. These results were confirmed by flow cytometry, live imaging, and tissue immunostaining in the lacrimal gland. Importantly, effector T helper 1 (Th1) genes were highly upregulated on aged Tregs, including the master regulator Tbx21. Among the non-Tregs, we also found a significant increase in the levels of EOMESmed/high, TbetnegIFN-γ+, and CD62L+CD44negCD4+T cells with aging, which are associated with cell exhaustion, immunopathology, and the generation of tertiary lymphoid tissue. At the functional level, aged Tregs from lymphoid organs are less able to decrease proliferation and IFN-γ production of T responders at any age. More importantly, human lacrimal glands (age range 55-81 years) also showed the presence of CD4+Foxp3+cells. Further studies are needed to propose potential molecular targets to avoid immune-mediated lacrimal gland dysfunction with aging.© 2022.

Due to their sheer numbers, complexity and diversity, their systematic study requires concrete classifications that can serve reduced dimensionality, reproducibility, and information integration. Conventional hierarchical schemes transformed through the history of neuroscience by prioritizing criteria of morphology, (electro)physiological activity, molecular content, and circuit function, influenced by prevailing methodologies of the time. Since the molecular biology revolution and the recent advents in transcriptomics, molecular profiling gains ground toward the classification of neurons and glial cell types. Yet, transcriptomics entails technical challenges and more importantly uncovers unforeseen spatiotemporal heterogeneity, in complex and simpler nervous systems. Cells change states dynamically in space and time, in response to stimuli or throughout their developmental trajectory. Mapping cell type and state heterogeneity uncovers uncharted terrains in neurons and especially in glial cell biology, that remains understudied in many aspects. Examining neurons and glial cells from the perspectives of molecular neuroscience, physiology, development and evolution highlights the advantage of multifaceted classification schemes. Among the amalgam of models contributing to neuroscience research,Caenorhabditis eleganscombines nervous system anatomy, lineage, connectivity and molecular content, all mapped at single-cell resolution, and can provide valuable insights for the workflow and challenges of the multimodal integration of cell type features. This review reflects on concepts and practices of neuron and glial cells classification and how research, inC. elegansand beyond, guides nervous system experimentation through integrated multidimensional schemes. It highlights underlying principles, emerging themes, and open frontiers in the study of nervous system development, regulatory logic and evolution. It proposes unified platforms to allow integrated annotation of large-scale datasets, gene-function studies, published or unpublished findings and community feedback. Neuroscience is moving fast toward interdisciplinary, high-throughput approaches for combined mapping of the morphology, physiology, connectivity, molecular function, and the integration of information in multifaceted schemes.

However, CNV is not well studied on the single-cell level except for humans and a few model organisms.We sequenced 143 single sperms of two Holstein bulls, from which we predicted CNV events using 14 single sperms with deep sequencing. We then compared the CNV results derived from single sperms with the bulk-cell sequencing of one bull's family trio of diploid genomes. As a known CNV hotspot, segmental duplications were also predicted using the bovine ARS-UCD1.2 genome. Although the trio CNVs validated only some single sperm CNVs, they still showed a distal chromosomal distribution pattern and significant associations with segmental duplications and satellite repeats.Our preliminary results pointed out future research directions and highlighted the importance of uniform whole genome amplification, deep sequence coverage, and dedicated software pipelines for CNV detection using single cell sequencing data.© 2022.

This makes it popular in experimental biology for gleaning specifications of novel cell types as well as inferring heterogeneity. Experimental data conventionally contains zero counts or dropout events for many single cell transcripts. Such missing data hampers the accurate analysis using standard workflows, designed for massive RNA-Seq datasets. Imputation for single cell datasets is done to infer the missing values. This was traditionally done with ad-hoc code but later customized pipelines, workflows and specialized software appeared for this purpose. This made it easy to benchmark and cluster things in an organized manner. In this review, we have assembled a catalog of available RNA-Seq single cell imputation algorithms/workflows and associated softwares for the scientific community performing single-cell RNA-Seq data analysis. Continued development of imputation methods, especially using deep learning approaches, would be necessary for eradicating associated pitfalls and addressing challenges associated with future large scale and heterogeneous datasets.© 2021 Bentham Science Publishers."

These representations have been generated from various biomedical data types and can be used to produce realistic-looking simulated data. However, standard vanilla VAEs suffer from entangled and uninformative latent spaces, which can be mitigated using other types of VAEs such as β-VAE and MMD-VAE. In this project, we evaluated the ability of VAEs to learn cell morphology characteristics derived from cell images. We trained and evaluated these three VAE variants-Vanilla VAE, β-VAE, and MMD-VAE-on cell morphology readouts and explored the generative capacity of each model to predict compound polypharmacology (the interactions of a drug with more than one target) using an approach called latent space arithmetic (LSA). To test the generalizability of the strategy, we also trained these VAEs using gene expression data of the same compound perturbations and found that gene expression provides complementary information. We found that the β-VAE and MMD-VAE disentangle morphology signals and reveal a more interpretable latent space. We reliably simulated morphology and gene expression readouts from certain compounds thereby predicting cell states perturbed with compounds of known polypharmacology. Inferring cell state for specific drug mechanisms could aid researchers in developing and identifying targeted therapeutics and categorizing off-target effects in the future."

Studies in germline and somaticDnmt3aknockout mice have identified focal, canonical hypomethylation phenotypes in hematopoietic cells; however, the kinetics of methylation loss following acquiredDNMT3Ainactivation in hematopoietic cells is essentially unknown. Therefore, we evaluated a somatic, inducible model of hematopoieticDnmt3aloss, and show that inactivation ofDnmt3ain murine hematopoietic cells results in a relatively slow loss of methylation at canonical sites throughout the genome; in contrast, remethylation of Dnmt3a deficient genomes in hematopoietic cells occurs much more quickly. This data suggests that slow methylation loss may contribute, at least in part, to the long latent period that characterizes clonal expansion and leukemia development in individuals with acquiredDNMT3Amutations in hematopoietic stem cells.© 2022 The Authors."

Here, we found that PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) mediated HSPC reprogramming into committed MDSC precursors in the spleen via PERK-ATF4-C/EBPβ signaling. Pharmacological and genetic inhibition of this pathway in murine and human HSPCs prevented their myeloid descendant cells from becoming MDSCs even with subsequent exposure to tumor microenvironment (TME) factors. In mice, the selective delivery of PERK antagonists to the spleen was not only sufficient but more effective than the tumor-targeted strategy in preventing MDSC activation in the tumor, leading to profound TME reshaping and tumor regression. Clinically, HSPCs in the spleen of cancer patients exhibit increased PERK signaling correlated with enhanced myelopoiesis. Our findings indicate that PERK-mediated HSPC preconditioning plays a crucial role in MDSC generation, suggesting novel spleen-targeting therapeutic opportunities for restraining the tumor-promoting myeloid response at its source.© 2022 Liu et al."
"35284244","Exposure of pigs to glyphosate affects gene-specific DNA methylation and gene expression.","Toxicol Rep","Glyphosate (N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine) is a broad-spectrum systemic herbicide and crop desiccant. Glyphosate has long been suspected of leading to the development of cancer and of compromising fertility. Herbicides have been increasingly recognized as epigenetic modifiers, and the impact of glyphosate on human and animal health might be mediated by epigenetic modifications. This article presents the results from an animal study where pigs were exposed to glyphosate while feeding. The experimental setup included a control group with no glyphosate added to the feed and two groups of pigs with 20 ppm and 200 ppm of glyphosate added to the feed, respectively. After exposure, the pigs were dissected, and tissues of the small intestine, liver, and kidney were used for DNA methylation and gene expression analyses. No significant change in global DNA methylation was found in the small intestine, kidney, or liver. Methylation status was determined for selected genes involved in various functions such as DNA repair and immune defense. In a CpG island of the promoter for IL18, we observed significantly reduced DNA methylation for certain individual CpG positions. However, this change in DNA methylation had no influence on IL18 mRNA expression. The expression of the DNA methylation enzymes DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B was measured in the small intestine, kidney, and liver of pigs exposed to glyphosate. No significant changes in relative gene expression were found for these enzymes following dietary exposure to 20 and 200 ppm glyphosate. In contrast, a significant increase in expression of the enzyme TET3, responsible for demethylation, was observed in kidneys exposed to 200 ppm glyphosate.© 2022 The Authors."

The study included 51 IA patients and 46 control subjects. Demographic and lifestyle data were collected. Haematological and biochemical parameters and blood cadmium levels (Cd-B) were determined. Cd-B correlated positively with age, smoking, living in a high-traffic area, and serum levels of inflammatory markers and negatively with mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration (MCHC). The binary logistic regression model implied that high Cd-B (≥0.65 μg/L) is linked with an increased risk of IA in the studied population (odds ratio: 4.4). High levels of DNA oxidative damage marker (8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine) (≥7.66 ng/mL) and cyclooxygenase-2 (≥22.9 ng/mL) and frequent consumption of offal was also associated with increased risk of IA. High Cd-B was related to increased risk of disease symptoms onset in the group of IA patients, decreased the level of interleukin 10, and positively correlated with the disease activity. Increased Cd-B is associated with intensified inflammatory processes and decreased haemoglobin levels; in IA patients with decreased anti-inflammatory interleukin 10. These changes partly explain why cadmium exposure and a high cadmium body burden may raise the risk of IA and of disease symptoms exacerbation."

However, open questions surrounding the clinical validity and utility of plasma-based analyses have hindered widespread clinical adoption.Owing to the rapid evolution of the field, studies supporting the use of ctDNA as a biomarker throughout a patient's journey with cancer have accumulated in the last few years, warranting a review of the latest status for clinicians who may employ ctDNA in their precision oncology programs. In this work, we take a step back from the intricate coverage of detection approaches described extensively elsewhere and cover basic concepts around the practical implementation of next generation sequencing (NGS)-guided liquid biopsy. We compare relevant targeted and untargeted approaches to plasma DNA analysis, describe the latest evidence for clinical validity and utility, and highlight the value of genome-wide ctDNA analysis, particularly as it relates to early detection strategies and discovery applications harnessing the non-coding genome.The maturation of liquid biopsy for clinical application will require interdisciplinary efforts to address current challenges.

There are a variety of statistical models which can be used, and their fitting and interpretation can be complex, particularly where there is a nonlinear trajectory. Our aim was to provide an accessible guide along with applied examples to using four sophisticated modelling procedures for describing nonlinear growth trajectories.This expository paper provides an illustrative guide to summarising nonlinear growth trajectories for repeatedly measured continuous outcomes using (i) linear spline and (ii) natural cubic spline linear mixed-effects (LME) models, (iii) Super Imposition by Translation and Rotation (SITAR) nonlinear mixed effects models, and (iv) latent trajectory models. The underlying model for each approach, their similarities and differences, and their advantages and disadvantages are described. Their application and correct interpretation of their results is illustrated by analysing repeated bone mass measures to characterise bone growth patterns and their sex differences in three cohort studies from the UK, USA, and Canada comprising 8500 individuals and 37,000 measurements from ages 5-40 years. Recommendations for choosing a modelling approach are provided along with a discussion and signposting on further modelling extensions for analysing trajectory exposures and outcomes, and multiple cohorts.Linear and natural cubic spline LME models and SITAR provided similar summary of the mean bone growth trajectory and growth velocity, and the sex differences in growth patterns. Growth velocity (in grams/year) peaked during adolescence, and peaked earlier in females than males e.g., mean age at peak bone mineral content accrual from multicohort SITAR models was 12.2 years in females and 13.9 years in males. Latent trajectory models (with trajectory shapes estimated using a natural cubic spline) identified up to four subgroups of individuals with distinct trajectories throughout adolescence.LME models with linear and natural cubic splines, SITAR, and latent trajectory models are useful for describing nonlinear growth trajectories, and these methods can be adapted for other complex traits. Choice of method depends on the research aims, complexity of the trajectory, and available data. Scripts and synthetic datasets are provided for readers to replicate trajectory modelling and visualisation using the R statistical computing software.© 2022. The Author(s)."

We compared genetic data of patients with TRS (n = 63) with non-TRS (n = 111) by polygenic risk scores (PRS) calculated by PRSice software using PGC2_SCZ (Psychiatric Genomics Consortium - Schizophrenia) data. TRS criteria followed the International Psychopharmacology Algorithm Project SCZ algorithm. Statistical clustering and functional enrichment analyses of genes harboring TRS-linked variants were performed. Individuals on the top three deciles of schizophrenia PRS distribution exhibited higher odds of being refractory to antipsychotics than those on the bottom three deciles. Clusters of interacting variant-harboring genes were identified among the association signals. They are upregulated in the dorsolateral prefrontal, orbitofrontal, temporal, and inferior parietal areas during adolescence and early adulthood. Similar gene modules were found using transcriptional data from the same brain regions in individuals with schizophrenia. Genes were enriched among markers of cortical interneurons and somatosensory pyramidal cells. Finally, the enrichment of the clustered genes in drug-response expression signatures revealed compounds that could be employed to identify novel antipsychotic targets. In conclusion, we identified variant-harboring genes that may predispose SCZ patients to poor antipsychotic response and found statistically enriched clusters which provided functional and spatiotemporal context for TRS, suggesting that genotypic variation may converge to biological alterations at the interplay between actin dynamics and synaptic organization.© 2022.

"35269818","Intertwined Relationship of Mitochondrial Metabolism, Gut Microbiome and Exercise Potential.","Int J Mol Sci","The microbiome has emerged as a key player contributing significantly to the human physiology over the past decades. The potential microbial niche is largely unexplored in the context of exercise enhancing capacity and the related mitochondrial functions. Physical exercise can influence the gut microbiota composition and diversity, whereas a sedentary lifestyle in association with dysbiosis can lead to reduced well-being and diseases. Here, we have elucidated the importance of diverse microbiota, which is associated with an individual's fitness, and moreover, its connection with the organelle, the mitochondria, which is the hub of energy production, signaling, and cellular homeostasis. Microbial by-products, such as short-chain fatty acids, are produced during regular exercise that can enhance the mitochondrial capacity. Therefore, exercise can be employed as a therapeutic intervention to circumvent or subside various metabolic and mitochondria-related diseases. Alternatively, the microbiome-mitochondria axis can be targeted to enhance exercise performance. This review furthers our understanding about the influence of microbiome on the functional capacity of the mitochondria and exercise performance, and the interplay between them."
"35310334","Merging the exposome into an integrated framework for ""omics"" sciences.","iScience","The exposome concept encourages holistic consideration of the non-genetic factors (environmental exposures including lifestyle) that influence an individual's health over their life course. However, disconnect between the concept and practical application has promoted divergent interpretations of the exposome across disciplines and reinforced separation of the environmental (emphasizing exposures) and biological (emphasizing responses) research communities. In particular, while knowledge of biological responses can help to distinguish actual (i.e. experienced) from potential exposures, the inclusion of endogenous processes has generated confusion about the position of the exposome in a multi-omics systems biology context. We propose a reattribution of ""exposome"" to exclusively represent the totality of contact with external factors that a biological entity experiences, and introduce the term ""functional exposomics"" to denote the systematic study of exposure-phenotype interaction. This reoriented definition of the exposome allows a more readily integrable dataset for multi-omics and systems biology research.© 2022 The Author(s)."
"35300460","scREMOTE: Using multimodal single cell data to predict regulatory gene relationships and to build a computational cell reprogramming model.","NAR Genom Bioinform","Cell reprogramming offers a potential treatment to many diseases, by regenerating specialized somatic cells. Despite decades of research, discovering the transcription factors that promote cell reprogramming has largely been accomplished through trial and error, a time-consuming and costly method. A computational model for cell reprogramming, however, could guide the hypothesis formulation and experimental validation, to efficiently utilize time and resources. Current methods often cannot account for the heterogeneity observed in cell reprogramming, or they only make short-term predictions, without modelling the entire reprogramming process. Here, we present scREMOTE, a novel computational model for cell reprogramming that leverages single cell multiomics data, enabling a more holistic view of the regulatory mechanisms at cellular resolution. This is achieved by first identifying the regulatory potential of each transcription factor and gene to uncover regulatory relationships, then a regression model is built to estimate the effect of transcription factor perturbations. We show that scREMOTE successfully predicts the long-term effect of overexpressing two key transcription factors in hair follicle development by capturing higher-order gene regulations. Together, this demonstrates that integrating the multimodal processes governing gene regulation creates a more accurate model for cell reprogramming with significant potential to accelerate research in regenerative medicine.© The Author(s) 2022.

"35197433","Predicting the course of asthma from childhood until early adulthood.","Curr Opin Allergy Clin Immunol","To communicate recent insights about the natural history of childhood asthma, with a focus on prediction of persistence and remission of childhood asthma, up to early adulthood.Lung function around the age of 8-9 years is the strongest predictor: obstructive lung function predicts asthma persistence up to early adulthood, whereas normal lung function predicts remission. The ability to predict asthma remission improves when lung function is combined with blood eosinophil levels and degree of bronchial hyperresponsiveness. Interventions, such as inhaled corticosteroids and immunotherapy do not appear to alter the course of asthma. Epigenetic studies have revealed potential novel biomarkers of asthma remission, such as micro-RNA patterns in blood. Specifically, lower serum levels of mi-R221-5p, which is associated with lower IL-6 release and eosinophilic inflammation, predict remission. Higher levels of blood DNA-methylation of a CpG site in Peroxisomal Biogenesis Factor 11 Beta were associated with asthma remission.Lung function, allergic comorbidity and polysensitization in childhood predict the course of asthma. Recent epigenetic studies have provided a better understanding of underlying pathological processes in asthma remission, which may be used to improve prediction or develop novel treatments aimed at altering the course of asthma.Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).

"35294740","Overview of the 2022 WHO Classification of Neuroendocrine Neoplasms.","Endocr Pathol","In this review, we detail the changes and the relevant features that are applied to neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) in the 2022 WHO Classification of Endocrine and Neuroendocrine Tumors. Using a question-and-answer approach, we discuss the consolidation of the nomenclature that distinguishes neuronal paragangliomas from epithelial neoplasms, which are divided into well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) and poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs). The criteria for these distinctions based on differentiation are outlined. NETs are generally (but not always) graded as G1, G2, and G3 based on proliferation, whereas NECs are by definition high grade; the importance of Ki67 as a tool for classification and grading is emphasized. The clinical relevance of proper classification is explained, and the importance of hormonal function is examined, including eutopic and ectopic hormone production. The tools available to pathologists for accurate classification include the conventional biomarkers of neuroendocrine lineage and differentiation, INSM1, synaptophysin, chromogranins, and somatostatin receptors (SSTRs), but also include transcription factors that can identify the site of origin of a metastatic lesion of unknown primary site, as well as hormones, enzymes, and keratins that play a role in functional and structural correlation. The recognition of highly proliferative, well-differentiated NETs has resulted in the need for biomarkers that can distinguish these G3 NETs from NECs, including stains to determine expression of SSTRs and those that can indicate the unique molecular pathogenetic alterations that underlie the distinction, for example, global loss of RB and aberrant p53 in pancreatic NECs compared with loss of ATRX, DAXX, and menin in pancreatic NETs. Other differential diagnoses are discussed with recommendations for biomarkers that can assist in correct classification, including the distinctions between epithelial and non-epithelial NENs that have allowed reclassification of epithelial NETs in the spine, in the duodenum, and in the middle ear; the first two may be composite tumors with neuronal and glial elements, and as this feature is integral to the duodenal lesion, it is now classified as composite gangliocytoma/neuroma and neuroendocrine tumor (CoGNET). The many other aspects of differential diagnosis are detailed with recommendations for biomarkers that can distinguish NENs from non-neuroendocrine lesions that can mimic their morphology. The concepts of mixed neuroendocrine and non-neuroendocrine (MiNEN) and amphicrine tumors are clarified with information about how to approach such lesions in routine practice. Theranostic biomarkers that assist patient management are reviewed. Given the significant proportion of NENs that are associated with germline mutations that predispose to this disease, we explain the role of the pathologist in identifying precursor lesions and applying molecular immunohistochemistry to guide genetic testing.© 2022.

"35278097","An update on the development of concepts, diagnostic criteria, and challenging issues for neuroendocrine neoplasms across different digestive organs.","Virchows Arch","Digestive neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) are a group of heterogeneous neoplasms found throughout the digestive tract, with different behaviour and genetic background. In the last few years, nomenclature and WHO/UICC classifications of digestive NENs have changed, and molecular classifications have emerged, especially in pancreatic locations. Increasing patho-molecular details are needed to diagnose the different categories of NEN, including the use of helpful immunohistochemical markers. In this review, we address these topics in three successive chapters. We first briefly review recent updates in classifications, discuss important grading and proliferating issues and advances in the molecular understanding of NEN. Then, we provide an update on diagnosis, including the most important differential diagnoses of NEN, with a focus on high-grade neoplasms and mixed tumours. Finally, we highlight a variety of currently used and next-generation predictive and prognostic biomarkers as well as biomarkers of tumour origin and describe some site specificities of gastrointestinal NEN. We specifically focus on biomarkers available to pathologists with the potential to change the way patients with NEN are diagnosed and treated.© 2022.

"35309241","Consensus on potential biomarkers developed for use in clinical tests for schizophrenia.","Gen Psychiatr","Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness affecting approximately 20 million individuals globally. Both genetic and environmental factors contribute to the illness. If left undiagnosed and untreated, schizophrenia results in impaired social function, repeated hospital admissions, reduced quality of life and decreased life expectancy. Clinical diagnosis largely relies on subjective evidence, including self-reported experiences, and reported behavioural abnormalities followed by psychiatric evaluation. In addition, psychoses may occur along with other conditions, and the symptoms are often episodic and transient, posing a significant challenge to the precision of diagnosis. Therefore, objective, specific tests using biomarkers are urgently needed for differential diagnosis of schizophrenia in clinical practice.We aimed to provide evidence-based and consensus-based recommendations, with a summary of laboratory measurements that could potentially be used as biomarkers for schizophrenia, and to discuss directions for future research.We searched publications within the last 10 years with the following keywords: 'schizophrenia', 'gene', 'inflammation', 'neurotransmitter', 'protein marker', 'gut microbiota', 'pharmacogenomics' and 'biomarker'. A draft of the consensus was discussed and agreed on by all authors at a round table session.We summarised the characteristics of candidate diagnostic markers for schizophrenia, including genetic, inflammatory, neurotransmitter, peripheral protein, pharmacogenomic and gut microbiota markers. We also proposed a novel laboratory process for diagnosing schizophrenia in clinical practice based on the evidence summarised in this paper.Further efforts are needed to identify schizophrenia-specific genetic and epigenetic markers for precise diagnosis, differential diagnosis and ethnicity-specific markers for the Chinese population. The development of novel laboratory techniques is making it possible to use these biomarkers clinically to diagnose disease.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC.

We sought to identify plasma metabolic profiles distinguishing vegans (avoiding meat, eggs, dairy) from non-vegetarians (consuming ≥28 g/day red meat) of the Adventist Health Study-2 cohort using global metabolomics profiling with ultra-performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). Differences in abundance of metabolites or biochemical subclasses were analyzed using linear regression models, adjusting for surrogate and confounding variables, with cross-validation to simulate results from an independent sample. Random forest was used as a learning tool for classification, and principal component analysis was used to identify clusters of related metabolites. Differences in covariate-adjusted metabolite abundance were identified in over 60% of metabolites (586/930), after adjustment for false discovery. The vast majority of differentially abundant metabolites or metabolite subclasses showed lower abundance in vegans, including xanthine, histidine, branched fatty acids, acetylated peptides, ceramides, and long-chain acylcarnitines, among others. Many of these metabolite subclasses have roles in insulin dysregulation, cardiometabolic phenotypes, and inflammation. Analysis of metabolic profiles in vegans and non-vegetarians revealed vast differences in these two dietary groups, reflecting differences in consumption of animal and plant products. These metabolites serve as biomarkers of food intake, many with potential pathophysiological consequences for cardiometabolic diseases."

Cultural conditioning has ensured that therapeutics for extreme human lifespans are considered out of reach technologies. However, longevity therapies such as stem cell replacement, fasting, gene therapies, fasting mimetics such as metformin and rapamycin, regulation and tissue reprogramming with OSK transcription factors, blood dilution, metabolic pathway engineering, reversal of epigenetic drift, heterochronic parabiosis, coenzyme replacement technologies (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) and a plethora of other established sciences are showing great potential at slowing down the rate at which tissues enter dysfunction. Recent discoveries have shed light on major mysteries of the aging process. Longevity-based discoveries are not only landing quickly, but therapies to prevent or reverse those drivers of aging are also being devised regularly and this is opening up an entirely new industry, the longevity industry. This presents the requirement for a new classification system where subjects can be divided into specific groups based on their potential for mortality.

"35269428","Deciphering the Retinal Epigenome during Development, Disease and Reprogramming: Advancements, Challenges and Perspectives.","Cells","Retinal neurogenesis is driven by concerted actions of transcription factors, some of which are expressed in a continuum and across several cell subtypes throughout development. While seemingly redundant, many factors diversify their regulatory outcome on gene expression, by coordinating variations in chromatin landscapes to drive divergent retinal specification programs. Recent studies have furthered the understanding of the epigenetic contribution to the progression of age-related macular degeneration, a leading cause of blindness in the elderly. The knowledge of the epigenomic mechanisms that control the acquisition and stabilization of retinal cell fates and are evoked upon damage, holds the potential for the treatment of retinal degeneration. Herein, this review presents the state-of-the-art approaches to investigate the retinal epigenome during development, disease, and reprogramming. A pipeline is then reviewed to functionally interrogate the epigenetic and transcriptional networks underlying cell fate specification, relying on a truly unbiased screening of open chromatin states. The related work proposes an inferential model to identify gene regulatory networks, features the first footprinting analysis and the first tentative, systematic query of candidate pioneer factors in the retina ever conducted in any model organism, leading to the identification of previously uncharacterized master regulators of retinal cell identity, such as the nuclear factor I, NFI. This pipeline is virtually applicable to the study of genetic programs and candidate pioneer factors in any developmental context. Finally, challenges and limitations intrinsic to the current next-generation sequencing techniques are discussed, as well as recent advances in super-resolution imaging, enabling spatio-temporal resolution of the genome."

We aimed to estimate the prevalence of parkinsonism and PD and examine related risk factors in a cohort of elderly individuals from Latin America (LatAm).Data from 11,613 adults (65+ years) who participated in a baseline assessment of the 10/66 study and lived in six LatAm countries were analyzed to estimate parkinsonism and PD prevalence. Crude and age-adjusted prevalence were determined by sex and country. Diagnosis of PD was established using the UK Parkinson's Disease Society Brain Bank's clinical criteria.In this cohort, the prevalence of parkinsonism was 8.0% (95% CI 7.6%-8.5%), and the prevalence of PD was 2.0% (95% CI 1.7%-2.3%). PD prevalence increased with age from 1.0 to 3.5 (65-69vs. 80 years or older,p < 0.001). Age-adjusted prevalence rates were lower for women than for men. No significant differences were found across countries, except for lower prevalence in urban areas of Peru. PD was positively associated with depression (adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR] 2.06, 95% CI 1.40-3.01,I2 = 56.0%), dementia (aPR 1.57, 95% CI 1.07- 2.32,I2 = 0.0%) and educational level (aPR 1.14, 95% CI 1.01- 1.29,I2 = 58.6%).The reported prevalence of PD in LatAm is similar to reports from high-income countries (HIC). A significant proportion of cases with PD did not have a previous diagnosis, nor did they seek any medical or neurological attention. These findings underscore the need to improve public health programs for populations currently undergoing rapid demographic aging and epidemiological transition.The funding source had no role in the design and conduct of the study; collection, management, analysis, and interpretation of the data; preparation, review, or approval of the manuscript; and decision to submit the manuscript for publication.© 2021 The Author(s)."

However, whether longevity is caused by a compression of the portion of life spent in a state of morbidity,i.e., ""sickspan,"" is highly debated even in isogenicCaenorhabditis elegans. Here, we developed a microfluidic device that employs acoustophoretic force fields to quantify the maximum muscle strength and dynamic power in agingC. elegans. Together with different biomarkers for healthspan, we found a stochastic onset of morbidity, starting with a decline in dynamic muscle power and structural integrity, culminating in frailty. Surprisingly, we did not observe a compression of sickspan in longevity mutants but instead observed a temporal scaling of healthspan. Given the conservation of these longevity interventions, this raises the question of whether the healthspan of mammalian longevity interventions is also temporally scaled.© 2022 The Author(s)."
"35303871","Engineering the next-generation of CAR T-cells with CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing.","Mol Cancer","Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cells represent a breakthrough in personalized cancer therapy. In this strategy, synthetic receptors comprised of antigen recognition, signaling, and costimulatory domains are used to reprogram T-cells to target tumor cells for destruction. Despite the success of this approach in refractory B-cell malignancies, optimal potency of CAR T-cell therapy for many other cancers, particularly solid tumors, has not been achieved. Factors such as T-cell exhaustion, lack of CAR T-cell persistence, cytokine-related toxicities, and bottlenecks in the manufacturing of autologous products have hampered the safety, effectiveness, and availability of this approach. With the ease and accessibility of CRISPR-Cas9-based gene editing, it is possible to address many of these limitations. Accordingly, current research efforts focus on precision engineering of CAR T-cells with conventional CRISPR-Cas9 systems or novel editors that can install desired genetic changes with or without introduction of a double-stranded break (DSB) into the genome. These tools and strategies can be directly applied to targeting negative regulators of T-cell function, directing therapeutic transgenes to specific genomic loci, and generating reproducibly safe and potent allogeneic universal CAR T-cell products for on-demand cancer immunotherapy. This review evaluates several of the ongoing and future directions of combining next-generation CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing with synthetic biology to optimize CAR T-cell therapy for future clinical trials toward the establishment of a new cancer treatment paradigm.© 2022.

"35269383","Constitutive Heterochromatin in Eukaryotic Genomes: A Mine of Transposable Elements.","Cells","Transposable elements (TEs) are abundant components of constitutive heterochromatin of the most diverse evolutionarily distant organisms. TEs enrichment in constitutive heterochromatin was originally described in the model organismDrosophila melanogaster, but it is now considered as a general feature of this peculiar portion of the genomes. The phenomenon of TE enrichment in constitutive heterochromatin has been proposed to be the consequence of a progressive accumulation of transposable elements caused by both reduced recombination and lack of functional genes in constitutive heterochromatin. However, this view does not take into account classical genetics studies and most recent evidence derived by genomic analyses of heterochromatin inDrosophilaand other species. In particular, the lack of functional genes does not seem to be any more a general feature of heterochromatin. Sequencing and annotation ofDrosophila melanogasterconstitutive heterochromatin have shown that this peculiar genomic compartment contains hundreds of transcriptionally active genes, generally larger in size than that of euchromatic ones. Together, these genes occupy a significant fraction of the genomic territory of heterochromatin. Moreover, transposable elements have been suggested to drive the formation of heterochromatin by recruiting HP1 and repressive chromatin marks. In addition, there are several pieces of evidence that transposable elements accumulation in the heterochromatin might be important for centromere and telomere structure. Thus, there may be more complexity to the relationship between transposable elements and constitutive heterochromatin, in that different forces could drive the dynamic of this phenomenon. Among those forces, preferential transposition may be an important factor. In this article, we present an overview of experimental findings showing cases of transposon enrichment into the heterochromatin and their positive evolutionary interactions with an impact to host genomes."
"35306888","Sex chromosomes, sex ratios and sex gaps in longevity in plants.","Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci","In animals, males and females can display markedly different longevity (also called sex gaps in longevity, SGL). Sex chromosomes contribute to establishing these SGLs. X-hemizygosity and toxicity of the Y chromosomes are two mechanisms that have been suggested to reduce male longevity (Z-hemizygosity and W toxicity in females in ZW systems). In plants, SGLs are known to exist, but the role of sex chromosomes remains to be established. Here, by using adult sex ratio as a proxy for measuring SGLs, we explored the relationship between sex chromosomes and SGLs across 43 plant species. Based on the knowledge accumulated in animals, we specifically asked whether: (i) species with XY systems tend to have female-biased sex ratios (reduced male longevity) and species with ZW ones tend to have male-biased sex ratios (reduced female longevity); and (ii) this pattern was stronger in heteromorphic systems compared to homomorphic ones. Our results tend to support these predictions although we lack statistical power because of a small number of ZW systems and the absence of any heteromorphic ZW system in the dataset. We discuss the implications of these findings, which we hope will stimulate further research on sex differences in lifespan and ageing across plants.

We report here a multiomics investigation of systemic IFN signaling in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, defining the multiomics biosignatures associated with varying levels of 12 different type I, II, and III IFNs. The antiviral transcriptional response in circulating immune cells is strongly associated with a specific subset of IFNs, most prominently IFNA2 and IFNG. In contrast, proteomics signatures indicative of endothelial damage and platelet activation associate with high levels of IFNB1 and IFNA6. Seroconversion and time since hospitalization associate with a significant decrease in a specific subset of IFNs. Additionally, differential IFN subtype production is linked to distinct constellations of circulating myeloid and lymphoid immune cell types. Each IFN has a unique metabolic signature, with IFNG being the most associated with activation of the kynurenine pathway. IFNs also show differential relationships with clinical markers of poor prognosis and disease severity. For example, whereas IFNG has the strongest association with C-reactive protein and other immune markers of poor prognosis, IFNB1 associates with increased neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, a marker of late severe disease. Altogether, these results reveal specialized IFN action in COVID-19, with potential diagnostic and therapeutic implications.Copyright © 2022 the Author(s). Published by PNAS."

Current preclinical data suggest stem cell transplantation is a potential treatment for these chronic conditions that lack effective long-term treatment options. Finding treatments with a wider therapeutic window and harnessing a disease-modifying approach will likely improve clinical outcomes. The overarching concept of stem cell therapy entails the use of immature cells, while key in recapitulating brain development and presents the challenge of young grafted cells forming neural circuitry with the mature host brain cells. To this end, exploring strategies designed to nurture graft-host integration will likely enhance the reconstruction of the elusive neural circuitry. Enriched environment (EE) and exercise facilitate stem cell graft-host reconstruction of neural circuitry. It may involve at least a two-pronged mechanism whereby EE and exercise create a conducive microenvironment in the host brain, allowing the newly transplanted cells to survive, proliferate, and differentiate into neural cells; vice versa, EE and exercise may also train the transplanted immature cells to learn the neurochemical, physiological, and anatomical signals in the brain towards better functional graft-host connectivity.Copyright © 2022 Berlet, Galang Cabantan, Gonzales-Portillo and Borlongan."
"35276792","Traditional and Medical Applications of Fasting.","Nutrients","Fasting has been practiced for millennia, for religious, ethical, or health reasons. It is also commonplace among different species, from humans, to animals, to lower eukaryotes. Research on fasting is gaining traction based on recent studies that show its role in many adaptive cellular responses such as the reduction of oxidative damage and inflammation, increase of energy metabolism, and in boosting cellular protection. In this expert review, we recount the historical evolution of fasting and we critically analyze its current medical applications, including benefits and caveats. Based on the available data, we conclude that the manipulation of dietary intake, in the form of calorie restriction, intermittent fasting, dietary restriction with the exclusion of some nutrients, prolonged fasting, and so forth, is anthropologically engraved in human culture possibly because of its positive health effects. Indeed, many studies show that fasting ameliorates many biochemical parameters related to cardiovascular and cancer risk, and neurodegeneration. Mechanistic studies are plentiful, but largely limited to cell cultures or laboratory animals. Understandably, there are no controlled trials of any form of fasting that gauge the effects on [any cause] mortality. Physicians should be aware that misinformation is pervasive and that their patients often adopt dietary regimens that are far from being clinically validated. Moreover, doctors are often unaware of their patients' religious or traditional fasting and of its potential health effects. Based on current evidence, no long-term fasting should be undertaken without medical supervision until future research will hopefully help shed further light on fasting and its effects on human health."

The correlations between BIPI and clinicopathologic characteristics were determined by the chi-square test or Fisher's exact test. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the survival probability, and the log-rank test was used to analyze the differences in the survival probability among patients. The univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression model was used to screen the independent prognostic factors. A prognostic nomogram for disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) was built on the basis of the multivariate analyses. Furthermore, the calibration curve and decision curve analysis (DCA) were used to assess the predictive performance of the nomogram.All enrolled patients were split into three subgroups based on the BIPI score. The mean DFS and OS of the BIPI score 0 group and BIPI score 1 group were significantly longer than those of the BIPI score 2 group (42.02 vs. 38.61 vs. 26.01 months, 77.61 vs. 71.83 vs. 53.15 months; p < 0.05). Univariate and multivariate analyses indicated that BIPI was an independent prognostic factor for patients' DFS and OS (DFS, hazard ratio (HR): 6.720, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.629-27.717; OS, HR: 8.006, 95% CI: 1.638-39.119). A nomogram with a C-index of 0.873 (95% CI: 0.779-0.966) and 0.801 (95% CI: 0.702-0.901) had a favorable performance for predicting DFS and OS survival rates for clinical use by combining immune scores with other clinical features. The calibration curves at 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival suggested a good consistency between the predicted and actual DFS and OS probability. The DCA demonstrated that the constructed nomogram had better clinical predictive usefulness than only BIPI in predictive clinical applications of 5-year DFS and OS prognostic assessments.The patients with low BIPI score have better prognoses and longer DFS and OS. Furthermore, the BIPI-based nomogram may serve as a convenient prognostic tool for breast cancer and help in clinical decision-making.Copyright © 2022 Chen, Kong, Huang, Su, Zhu, Fang, Zhang, Li and Wang."

TPH2 methylation is correlated with antidepressant effects. Resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) is applied for detecting abnormal brain functional activity in patients with different antidepressant effects. We will investigate the effect of the interaction between rs-fMRI and TPH2 DNA methylation on the early antidepressant effects.A total of 300 patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and 100 healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled, of which 60 patients with MDD were subjected to rs-fMRI. Antidepressant responses was assessed by a 50% reduction in 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD-17) scores at baseline and after two weeks of medication. The RESTPlus software in MATLAB was used to analyze the rs-fMRI data. The amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF), regional homogeneity (ReHo), fractional ALFF (fALFF), and functional connectivity (FC) were used, and the above results were used as regions of interest (ROIs) to extract the average value of brain ROIs regions in the RESTPlus software. Generalized linear model analysis was performed to analyze the association between abnormal activity found in rs-fMRI and the effect of TPH2 DNA methylation on antidepressant responses.Two hundred ninety-one patients with MDD and 100 HCs were included in the methylation statistical analysis, of which 57 patients were included in the further rs-fMRI analysis (3 patients were excluded due to excessive head movement). 57 patients were divided into the responder group (n = 36) and the non-responder group (n = 21). Rs-fMRI results showed that the ALFF of the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) was significantly different between the two groups. The results showed that TPH2-1-43 methylation interacted with ALFF of left IFG to affect the antidepressant responses (p = 0.041, false discovery rate (FDR) corrected p = 0.149).Our study demonstrated that the differences in the ALFF of left IFG between the two groups and its association with TPH2 methylation affect short-term antidepressant drug responses.© 2022.

"35308874","Maternal Deprivation Increased Vulnerability to Depression in Adult Rats Through DRD2 Promoter Methylation in the Ventral Tegmental Area.","Front Psychiatry","Early life adversity is a risk factor for depression in adulthood; however, the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. This study aims to investigate the effect of DNA methylation of DRD2 gene on early life stress-induced depression in adult rats.Newborn Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to four groups: maternal deprivation group (MD), chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) group, maternal deprivation plus chronic unpredictable stress (MD/CUS) group, and normal control group (NOR). Behaviors were measured by open field test (OFT), sucrose preference test (SPT), and Original Research Article forced swimming test (FST). Fecal CORT level was detected by ELISA. Bisulfite amplicon sequencing PCR was used to assess methylation levels of DRD2 promoter.CUS and MD/CUS rats had a significantly shorter total distance, longer immobility time, and higher CORT level, while MD and MD/CUS rats had a significantly lower percentage of central distance, more feces, lower rate of sucrose preference, and lower levels of DRD2 protein and mRNA in the VTA than NOR rats. CUS rats showed a significantly higher DRD2 mRNA and protein levels in the VTA than NOR rats. CUS, MD, and MD/CUS rats showed a significantly higher level of DRD2 promoter methylation than NOR rats. CORT level was significantly correlated with the sucrose preference rate in SPT, the immobility time in FST, the total distance, and the number of fecal pellets in OFT. DRD2 protein level was significantly correlated with the sucrose preference rate and the number of fecal pellets. DRD2 mRNA level was significantly correlated with the percentage of central distance and the number of fecal pellets in OFT. The level of DRD2 promoter methylation was significantly correlated with the sucrose preference rate, immobility time, total distance, the percentage of central distance, and the number of fecal pellets.Early life MD increased vulnerability to stress-induced depressive-like behavior in adult rats. Enhanced DRD2 promoter methylation in the VTA may increase the susceptibility to depression.Copyright © 2022 Guo, Li, Wu, Zhu and Zhang."
"35235458","Epigenetic MRI: Noninvasive imaging of DNA methylation in the brain.","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","Significance Dynamic epigenetic activity is a fundamental mechanism underpinning how the brain changes its function during development and aging and in response to environmental and disease stimuli. We developed a technology called epigenetic MRI (eMRI) that enables noninvasive imaging of DNA methylation in the brain, a major epigenetic mechanism. eMRI reveals strong regional differences in global DNA methylation in pig brains, a model with stronger resemblance to human brains than are rodents. Given the noninvasive nature of eMRI, our results pave the way for a DNA-methylation imaging paradigm for living human brains. We expect eMRI to enable many studies to unravel the molecular control of brain function and disease."
"35311072","Cancer Neoantigens: Challenges and Future Directions for Prediction, Prioritization, and Validation.","Front Oncol","Prioritization of immunogenic neoantigens is key to enhancing cancer immunotherapy through the development of personalized vaccines, adoptive T cell therapy, and the prediction of response to immune checkpoint inhibition. Neoantigens are tumor-specific proteins that allow the immune system to recognize and destroy a tumor. Cancer immunotherapies, such as personalized cancer vaccines, adoptive T cell therapy, and immune checkpoint inhibition, rely on an understanding of the patient-specific neoantigen profile in order to guide personalized therapeutic strategies. Genomic approaches to predicting and prioritizing immunogenic neoantigens are rapidly expanding, raising new opportunities to advance these tools and enhance their clinical relevance. Predicting neoantigens requires acquisition of high-quality samples and sequencing data, followed by variant calling and variant annotation. Subsequently, prioritizing which of these neoantigens may elicit a tumor-specific immune response requires application and integration of tools to predict the expression, processing, binding, and recognition potentials of the neoantigen. Finally, improvement of the computational tools is held in constant tension with the availability of datasets with validated immunogenic neoantigens. The goal of this review article is to summarize the current knowledge and limitations in neoantigen prediction, prioritization, and validation and propose future directions that will improve personalized cancer treatment.Copyright © 2022 Borden, Buetow, Wilson and Hastings."
"35296332","Trans-acting genetic variants causing multilocus imprinting disturbance (MLID): common mechanisms and consequences.","Clin Epigenetics","Imprinting disorders are a group of congenital diseases which are characterized by molecular alterations affecting differentially methylated regions (DMRs). To date, at least twelve imprinting disorders have been defined with overlapping but variable clinical features including growth and metabolic disturbances, cognitive dysfunction, abdominal wall defects and asymmetry. In general, a single specific DMR is affected in an individual with a given imprinting disorder, but there are a growing number of reports on individuals with so-called multilocus imprinting disturbances (MLID), where aberrant imprinting marks (most commonly loss of methylation) occur at multiple DMRs. However, as the literature is fragmented, we reviewed the molecular and clinical data of 55 previously reported or newly identified MLID families with putative pathogenic variants in maternal effect genes (NLRP2, NLRP5, NLRP7, KHDC3L, OOEP, PADI6) and in other candidate genes (ZFP57, ARID4A, ZAR1, UHRF1, ZNF445).In 55 families, a total of 68 different candidate pathogenic variants were identified (7 in NLRP2, 16 in NLRP5, 7 in NLRP7, 17 in PADI6, 15 in ZFP57, and a single variant in each of the genes ARID4A, ZAR1, OOEP, UHRF1, KHDC3L and ZNF445). Clinical diagnoses of affected offspring included Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome spectrum, Silver-Russell syndrome spectrum, transient neonatal diabetes mellitus, or they were suspected for an imprinting disorder (undiagnosed). Some families had recurrent pregnancy loss.Genomic maternal effect and foetal variants causing MLID allow insights into the mechanisms behind the imprinting cycle of life, and the spatial and temporal function of the different factors involved in oocyte maturation and early development. Further basic research together with identification of new MLID families will enable a better understanding of the link between the different reproductive issues such as recurrent miscarriages and preeclampsia in maternal effect variant carriers/families and aneuploidy and the MLID observed in the offsprings. The current knowledge can already be employed in reproductive and genetic counselling in specific situations.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35269693","Transposable Elements and Human Diseases: Mechanisms and Implication in the Response to Environmental Pollutants.","Int J Mol Sci","Transposable elements (TEs) are recognized as major players in genome plasticity and evolution. The high abundance of TEs in the human genome, especially theAluand Long Interspersed Nuclear Element-1 (LINE-1) repeats, makes them responsible for the molecular origin of several diseases. This involves several molecular mechanisms that are presented in this review: insertional mutation, DNA recombination and chromosomal rearrangements, modification of gene expression, as well as alteration of epigenetic regulations. This literature review also presents some of the more recent and/or more classical examples of human diseases in which TEs are involved. Whether through insertion of LINE-1 orAluelements that cause chromosomal rearrangements, or through epigenetic modifications, TEs are widely implicated in the origin of human cancers. Many other human diseases can have a molecular origin in TE-mediated chromosomal recombination or alteration of gene structure and/or expression. These diseases are very diverse and include hemoglobinopathies, metabolic and neurological diseases, and common diseases. Moreover, TEs can also have an impact on aging. Finally, the exposure of individuals to stresses and environmental contaminants seems to have a non-negligible impact on the epigenetic derepression and mobility of TEs, which can lead to the development of diseases. Thus, improving our knowledge of TEs may lead to new potential diagnostic markers of diseases."
"35308118","Evidence That Substantia Nigra Pars Compacta Dopaminergic Neurons Are Selectively Vulnerable to Oxidative Stress Because They Are Highly Metabolically Active.","Front Cell Neurosci","There are 400-500 thousand dopaminergic cells within each side of the human substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) making them a minuscule portion of total brain mass. These tiny clusters of cells have an outsized impact on motor output and behavior as seen in disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD). SNpc dopaminergic neurons are more vulnerable to oxidative stress compared to other brain cell types, but the reasons for this are not precisely known. Here we provide evidence to support the hypothesis that this selective vulnerability is because SNpc neurons sustain high metabolic rates compared to other neurons. A higher baseline requirement for ATP production may lead to a selective vulnerability to impairments in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) or genetic insults that impair Complex I of the electron transport chain. We suggest that the energy demands of the unique morphological and electrophysiological properties of SNpc neurons may be one reason these cells produce more ATP than other cells. We further provide evidence to support the hypothesis that transcription factors (TFs) required to drive induction, differentiation, and maintenance of midbrain dopaminergic neural progenitor cells which give rise to terminally differentiated SNpc neurons are uniquely involved in both developmental patterning and metabolism, a dual function unlike other TFs that program neurons in other brain regions. The use of these TFs during induction and differentiation may program ventral midbrain progenitor cells metabolically to higher ATP levels, allowing for the development of those specialized cell processes seen in terminally differentiated cells. This paper provides a cellular and developmental framework for understanding the selective vulnerability of SNpc dopaminergic cells to oxidative stress.Copyright © 2022 Ni and Ernst."
"35291981","Mendelian randomization study of circulating lipids and biliary tract cancer among East Asians.","BMC Cancer","Associations of High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, total cholesterol (CHL), and triglyceride (TRG) concentrations with risk of biliary tract cancer (BtC) were conflicting in observational studies. We aim to investigate the causal link between circulating lipids and BtC using genetic information.Single nucleotide polymorphisms of the four circulating lipids (n = 34,421) and BtC (418 cases and 159,201 controls) were retrieved from two independent GWAS studies performed in East Asian populations. Two-sample univariate and multivariate Mendelian Randomization (MR) analyses were conducted to determine the causal link between circulating lipids and BtC.No significant horizontal pleiotropy was detected for all circulating lipids according to the MR-PRESSO global test (P = 0.458, 0.368, 0.522, and 0.587 for HDL, LDL, CHL, and TRG, respectively). No significant evidence of heterogeneity and directional pleiotropy was detected by the Cochran's Q test and MR-Egger regression. Univariate MR estimates from inverse variance weighting method suggested that one standard deviation (1-SD) increase of inverse-normal transformed HDL (OR = 1.38, 95% CI 0.98-1.94), LDL (OR = 1.46, 95% CI 0.96-2.23), and CHL (OR = 1.34, 95% CI 0.83-2.16) were not significantly associated with BtC risk. Whereas 1-SD increase of inverse-normal transformed TRG showed a significantly negative association with BtC risk (OR = 0.48, 95% CI 0.31-0.74). In multivariate MR analyses including all the four lipid traits, we found that 1-SD increase of LDL and TRG was significantly associated with elevated (OR = 1.32, 95% CI 1.04-2.01) and decreased (OR = 0.54, 95% CI 0.42-0.68) risk of BtC, respectively.Circulating lipids, particularly LDL and TRG, may have roles in the development of BtC. However, the results of this study should be replicated in MR with larger GWAS sample sizes for BtC.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35286307","SMetABF: A rapid algorithm for Bayesian GWAS meta-analysis with a large number of studies included.","PLoS Comput Biol","Bayesian methods are widely used in the GWAS meta-analysis. But the considerable consumption in both computing time and memory space poses great challenges for large-scale meta-analyses. In this research, we propose an algorithm named SMetABF to rapidly obtain the optimal ABF in the GWAS meta-analysis, where shotgun stochastic search (SSS) is introduced to improve the Bayesian GWAS meta-analysis framework, MetABF. Simulation studies confirm that SMetABF performs well in both speed and accuracy, compared to exhaustive methods and MCMC. SMetABF is applied to real GWAS datasets to find several essential loci related to Parkinson's disease (PD) and the results support the underlying relationship between PD and other autoimmune disorders. Developed as an R package and a web tool, SMetABF will become a useful tool to integrate different studies and identify more variants associated with complex traits."
"35284424","scMelody: An Enhanced Consensus-Based Clustering Model for Single-Cell Methylation Data by Reconstructing Cell-to-Cell Similarity.","Front Bioeng Biotechnol","Single-cell DNA methylation sequencing technology has brought new perspectives to investigate epigenetic heterogeneity, supporting a need for computational methods to cluster cells based on single-cell methylation profiles. Although several methods have been developed, most of them cluster cells based on single (dis)similarity measures, failing to capture complete cell heterogeneity and resulting in locally optimal solutions. Here, we present scMelody, which utilizes an enhanced consensus-based clustering model to reconstruct cell-to-cell methylation similarity patterns and identifies cell subpopulations with the leveraged information from multiple basic similarity measures. Besides, benefitted from the reconstructed cell-to-cell similarity measure, scMelody could conveniently leverage the clustering validation criteria to determine the optimal number of clusters. Assessments on distinct real datasets showed that scMelody accurately recapitulated methylation subpopulations and outperformed existing methods in terms of both cluster partitions and the number of clusters. Moreover, when benchmarking the clustering stability of scMelody on a variety of synthetic datasets, it achieved significant clustering performance gains over existing methods and robustly maintained its clustering accuracy over a wide range of number of cells, number of clusters and CpG dropout proportions. Finally, the real case studies demonstrated the capability of scMelody to assess known cell types and uncover novel cell clusters.Copyright © 2022 Tian, Zou, Tang, Liang, Cao and Fan."
"35275931","The ability to classify patients based on gene-expression data varies by algorithm and performance metric.","PLoS Comput Biol","By classifying patients into subgroups, clinicians can provide more effective care than using a uniform approach for all patients. Such subgroups might include patients with a particular disease subtype, patients with a good (or poor) prognosis, or patients most (or least) likely to respond to a particular therapy. Transcriptomic measurements reflect the downstream effects of genomic and epigenomic variations. However, high-throughput technologies generate thousands of measurements per patient, and complex dependencies exist among genes, so it may be infeasible to classify patients using traditional statistical models. Machine-learning classification algorithms can help with this problem. However, hundreds of classification algorithms exist-and most support diverse hyperparameters-so it is difficult for researchers to know which are optimal for gene-expression biomarkers. We performed a benchmark comparison, applying 52 classification algorithms to 50 gene-expression datasets (143 class variables). We evaluated algorithms that represent diverse machine-learning methodologies and have been implemented in general-purpose, open-source, machine-learning libraries. When available, we combined clinical predictors with gene-expression data. Additionally, we evaluated the effects of performing hyperparameter optimization and feature selection using nested cross validation. Kernel- and ensemble-based algorithms consistently outperformed other types of classification algorithms; however, even the top-performing algorithms performed poorly in some cases. Hyperparameter optimization and feature selection typically improved predictive performance, and univariate feature-selection algorithms typically outperformed more sophisticated methods. Together, our findings illustrate that algorithm performance varies considerably when other factors are held constant and thus that algorithm selection is a critical step in biomarker studies."

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small and secreted RNA molecules stable in blood and known to regulate physiological processes including glucose homeostasis. The aim of this study was to identify plasmatic miRNAs detectable in early pregnancy predicting IS at 24th-29th week of pregnancy.We quantified circulating miRNAs in 421 women in plasma collected at 9.6±2.2 weeks of pregnancy using next-generation sequencing.we detected 2170 miRNAs: 39 (35 positively and 4 negatively) were associated with IS as estimated by the Matsuda Index at 26.4±1.0 weeks of pregnancy. Lasso regression identified 18 miRNAs independently predicting Matsuda Index-estimated IS. Together with gestational age, maternal age and body mass index at first trimester, they explain 36% of IS variance in late second trimester of pregnancy. These miRNAs regulate fatty acid biosynthesis and metabolism among other pathways.In summary, we have identified first trimester plasmatic miRNAs predictive of Matsuda Index-estimated IS in late second trimester of pregnancy. These miRNAs could also contribute to initiate and support IS adaptation to pregnancy potentially through lipid metabolism regulation.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022.

"35323698","A Longitudinal <sup>1</sup>H NMR-Based Metabolic Profile Analysis of Urine from Hospitalized Premature Newborns Receiving Enteral and Parenteral Nutrition.","Metabolites","Preterm newborns are extremely vulnerable to morbidities, complications, and death. Preterm birth is a global public health problem due to its socioeconomic burden. Nurturing preterm newborns is a critical medical issue because they have limited nutrient stores and it is difficult to establish enteral feeding, which leads to inadequate growth frequently associated with poor neurodevelopmental outcomes. Parenteral nutrition (PN) provides nutrients to preterm newborns, but its biochemical effects are not completely known. To study the effect of PN treatment on preterm newborns, an untargeted metabolomic1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) assay was performed on 107 urine samples from 34 hospitalized patients. Multivariate data (Principal Component Analysis, PCA, Orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis OPLS-DA, parallel factor analysis PARAFAC-2) and univariate analyses were used to identify the association of specific spectral data with different nutritional types (NTs) and gestational ages. Our results revealed changes in the metabolic profile related to the NT, with the tricarboxylic acid cycle and galactose metabolic pathways being the most impacted pathways. Low citrate and succinate levels, despite higher glucose relative urinary concentrations, seem to constitute the metabolic profile found in the studied critically ill preterm newborns who received PN, indicating an energetic dysfunction that must be taken into account for better nutritional management."
