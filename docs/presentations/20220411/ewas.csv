35328979,Int J Environ Res Public Health,prenatal air pollution,infants ,cord blood,yes,Prenatal Exposure to Traffic-Related Air Pollution and the DNA Methylation in Cord Blood Cells: MOCEH Study.,"Particulate matter with a diameter of ≤10 µm (PM10) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) affect the DNA methylation in the fetus, but epigenetic studies regarding prenatal exposure to air pollution in Asia are lacking. Therefore, this study aimed to assess whether there is any association between the ambient concentrations of PM10and NO2and CpG methylation in the cord blood DNA by using a Korean birth cohort. The concentrations of the air pollutants were incorporated into the final LUR model by using the maternal address data. The methylation level was determined using HumanMethylationEPIC BeadChip and a linear regression analysis model. A multipollutant model including both PM10and NO2and models with single pollutants were used for each trimester exposure. The number of differentially methylated positions was the largest for midpregnancy exposure in both the single pollutant models and the multipollutant regression analysis. Additionally, gene-set analysis regarding midpregnancy exposure revealed four gene ontology terms (cellular response to staurosporine, positive regulation of cytoskeleton organization, neurotransmitter transport, and execution phase of apoptosis). In conclusion, these findings show an association between prenatal PM10and NO2exposure and DNA methylation in several CpG sites in cord blood cells, especially for midpregnancy exposure."
35317219,Environ Epigenet,prenatal acetominophen,infants,cord blood,yes,Association of prenatal acetaminophen use and acetaminophen metabolites with DNA methylation of newborns: analysis of two consecutive generations of the Isle of Wight birth cohort.,"Acetaminophen is used by nearly two-thirds of pregnant women. Although considered safe, studies have demonstrated associations between prenatal acetaminophen use and adverse health outcomes in offspring. Since DNA methylation (DNAm) at birth may act as an early indicator of later health, assessments on whether DNAm of newborns is associated with gestational acetaminophen use or its metabolites are needed. Using data from three consecutive generations of the Isle of Wight cohort (F0-grandmothers, F1-mothers, and F2-offspring) we investigated associations between acetaminophen metabolites in F0 serum at delivery with epigenome-wide DNAm in F1 (Guthrie cards) and between acetaminophen use of F1 and F2-cord-serum levels with F2 cord blood DNAm. In epigenome-wide screening, we eliminated non-informative DNAm sites followed by linear regression of informative sites. Based on repeated pregnancies, indication bias analyses tested whether acetaminophen indicated maternal diseases or has a risk in its own right. Considering that individuals with similar intake process acetaminophen differently, metabolites were clustered to distinguish metabolic exposures. Finally, metabolite clusters from F1-maternal and F2-cord sera were tested for their associations with newborn DNAm (F1 and F2). Twenty-one differential DNAm sites in cord blood were associated with reported maternal acetaminophen intake in the F2 generation. For 11 of these cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites, an indication bias was excluded and five were replicated in F2 with metabolite clusters. In addition, metabolite clusters showed associations with 25 CpGs in the F0-F1 discovery analysis, of which five CpGs were replicated in the F2-generation. Our results suggest that prenatal acetaminophen use, measured as metabolites, may influence DNAm in newborns.Published by Oxford University Press 2022.

35347270,Eur J Hum Genet,grandmaternal smoking,children,blood,maybe,Grandmaternal smoking during pregnancy is associated with differential DNA methylation in peripheral blood of their grandchildren.,"The idea that information can be transmitted to subsequent generation(s) by epigenetic means has been studied for decades but remains controversial in humans. Epidemiological studies have established that grandparental exposures are associated with health outcomes in their grandchildren, often with sex-specific effects; however, the mechanism of transmission is still unclear. We conducted Epigenome Wide Association Studies (EWAS) to test whether grandmaternal smoking during pregnancy is associated with altered DNA methylation (DNAm) in peripheral blood from their adolescent grandchildren. We used data from a birth cohort, with discovery and replication datasets of up to 1225 and 708 individuals (respectively, for the maternal line), aged 15-17 years, and tested replication in the same individuals at birth and 7 years. We show for the first time that DNAm at a small number of loci in cord blood is associated with grandmaternal smoking in humans. In adolescents we see suggestive associations in regions of the genome which we hypothesised a priori could be involved in transgenerational transmission - we observe sex-specific associations at two sites on the X chromosome and one in an imprinting control region. All are within transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs), and we observe enrichment for TFBS among the CpG sites with the strongest associations; however, there is limited evidence that the associations we see replicate between timepoints. The implication of this work is that effects of smoking during pregnancy may induce DNAm changes in later generations and that these changes are often sex-specific, in line with epidemiological associations.© 2022.

35302492,Elife,expression,children,blood,yes,Identification of autosomal cis expression quantitative trait methylation (cis eQTMs) in children's blood.,"The identification of expression quantitative trait methylation (eQTMs), defined as associations between DNA methylation levels and gene expression, might help the biological interpretation of epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS). We aimed to identify autosomal cis eQTMs in children's blood, using data from 832 children of the Human Early Life Exposome (HELIX) project.Blood DNA methylation and gene expression were measured with the Illumina 450K and the Affymetrix HTA v2 arrays, respectively. The relationship between methylation levels and expression of nearby genes (1 Mb window centered at the transcription start site, TSS) was assessed by fitting 13.6 M linear regressions adjusting for sex, age, cohort, and blood cell composition.We identified 39,749 blood autosomal cis eQTMs, representing 21,966 unique CpGs (eCpGs, 5.7% of total CpGs) and 8,886 unique transcript clusters (eGenes, 15.3% of total transcript clusters, equivalent to genes). In 87.9% of these cis eQTMs, the eCpG was located at <250 kb from eGene's TSS; and 58.8% of all eQTMs showed an inverse relationship between the methylation and expression levels. Only around half of the autosomal cis-eQTMs eGenes could be captured through annotation of the eCpG to the closest gene. eCpGs had less measurement error and were enriched for active blood regulatory regions and for CpGs reported to be associated with environmental exposures or phenotypic traits. In 40.4% of the eQTMs, the CpG and the eGene were both associated with at least one genetic variant. The overlap of autosomal cis eQTMs in children's blood with those described in adults was small (13.8%), and age-shared cis eQTMs tended to be proximal to the TSS and enriched for genetic variants.This catalogue of autosomal cis eQTMs in children's blood can help the biological interpretation of EWAS findings and is publicly available at https://helixomics.isglobal.org/ and at Dryad (doi:10.5061/dryad.fxpnvx0t0).The study has received funding from the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-206) under grant agreement no 308333 (HELIX project); the H2020-EU.3.1.2. - Preventing Disease Programme under grant agreement no 874583 (ATHLETE project); from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement no 733206 (LIFECYCLE project), and from the European Joint Programming Initiative ""A Healthy Diet for a Healthy Life"" (JPI HDHL and Instituto de Salud Carlos III) under the grant agreement no AC18/00006 (NutriPROGRAM project).

35379837,Sci Rep,handedness,children and adults,blood and saliva,no,DNA methylation in peripheral tissues and left-handedness.,"Handedness has low heritability and epigenetic mechanisms have been proposed as an etiological mechanism. To examine this hypothesis, we performed an epigenome-wide association study of left-handedness. In a meta-analysis of 3914 adults of whole-blood DNA methylation, we observed that CpG sites located in proximity of handedness-associated genetic variants were more strongly associated with left-handedness than other CpG sites (P = 0.04), but did not identify any differentially methylated positions. In longitudinal analyses of DNA methylation in peripheral blood and buccal cells from children (N = 1737), we observed moderately stable associations across age (correlation range [0.355-0.578]), but inconsistent across tissues (correlation range [- 0.384 to 0.318]). We conclude that DNA methylation in peripheral tissues captures little of the variance in handedness. Future investigations should consider other more targeted sources of tissue, such as the brain.© 2022. The Author(s)."
35277542,Sci Rep,smoking,Costa Rican adults,blood,yes,Epigenome-wide association study and epigenetic age acceleration associated with cigarette smoking among Costa Rican adults.,"Smoking-associated DNA methylation (DNAm) signatures are reproducible among studies of mostly European descent, with mixed evidence if smoking accelerates epigenetic aging and its relationship to longevity. We evaluated smoking-associated DNAm signatures in the Costa Rican Study on Longevity and Healthy Aging (CRELES), including participants from the high longevity region of Nicoya. We measured genome-wide DNAm in leukocytes, tested Epigenetic Age Acceleration (EAA) from five clocks and estimates of telomere length (DNAmTL), and examined effect modification by the high longevity region. 489 participants had a mean (SD) age of 79.4 (10.8) years, and 18% were from Nicoya. Overall, 7.6% reported currently smoking, 35% were former smokers, and 57.4% never smoked. 46 CpGs and five regions (e.g. AHRR, SCARNA6/SNORD39, SNORA20, and F2RL3) were differentially methylated for current smokers. Former smokers had increased Horvath's EAA (1.69-years; 95% CI 0.72, 2.67), Hannum's EAA (0.77-years; 95% CI 0.01, 1.52), GrimAge (2.34-years; 95% CI1.66, 3.02), extrinsic EAA (1.27-years; 95% CI 0.34, 2.21), intrinsic EAA (1.03-years; 95% CI 0.12, 1.94) and shorter DNAmTL (- 0.04-kb; 95% CI - 0.08, - 0.01) relative to non-smokers. There was no evidence of effect modification among residents of Nicoya. Our findings recapitulate previously reported and novel smoking-associated DNAm changes in a Latino cohort.© 2022.

35377194,Environ Health Perspect,glyphosate (herbicide) exposure,postmenopausal women,blood,yes,Association of Glyphosate Exposure with Blood DNA Methylation in a Cross-Sectional Study of Postmenopausal Women.,"Glyphosate is the most commonly used herbicide in the world and is purported to have a variety of health effects, including endocrine disruption and an elevated risk of several types of cancer. Blood DNA methylation has been shown to be associated with many other environmental exposures, but to our knowledge, no studies to date have examined the association between blood DNA methylation and glyphosate exposure.We conducted an epigenome-wide association study to identify DNA methylation loci associated with urinary glyphosate and its metabolite aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) levels. Secondary goals were to determine the association of epigenetic age acceleration with glyphosate and AMPA and develop blood DNA methylation indices to predict urinary glyphosate and AMPA levels.For 392 postmenopausal women, white blood cell DNA methylation was measured using the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip array. Glyphosate and AMPA were measured in two urine samples per participant using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Methylation differences at the probe and regional level associated with glyphosate and AMPA levels were assessed using a resampling-based approach. Probes and regions that had an false discovery rateq<0.1in≥90%of 1,000 subsamples of the study population were considered differentially methylated. Differentially methylated sites from the probe-specific analysis were combined into a methylation index. Epigenetic age acceleration from three epigenetic clocks and an epigenetic measure of pace of aging were examined for associations with glyphosate and AMPA.We identified 24 CpG sites whose methylation level was associated with urinary glyphosate concentration and two associated with AMPA. Four regions, within the promoters of theMSH4,KCNA6,ABAT, andNDUFAF2/ERCC8genes, were associated with glyphosate levels, along with an association betweenESR1promoter hypomethylation and AMPA. The methylation index accurately predicted glyphosate levels in an internal validation cohort. AMPA, but not glyphosate, was associated with greater epigenetic age acceleration.Glyphosate and AMPA exposure were associated with DNA methylation differences that could promote the development of cancer and other diseases. Further studies are warranted to replicate our results, determine the functional impact of glyphosate- and AMPA-associated differential DNA methylation, and further explore whether DNA methylation could serve as a biomarker of glyphosate exposure. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP10174."
35274472,J Cachexia Sarcopenia Muscle,critical illness,adults,muscle,yes,DNA methylation alterations in muscle of critically ill patients.,"Intensive care unit (ICU)-acquired weakness can persist beyond ICU stay and has been associated with long-term functional impairment of ICU survivors. Recently, DNA methylation alterations were found in the blood of ICU patients, partially explaining long-term developmental impairment of critically ill children. As illness-induced aberrant DNA methylation theoretically could also be involved in long-term weakness, we investigated whether the DNA methylation signature in muscle of adult critically ill patients differs from that in muscle of healthy controls.Genome-wide methylation was determined (Infinium® HumanMethylationEPIC BeadChips) in DNA extracted from skeletal muscle biopsies that had been collected on Day 8 ± 1 in ICU from 172 EPaNIC-trial patients [66% male sex, median age 62.7 years, median body mass index (BMI) 25.9 kg/m2] and 20 matched healthy controls (70% male sex, median age 58.0 years, median BMI 24.4 kg/m2). Methylation status of individual cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites of patients and controls was compared with F-tests, using the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate to correct for multiple comparisons. Differential methylation of DNA regions was assessed with bump hunting, with 1000 permutations assessing uncertainty, expressed as family-wise error rate. Gene expression was investigated for 10 representative affected genes.In DNA from ICU patients, 565 CpG sites, associated with 400 unique genes, were differentially methylated as compared with controls (average difference 3.2 ± 0.1% ranging up to 16.9%, P < 0.00005). Many of the associated genes appeared highly relevant for muscle structure and function/weakness, including genes involved in myogenesis, muscle regeneration, nerve/muscle membrane excitability, muscle denervation/re-innervation, axon guidance/myelination/degeneration/regeneration, synapse function, ion channelling with especially calcium signalling, metabolism (glucose, protein, and fat), insulin signalling, neuroendocrine hormone regulation, mitochondrial function, autophagy, apoptosis, oxidative stress, Wnt signalling, transcription regulation, muscle fat infiltration during regeneration, and fibrosis. In patients as compared with controls, we also identified two hypomethylated regions, spanning 18 and 3 CpG sites in the promoters of the HIC1 and NADK2 genes, respectively (average differences 5.8 ± 0.01% and 12.1 ± 0.04%, family-wise error rate <0.05). HIC1 and NADK2 play important roles in muscle regeneration and postsynaptic acetylcholine receptors and in mitochondrial processes, respectively. Nine of 10 investigated genes containing DNA methylation alterations were differentially expressed in patients as compared with controls (P ≤ 0.03).Critically ill patients present with a different DNA methylation signature in skeletal muscle as compared with healthy controls, which in theory could provide a biological basis for long-term persistence of weakness in ICU survivors.ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00512122, registered on 31 July 2007.© 2022 The Authors.

35354486,Genome Med,depression prs,adults,blood,yes,DNA methylome-wide association study of genetic risk for depression implicates antigen processing and immune responses.,"Depression is a disabling and highly prevalent condition where genetic and epigenetic, such as DNA methylation (DNAm), differences contribute to disease risk. DNA methylation is influenced by genetic variation but the association between polygenic risk of depression and DNA methylation is unknown.We investigated the association between polygenic risk scores (PRS) for depression and DNAm by conducting a methylome-wide association study (MWAS) in Generation Scotland (N = 8898, mean age = 49.8 years) with replication in the Lothian Birth Cohorts of 1921 and 1936 and adults in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) (Ncombined= 2049, mean age = 79.1, 69.6 and 47.2 years, respectively). We also conducted a replication MWAS in the ALSPAC children (N = 423, mean age = 17.1 years). Gene ontology analysis was conducted for the cytosine-guanine dinucleotide (CpG) probes significantly associated with depression PRS, followed by Mendelian randomisation (MR) analysis to infer the causal relationship between depression and DNAm.Widespread associations (NCpG= 71, pBonferroni< 0.05, p < 6.3 × 10-8) were found between PRS constructed using genetic risk variants for depression and DNAm in CpG probes that localised to genes involved in immune responses and neural development. The effect sizes for the significant associations were highly correlated between the discovery and replication samples in adults (r = 0.79) and in adolescents (r = 0.82). Gene Ontology analysis showed that significant CpG probes are enriched in immunological processes in the human leukocyte antigen system. Additional MWAS was conducted for each lead genetic risk variant. Over 47.9% of the independent genetic risk variants included in the PRS showed associations with DNAm in CpG probes located in both the same (cis) and distal (trans) locations to the genetic loci (pBonferroni< 0.045). Subsequent MR analysis showed that there are a greater number of causal effects found from DNAm to depression than vice versa (DNAm to depression: pFDRranged from 0.024 to 7.45 × 10-30; depression to DNAm: pFDRranged from 0.028 to 0.003).PRS for depression, especially those constructed from genome-wide significant genetic risk variants, showed methylome-wide differences associated with immune responses. Findings from MR analysis provided evidence for causal effect of DNAm to depression.© 2022. The Author(s)."
35346352,Clin Epigenetics,chronic lower back pain,adults,blood,yes,Epigenome-wide DNA methylation profiling of conditioned pain modulation in individuals with non-specific chronic low back pain.,"The pathoanatomic cause of chronic low back pain (cLBP) cannot be identified for up to 90% of individuals. However, dysfunctional processing of endogenous nociceptive input, measured as conditioned pain modulation (CPM), has been associated with cLBP and may involve changes in neuronal gene expression. Epigenetic-induced changes such as DNA methylation (DNAm) have been associated with cLBP.In the present study, the relationship between CPM and DNAm changes in a sample of community-dwelling adults with nonspecific cLBP (n = 48) and pain-free controls (PFC; n = 50) was examined using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing. Gene ontology (GO) term enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis were applied to identify key pathways involved in efficient versus deficient CPM.Based on CPM efficiency, we identified 6006 and 18,305 differentially methylated CpG sites (DMCs) with q values < 0.01 among individuals with cLBP and PFCs, respectively. Most of the DMCs were hypomethylated and annotated to genes of relevance to pain, including OPRM1, ADRB2, CACNA2D3, GNA12, LPL, NAXD, and ASPHD1. In both cLBP and PFC groups, the DMCs annotated genes enriched many GO terms relevant to pain processing, including transcription regulation by RNA polymerase II, nervous system development, generation of neurons, neuron differentiation, and neurogenesis. Both groups also enriched the pathways involved in Rap1-signaling, cancer, and dopaminergic neurogenesis. However, MAPK-Ras signaling pathways were enriched in the cLBP, not the PFC group.This is the first study to investigate the genome-scale DNA methylation profiles of CPM phenotype in adults with cLBP and PFCs. Based on CPM efficiency, fewer DMC enrichment pathways were unique to the cLBP than the PFCs group. Our results suggest that epigenetically induced modification of neuronal development/differentiation pathways may affect CPM efficiency, suggesting novel potential therapeutic targets for central sensitization. However, CPM efficiency and the experience of nonspecific cLBP may be independent. Further mechanistic studies are required to confirm the relationship between CPM, central sensitization, and nonspecific cLBP.© 2022. The Author(s)."
