"35387486","Genetic Landscape of the ACE2 Coronavirus Receptor.","Circulation","Background:Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiologic agent of COVID-19, enters human cells using the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein as a receptor. ACE2 is thus key to the infection and treatment of the coronavirus. ACE2 is highly expressed in the heart, respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, playing important regulatory roles in the cardiovascular and other biologic systems. However, the genetic basis of the ACE2 protein levels is not well understood.Methods:We conduct so far the largest genome-wide association meta-analysis of plasma ACE2 levels in over 28,000 individuals of the SCALLOP Consortium. We summarize the cross-sectional epidemiologic correlates of circulating ACE2. Using the summary-statistics-based high-definition likelihood method, we estimate relevant genetic correlations with cardiometabolic phenotypes, COVID-19, and other human complex traits and diseases. We perform causal inference of soluble ACE2 on vascular disease outcomes and COVID-19 disease severity using Mendelian randomization. We also perform in silico functional analysis by integrating with other types of omics data.Results:We identified ten loci, including eight novel, capturing 30% of the protein's heritability. We detected that plasma ACE2 was genetically correlated with vascular diseases, severe COVID-19, and a wide range of human complex diseases and medications. An X-chromosome cis-pQTL-based Mendelian randomization analysis suggested a causal effect of elevated ACE2 levels on COVID-19 severity (odds ratio (OR), 1.63; 95% CI, 1.10 to 2.42;P= 0.01), hospitalization (OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.05 to 2.21;P= 0.03), and infection (OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.08 to 2.37;P= 0.02). Tissue- and cell-type-specific transcriptomic and epigenomic analysis revealed that the ACE2 regulatory variants were enriched for DNA methylation sites in blood immune cells.Conclusions:Human plasma ACE2 shares a genetic basis with cardiovascular disease, COVID-19, and other related diseases. The genetic architecture of the ACE2 protein is mapped, providing a useful resource for further biological and clinical studies on this coronavirus receptor."
"35386944","Genome-wide DNA methylation pattern in systemic sclerosis microvascular endothelial cells: Identification of epigenetically affected key genes and pathways.","J Scleroderma Relat Disord","The etiology of systemic sclerosis is not clear, but there is evidence suggesting a critical role for epigenetic alterations in disease pathogenesis and clinical expression. We sought, in this study, to characterize the genome-wide DNA methylation signature in systemic sclerosis microvascular endothelial cells.We performed a genome-wide DNA methylation study in microvascular endothelial cells derived from seven diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis patients compared to seven age-, sex-, and ethnicity-matched healthy controls. We paired matched samples on Illumina HumanMethylation450 (three diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis microvascular endothelial cells and three controls), and reproduced the results in an independent set of matched patient and controls using Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC (four diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis patients and four controls) to identify differentially methylated genes.We identified 71,353 differentially methylated CpG sites in systemic sclerosis microvascular endothelial cells using Infinium MethylationEPIC microarray in the first group (0.081% of representative probes) and 33,170 CpG sites in the second group using HumanMethylation450 microarray (0.073% of representative probes) in diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis microvascular endothelial cells. Among the two groups of subjects, we identified differential methylation of 2455 CpG sites, representing 1301 genes. Most of the differentially methylated CpG sites were hypermethylated (1625 CpG), corresponding to 910 genes. Common hypermethylated genes in systemic sclerosis microvascular endothelial cells includeNOS1, DNMT3A, DNMT3B, HDAC4, andANGPT2.We also identified hypomethylation ofIL17RA, CTNNA3, ICAM2, andSDK1in systemic sclerosis microvascular endothelial cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate significant inverse correlation between DNA methylation status and gene expression in the majority of genes evaluated. Gene ontology analysis of hypermethylated genes demonstrated enrichment of genes involved in angiogenesis (p= 0.0006). Pathway analysis of hypomethylated genes includes genes involved in vascular smooth muscle contraction (p= 0.014) and adherens junctions (p= 0.013).Our data suggest the presence of significant genome-wide DNA methylation aberrancies in systemic sclerosis microvascular endothelial cells, and identify novel affected genes and pathways in systemic sclerosis microvascular endothelial cells.© The Author(s) 2021."
"35386832","Pollution induces epigenetic effects that are stably transmitted across multiple generations.","Evol Lett","It has been hypothesized that the effects of pollutants on phenotypes can be passed to subsequent generations through epigenetic inheritance, affecting populations long after the removal of a pollutant. But there is still little evidence that pollutants can induce persistent epigenetic effects in animals. Here, we show that low doses of commonly used pollutants induce genome-wide differences in cytosine methylation in the freshwater crustaceanDaphnia pulex. Uniclonal populations were either continually exposed to pollutants or switched to clean water, and methylation was compared to control populations that did not experience pollutant exposure. Although some direct changes to methylation were only present in the continually exposed populations, others were present in both the continually exposed and switched to clean water treatments, suggesting that these modifications had persisted for 7 months (>15 generations). We also identified modifications that were only present in the populations that had switched to clean water, indicating a long-term legacy of pollutant exposure distinct from the persistent effects. Pollutant-induced differential methylation tended to occur at sites that were highly methylated in controls. Modifications that were observed in both continually and switched treatments were highly methylated in controls and showed reduced methylation in the treatments. On the other hand, modifications found just in the switched treatment tended to have lower levels of methylation in the controls and showed increase methylation in the switched treatment. In a second experiment, we confirmed that sublethal doses of the same pollutants generate effects on life histories for at least three generations following the removal of the pollutant. Our results demonstrate that even low doses of pollutants can induce transgenerational epigenetic effects that are stably transmitted over many generations. Persistent effects are likely to influence phenotypic development, which could contribute to the rapid adaptation, or extinction, of populations confronted by anthropogenic stressors.© 2022 The Authors.

"35385786","Occupational lead exposure on genome-wide DNA methylation and DNA damage.","Environ Pollut","Lead (Pb) exposure can induce DNA damage and alter DNA methylation but their inter-relationships have not been adequately determined. Our overall aims were to explore such relationships and to evaluate underlying epigenetic mechanisms of Pb-induced genotoxicity in Chinese workers. Blood Pb levels (BLLs) were determined and used as individual's Pb-exposure dose and the Comet assay (i.e., % tail DNA) was conducted to evaluate DNA damage. In the screening assay, 850 K BeadChip sequencing was performed on peripheral blood from 10 controls (BLLs ≤100 μg/L) and 20 exposed workers (i.e., 10 DNA-damaged and 10 DNA-undamaged workers). Using the technique, differentially methylated positions (DMPs) between the controls and the exposed workers were identified. In addition, DMPs were identified between the DNA-undamaged and DNA-damaged workers (% tail DNA >2.14%). In our validation assay, methylation levels of four candidate genes were measured by pyrosequencing in an independent sample set (n = 305), including RRAGC (Ras related GTP binding C), USP1 (Ubiquitin specific protease 1), COPS7B (COP9 signalosome subunit 7 B) and CHEK1 (Checkpoint kinase 1). The result of comparisons between the controls and the Pb-exposed workers show that DMPs were significantly enriched in genes related to nerve conduction and cell cycle. Between DNA-damaged group and DNA-undamaged group, differentially methylated genes were enriched in the pathways related cell cycle and DNA integrity checkpoints. Additionally, methylation levels of RRAGC and USP1 were negatively associated with BLLs (P < 0.05), and the former mediated 19.40% of the effect of Pb on the % tail DNA. These findings collectively indicate that Pb-induced DNA damage was closely related to methylation of genes in cell cycle regulation, and methylation levels of RRAGC were involved in Pb-induced genotoxicity.Copyright © 2022.

"35384273","Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling confirms a case of low-level mosaic Kabuki syndrome 1.","Am J Med Genet A","Kabuki syndrome is a Mendelian disorder of the epigenetic machinery characterized by typical dysmorphic features, intellectual disability, and postnatal growth deficiency. Pathogenic variants in the genes encoding the chromatin modifiers KMT2D and KDM6A are responsible for Kabuki syndrome 1 (KS1) and Kabuki syndrome 2 (KS2), respectively. In addition, 11 cases of KS1 caused by mosaic variants in KMT2D have been reported in the literature. Some of these individuals display milder craniofacial and growth phenotypes, and most do not have congenital heart defects. We report the case of an infant with severe hypoplastic left heart syndrome with mitral atresia and aortic atresia (HLHS MA-AA), pulmonary vein stenosis, and atypical facies with a somatic mosaic de novo nonsense variant in KMT2D (c.8200C>T, p.R2734*) identified on trio exome sequencing of peripheral blood and present in 11.2% of sequencing reads. KS was confirmed with EpiSign, a diagnostic genome-wide DNA methylation platform used to identify epigenetic signatures. This case suggests that use of this newly available clinical test can guide the interpretation of low-level mosaic variants identified through sequencing and suggests a new lower limit of mosaicism in whole blood required for a diagnosis of KS.© 2022 The Authors.

"35383530","Autophagopathies: from autophagy gene polymorphisms to precision medicine for human diseases.","Autophagy","At a time when complex diseases affect globally 280 million people and claim 14 million lives every year, there is an urgent need to rapidly increase our knowledge into their underlying etiologies. Though critical in identifying the people at risk, the causal environmental factors (microbiome and/or pollutants) and the affected pathophysiological mechanisms are not well understood. Herein, we consider the variations of autophagy-related (ATG) genes at the heart of mechanisms of increased susceptibility to environmental stress. A comprehensive autophagy genomic resource is presented with 263 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for 69 autophagy-related genes associated with 117 autoimmune, inflammatory, infectious, cardiovascular, neurological, respiratory, and endocrine diseases. We thus propose the term 'autophagopathies' to group together a class of complex human diseases the etiology of which lies in a genetic defect of the autophagy machinery, whether directly related or not to an abnormal flux in autophagy, LC3-associated phagocytosis, or any associated trafficking. The future of precision medicine for common diseases will lie in our ability to exploit theseATGSNP x environment relationships to develop new polygenetic risk scores, new management guidelines, and optimal therapies for afflicted patients.Abbreviations:ATG, autophagy-related; ALS-FTD, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-frontotemporal dementia; ccRCC, clear cell renal cell carcinoma; CD, Crohn disease; COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; eQTL, expression quantitative trait loci; HCC, hepatocellular carcinoma; HNSCC, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma; GTEx, genotype-tissue expression; GWAS, genome-wide association studies; LAP, LC3-associated phagocytosis; LC3-II, phosphatidylethanolamine conjugated form of LC3; LD, linkage disequilibrium; LUAD, lung adenocarcinoma; MAF, minor allele frequency; MAP1LC3/LC3: microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3; NSCLC, non-small cell lung cancer; OS, overall survival; PtdIns3K CIII, class III phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; PtdIns3P, phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate; SLE, systemic lupus erythematosus; SNPs, single-nucleotide polymorphisms; mQTL, methylation quantitative trait loci; ULK, unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase; UTRs, untranslated regions; WHO, World Health Organization."

Due to challenges with isolating intermediate cell states, genome-wide cytosine modifications that define transition are not completely understood.Methods:The authors measured multiple DNA cytosine modification marks and chromatin accessibility across clonal populations residing in specific EMT states.Results:Clones exhibiting more intermediate EMT phenotypes demonstrated increased 5-hydroxymethylcytosine and decreased 5-methylcytosine. Open chromatin regions containing increased 5-hydroxymethylcytosine CpG loci were enriched in EMT transcription factor motifs and were associated with Rho GTPases.Conclusion:The results indicate the importance of both distinct and shared epigenetic profiles associated with EMT processes that may be targeted to prevent EMT progression."

Recent transcriptome profiling transformed our understanding of its biology and generally algal biology, but epigenetic regulation remains understudied and represents a fundamental gap in our understanding of algal gene expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing (ChIP-Seq) is a powerful tool for the discovery of such mechanisms, by identifying genome-wide histone modification patterns and transcription factor-binding sites alike. Here, we established a ChIP-Seq framework forChr. zofingiensisyielding over 20 million high-quality reads per sample. The most critical steps in a ChIP experiment were optimized, including DNA shearing to obtain an average DNA fragment size of 250 bp and assessment of the recommended formaldehyde concentration for optimal DNA-protein cross-linking. We used this ChIP-Seq framework to generate a genome-wide map of the H3K4me3 distribution pattern and to integrate these data with matching RNA-Seq data. In line with observations from other organisms, H3K4me3 marks predominantly transcription start sites of genes.

"35379837","DNA methylation in peripheral tissues and left-handedness.","Sci Rep","Handedness has low heritability and epigenetic mechanisms have been proposed as an etiological mechanism. To examine this hypothesis, we performed an epigenome-wide association study of left-handedness. In a meta-analysis of 3914 adults of whole-blood DNA methylation, we observed that CpG sites located in proximity of handedness-associated genetic variants were more strongly associated with left-handedness than other CpG sites (P = 0.04), but did not identify any differentially methylated positions. In longitudinal analyses of DNA methylation in peripheral blood and buccal cells from children (N = 1737), we observed moderately stable associations across age (correlation range [0.355-0.578]), but inconsistent across tissues (correlation range [- 0.384 to 0.318]). We conclude that DNA methylation in peripheral tissues captures little of the variance in handedness. Future investigations should consider other more targeted sources of tissue, such as the brain.© 2022. The Author(s)."

The study enrolled 119 subjects, including 55 BD spectrum (BDS) subjects diagnosed with BD or major depressive disorder (MDD) with subthreshold BD symptoms and 64 non-BDS subjects comprising 32 MDD subjects without BD symptoms and 32 healthy subjects. The blood samples underwent genome-wide genotyping and methylation quantification. We derived polygenic risk score (PRS) and methylation profile score (MPS) as weighted summations of risk single nucleotide polymorphisms and methylation probes, respectively, which were considered as molecular measures of genetic and environmental risks for BD. Linear regression was used to relate PRS, MPS, and their interaction to 44 brain structure measures quantified from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on 47 BDS subjects, and the results were compared with those based on family history and childhood trauma. After multiplicity corrections using false discovery rate (FDR), MPS was found to be negatively associated with the volume of the medial geniculate thalamus (FDR = 0.059, partial R2 = 0.208). Family history, trauma scale, and PRS were not associated with any brain measures. PRS and MPS show significant interactions on whole putamen (FDR = 0.09, partial R2 = 0.337). No significant gene-environment interactions were identified for the family history and trauma scale. PRS and MPS generally explained greater proportions of variances of the brain measures (range of partial R2 = [0.008, 0.337]) than the clinical risk factors (range = [0.004, 0.228]).© 2022.

"35377194","Association of Glyphosate Exposure with Blood DNA Methylation in a Cross-Sectional Study of Postmenopausal Women.","Environ Health Perspect","Glyphosate is the most commonly used herbicide in the world and is purported to have a variety of health effects, including endocrine disruption and an elevated risk of several types of cancer. Blood DNA methylation has been shown to be associated with many other environmental exposures, but to our knowledge, no studies to date have examined the association between blood DNA methylation and glyphosate exposure.We conducted an epigenome-wide association study to identify DNA methylation loci associated with urinary glyphosate and its metabolite aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) levels. Secondary goals were to determine the association of epigenetic age acceleration with glyphosate and AMPA and develop blood DNA methylation indices to predict urinary glyphosate and AMPA levels.For 392 postmenopausal women, white blood cell DNA methylation was measured using the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip array. Glyphosate and AMPA were measured in two urine samples per participant using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Methylation differences at the probe and regional level associated with glyphosate and AMPA levels were assessed using a resampling-based approach. Probes and regions that had an false discovery rateq<0.1in≥90%of 1,000 subsamples of the study population were considered differentially methylated. Differentially methylated sites from the probe-specific analysis were combined into a methylation index. Epigenetic age acceleration from three epigenetic clocks and an epigenetic measure of pace of aging were examined for associations with glyphosate and AMPA.We identified 24 CpG sites whose methylation level was associated with urinary glyphosate concentration and two associated with AMPA. Four regions, within the promoters of theMSH4,KCNA6,ABAT, andNDUFAF2/ERCC8genes, were associated with glyphosate levels, along with an association betweenESR1promoter hypomethylation and AMPA. The methylation index accurately predicted glyphosate levels in an internal validation cohort. AMPA, but not glyphosate, was associated with greater epigenetic age acceleration.Glyphosate and AMPA exposure were associated with DNA methylation differences that could promote the development of cancer and other diseases. Further studies are warranted to replicate our results, determine the functional impact of glyphosate- and AMPA-associated differential DNA methylation, and further explore whether DNA methylation could serve as a biomarker of glyphosate exposure. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP10174."
"35373418","Developmental arsenic exposure impairs cognition, directly targets DNMT3A, and reduces DNA methylation.","EMBO Rep","Developmental arsenic exposure has been associated with cognitive deficits in epidemiological studies, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we establish a mouse model of developmental arsenic exposure exhibiting deficits of recognition and spatial memory in the offspring. These deficits are associated with genome-wide DNA hypomethylation and abnormal expression of cognition-related genes in the hippocampus. Arsenic atoms directly bind to the cysteine-rich ADD domain of DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A), triggering ubiquitin- and proteasome-mediated degradation of DNMT3A in different cellular contexts. DNMT3A degradation leads to genome-wide DNA hypomethylation in mouse embryonic fibroblasts but not in non-embryonic cell lines. Treatment with metformin, a first-line antidiabetic agent reported to increase DNA methylation, ameliorates the behavioral deficits and normalizes the aberrant expression of cognition-related genes and DNA methylation in the hippocampus of arsenic-exposed offspring. Our study establishes a DNA hypomethylation effect of developmental arsenic exposure and proposes a potential treatment against cognitive deficits in the offspring of pregnant women in arsenic-contaminated areas.© 2022 The Authors."

In this study, we explored the peripheral blood DNA methylome and its immune cell composition in patients with PSC-UC, UC, and healthy controls (HC) with the aim to develop a predictive assay in distinguishing patients with PSC-UC from those with UC alone.The peripheral blood DNA methylome of male patients with PSC and concomitant UC, UC and HCs was profiled using the Illumina HumanMethylation Infinium EPIC BeadChip (850K) array. Differentially methylated CpG position (DMP) and region (DMR) analyses were performed alongside gradient boosting classification analyses to discern PSC-UC from UC patients. As observed differences in the DNA methylome could be the result of differences in cellular populations, we additionally employed mass cytometry (CyTOF) to characterize the immune cell compositions.Genome wide methylation analysis did not reveal large differences between PSC-UC and UC patients nor HCs. Nonetheless, using gradient boosting we were capable of discerning PSC-UC from UC with an area under the receiver operator curve (AUROC) of 0.80. Four CpG sites annotated to theNINJ2gene were found to strongly contribute to the predictive performance. While CyTOF analyses corroborated the largely similar blood cell composition among patients with PSC-UC, UC and HC, a higher abundance of myeloid cells was observed in UC compared to PSC-UC patients.DNA methylation enables discerning PSC-UC from UC patients, with a potential for biomarker development.Copyright © 2022 de Krijger, Hageman, Li Yim, Verhoeff, Garcia Vallejo, van Hamersveld, Levin, Hakvoort, Wildenberg, Henneman, Ponsioen and de Jonge."

However, cleavage stimulation factor subunit 2 (CSTF2) was found to play a more critical regulatory role across cancers. General cancer data sets from The Cancer Genome Atlas and Genotype-Tissue Expression project were thus downloaded for differential analysis, and the possible functions and mechanisms of CSTF2 in general cancer were analyzed using the Compartments database, cBioPortal database, Tumor Immune Single-cell Hub database, and Comparative Toxigenomics database using gene set enrichment analysis and R software. The results showed thatCSTF2could affect DNA repair and methylation in tumor cells. In addition, CSTF2 was associated with multiple tumor immune infiltrates in a wide range of cancers, and its high expression was associated with multiple immune checkpoints; therefore, it could serve as a potential target for many drug molecules. We also proved that CSTF2 promotes oral cell proliferation and migration. The high diagnostic efficacy ofCSTF2suggested that this gene may act as a new biomarker and personalized therapeutic target for a variety of tumors.Copyright © 2022 Feng, Jing, Qin, Zhou, Ning, Hou, Kong and Zhu."

Here, we investigated the genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in patients with MMD and identified the genes related to the pathogenesis of MMD.Whole blood samples were collected from 20 individuals, including 10 patients with ischemic moyamoya disease without any underlying disease and 10 healthy individuals. Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis was performed using Illumina 850K microarrays. Transcriptional correlation was verified using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. In vitro experiments were used to analyze the association of functional defects with candidate epigenetic markers.The genome-wide methylation level in the whole blood of adults with ischemic MMD was higher than that in the healthy individuals. In total, 759 methylation probes differed significantly between the case and control. The hypermethylated regions were mostly concentrated in the gene spacer regions. Among genes with the highest degree of the differential expression, KCNMA1 and GALNT2 were upregulated, whereas SOX6 and RBM33 were downregulated.This is the first study showing that the low expression of genes associated with epigenetic regulation, such as SOX6 and RBM33, may be related to vascular occlusion in MMD, whereas the overexpression of KCNMA1 and GALNT2 may be related to the vascular hyperplasia. The results suggest that DNA methylation was involved in the pathogenesis of MMD, and new pathogenic genes were proposed as biological markers.Copyright © 2022 Shihao He et al."

We present here the genome-wide methylation specific to SCM in water buffalo and its consequential effect on the gene expression landscape for the first time. Whole-genome DNA methylation profiles from peripheral blood lymphocytes and gene expression profiles from milk somatic cells of healthy and SCM cases were catalogued from the MeDIP-Seq and RNA-Seq data. The average methylation in healthy buffaloes was found to be higher than that in the SCM-infected buffaloes. DNA methylation was abundant in the intergenic region followed by the intronic region in both healthy control and SCM groups. A total of 3,950 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identified and annotated to 370 differentially methylated genes (DMGs), most of which were enriched in the promoter region. Several important pathways were activated due to hypomethylation and belonged to theStaphylococcus aureusinfection, Th17 cell differentiation, and antigen processing and presentation pathways along with others of defense responses. DNA methylome was compared with transcriptome to understand the regulatory role of DNA methylation on gene expression specific to SCM in buffaloes. A total of 4,778 significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were extracted in response to SCM, out of which 67 DMGs were also found to be differentially expressed, suggesting that during SCM, DNA methylation could be one of the epigenetic regulatory mechanisms of gene expression. Genes like CSF2RB, LOC102408349, C3 and PZP like, and CPAMD8 were found to be downregulated in our study, which are known to be involved in the immune response to SCM. Association of DNA methylation with transposable elements, miRNAs, and lncRNAs was also studied. The present study reports a buffalo SCM web resource (BSCM2TDb) available at http://webtom.cabgrid.res.in/BSCM2TDb that catalogues all the mastitis-related information of the analyses results of this study in a single place.

We generated a high-quality assembled CRI-12 genome of 2.31 Gb with a contig N50 of 19.65 Mb, which was superior to previously reported genomes. Comparisons between CRI-12 and other reported genomes revealed 7,966 structural variations and 7,378 presence/absence variations. The distribution of the haplotypes among A-genome (Gossypium arboreum), D-genome (Gossypium raimondii), and AD-genome (G. hirsutum and Gossypium barbadense) suggested that many haplotypes were lost and recombined in the process of polyploidization. More than half of the haplotypes that correlated with different tolerances were located on chromosome D13, suggesting that this chromosome may be important for wide adaptation. Finally, it was demonstrated that DNA methylation may provide advantages in environmental adaptation through whole-genome bisulfite sequencing analysis.This research provides a new reference genome for molecular biology research on Gossypium hirsutum L. and helps decode the broad environmental adaptation mechanisms in the No. 1 Chinese cotton variety CRI-12.© The Author(s) 2022.

Pathogenic variants in the ASXL gene family are associated with three phenotypically distinct neurodevelopmental syndromes. Our previous work has shown that syndromic conditions caused by pathogenic variants in epigenetic regulatory genes show consistent patterns of genome-wide DNA methylation (DNAm) alterations, i.e., DNAm signatures in peripheral blood. Given the role of ASXL1 in chromatin modification, we hypothesized that pathogenic ASXL1 variants underlying Bohring-Opitz syndrome (BOS) have a unique DNAm signature. We profiled whole-blood DNAm for 17 ASXL1 variants, and 35 sex- and age-matched typically developing individuals, using Illumina's Infinium EPIC array. We identified 763 differentially methylated CpG sites in individuals with BOS. Differentially methylated sites overlapped 323 unique genes, including HOXA5 and HOXB4, supporting the functional relevance of DNAm signatures. We used a machine-learning classification model based on the BOS DNAm signature to classify variants of uncertain significance in ASXL1, as well as pathogenic ASXL2 and ASXL3 variants. The DNAm profile of one individual with the ASXL2 variant was BOS-like, whereas the DNAm profiles of three individuals with ASXL3 variants were control-like. We also used Horvath's epigenetic clock, which showed acceleration in DNAm age in individuals with pathogenic ASXL1 variants, and the individual with the pathogenic ASXL2 variant, but not in individuals with ASXL3 variants. These studies enhance our understanding of the epigenetic dysregulation underpinning ASXL gene family-associated syndromes.© 2022. The Author(s)."

My lab's approach has been to investigate DNA methylation as a tractable genome-wide modification at the interface of these complex interactions, reflecting past and future events in the molecular pathogenesis of ASD. Since X-linked genes were enriched in DNA methylation differences discovered from cord blood from newborns later diagnosed with ASD, this has prompted me to review and revisit the recent advancements in the field of X chromosome inactivation (XCI), particularly in humans and other primates. In this Perspective, I compare XCI mechanisms in different mammalian species, including the finding of the noncoding transcriptXACTassociated with X chromosome erosion in human pluripotent stem cells and recent findings from non-human primate post-implantation embryos.

"35354948","Anti-cancer therapy is associated with long-term epigenomic changes in childhood cancer survivors.","Br J Cancer","Childhood cancer survivors (CCS) exhibit significantly increased chronic diseases and premature death. Abnormalities in DNA methylation are associated with development of chronic diseases and reduced life expectancy. We investigated the hypothesis that anti-cancer treatments are associated with long-term DNA methylation changes that could be key drivers of adverse late health effects.Genome-wide DNA methylation was assessed using MethylationEPIC arrays in paired samples (before/after therapy) from 32 childhood cancer patients. Separately, methylation was determined in 32 samples from different adult CCS (mean 22-years post-diagnosis) and compared with cancer-free controls (n = 284).Widespread DNA methylation changes were identified post-treatment in childhood cancer patients, including 146 differentially methylated regions (DMRs), which were consistently altered in the 32 post-treatment samples. Analysis of adult CCS identified matching methylation changes at 107/146 of the DMRs, suggesting potential long-term retention of post-therapy changes. Adult survivors also exhibited epigenetic age acceleration, independent of DMR methylation. Furthermore, altered methylation at the DUSP6 DMR was significantly associated with early mortality, suggesting altered methylation may be prognostic for some late adverse health effects in CCS.These novel methylation changes could serve as biomarkers for assessing normal cell toxicity in ongoing treatments and predicting long-term health outcomes in CCS.© 2022.

"35354798","DNA methylation signatures in human neonatal blood following maternal antenatal corticosteroid treatment.","Transl Psychiatry","Antenatal corticosteroids (ACS) are used to treat women at risk of preterm birth to improve neonatal survival. Though affected children may be at long-term risk of neurobehavioural disorders, the driving mechanisms remain unknown. Animal studies have shown that ACS exposure can lead to overlapping changes in DNA methylation between the blood and the brain, identifying gene pathways for neurodevelopment, which highlights the potential to examine peripheral blood as a surrogate for inaccessible human brain tissue. We hypothesized that differential methylation will be identified in blood of term-born neonates following ACS. Mother-infant dyads that received ACS were retrospectively identified through the Ontario Birth Study at Sinai Health Complex and matched to untreated controls for maternal age, BMI, parity and foetal sex (n = 14/group). Genome-wide methylation differences were examined at single-nucleotide resolution in DNA extracted from dried bloodspot cards using reduced representative bisulfite sequencing approaches. 505 differentially methylated CpG sites (DMCs) were identified, wherein 231 were hypermethylated and 274 were hypomethylated. These sites were annotated to 219 genes, of which USP48, SH3PXD2A, NTM, CAMK2N2, MAP6D1 were five of the top ten genes with known neurological function. Collectively, the set of hypermethylated genes were enriched for pathways of transcription regulation, while pathways of proteasome activity were enriched among the set of hypomethylated genes. This study is the first to identify DNA methylation changes in human neonatal blood following ACS. Understanding the epigenetic changes that occur in response to ACS will support future investigations to delineate the effects of prenatal glucocorticoid exposure on human development.© 2022.

"35354486","DNA methylome-wide association study of genetic risk for depression implicates antigen processing and immune responses.","Genome Med","Depression is a disabling and highly prevalent condition where genetic and epigenetic, such as DNA methylation (DNAm), differences contribute to disease risk. DNA methylation is influenced by genetic variation but the association between polygenic risk of depression and DNA methylation is unknown.We investigated the association between polygenic risk scores (PRS) for depression and DNAm by conducting a methylome-wide association study (MWAS) in Generation Scotland (N = 8898, mean age = 49.8 years) with replication in the Lothian Birth Cohorts of 1921 and 1936 and adults in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) (Ncombined= 2049, mean age = 79.1, 69.6 and 47.2 years, respectively). We also conducted a replication MWAS in the ALSPAC children (N = 423, mean age = 17.1 years). Gene ontology analysis was conducted for the cytosine-guanine dinucleotide (CpG) probes significantly associated with depression PRS, followed by Mendelian randomisation (MR) analysis to infer the causal relationship between depression and DNAm.Widespread associations (NCpG= 71, pBonferroni< 0.05, p < 6.3 × 10-8) were found between PRS constructed using genetic risk variants for depression and DNAm in CpG probes that localised to genes involved in immune responses and neural development. The effect sizes for the significant associations were highly correlated between the discovery and replication samples in adults (r = 0.79) and in adolescents (r = 0.82). Gene Ontology analysis showed that significant CpG probes are enriched in immunological processes in the human leukocyte antigen system. Additional MWAS was conducted for each lead genetic risk variant. Over 47.9% of the independent genetic risk variants included in the PRS showed associations with DNAm in CpG probes located in both the same (cis) and distal (trans) locations to the genetic loci (pBonferroni< 0.045). Subsequent MR analysis showed that there are a greater number of causal effects found from DNAm to depression than vice versa (DNAm to depression: pFDRranged from 0.024 to 7.45 × 10-30; depression to DNAm: pFDRranged from 0.028 to 0.003).PRS for depression, especially those constructed from genome-wide significant genetic risk variants, showed methylome-wide differences associated with immune responses. Findings from MR analysis provided evidence for causal effect of DNAm to depression.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35354049","Genome-wide identification and analysis of prognostic features in human cancers.","Cell Rep","Clinical decisions in cancer rely on precisely assessing patient risk. To improve our ability to identify the most aggressive malignancies, we constructed genome-wide survival models using gene expression, copy number, methylation, and mutation data from 10,884 patients. We identified more than 100,000 significant prognostic biomarkers and demonstrate that these genomic features can predict patient outcomes in clinically ambiguous situations. While adverse biomarkers are commonly believed to represent cancer driver genes and promising therapeutic targets, we show that cancer features associated with shorter survival times are not enriched for either oncogenes or for successful drug targets. Instead, the strongest adverse biomarkers represent widely expressed cell-cycle and housekeeping genes, and, correspondingly, nearly all therapies directed against these features have failed in clinical trials. In total, our analysis establishes a rich resource for prognostic biomarker analysis and clarifies the use of patient survival data in preclinical cancer research and therapeutic development.Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

Second, the GSE109905 data set was used to further validate the methylation state and test the ability to diagnose disease of identified differentially methylated genes. Third, expression measurement of selected differentially methylated genes was performed in whole blood from an independent sample. Finally, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of core differentially methylated genes was constructed.Totally, 74 differentially methylated genes were identified in ASD, including 38 hypermethylated genes and 36 hypomethylated genes. 15 differentially methylated genes were further identified after validation in the GSE109905 data set. Among these, major histocompatibility complex (HLA)-DQA1 was involved in the molecular function of myosin heavy chain class II receptor activity; HLA-DRB5 was involved in the signaling pathways of cell adhesion molecules, Epstein-Barr virus infection and antigen processing and presentation. In the PPI analysis, the interaction pairs of HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DRB5, FMN2 and ACTR3, and CALCOCO2 and BAZ2B were identified. Interestingly, FMN2, BAZ2B, HLA-DRB5, CALCOCO2 and DUSP22 had a potential diagnostic value for patients with ASD. The expression result of four differentially methylated genes (HLA-DRB5, NTM, IL16 and COL5A3) in the independent sample was consistent with the integrated analysis.Identified differentially methylated genes and enriched signaling pathway could be associated with ASD.Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

"35351997","H3K9me3 represses G6PD expression to suppress the pentose phosphate pathway and ROS production to promote human mesothelioma growth.","Oncogene","The role of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) in human cancer is incompletely understood. In a metabolite screening, we observed that inhibition of H3K9 methylation suppressed aerobic glycolysis and enhances the PPP in human mesothelioma cells. Genome-wide screening identified G6PD as an H3K9me3 target gene whose expression is correlated with increased tumor cell apoptosis. Inhibition of aerobic glycolysis enzyme LDHA and G6PD had no significant effects on tumor cell survival. Ablation of G6PD had no significant effect on human mesothelioma and colon carcinoma xenograft growth in athymic mice. However, activation of G6PD with the G6PD-selective activator AG1 induced tumor cell death. AG1 increased tumor cell ROS production and the resultant extrinsic and intrinsic death pathways, mitochondrial processes, and unfolded protein response in tumor cells. Consistent with increased tumor cell death in vitro, AG1 suppressed human mesothelioma xenograft growth in a dose-dependent manner in vivo. Furthermore, AG1 treatment significantly increased tumor-bearing mouse survival in an intra-peritoneum xenograft athymic mouse model. Therefore, in human mesothelioma and colon carcinoma, G6PD is not essential for tumor growth. G6PD acts as a metabolic checkpoint to control metabolic flux towards the PPP to promote tumor cell apoptosis, and its expression is repressed by its promotor H3K9me3 deposition.© 2022.

Gene targeting by homologous recombination is a key technique for improving strains and constructing mutants. In T. reesei, tku70 (homologous to human KU70) was deleted to block non-homologous end-joining, which led to 95% of transformants exhibiting homologous recombination.Two genes located in close proximity to tku70 were identified: the ferrochelatase gene hem8 (tre78582, homologous to Aspergillus niger hemH and Cryptococcus neoformans HEM15) and a putative DNA methylation modulator-2 gene dmm2 (tre108087, homologous to Neurospora crassa dmm-2). Genome-wide surveys of 324 sequenced fungal genomes revealed that the homologues of the three genes of interest are encoded in tandem in most Sordariomycetes. The expression of this three-gene cluster is regulated by blue light. The roles of these three genes were analyzed via deletion and complementation tests. The gene hem8 was originally described as a novel and highly distinct auxotrophic marker in T. reesei and we found that the product protein, HEM8, catalyzes the final step in heme biosynthesis from highly photoreactive porphyrins. The lethal phenotype of the hem8 deletion could be overcome by hematin supplementation. We also studied the functions of tku70 and dmm2 in DNA repair using mutagen sensitivity experiments. We found that the Δtku70 strain showed increased sensitivity to bleomycin, which induces DNA double-strand breaks, and that the Δdmm2 strain was sensitive to bleomycin, camptothecin (an inhibitor of type I topoisomerases), and hydroxyurea (a deoxynucleotide synthesis inhibitor). The double-mutant Δtku70&dmm2 showed higher sensitivity to hydroxyurea, camptothecin, and bleomycin than either of the single mutants. Knockout of dmm2 significantly increased cellulase production.Our data show, for the first time, that ferrochelatase encoded by hem8 catalyzes the final step in heme biosynthesis from highly photoreactive porphyrins and that dmm2 encodes a putative DNA methylation modulator-2 protein related to DNA repair and cellulase expression in T. reesei. Our data provide important insights into the roles of this three-gene cluster in T. reesei and other Sordariomycetes and show that the DNA methylation modulator DMM2 affects cellulase gene expression in T. reesei.© 2022.

Here, we perform genome-wide expression-methylation Quantitative Trait Loci (emQTL) analysis through the integration of DNA methylation and gene expression to identify disease-driving pathways under epigenetic control. By grouping the emQTLs using biclustering we identify associations representing important biological processes associated with breast cancer pathogenesis including regulation of proliferation and tumor-infiltrating fibroblasts. We report genome-wide loss of enhancer methylation at binding sites of proliferation-driving transcription factors including CEBP-β, FOSL1, and FOSL2 with concomitant high expression of proliferation-related genes in aggressive breast tumors as we confirm with scRNA-seq. The identified emQTL-CpGs and genes were found connected through chromatin loops, indicating that proliferation in breast tumors is under epigenetic regulation by DNA methylation. Interestingly, the associations between enhancer methylation and proliferation-related gene expression were also observed within known subtypes of breast cancer, suggesting a common role of epigenetic regulation of proliferation. Taken together, we show that proliferation in breast cancer is linked to loss of methylation at specific enhancers and transcription factor binding and gene activation through chromatin looping.© The Author(s) 2022.

"35347270","Grandmaternal smoking during pregnancy is associated with differential DNA methylation in peripheral blood of their grandchildren.","Eur J Hum Genet","The idea that information can be transmitted to subsequent generation(s) by epigenetic means has been studied for decades but remains controversial in humans. Epidemiological studies have established that grandparental exposures are associated with health outcomes in their grandchildren, often with sex-specific effects; however, the mechanism of transmission is still unclear. We conducted Epigenome Wide Association Studies (EWAS) to test whether grandmaternal smoking during pregnancy is associated with altered DNA methylation (DNAm) in peripheral blood from their adolescent grandchildren. We used data from a birth cohort, with discovery and replication datasets of up to 1225 and 708 individuals (respectively, for the maternal line), aged 15-17 years, and tested replication in the same individuals at birth and 7 years. We show for the first time that DNAm at a small number of loci in cord blood is associated with grandmaternal smoking in humans. In adolescents we see suggestive associations in regions of the genome which we hypothesised a priori could be involved in transgenerational transmission - we observe sex-specific associations at two sites on the X chromosome and one in an imprinting control region. All are within transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs), and we observe enrichment for TFBS among the CpG sites with the strongest associations; however, there is limited evidence that the associations we see replicate between timepoints. The implication of this work is that effects of smoking during pregnancy may induce DNAm changes in later generations and that these changes are often sex-specific, in line with epidemiological associations.© 2022.

"35346416","Assessing the causal role of epigenetic clocks in the development of multiple cancers: a Mendelian randomization study.","Elife","Background:Epigenetic clocks have been associated with cancer risk in several observational studies. Nevertheless, it is unclear whether they play a causal role in cancer risk or if they act as a non-causal biomarker.Methods:We conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study to examine the genetically predicted effects of epigenetic age acceleration as measured by HannumAge (9 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)), Horvath Intrinsic Age (24 SNPs), PhenoAge (11 SNPs) and GrimAge (4 SNPs) on multiple cancers (i.e., breast, prostate, colorectal, ovarian and lung cancer). We obtained genome-wide association data for biological ageing from a meta-analysis (N=34,710), and for cancer from the UK Biobank (N cases=2,671-13,879; N controls=173,493-372,016), FinnGen (N cases=719-8,401; N controls=74,685-174,006) and several international cancer genetic consortia (N cases=11,348-122,977; N controls=15,861-105,974). Main analyses were performed using multiplicative random effects inverse variance weighted (IVW) MR. Individual study estimates were pooled using fixed effect meta-analysis. Sensitivity analyses included MR-Egger, weighted median, weighted mode and Causal Analysis using Summary Effect Estimates (CAUSE) methods, which are robust to some of the assumptions of the IVW approach.Results:Meta-analysed IVW MR findings suggested that higher GrimAge acceleration increased the risk of colorectal cancer (OR=1.12 per year increase in GrimAge acceleration, 95%CI 1.04-1.20,p=0.002). The direction of the genetically predicted effects was consistent across main and sensitivity MR analyses. Among subtypes, the genetically predicted effect of GrimAge acceleration was greater for colon cancer (IVW OR=1.15, 95%CI 1.09-1.21,p=0.006), than rectal cancer (IVW OR=1.05, 95%CI 0.97-1.13,p=0.24). Results were less consistent for associations between other epigenetic clocks and cancers.Conclusions:GrimAge acceleration may increase the risk of colorectal cancer.

Understanding accurately how multi-omics molecular features change at the early stage of AMI is crucial for its treatment. Currently, the changes involved in DNA methylation modification and gene expression of multiple genes have remained unexplored.We used the RNA-seq and MeDIP-seq on heart tissues from AMI mouse models at series of time points (Sham, AMI 10-min, 1-h, 6-h, 24-h and 72-h), to comprehensively describe the transcriptome and genome-wide DNA methylation changes at above time points. We identified 18814, 18614, 23587, 26018 and 33788 differential methylation positions (DMPs) and 123, 135, 731, 1419 and 2779 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at 10-min, 1-h, 6-h, 24-h and 72-h AMI, respectively, compared with the sham group. Remarkably, the 6-h AMI with the drastic changes of DEGs and a large number of enriched functional pathways in KEGG may be the most critical stage of AMI process. The 4, 9, 40, 26, and 183 genes were further identified at each time point, based on the negative correlation (P < 0.05) between the differential mRNA expression and the differential DNA methylation. The mRNA and the promoter methylation expressions of five genes (Ptpn6, Csf1r, Col6a1, Cyba, and Map3k14) were validated by qRT-PCR and BSP methods, and the mRNA expressions were further confirmed to be regulated by DNA methylation in cardiomyocytes in vitro.Our findings profiled the molecular variations from the perspective of DNA methylation in the early stage of AMI and provided promising epigenetic-based biomarkers for the early clinical diagnosis and therapeutic targets of AMI.© 2022.

However, dysfunctional processing of endogenous nociceptive input, measured as conditioned pain modulation (CPM), has been associated with cLBP and may involve changes in neuronal gene expression. Epigenetic-induced changes such as DNA methylation (DNAm) have been associated with cLBP.In the present study, the relationship between CPM and DNAm changes in a sample of community-dwelling adults with nonspecific cLBP (n = 48) and pain-free controls (PFC; n = 50) was examined using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing. Gene ontology (GO) term enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis were applied to identify key pathways involved in efficient versus deficient CPM.Based on CPM efficiency, we identified 6006 and 18,305 differentially methylated CpG sites (DMCs) with q values < 0.01 among individuals with cLBP and PFCs, respectively. Most of the DMCs were hypomethylated and annotated to genes of relevance to pain, including OPRM1, ADRB2, CACNA2D3, GNA12, LPL, NAXD, and ASPHD1. In both cLBP and PFC groups, the DMCs annotated genes enriched many GO terms relevant to pain processing, including transcription regulation by RNA polymerase II, nervous system development, generation of neurons, neuron differentiation, and neurogenesis. Both groups also enriched the pathways involved in Rap1-signaling, cancer, and dopaminergic neurogenesis. However, MAPK-Ras signaling pathways were enriched in the cLBP, not the PFC group.This is the first study to investigate the genome-scale DNA methylation profiles of CPM phenotype in adults with cLBP and PFCs. Based on CPM efficiency, fewer DMC enrichment pathways were unique to the cLBP than the PFCs group. Our results suggest that epigenetically induced modification of neuronal development/differentiation pathways may affect CPM efficiency, suggesting novel potential therapeutic targets for central sensitization. However, CPM efficiency and the experience of nonspecific cLBP may be independent. Further mechanistic studies are required to confirm the relationship between CPM, central sensitization, and nonspecific cLBP.© 2022. The Author(s)."

However, the relationship between methylation and ischemic stroke has not yet been clarified. We conducted a large-sample sequencing study to identify blood leukocyte DNA methylations as novel biomarkers for ischemic stroke risk and prognosis based on previously identified genetic loci.Methylation levels of 17 genes were measured by sequencing in 271 ischemic stroke cases and 323 controls, and the significant associations were validated in another independent sample of 852 cases and 925 controls. The associations between methylation levels and ischemic stroke risk and prognosis were evaluated.Methylation ofAMH, C17orf82, HDAC9, IGFBP3, LRRC10B, PDE3A, PRDM6, SYT7andTBX2was significantly associated with ischemic stroke. Compared to participants without any hypomethylated targets, the odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence interval, CI) for those with 9 hypomethylated genes was 1.41 (1.33-1.51) for ischemic stroke. Adding methylation levels of the 9 genes to the basic model of traditional risk factors significantly improved the risk stratification for ischemic stroke. Associations betweenAMH, HDAC9, IGFBP3, PDE3AandPRDM6gene methylation and modified Rankin Scale scores were significant after adjustment for covariates. Lower methylation levels ofAMH, C17orf82, PRDM6andTBX2were significantly associated with increased 3-month mortality. Compared to patients without any hypomethylated targets, the OR (95% CI) for those with 4 hypomethylated targets was 1.12 (1.08-1.15) for 3-month mortality (P= 2.28 × 10-10).The present study identified blood leukocyte DNA methylations as potential factors affecting ischemic stroke risk and prognosis among Han Chinese individuals.Copyright © 2022 Zhang, Mo, Wang, Peng, Guo, Zhong, Zhu, Xu and Zhang."

It had been shown to reduce the activity of the SETD2 H3K36 protein lysine methyltransferase (PKMT) and lead to genome wide changes in epigenome modifications including a global reduction in DNA methylation. Here, we investigated the effect of the H3.3 G34W mutation on the activity of the H3K36me2 methyltransferase NSD1, because NSD1 is known to play an important role in the differentiation of chondrocytes and osteoblasts. Unexpectedly, we observed that H3.3 G34W has a gain-of-function effect and it stimulates K36 methylation by NSD1 by about 2.3-fold with peptide substrates and 6.3-fold with recombinant nucleosomal substrates. This effect is specific for NSD1, as NSD2 shows only a mild stimulation on G34W substrates. The potential downstream effects of the G34W induced hyperactivity of NSD1 on DNA methylation, H3K27me3, histone acetylation and splicing are discussed.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier B.V. and Société Française de Biochimie et Biologie Moléculaire (SFBBM).

Over the past two decades, it has come to be understood as a complex systemic disorder involving gene-environmental interactions. Epigenetic changes have been increasingly implicated. Recent improvements in microarray and next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have allowed for ever more complex evaluations of epigenetic aberrations associated with the development and progression of OA.A systematic review was conducted in the Pubmed database. We curated studies that presented the results of DNA methylation and noncoding RNA research in human OA and OA animal models since 1985.Herein, we discuss recent findings and methodological advancements in OA epigenetics, including a discussion of DNA methylation, including microarray and NGS studies, and noncoding RNAs. Beyond cartilage, we also highlight studies in subchondral bone and peripheral blood mononuclear cells, which highlight widespread and potentially clinically important alterations in epigenetic patterns seen in OA patients. Finally, we discuss epigenetic editing approaches in the context of OA.Although a substantial body of literature has already been published in OA, much is still unknown. Future OA epigenetics studies will no doubt continue to broaden our understanding of underlying pathophysiology and perhaps offer novel diagnostics and/or treatments for human OA."
"35328380","Tissue-Specific Methylation Biosignatures for Monitoring Diseases: An In Silico Approach.","Int J Mol Sci","Tissue-specific gene methylation events are key to the pathogenesis of several diseases and can be utilized for diagnosis and monitoring. Here, we established an in silico pipeline to analyze high-throughput methylome datasets to identify specific methylation fingerprints in three pathological entities of major burden, i.e., breast cancer (BrCa), osteoarthritis (OA) and diabetes mellitus (DM). Differential methylation analysis was conducted to compare tissues/cells related to the pathology and different types of healthy tissues, revealing Differentially Methylated Genes (DMGs). Highly performing and low feature number biosignatures were built with automated machine learning, including: (1) a five-gene biosignature discriminating BrCa tissue from healthy tissues (AUC 0.987 and precision 0.987), (2) three equivalent OA cartilage-specific biosignatures containing four genes each (AUC 0.978 and precision 0.986) and (3) a four-gene pancreatic β-cell-specific biosignature (AUC 0.984 and precision 0.995). Next, the BrCa biosignature was validated using an independent ccfDNA dataset showing an AUC and precision of 1.000, verifying the biosignature's applicability in liquid biopsy. Functional and protein interaction prediction analysis revealed that most DMGs identified are involved in pathways known to be related to the studied diseases or pointed to new ones. Overall, our data-driven approach contributes to the maximum exploitation of high-throughput methylome readings, helping to establish specific disease profiles to be applied in clinical practice and to understand human pathology."

Therefore, this study aimed to assess whether there is any association between the ambient concentrations of PM10and NO2and CpG methylation in the cord blood DNA by using a Korean birth cohort. The concentrations of the air pollutants were incorporated into the final LUR model by using the maternal address data. The methylation level was determined using HumanMethylationEPIC BeadChip and a linear regression analysis model. A multipollutant model including both PM10and NO2and models with single pollutants were used for each trimester exposure. The number of differentially methylated positions was the largest for midpregnancy exposure in both the single pollutant models and the multipollutant regression analysis. Additionally, gene-set analysis regarding midpregnancy exposure revealed four gene ontology terms (cellular response to staurosporine, positive regulation of cytoskeleton organization, neurotransmitter transport, and execution phase of apoptosis). In conclusion, these findings show an association between prenatal PM10and NO2exposure and DNA methylation in several CpG sites in cord blood cells, especially for midpregnancy exposure."

The transcriptome in TB in multiple cohorts was enriched for DNA methylation and cellular senescence. Senescence associated proteins CXCL9, CXCL10, and TNF were elevated in TB patients compared to healthy controls. Humans with TB demonstrate 12.7 years (95% CI: 7.5, 21.9) and 14.38 years (95% CI: 10.23-18.53) of cellular aging as measured by epigenetic and gene expression based cellular clocks, respectively.In both guinea pigs and humans, TB perturbs epigenetic processes, promoting premature cellular aging and inflammation, a plausible means to explain the long-term detrimental health outcomes after TB."
"35326126","Oxidative Stress and Assisted Reproduction: A Comprehensive Review of Its Pathophysiological Role and Strategies for Optimizing Embryo Culture Environment.","Antioxidants (Basel)","Oxidative stress (OS) due to an imbalance between reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidants has been established as an important factor that can negatively affect the outcomes of assisted reproductive techniques (ARTs). Excess ROS exert their pathological effects through damage to cellular lipids, organelles, and DNA, alteration of enzymatic function, and apoptosis. ROS can be produced intracellularly, from immature sperm, oocytes, and embryos. Additionally, several external factors may induce high ROS production in the ART setup, including atmospheric oxygen, CO2incubators, consumables, visible light, temperature, humidity, volatile organic compounds, and culture media additives. Pathological amounts of ROS can also be generated during the cryopreservation-thawing process of gametes or embryos. Generally, these factors can act at any stage during ART, from gamete preparation to embryo development, till the blastocyst stage. In this review, we discuss the in vitro conditions and environmental factors responsible for the induction of OS in an ART setting. In addition, we describe the effects of OS on gametes and embryos. Furthermore, we highlight strategies to ameliorate the impact of OS during the whole human embryo culture period, from gametes to blastocyst stage."
"35361281","Regulation of oxytocin receptor gene expression in obsessive-compulsive disorder: a possible role for the microbiota-host epigenetic axis.","Clin Epigenetics","Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a prevalent and severe clinical condition. Robust evidence suggests a gene-environment interplay in its etiopathogenesis, yet the underlying molecular clues remain only partially understood. In order to further deepen our understanding of OCD, it is essential to ascertain how genes interact with environmental risk factors, a cross-talk that is thought to be mediated by epigenetic mechanisms. The human microbiota may be a key player, because bacterial metabolites can act as epigenetic modulators. We analyzed, in the blood and saliva of OCD subjects and healthy controls, the transcriptional regulation of the oxytocin receptor gene and, in saliva, also the different levels of major phyla. We also investigated the same molecular mechanisms in specific brain regions of socially isolated rats showing stereotyped behaviors reminiscent of OCD as well as short chain fatty acid levels in the feces of rats.Higher levels of oxytocin receptor gene DNA methylation, inversely correlated with gene expression, were observed in the blood as well as saliva of OCD subjects when compared to controls. Moreover, Actinobacteria also resulted higher in OCD and directly correlated with oxytocin receptor gene epigenetic alterations. The same pattern of changes was present in the prefrontal cortex of socially-isolated rats, where also altered levels of fecal butyrate were observed at the beginning of the isolation procedure.This is the first demonstration of an interplay between microbiota modulation and epigenetic regulation of gene expression in OCD, opening new avenues for the understanding of disease trajectories and for the development of new therapeutic strategies.© 2022.

Biological age (BA) may better capture ageing-related physiological changes compared with chronological age (CA).we developed a deep learning (DL) algorithm to predict BA based on retinal photographs and evaluated the performance of our new ageing marker in the risk stratification of mortality and major morbidity in general populations.we first trained a DL algorithm using 129,236 retinal photographs from 40,480 participants in the Korean Health Screening study to predict the probability of age being ≥65 years ('RetiAGE') and then evaluated the ability of RetiAGE to stratify the risk of mortality and major morbidity among 56,301 participants in the UK Biobank. Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs).in the UK Biobank, over a 10-year follow up, 2,236 (4.0%) died; of them, 636 (28.4%) were due to cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and 1,276 (57.1%) due to cancers. Compared with the participants in the RetiAGE first quartile, those in the RetiAGE fourth quartile had a 67% higher risk of 10-year all-cause mortality (HR = 1.67 [1.42-1.95]), a 142% higher risk of CVD mortality (HR = 2.42 [1.69-3.48]) and a 60% higher risk of cancer mortality (HR = 1.60 [1.31-1.96]), independent of CA and established ageing phenotypic biomarkers. Likewise, compared with the first quartile group, the risk of CVD and cancer events in the fourth quartile group increased by 39% (HR = 1.39 [1.14-1.69]) and 18% (HR = 1.18 [1.10-1.26]), respectively. The best discrimination ability for RetiAGE alone was found for CVD mortality (c-index = 0.70, sensitivity = 0.76, specificity = 0.55). Furthermore, adding RetiAGE increased the discrimination ability of the model beyond CA and phenotypic biomarkers (increment in c-index between 1 and 2%).the DL-derived RetiAGE provides a novel, alternative approach to measure ageing.© The Author(s) 2022.

Therefore, quantitative parameters are necessary to predict the risks of early culling of cows. In the study of the age dynamics of the disposal rate (culling for sum of reasons + death) in dairy cow populations, it was found that the average productive life span can be predicted by the value of the reciprocal culling/death rate (reciprocal value of Gompertz function) at the first lactation. This means that this potential of viability is formed during the developmental periods preceding the onset of lactation activity. Therefore, taking into account current data in the field of developmental biology, it can be assumed that the structural prerequisites for viability potential are laid down during prenatal development and in the early periods of postnatal life. To prevent unfavorable deviations in these processes due to negative welfare effects, it is advisable to monitor the physiological status of mothers and young animals using biosensors and Big Data systems."

However, it has been unknown whether NMRs also evade aging according to a primary hallmark of aging: epigenetic changes. To address this question, we profiledn= 385 samples from 11 tissue types at loci that are highly conserved between mammalian species using a custom array (HorvathMammalMethylChip40). We observed strong epigenetic aging effects and developed seven highly accurate epigenetic clocks for several tissues (pan-tissue, blood, kidney, liver, skin clocks) and two dual-species (human-NMR) clocks. The skin clock correctly estimated induced pluripotent stem cells derived from NMR fibroblasts to be of prenatal age. The NMR epigenetic clocks revealed that breeding NMR queens age more slowly than nonbreeders, a feature that is also observed in some eusocial insects. Our results show that despite a phenotype of negligible senescence, the NMR ages epigenetically."

"35330188","Notch Signaling and Cross-Talk in Hypoxia: A Candidate Pathway for High-Altitude Adaptation.","Life (Basel)","Hypoxia triggers complex inter- and intracellular signals that regulate tissue oxygen (O2) homeostasis, adjusting convective O2delivery and utilization (i.e., metabolism). Human populations have been exposed to high-altitude hypoxia for thousands of years and, in doing so, have undergone natural selection of multiple gene regions supporting adaptive traits. Some of the strongest selection signals identified in highland populations emanate from hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway genes. The HIF pathway is a master regulator of the cellular hypoxic response, but it is not the only regulatory pathway under positive selection. For instance, regions linked to the highly conserved Notch signaling pathway are also top targets, and this pathway is likely to play essential roles that confer hypoxia tolerance. Here, we explored the importance of the Notch pathway in mediating the cellular hypoxic response. We assessed transcriptional regulation of the Notch pathway, including close cross-talk with HIF signaling, and its involvement in the mediation of angiogenesis, cellular metabolism, inflammation, and oxidative stress, relating these functions to generational hypoxia adaptation."
"35327363","The Epigenetics of Psychosis: A Structured Review with Representative Loci.","Biomedicines","The evidence for an environmental component in chronic psychotic disorders is strong and research on the epigenetic manifestations of these environmental impacts has commenced in earnest. In reviewing this research, the focus is on three genes as models for differential methylation, MCHR1, AKT1 and TDO2, each of which have been investigated for genetic association with psychotic disorders. Environmental factors associated with psychotic disorders, and which interact with these model genes, are explored in depth. The location of transcription factor motifs relative to key methylation sites is evaluated for predicted gene expression results, and for other sites, evidence is presented for methylation directing alternative splicing. Experimental results from key studies show differential methylation: for MCHR1, in psychosis cases versus controls; for AKT1, as a pre-existing methylation pattern influencing brain activation following acute administration of a psychosis-eliciting environmental stimulus; and for TDO2, in a pattern associated with a developmental factor of risk for psychosis, in all cases the predicted expression impact being highly dependent on location. Methylation induced by smoking, a confounding variable, exhibits an intriguing pattern for all three genes. Finally, how differential methylation meshes with Darwinian principles is examined, in particular as it relates to the ""flexible stem"" theory of evolution."

We performed a large-scale gene expression analysis and generated a high-resolution atlas of the transcriptome in beef cattle.Our transcriptome atlas was generated from 135 bovine tissues in adult beef cattle, covering 51 tissue types of major organ systems (e.g., muscular system, digestive system, immune system, reproductive system). Approximately 94.76% of sequencing reads were successfully mapped to the reference genome assembly ARS-UCD1.2. We detected a total of 60,488 transcripts, and 32% of them were not reported before. We identified 2654 housekeeping genes (HKGs) and 477 tissue-specific genes (TSGs) across tissues. Using weighted gene co-expression network analysis, we obtained 24 modules with 237 hub genes (HUBGs). Functional enrichment analysis showed that HKGs mainly maintain the basic biological activities of cells, while TSGs were involved in tissue differentiation and specific physiological processes. HKGs in bovine tissues were more conserved in terms of expression pattern as compared to TSGs and HUBGs among multiple species. Finally, we obtained a subset of tissue-specific differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between beef and dairy cattle and several functional pathways, which may be involved in production and health traits.We generated a large-scale gene expression atlas across the major tissues in beef cattle, providing valuable information for enhancing genome assembly and annotation. HKGs, TSGs, and HUBGs further contribute to better understanding the biology and evolution of multiple tissues in cattle. DEGs between beef and dairy cattle also fill in the knowledge gaps about differential transcriptome regulation of bovine tissues underlying economically important traits.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35347109","Molecular rhythm alterations in prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens associated with opioid use disorder.","Transl Psychiatry","Severe and persistent disruptions to sleep and circadian rhythms are common in people with opioid use disorder (OUD). Preclinical evidence suggests altered molecular rhythms in the brain modulate opioid reward and relapse. However, whether molecular rhythms are disrupted in the brains of people with OUD remained an open question, critical to understanding the role of circadian rhythms in opioid addiction. Using subjects' times of death as a marker of time of day, we investigated transcriptional rhythms in the brains of subjects with OUD compared to unaffected comparison subjects. We discovered rhythmic transcripts in both the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and nucleus accumbens (NAc), key brain areas involved in OUD, that were largely distinct between OUD and unaffected subjects. Fewer rhythmic transcripts were identified in DLPFC of subjects with OUD compared to unaffected subjects, whereas in the NAc, nearly double the number of rhythmic transcripts was identified in subjects with OUD. In NAc of subjects with OUD, rhythmic transcripts peaked either in the evening or near sunrise, and were associated with an opioid, dopamine, and GABAergic neurotransmission. Associations with altered neurotransmission in NAc were further supported by co-expression network analysis which identified OUD-specific modules enriched for transcripts involved in dopamine, GABA, and glutamatergic synaptic functions. Additionally, rhythmic transcripts in DLPFC and NAc of subjects with OUD were enriched for genomic loci associated with sleep-related GWAS traits, including sleep duration and insomnia. Collectively, our findings connect transcriptional rhythm changes in opioidergic, dopaminergic, GABAergic signaling in the human brain to sleep-related traits in opioid addiction.© 2022.

Overactivation of the immune system negatively influences cardiovascular function and contributes to cardiovascular disease. In this review, we propose that modulation of the immune system is a potential link between prenatal stress and offspring vascular dysfunction. Glucocorticoids are key mediators of stress and modulate the inflammatory response. The potential mechanisms whereby prenatal stress negatively impacts vascular function in the offspring, including poor hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis regulation of inflammatory response, activation of Th17 cells, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system hyperactivation, reactive oxygen species imbalance, generation of neoantigens and TLR4 activation, are discussed. Alterations in the immune system by maternal stress during pregnancy have broad relevance for vascular dysfunction and immune-mediated diseases, such as cardiovascular disease.Copyright © 2022 Costa, De Oliveira, Giachini, Lima, Tostes and Bomfim."

Due to the dearth of appropriate biomarkers, the diagnosis of this mortal disease is usually deferred, in its turn, culminating in the failure of prevention. By the same token, proper biomarkers are at play in determining the quality of prognosis. In other words, the survival rate is contingent upon the regulation of such biomarkers.The information regarding expression (GSE41258, and GSE31905), methylation (GSE101764), and miRNA (dbDEMC) were downloaded. MEXPRESS and GEPIA confirmed the validated differentially expressed/methylated genes using TCGA data. Taking advantage of the correlation plots and receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curves, expression and methylation profiles were compared. The interactions between validated differentially expressed genes and differentially expressed miRNA were recognized and visualized by miRTarBase and Cytoscape, respectively. Then, the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and hub genes were established via STRING and Cytohubba plugin. Utilizing R packages (DOSE, Enrichplot, and clusterProfiler) and DAVID database, the Functional Enrichment analysis and the detection of KEGG pathways were performed. Ultimately, in order to recognize the prognostic value of found biomarkers, they were evaluated through drawing survival plots for CRC patients.In this research, we found an expression profile (with 13 novel genes), a methylation profile (with two novel genes), and a miRNA profile with diagnostic value. Concerning diagnosis, the expression profile was evaluated more powerful in comparison with the methylation profile. Furthermore, a prognosis-related expression profile was detected.In addition to diagnostic- and prognostic-applicability, the discerned profiles can assist in targeted therapy and current therapeutic strategies."

Particularly, age-related turnover in adipose tissue is a major contributor to metabolic syndromes and shortened lifespan. Adipocytes undergo senescence in early stage, which results in adipose tissue metabolic dysfunction, redistribution, and inflammation. The well-established association between DNA methylation (DNAm) and aging has been observed in the past few decades. Indeed, age-related alteration in DNAm is highly tissue-specific. This review intends to summarize the advancements how DNAm changes coupled with aging process in adipose tissue, by which DNAm regulates cellular senescence, metabolic function, adipokine secretion and beiging process in adipocytes. Elucidation of the effect of DNAm on adipose aging would have great potential to the development of epigenetic therapeutic strategies against aging-related diseases in clinical settings.Copyright: © 2022 Xie et al."
"35336242","Utilization of Host and Microbiome Features in Determination of Biological Aging.","Microorganisms","The term 'old age' generally refers to a period characterized by profound changes in human physiological functions and susceptibility to disease that accompanies the final years of a person's life. Despite the conventional definition of old age as exceeding the age of 65 years old, quantifying aging as a function of life years does not necessarily reflect how the human body ages. In contrast, characterizing biological (or physiological) aging based on functional parameters may better reflect a person's temporal physiological status and associated disease susceptibility state. As such, differentiating 'chronological aging' from 'biological aging' holds the key to identifying individuals featuring accelerated aging processes despite having a young chronological age and stratifying them to tailored surveillance, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment. Emerging evidence suggests that the gut microbiome changes along with physiological aging and may play a pivotal role in a variety of age-related diseases, in a manner that does not necessarily correlate with chronological age. Harnessing of individualized gut microbiome data and integration of host and microbiome parameters using artificial intelligence and machine learning pipelines may enable us to more accurately define aging clocks. Such holobiont-based estimates of a person's physiological age may facilitate prediction of age-related physiological status and risk of development of age-associated diseases."

Dysregulation of retroelement silencing is associated with male sterility. Although retroelement silencing mechanisms have been extensively studied in mouse germ cells, little progress has been made in humans. Here, we show that the Krüppel-associated box domain zinc finger proteins are associated with DNA methylation of retroelements in human primordial germ cells. Further, we show that the hominoid-specific retroelement SINE-VNTR-Alus(SVA) is subjected to transcription-directed de novo DNA methylation during human spermatogenesis. The degree of de novo DNA methylation in SVAs varies among human individuals, which confers significant inter-individual epigenetic variation in sperm.

We found 75 risk loci, of which 42 were new at the time of analysis. Pathway enrichment analyses confirmed the involvement of amyloid/tau pathways and highlighted microglia implication. Gene prioritization in the new loci identified 31 genes that were suggestive of new genetically associated processes, including the tumor necrosis factor alpha pathway through the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex. We also built a new genetic risk score associated with the risk of future AD/dementia or progression from mild cognitive impairment to AD/dementia.

However, the developmental trajectory of OXTR gene expression is unclear. By analyzing gene expression data in human post-mortem brain samples, from the prenatal period to late adulthood, we demonstrate distinct patterns of OXTR gene expression in the developing brain, with increasing OXTR expression along the course of the prenatal period culminating in a peak during early childhood. This early life OXTR expression peak pattern appears slightly earlier in a comparative macaque sample, which is consistent with the relative immaturity of the human brain during early life compared to macaques. We also show that a network of genes with strong spatiotemporal couplings with OXTR is enriched in several psychiatric illness and body composition phenotypes. Taken together, these results demonstrate that oxytocin signaling plays an important role in a diverse set of psychological and somatic processes across the lifespan.© 2022.

"35373152","From pharmacogenetics to pharmaco-omics: Milestones and future directions.","HGG Adv","The origins of pharmacogenetics date back to the 1950s, when it was established that inter-individual differences in drug response are partially determined by genetic factors. Since then, pharmacogenetics has grown into its own field, motivated by the translation of identified gene-drug interactions into therapeutic applications. Despite numerous challenges ahead, our understanding of the human pharmacogenetic landscape has greatly improved thanks to the integration of tools originating from disciplines as diverse as biochemistry, molecular biology, statistics, and computer sciences. In this review, we discuss past, present, and future developments of pharmacogenetics methodology, focusing on three milestones: how early research established the genetic basis of drug responses, how technological progress made it possible to assess the full extent of pharmacological variants, and how multi-dimensional omics datasets can improve the identification, functional validation, and mechanistic understanding of the interplay between genes and drugs. We outline novel strategies to repurpose and integrate molecular and clinical data originating from biobanks to gain insights analogous to those obtained from randomized controlled trials. Emphasizing the importance of increased diversity, we envision future directions for the field that should pave the way to the clinical implementation of pharmacogenetics.© 2022 The Author(s)."

Of growing interest in this area is the role of epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation, in tailoring gene expression to fit novel conditions. Here, we reanalyzed nine invertebrate (Anthozoa and Hexapoda) datasets to validate a key prediction of this hypothesis: changes in DNA methylation in response to some condition correlate with changes in gene expression.In accord with previous observations, baseline levels of gene body methylation (GBM) positively correlated with transcription, and negatively correlated with transcriptional variation between conditions. Correlations between changes in GBM and transcription, however, were negligible. There was also no consistent negative correlation between methylation and transcription at the level of gene body methylation class (either highly- or lowly-methylated), anticipated under the previously described ""seesaw hypothesis"".Our results do not support the direct involvement of GBM in regulating dynamic transcriptional responses in invertebrates.

The use of biomarkers that target different hallmarks of aging is substantial in predicting adverse outcomes during the aging process, implementing specifically designed antiaging interventions and monitoring responses to these interventions. The present study aimed to develop a novel composition of plant extracts, comprising identified active ingredients that synergistically target different hallmarks of aging in cellulo and in vivo. The selected single extracts and the developed composition were tested through a powerful set of biomarkers that we have previously identified and studied. The composition of selected extracts simultaneously increased cellular lifespan, reduced the cellular oxidative load and enhanced antioxidant defense mechanisms by increasing proteasome activity and content. In addition, the combination prevented telomere attrition and preserved optimum DNA methylation levels. Remarkably, biomarker profiling of healthy volunteers who received the identified combination in the form of a nutritional supplement within the frame of a prospective, randomized, controlled 3-month trial revealed an unprecedented antioxidant capacity in humans. In conclusion, our results support the notion that interventions with specifically designed combinations of natural compounds targeting multiple hallmarks of aging represent an effective way to improve healthspan and well-being."

Therefore, we performed the largest transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) for PPD (482 cases, 859 controls) to date using RNA-sequencing in whole blood and deconvoluted cell types. No transcriptional changes were observed in whole blood. B-cells showed a majority of transcriptome-wide significant results (891 transcripts representing 789 genes) with pathway analyses implicating altered B-cell activation and insulin resistance. Integration of other data types revealed cell type-specific DNA methylation loci and disease-associated eQTLs (deQTLs), but not hormones/neuropeptides (estradiol, progesterone, oxytocin, BDNF), serve as regulators for part of the transcriptional differences between cases and controls. Further, deQTLs were enriched for several brain region-specific eQTLs, but no overlap with MDD risk loci was observed. Altogether, our results constitute a convergence of evidence for pathways most affected in PPD with data across different biological mechanisms.© 2022. The Author(s)."

Although body mass index (BMI) is the most commonly used reference for obesity, it is insufficient to evaluate the obesity-related pathophysiological changes in breast tissue. The purpose of this study is to establish a DNA-methylation-based biomarker for BMI (DM-BMI) and explore the connection between obesity and BC. Using DNA methylation data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), we developed DM-BMI to evaluate the degree of obesity in breast tissues. In tissues from non-BC and BC population, the DM-BMI model exhibited high accuracy in BMI prediction. In BC tissues, DM-BMI correlated with increased adipose tissue content and BC tissues with increased DM-BMI exhibited higher expression of pro-inflammatory adipokines. Next, we identified the gene expression profile relating to DM-BMI. Using Gene Ontology (GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database, we observed that the DM-BMI-related genes were mostly involved in the process of cancer immunity. DM-BMI is positively correlated with T cell infiltration in BC tissues. Furthermore, we observed that DM-BMI was positively correlated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) response markers in BC. Collectively, we developed a new biomarker for obesity and discovered that BC tissues from obese individuals exhibit an increased degree of immune cell infiltration, indicating that obese BC patients might be the potential beneficiaries for ICI treatment.Copyright © 2022 Xiong, Li, Yang, WU, Xie, Xu and Xie."

Typically, PCa is diagnosed at an advanced stage, with the consequence that there is more tumor heterogeneity and increased probability that more cells are resistant to treatments. Risk factors for PCa can serve as a way to select a high-risk population and develop biomarkers to improve early detection and treatment. We focus on blood-based methylation as an approach to identify a marker set that can be obtained in a minimally invasive way (through peripheral blood) and could be applied to a high-risk subpopulation [those with recent onset type 2 diabetes (DM)]. Blood samples were collected from 30 patients, 15 had been diagnosed with PCa and 15 had been diagnosed with recent onset DM. HumanMethylationEPIC Beadchip (Illumina, CA, United States) was used to quantify methylation of approximately 850,000 methylation sites across the genome and to analyze methylation markers associated with PCa or DM or both. Exploratory analysis conducted to propose importance of top CpG (5'-C-phosphate-G-3') methylation site associated genes and visualized using boxplots. A methylation-based age predictor was also investigated for ability to distinguish disease groups from controls. No methylation markers were observed to be significantly associated with PCa or new onset diabetes compared with control the respective control groups. In our exploratory analysis, one methylation marker, CpG04969764, found in the Laminin Subunit Alpha 5 (LAMA5) gene region was observed in both PCa and DM Top 100 methylation marker sets.

Although rich in calories, Western diets could be linked with the deficiency of micronutrients, resulting in the downstream of epigenetic and metabolic effects and consequently in obesity. Zinc (Zn) is an essential nutrient associated with distinct biological roles in human health. Despite the importance of Zn in metabolic processes, little is known about the relationship between Zn and epigenetic. Thus, the present study aimed to identify the epigenetic variables associated with Zn daily ingestion (ZnDI) and serum Zinc (ZnS) levels in women with and without obesity.This is a case-control, non-randomized, single-center study conducted with 21 women allocated into two groups: control group (CG), composed of 11 women without obesity, and study group (SG), composed of 10 women with obesity. Anthropometric measurements, ZnDI, and ZnS levels were evaluated. Also, leukocyte DNA was extracted for DNA methylation analysis using 450 k Illumina BeadChips. The epigenetic clock was calculated by Horvath method. The chip analysis methylation pipeline (ChAMP) package selected the differentially methylated regions (DMRs).The SG had lower ZnS levels than the CG. Moreover, in SG, the ZnS levels were negatively associated with the epigenetic age acceleration. The DMR analysis revealed 37 DMRs associated with ZnDI and ZnS levels. The DMR ofPM20D1gene was commonly associated with ZnDI and ZnS levels and was hypomethylated in the SG.Our findings provide new information on Zn's modulation of DNA methylation patterns and bring new perspectives for understanding the nutriepigenetic mechanisms in obesity.Copyright © 2022 Noronha, Barato, Sae-Lee, Pinhel, Watanabe, Pereira, Rodrigues, Morais, de Sousa, Souza, Plaça, Salgado, Barbosa, Plösch and Nonino."
"35361933","Reprogramming of fibroblasts into expandable cardiovascular progenitor cells via small molecules in xeno-free conditions.","Nat Biomed Eng","A major hurdle in cardiac cell therapy is the lack of a bona fide autologous stem-cell type that can be expanded long-term and has authentic cardiovascular differentiation potential. Here we report that a proliferative cell population with robust cardiovascular differentiation potential can be generated from mouse or human fibroblasts via a combination of six small molecules. These chemically induced cardiovascular progenitor cells (ciCPCs) self-renew long-term in fully chemically defined and xeno-free conditions, with faithful preservation of the CPC phenotype and of cardiovascular differentiation capacity in vitro and in vivo. Transplantation of ciCPCs into infarcted mouse hearts improved animal survival and cardiac function up to 13 weeks post-infarction. Mechanistically, activated fibroblasts revert to a plastic state permissive to cardiogenic signals, enabling their reprogramming into ciCPCs. Expanded autologous cardiovascular cells may find uses in drug discovery, disease modelling and cardiac cell therapy.© 2022. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited."

For participants without a history of vertebral fracture, lateral X-rays of the spine covering the fourth thoracic spine to the fifth lumbar spine were performed to detect any asymptomatic vertebral fractures. Ten tag-single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) ofPOSTNwere genotyped. Serum periostin levels, biochemical parameters, and BMD were measured individually.rs9603226 was significantly associated with vertebral fractures. Compared to allele G, the minor allele A carriers of rs9603226 had a 1.722-fold higher prevalence of vertebral fracture (p= 0.037). rs3923854 was significantly associated with the serum periostin level. G/G genotype of rs3923854 had a higher serum periostin level than C/C and C/G (67.26 ± 19.90 ng/mL vs. 54.57 ± 21.44 ng/mL and 54.34 ± 18.23 ng/mL). Furthermore, there was a negative correlation between the serum level of periostin and BMD at trochanter and total hip.Our study suggested that genetic variation ofPOSTNcould be a predicting factor for the risk of vertebral fractures. The serum level of periostin could be a potential biochemical parameter for osteoporosis in Chinese postmenopausal women."
"35327605","Hormones and Sex-Specific Medicine in Human Physiopathology.","Biomolecules","A prodigious increment of scientific evidence in both preclinical and clinical studies is narrowing a major gap in knowledge regarding sex-specific biological responses observed in numerous branches of clinical practices. Some paradigmatic examples include neurodegenerative and mental disorders, immune-related disorders such as pathogenic infections and autoimmune diseases, oncologic conditions, and cardiovascular morbidities. The male-to-female proportion in a population is expressed as sex ratio and varies eminently with respect to the pathophysiology, natural history, incidence, prevalence, and mortality rates. The factors that determine this scenario incorporate both sex-associated biological differences and gender-dependent sociocultural issues. A broad narrative review focused on the current knowledge about the role of hormone regulation in gender medicine and gender peculiarities across key clinical areas is provided. Sex differences in immune response, cardiovascular diseases, neurological disorders, cancer, and COVID-19 are some of the hints reported. Moreover, gender implications in occupational health and health policy are offered to support the need for more personalized clinical medicine and public health approaches to achieve an ameliorated quality of life of patients and better outcomes in population health."
"35327559","The Role of Epigenetic Modifications in Human Cancers and the Use of Natural Compounds as Epidrugs: Mechanistic Pathways and Pharmacodynamic Actions.","Biomolecules","Cancer is a complex disease resulting from the genetic and epigenetic disruption of normal cells. The mechanistic understanding of the pathways involved in tumor transformation has implicated a priori predominance of epigenetic perturbations and a posteriori genetic instability. In this work, we aimed to explain the mechanistic involvement of epigenetic pathways in the cancer process, as well as the abilities of natural bioactive compounds isolated from medicinal plants (flavonoids, phenolic acids, stilbenes, and ketones) to specifically target the epigenome of tumor cells. The molecular events leading to transformation, angiogenesis, and dissemination are often complex, stochastic, and take turns. On the other hand, the decisive advances in genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics have allowed, in recent years, for the mechanistic decryption of the molecular pathways of the cancerization process. This could explain the possibility of specifically targeting this or that mechanism leading to cancerization. With the plasticity and flexibility of epigenetic modifications, some studies have started the pharmacological screening of natural substances against different epigenetic pathways (DNA methylation, histone acetylation, histone methylation, and chromatin remodeling) to restore the cellular memory lost during tumor transformation. These substances can inhibit DNMTs, modify chromatin remodeling, and adjust histone modifications in favor of pre-established cell identity by the differentiation program. Epidrugs are molecules that target the epigenome program and can therefore restore cell memory in cancerous diseases. Natural products isolated from medicinal plants such as flavonoids and phenolic acids have shown their ability to exhibit several actions on epigenetic modifiers, such as the inhibition of DNMT, HMT, and HAT. The mechanisms of these substances are specific and pleiotropic and can sometimes be stochastic, and their use as anticancer epidrugs is currently a remarkable avenue in the fight against human cancers."
"35326684","Is There a Role for Epigenetic Therapies in Modulating DNA Damage Repair Pathways to Enhance Chemotherapy and Overcome Drug Resistance?","Cancers (Basel)","Epigenetic therapies describe drug molecules such as DNA methyltransferase, histone methyltransferase and histone acetylase/deacetylase inhibitors, which target epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation and histone modifications. Many DNA damage response (DDR) genes are epigenetically regulated in cancer leading to transcriptional silencing and the loss of DNA repair capacity. Epigenetic marks at DDR genes, such as DNA methylation at gene promoters, have the potential to be used as stratification biomarkers, identifying which patients may benefit from particular chemotherapy treatments. For genes such asMGMTandBRCA1, promoter DNA methylation is associated with chemosensitivity to alkylating agents and platinum coordination complexes, respectively, and they have use as biomarkers directing patient treatment options. In contrast to epigenetic change leading to chemosensitivity, DNA methylation of DDR genes involved in engaging cell death responses, such asMLH1, are associated with chemoresistance. This contrasting functional effect of epigenetic modification on chemosensitivity raises challenges in using DNA-demethylating agents, and other epigenetic approaches, to sensitise tumours to DNA-damaging chemotherapies and molecularly targeted agents. Demethylation ofMGMT/BRCA1could lead to drug resistance whereas demethylation ofMLH1could sensitise cells to chemotherapy. Patient selection based on a solid understanding of the disease pathway will be one means to tackle these challenges. The role of epigenetic modification of DDR genes during tumour development, such as causing a mutator phenotype, has different selective pressures and outcomes compared to epigenetic adaptation during treatment. The prevention of epigenetic adaptation during the acquisition of drug resistance will be a potential strategy to improve the treatment of patients using epigenetic therapies."
"35326391","MicroRNA Roles in Cell Reprogramming Mechanisms.","Cells","Cell reprogramming is a groundbreaking technology that, in few decades, generated a new paradigm in biomedical science. To date we can use cell reprogramming to potentially generate every cell type by converting somatic cells and suitably modulating the expression of key transcription factors. This approach can be used to convert skin fibroblasts into pluripotent stem cells as well as into a variety of differentiated and medically relevant cell types, including cardiomyocytes and neural cells. The molecular mechanisms underlying such striking cell phenotypes are still largely unknown, but in the last decade it has been proven that cell reprogramming approaches are significantly influenced by non-coding RNAs. Specifically, this review will focus on the role of microRNAs in the reprogramming processes that lead to the generation of pluripotent stem cells, neurons, and cardiomyocytes. As highlighted here, non-coding RNA-forced expression can be sufficient to support some cell reprogramming processes, and, therefore, we will also discuss how these molecular determinants could be used in the future for biomedical purposes."
"35355955","Maternal tobacco smoke exposure is associated with increased DNA methylation at human metastable epialleles in infant cord blood.","Environ Epigenet","Metastable epialleles (MEs) are genomic regions that are stochastically methylated prior to germ layer specification and exhibit high interindividual but low intra-individual variability across tissues. ME methylation is vulnerable to environmental stressors, including diet. Tobacco smoke (TS) exposure during pregnancy is associated with adverse impacts on fetal health and maternal micronutrient levels as well as altered methylation. Our objective was to determine if maternal smoke exposure impacts methylation at MEs. Consistent with prior studies, we observed reductions in one-carbon pathway micronutrients with gestational TS exposure, including maternal folate (P = 0.02) and vitamins B6 (P = 0.05) and B12 (P = 0.007). We examined putative MEsBOLA3, PAX8,andZFYVE28in cord blood specimens from 85 Newborn Epigenetics STudy participants. Gestational TS exposure was associated with elevated DNA methylation atPAX8(+5.22% average methylation; 95% CI: 0.33% to 10.10%;P = 0.037). In human conceptal kidney tissues, higherPAX8transcription was associated with lower methylation (Rs = 0.55;P = 0.07), suggesting that the methylation levels established at MEs, and their environmentally induced perturbation, may have meaningful, tissue-specific functional consequences. This may be particularly important becausePAX8is implicated in several cancers, including pediatric kidney cancer. Our data are the first to indicate vulnerability of human ME methylation establishment to TS exposure, with a general trend of increasing levels of methylation at these loci. Further investigation is needed to determine how TS exposure-mediated changes in DNA methylation at MEs, and consequent expression levels, might affect smoking-related disease risk.© The Author(s) 2022.

Here we explore the variation in macronutrient tolerance in Drosophila melanogaster using the Drosophila genetic reference panel, a collection of ~200 strains derived from a single natural population. Our study demonstrates that D. melanogaster, often considered a ""dietary generalist"", displays marked genetic variation in survival on different diets, notably on high-sugar diet. Our genetic analysis and functional validation identify several regulators of macronutrient tolerance, including CG10960/GLUT8, Pkn and Eip75B. We also demonstrate a role for the JNK pathway in sugar tolerance and de novo lipogenesis. Finally, we report a role for tailless, a conserved orphan nuclear hormone receptor, in regulating sugar metabolism via insulin-like peptide secretion and sugar-responsive CCHamide-2 expression.

However, the genomic and clinical characteristics among them remain elusive. Here, we performed targeted capture sequence to characterize the mutational spectrum of Chinese lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients across ages.Patients and Methods: 2025 LUAD patients were divided into three groups: young (≤50 years old) (n=416, 20.54%), intermediate (51~69 years old) (n=1271, 62.77%), and aged (≥70 years old) (n=338, 16.69%). 1,021-gene panel and 59-gene panel were used for sequencing with tissue samples. Genetic alterations and tumor mutation burden (TMB) in LUAD patients were investigated.Results: The frequency of mutations affecting 20 genes were significantly higher in aged group than in young group, and fourteen of them were not reported before, including involved in cell cycle/apoptosis signaling (FAT1, FAT2), DNA damage repair (FANCAandFANCM), chromatin histone modification (KDM6A),RTK/RAS/PI3Ksignaling (FLT4andMTOR),NOTCHsignaling (NOTCH1, NOTCH2andNOTCH4) and other signaling pathway or cellular regulatory factor (KEAP1, ASXL1, EPHB1andABCB1). Six previously reported mutated genes (RBM10,KRAS,LRP1B,CDKN2AandKMT2C/D) were also significantly more frequent in aged group. Among clinical actionable mutation sites,KRASmutation was presented more common in aged group; bothMETexon 14 skipping andMETamplification were significantly positively correlated with old age; the fusions ofALK,ROS1, RET and ERBB2exon 20 insertion were less frequent in aged group. Furthermore, a higher level of TMB was found in aged group compared with young group.Conclusion:In this study, we revealed the differences of somatic genetic mutations and TMB between young and aged LUAD patients, which may provide directions of targeted therapy and advantages of immunotherapy for the elderly in the future.© The author(s)."

By LP, tumor-specific genetic alterations can be determined as part of companion diagnostics to guide selection of appropriate targeted therapeutics. Because LP facilitates longitudinal monitoring of cancer patients, it can be used to detect acquired resistant mechanisms or as a personalized biomarker for earlier detection of disease recurrence, among other applications. However, LP is not yet integrated into routine care to the extent that might be expected. This is due to the lack of harmonization and standardization of preanalytical and analytical workflows, the lack of proper quality controls, limited evidence of its clinical utility, heterogeneous study results, the uncertainty of clinicians regarding the value and appropriate indications for LP and its interpretation, and finally, the lack of reimbursement for most LP tests. In this review, the value proposition of LP for cancer patient management and treatment optimization, the current status of implementation in standard care, and the main challenges that need to be overcome are discussed in detail."

However, previous studies usually examine multi-dimensional (physical, mental, and perceived) health and life satisfaction separately, and few studies dealt with them simultaneously. Moreover, limited research revealed the mechanisms behind the effects of perceived neighborhood environment on health and life satisfaction, as well as how such effects are moderated by socio-demographics. Therefore, employing the 2016 China Family Panel Study Dataset and using structural equation modeling, this study delves into the complicated relationships among perceived neighborhood environment, health behavior, health outcomes (i.e., body mass index, self-rated health status, and depression), and life satisfaction. Notably, it considers mediation and moderation simultaneously. It finds: (1) Better perceived neighborhood environment significantly promotes physical activity and reduces sedentary behavior, smoking, and drinking; (2) Health behavior fully mediates the effects of perceived neighborhood environment on health; (3) Perceived neighborhood environment significantly affects life satisfaction both directly and indirectly (through health behavior and health outcomes); (4) Socio-demographics moderate the above relationships. This study disentangles the complicated impacts of perceived neighborhood environment on adults' multi-dimensional health and life satisfaction, thus providing policy makers and practitioners with nuanced knowledge for intervention.Copyright © 2022 Liu, Yang, Xiao and Tao."

Although sepsis is characterized by a malfunction of the immune system leading to an altered immune response and immunosuppression, the high complexity of the pathophysiology of sepsis requires further investigation to characterize the immune response in sepsis and septic shock. (2) Methods: This study analyzes the immune-related responses occurring during the early stages of sepsis by comparing the amounts of cytokines, immune modulators and other endothelial mediators of a control group and three types of severe patients: critically ill non-septic patients, septic and septic shock patients. (3) Results: We showed that in the early stages of sepsis the innate immune system attempts to counteract infection, probably via neutrophils. Conversely, the adaptive immune system is not yet fully activated, either in septic or in septic shock patients. In addition, immunosuppressive responses and pro-coagulation signals are active in patients with septic shock. (4) Conclusions: The highest levels of IL-6 and pyroptosis-related cytokines (IL-18 and IL-1α) were found in septic shock patients, which correlated with D-dimer. Moreover, endothelial function may be affected as shown by the overexpression of adhesion molecules such as s-ICAM1 and E-Selectin during septic shock."

A recent TS genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified a genome-wide significant locus. However, determining the biological mechanism of GWAS signals remains difficult. To characterize effects of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) in TS and understand biological underpinnings of the disease. Here, we conduct a TS transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) consisting of 4819 cases and 9488 controls. We demonstrate that increased expression of FLT3 in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is associated with TS. We further show that there is global dysregulation of FLT3 across several brain regions and probabilistic causal fine-mapping of the TWAS signal prioritizes FLT3 with a posterior inclusion probability of 0.849. After, we proxy the expression with 100 lymphoblastoid cell lines, and demonstrate that TS cells has a 1.72 increased fold change compared to controls. A phenome-wide association study also points toward FLT3 having links with immune-related pathways such as monocyte count. We further identify several splicing events in MPHOSPH9, CSGALNACT2 and FIP1L1 associated with TS, which are also implicated in immune function.

To investigate the artemisinin resistance mechanism, transcriptome analysis was conducted of 577 P. falciparum isolates collected in the GMS between 2016-2018. A specific artemisinin resistance-associated transcriptional profile was identified that involves a broad but discrete set of biological functions related to proteotoxic stress, host cytoplasm remodelling, and REDOX metabolism. The artemisinin resistance-associated transcriptional profile evolved from initial transcriptional responses of susceptible parasites to artemisinin. The genetic basis for this adapted response is likely to be complex.© 2022. The Author(s)."

Our airway analysis identified 95 asthma genes, 58 of which were not identified by transcriptome-wide association analyses using other asthma-relevant tissues. Among these genes were MUC5AC, an airway mucin, and FOXA3, a transcriptional driver of mucus metaplasia. Muco-ciliary epithelial cultures from genotyped donors revealed that the MUC5AC risk variant increases MUC5AC protein secretion and mucus secretory cell frequency. Airway transcriptome-wide association analyses for mucus production and chronic cough also identified MUC5AC. These cis-expression variants were associated with trans effects on expression; the MUC5AC variant was associated with upregulation of non-inflammatory mucus secretory network genes, while the FOXA3 variant was associated with upregulation of type-2 inflammation-induced mucus-metaplasia pathway genes.

Seed coat content is a complex quantitative trait that negatively correlates with the seed oil content in B. napus.Here we provide insights into the genetic basis of natural variation of seed coat content by transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using 382 B. napus accessions. By population transcriptomic analysis, we identify more than 700 genes and four gene modules that are significantly associated with seed coat content. We also characterize three reliable quantitative trait loci (QTLs) controlling seed coat content by GWAS. Combining TWAS and correlation networks of seed coat content-related gene modules, we find that BnaC07.CCR-LIKE (CCRL) and BnaTT8s play key roles in the determination of the trait by modulating lignin biosynthesis. By expression GWAS analysis, we identify a regulatory hotspot on chromosome A09, which is involved in controlling seed coat content through BnaC07.CCRL and BnaTT8s. We then predict the downstream genes regulated by BnaTT8s using multi-omics datasets. We further experimentally validate that BnaCCRL and BnaTT8 positively regulate seed coat content and lignin content. BnaCCRL represents a novel identified gene involved in seed coat development. Furthermore, we also predict the key genes regulating carbon allocation between phenylpropane compounds and oil during seed development in B. napus.This study helps us to better understand the complex machinery of seed coat development and provides a genetic resource for genetic improvement of seed coat content in B. napus breeding.© 2022.

Genetic studies combining both phenotypes have identified three loci associated with both traits. However, the genetic cis-regulation at the protein level associated with SVD has not been studied before. We performed a proteome-wide association study (PWAS) using FUSION to integrate a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and brain proteomic data to discover the common mechanisms regulating both SVS and ICH. Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dPFC) brain proteomes from the ROS/MAP study (N = 376 subjects and 1443 proteins) and the summary statistics for the SVS GWAS from the MEGASTROKE study (N = 237,511) and multi-trait analysis of GWAS (MTAG)-ICH-SVS from Chung et al.

The replicated results (q-value &lt; 0.05) were further investigated for the causality relationship using summary data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR). One protein (ICA1L) was significantly associated with SVS (z-score = -4.42 andp-value = 9.6 × 10-6) and non-lobar ICH (z-score = -4.8 andp-value = 1.58 × 10-6) in the discovery PWAS, with a high co-localization posterior probability of 4. In the validation PWAS, ICA1L remained significantly associated with both traits. The SMR results for ICA1L indicated a causal association of protein expression levels in the brain with SVS (p-value = 3.66 × 10-5) and non-lobar ICH (p-value = 1.81 × 10-5).

Interestingly, 70% (215/309) acted through cis-regulatory elements, with the remaining through promoters (22%, 70/309) or non-coding RNAs (8%, 24/309). Several validation approaches were utilized in these studies, including gene expression (n = 272), transcription factor binding (n = 175), reporter assays (n = 171), in vivo models (n = 104), genome editing (n = 96) and chromatin interaction (n = 33).This review of the literature is the first to systematically evaluate the status and the landscape of experimentation being used to validate non-coding GWAS-identified variants. Our results clearly underscore the multifaceted approach needed for experimental validation, have practical implications on variant prioritization and considerations of target gene nomination.

Knowledge of their hematopoietic activities casts light on normal and malignant immune cell development. Recently, we constructed the so-called lymphoid TALE-code that codifies expression patterns of all active TALE class homeobox genes in early hematopoiesis and lymphopoiesis. Here, we present the corresponding myeloid TALE-code to extend this gene signature, covering the entire hematopoietic system. The collective data showed expression patterns for eleven TALE homeobox genes and highlighted the exclusive expression of IRX1 in megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors (MEPs), implicating this TALE class member in a specific myeloid differentiation process. Analysis of public profiling data from acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients revealed aberrant activity of IRX1 in addition to IRX3 and IRX5, indicating an oncogenic role for these TALE homeobox genes when deregulated. Screening of RNA-seq data from 100 leukemia/lymphoma cell lines showed overexpression of IRX1, IRX3, and IRX5 in megakaryoblastic and myelomonocytic AML cell lines, chosen as suitable models for studying the regulation and function of these homeo-oncogenes. Genomic copy number analysis of IRX-positive cell lines demonstrated chromosomal amplification of the neighboring IRX3 and IRX5 genes at position 16q12 in MEGAL, underlying their overexpression in this cell line model. Comparative gene expression analysis of these cell lines revealed candidate upstream factors and target genes, namely the co-expression of GATA1 and GATA2 together with IRX1, and of BMP2 and HOXA10 with IRX3/IRX5. Subsequent knockdown and stimulation experiments in AML cell lines confirmed their activating impact in the corresponding IRX gene expression. Furthermore, we demonstrated that IRX1 activated KLF1 and TAL1, while IRX3 inhibited GATA1, GATA2, and FST. Accordingly, we propose that these regulatory relationships may represent major physiological and oncogenic activities of IRX factors in normal and malignant myeloid differentiation, respectively. Finally, the established myeloid TALE-code is a useful tool for evaluating TALE homeobox gene activities in AML."

Cognitive impairment is a core clinical feature of SCZ and a determinant of poorer outcome. Genetic overlap between SCZ and cognitive traits is complex, with limited studies of comprehensive epidemiological and genomic evidence. To examine the relation between SCZ and three cognitive traits, educational attainment (EDU), premorbid cognitive ability, and intellectual disability (ID), we used two Swedish samples: a national cohort (14,230 SCZ cases and 3,816,264 controls) and a subsample with comprehensive genetic data (4992 cases and 6009 controls). Population-based analyses confirmed worse cognition as a risk factor for SCZ, and the pedigree and SNP-based genetic correlations were comparable. In the genotyped cases, those with high EDU and premorbid cognitive ability tended to have higher polygenetic risk scores (PRS) of EDU and intelligence and fewer rare exonic variants. Finally, by applying an empirical clustering method, we dissected SCZ cases into four replicable subgroups characterized by EDU and ID. In particular, the subgroup with higher EDU in the national cohort had fewer adverse outcomes including long hospitalization and death. In the genotyped subsample, this subgroup had higher PRS of EDU and no excess of rare genetic burdens than controls. In conclusion, we found extensive evidence of a robust relation between cognitive traits and SCZ, underscoring the importance of cognition in dissecting the heterogeneity of SCZ.© 2022.

Here, we present a whole-genome sequencing study comparing 3181 moderate-to-severe asthma patients to 3590 non-asthma controls. We demonstrate that asthma risk is genetically correlated with lung function measures and that this component of asthma risk is orthogonal to the eosinophil genetics that also contribute to disease susceptibility. We find that polygenic scores for reduced lung function are associated with younger asthma age of onset. Genome-wide, seven previously reported common asthma variant loci and one previously reported lung function locus, near THSD4, reach significance. We replicate association of the lung function locus in a recently published GWAS of moderate-to-severe asthma patients. We additionally replicate the association of a previously reported rare (minor allele frequency < 1%) coding variant in IL33 and show significant enrichment of rare variant burden in genes from common variant allergic disease loci. Our findings highlight the contribution of lung function genetics to moderate-to-severe asthma risk, and provide initial rare variant support for associations with moderate-to-severe asthma risk at several candidate genes from common variant loci.© 2022.

The Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study was created to study the biopsychosocial factors underlying healthy and pathological brain development during this period, and comprises the world's largest youth cohort with neuroimaging, family history and genetic data.We examined 9856 unrelated 9-to-10-year-old participants in the ABCD study drawn from 21 sites across the United States, of which 7662 had multimodal magnetic resonance imaging scans passing quality control, and 4447 were non-Hispanic white and used for polygenic risk score analyses. Using data available at baseline, we associated eight 'syndrome scale scores' from the Child Behavior Checklist-summarizing anxious/depressed symptoms, withdrawn/depressed symptoms, somatic complaints, social problems, thought problems, attention problems, rule-breaking behavior, and aggressive behavior-with resting-state functional and structural brain magnetic resonance imaging measures; eight indicators of family history of psychopathology; and polygenic risk scores for major depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and anorexia nervosa. As a sensitivity analysis, we excluded participants with clinically significant (>97th percentile) or borderline (93rd-97th percentile) scores for each dimension.Most Child Behavior Checklist dimensions were associated with reduced functional connectivity within one or more of four large-scale brain networks-default mode, cingulo-parietal, dorsal attention, and retrosplenial-temporal. Several dimensions were also associated with increased functional connectivity between the default mode, dorsal attention, ventral attention and cingulo-opercular networks. Conversely, almost no global or regional brain structural measures were associated with any of the dimensions. Every family history indicator was associated with every dimension. Major depression polygenic risk was associated with six of the eight dimensions, whereas ADHD polygenic risk was exclusively associated with attention problems and externalizing behavior (rule-breaking and aggressive behavior). Bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and anorexia nervosa polygenic risk were not associated with any of the dimensions. Many associations remained statistically significant even after excluding participants with clinically significant or borderline psychopathology, suggesting that the same risk factors that contribute to clinically significant psychopathology also contribute to continuous variation within the clinically normal range.This study codifies neurobiological, familial and genetic risk factors for dimensional psychopathology across a population-scale cohort of community-dwelling preadolescents. Future efforts are needed to understand how these multiple modalities of risk intersect to influence trajectories of psychopathology into late adolescence and adulthood.© 2022.

"35347246","A genome-wide association study of suicide attempts in the million veterans program identifies evidence of pan-ancestry and ancestry-specific risk loci.","Mol Psychiatry","To identify pan-ancestry and ancestry-specific loci associated with attempting suicide among veterans, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of suicide attempts within a large, multi-ancestry cohort of U.S. veterans enrolled in the Million Veterans Program (MVP). Cases were defined as veterans with a documented history of suicide attempts in the electronic health record (EHR; N = 14,089) and controls were defined as veterans with no documented history of suicidal thoughts or behaviors in the EHR (N = 395,064). GWAS was performed separately in each ancestry group, controlling for sex, age and genetic substructure. Pan-ancestry risk loci were identified through meta-analysis and included two genome-wide significant loci on chromosomes 20 (p = 3.64 × 10-9) and 1 (p = 3.69 × 10-8). A strong pan-ancestry signal at the Dopamine Receptor D2 locus (p = 1.77 × 10-7) was also identified and subsequently replicated in a large, independent international civilian cohort (p = 7.97 × 10-4). Additionally, ancestry-specific genome-wide significant loci were also detected in African-Americans, European-Americans, Asian-Americans, and Hispanic-Americans. Pathway analyses suggested over-representation of many biological pathways with high clinical significance, including oxytocin signaling, glutamatergic synapse, cortisol synthesis and secretion, dopaminergic synapse, and circadian rhythm. These findings confirm that the genetic architecture underlying suicide attempt risk is complex and includes both pan-ancestry and ancestry-specific risk loci. Moreover, pathway analyses suggested many commonly impacted biological pathways that could inform development of improved therapeutics for suicide prevention.© 2022.

"35334875","Estimating the Direct Effect between Dietary Macronutrients and Cardiometabolic Disease, Accounting for Mediation by Adiposity and Physical Activity.","Nutrients","Assessing the causal effects of individual dietary macronutrients and cardiometabolic disease is challenging because distinguish direct effects from those mediated or confounded by other factors is difficult. To estimate these effects, intake of protein, carbohydrate, sugar, fat, and its subtypes were obtained using food frequency data derived from a Swedish population-based cohort (n~60,000). Data on clinical outcomes (i.e., type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) incidence) were obtained by linking health registry data. We assessed the magnitude of direct and mediated effects of diet, adiposity and physical activity on T2D and CVD using structural equation modelling (SEM). To strengthen causal inference, we used Mendelian randomization (MR) to model macronutrient intake exposures against clinical outcomes. We identified likely causal effects of genetically predicted carbohydrate intake (including sugar intake) and T2D, independent of adiposity and physical activity. Pairwise, serial- and parallel-mediational configurations yielded similar results. In the integrative genomic analyses, the candidate causal variant localized to the established T2D geneTCF7L2. These findings may be informative when considering which dietary modifications included in nutritional guidelines are most likely to elicit health-promoting effects."
"35321643","Sex-specific genetic modifiers identified susceptibility of cold stored red blood cells to osmotic hemolysis.","BMC Genomics","Genetic variants have been found to influence red blood cell (RBC) susceptibility to hemolytic stress and affect transfusion outcomes and the severity of blood diseases. Males have a higher susceptibility to hemolysis than females, but little is known about the genetic mechanism contributing to the difference.To investigate the sex differences in RBC susceptibility to hemolysis, we conducted a sex-stratified genome-wide association study and a genome-wide gene-by-sex interaction scan in a multi-ethnic dataset with 12,231 blood donors who have in vitro osmotic hemolysis measurements during routine blood storage. The estimated SNP-based heritability for osmotic hemolysis was found to be significantly higher in males than in females (0.46 vs. 0.41). We identified SNPs associated with sex-specific susceptibility to osmotic hemolysis in five loci (SPTA1, KCNA6, SLC4A1, SUMO1P1, and PAX8) that impact RBC function and hemolysis.Our study established a best practice to identify sex-specific genetic modifiers for sexually dimorphic traits in datasets with mixed ancestries, providing evidence of different genetic regulations of RBC susceptibility to hemolysis between sexes. These and other variants may help explain observed sex differences in the severity of hemolytic diseases, such as sickle cell and malaria, as well as the viability of red cell storage and recovery.© 2022.

"35328039","Comparing BeadChip and WGS Genotyping: Non-Technical Failed Calling Is Attributable to Additional Variation within the Probe Target Sequence.","Genes (Basel)","Microarray-based genomic selection is a central tool to increase the genetic gain of economically significant traits in dairy cattle. Yet, the effectivity of this tool is slightly limited, as estimates based on genotype data only partially explain the observed heritability. In the analysis of the genomes of 17 Israeli Holstein bulls, we compared genotyping accuracy between whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and microarray-based techniques. Using the standard GATK pipeline, the short-variant discovery within sequence reads mapped to the reference genome (ARS-UCD1.2) was compared to the genotypes from Illumina BovineSNP50 BeadChip and to an alternative method, which computationally mimics the hybridization procedure by mapping reads to 50 bp spanning the BeadChip source sequences. The number of mismatches between the BeadChip and WGS genotypes was low (0.2%). However, 17,197 (40% of the informative SNPs) had extra variation within 50 bp of the targeted SNP site, which might interfere with hybridization-based genotyping. Consequently, with respect to genotyping errors, BeadChip varied significantly and systematically from WGS genotyping, introducing null allele-like effects and Mendelian errors (&lt;0.5%), whereas the GATK algorithm of local de novo assembly of haplotypes successfully resolved the genotypes in the extra-variable regions. These findings suggest that the microarray design should avoid polymorphic genomic regions that are prone to extra variation and that WGS data may be used to resolve erroneous genotyping, which may partially explain missing heritability."

Bioinformatic approaches, advances in machine learning techniques and the increasing deposition of high-throughput data in public databases have significantly contributed to recent advances in the field, but it is not straightforward to decide which data and methods are most suitable to use in a given case. In this review, we focus on these methods and data and their applications in generating MoA hypotheses for subsequent experimental validation. We discuss compound-specific data such as -omics, cell morphology and bioactivity data, as well as commonly used supplementary prior knowledge such as network and pathway data, and provide information on databases where this data can be accessed. In terms of methodologies, we discuss both well-established methods (connectivity mapping, pathway enrichment) as well as more developing methods (neural networks and multi-omics integration). Finally, we review case studies where the MoA of a compound was successfully suggested from computational analysis by incorporating multiple data modalities and/or methodologies. Our aim for this review is to provide researchers with insights into the benefits and drawbacks of both the data and methods in terms of level of understanding, biases and interpretation - and to highlight future avenues of investigation which we foresee will improve the field of MoA elucidation, including greater public access to -omics data and methodologies which are capable of data integration.This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry."
"35347416","Predicting embryonic aneuploidy rate in IVF patients using whole-exome sequencing.","Hum Genet","Infertility is a major reproductive health issue that affects about 12% of women of reproductive age in the United States. Aneuploidy in eggs accounts for a significant proportion of early miscarriage and in vitro fertilization failure. Recent studies have shown that genetic variants in several genes affect chromosome segregation fidelity and predispose women to a higher incidence of egg aneuploidy. However, the exact genetic causes of aneuploid egg production remain unclear, making it difficult to diagnose infertility based on individual genetic variants in mother's genome. In this study, we evaluated machine learning-based classifiers for predicting the embryonic aneuploidy risk in female IVF patients using whole-exome sequencing data. Using two exome datasets, we obtained an area under the receiver operating curve of 0.77 and 0.68, respectively. High precision could be traded off for high specificity in classifying patients by selecting different prediction score cutoffs. For example, a strict prediction score cutoff of 0.7 identified 29% of patients as high-risk with 94% precision. In addition, we identified MCM5, FGGY, and DDX60L as potential aneuploidy risk genes that contribute the most to the predictive power of the model. These candidate genes and their molecular interaction partners are enriched for meiotic-related gene ontology categories and pathways, such as microtubule organizing center and DNA recombination. In summary, we demonstrate that sequencing data can be mined to predict patients' aneuploidy risk thus improving clinical diagnosis. The candidate genes and pathways we identified are promising targets for future aneuploidy studies.© 2022.

"35361996","Inferring gene expression from cell-free DNA fragmentation profiles.","Nat Biotechnol","Profiling of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in the bloodstream shows promise for noninvasive cancer detection. Chromatin fragmentation features have previously been explored to infer gene expression profiles from cell-free DNA (cfDNA), but current fragmentomic methods require high concentrations of tumor-derived DNA and provide limited resolution. Here we describe promoter fragmentation entropy as an epigenomic cfDNA feature that predicts RNA expression levels at individual genes. We developed 'epigenetic expression inference from cell-free DNA-sequencing' (EPIC-seq), a method that uses targeted sequencing of promoters of genes of interest. Profiling 329 blood samples from 201 patients with cancer and 87 healthy adults, we demonstrate classification of subtypes of lung carcinoma and diffuse large B cell lymphoma. Applying EPIC-seq to serial blood samples from patients treated with PD-(L)1 immune-checkpoint inhibitors, we show that gene expression profiles inferred by EPIC-seq are correlated with clinical response. Our results indicate that EPIC-seq could enable noninvasive, high-throughput tissue-of-origin characterization with diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic potential.© 2022.

"35371514","The distinct morphological phenotypes of Southeast Asian aborigines are shaped by novel mechanisms for adaptation to tropical rainforests.","Natl Sci Rev","Southeast Asian aborigines, the hunter-gatherer populations living in tropical rainforests, exhibit distinct morphological phenotypes, including short stature, dark skin, curly hair and a wide and snub nose. The underlying genetic architecture and evolutionary mechanism of these phenotypes remain a long-term mystery. We conducted whole genome deep sequencing of 81 Cambodian aborigines from eight ethnic groups. Through a genome-wide scan of selective sweeps, we discovered key genes harboring Cambodian-enriched mutations that may contribute to their phenotypes, including two hair morphogenesis genes (TCHHandTCHHL1), one nasal morphology gene (PAX3) and a set of genes (such asENTPD1-AS1) associated with short stature. The identified new genes and novel mutations suggest an independent origin of the distinct phenotypes in Cambodian aborigines through parallel evolution, refuting the long-standing argument on the common ancestry of these phenotypes among the worldwide rainforest hunter-gatherers. Notably, our discovery reveals that various types of molecular mechanisms, including antisense transcription and epigenetic regulation, contribute to human morphogenesis, providing novel insights into the genetics of human environmental adaptation.© The Author(s) 2021.

The Finnish population provides an ideal opportunity for such explorations, given the multiple bottlenecks and expansions that have shaped its history, and the enrichment for many otherwise rare alleles that has resulted. Here, we report genetic associations for 1391 plasma metabolites in 6136 men from the late-settlement region of Finland. We identify 303 novel association signals, more than one third at variants rare or enriched in Finns. Many of these signals identify genes not previously implicated in metabolite genome-wide association studies and suggest mechanisms for diseases and disease-related traits.© 2022. The Author(s)."

Elucidating novel epigenetic contributors to DN can not only enhance our understanding of this complex disorder, but also lay the foundation for developing more effective monitoring tools and preventive interventions in the future, thus contributing to our ultimate goal of improving patient care.The 5hmC-Seal, a highly selective, chemical labeling technique, was used to profile genome-wide 5-hydroxymethylcytosines (5hmC), a stable cytosine modification type marking gene activation, in circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) samples from a cohort of patients recruited at Zhongnan Hospital, including T2D patients with nephropathy (DN, n = 12), T2D patients with non-DN vascular complications (non-DN, n = 29), and T2D patients without any complication (controls, n = 14). Differentially analysis was performed to find DN-associated 5hmC features, followed by the exploration of biomarker potential of 5hmC in cfDNA for DN using a machine learning approach.Genome-wide analyses of 5hmC in cfDNA detected 427 and 336 differential 5hmC modifications associated with DN, compared with non-DN individuals and controls, and suggested relevant pathways such as NOD-like receptor signaling pathway and tyrosine metabolism. Our exploration using a machine learning approach revealed an exploratory model comprised of ten 5hmC genes showing the possibility to distinguish DN from non-DN individuals or controls.Genome-wide analysis suggests the possibility of exploiting novel 5hmC in patient-derived cfDNA as a non-invasive tool for monitoring DN in high risk T2D patients in the future."
"35328433","Fragments of rDNA Genes Scattered over the Human Genome Are Targets of Small RNAs.","Int J Mol Sci","Small noncoding RNAs of different origins and classes play several roles in the regulation of gene expression. Here, we show that diverged and rearranged fragments of rDNA units are scattered throughout the human genome and that endogenous small noncoding RNAs are processed by the Microprocessor complex from specific regions of ribosomal RNAs shaping hairpins. These small RNAs correspond to particular sites inside the fragments of rDNA that mostly reside in intergenic regions or the introns of about 1500 genes. The targets of these small ribosomal RNAs (srRNAs) are characterized by a set of epigenetic marks, binding sites of Pol II, RAD21, CBP, and P300, DNase I hypersensitive sites, and by enrichment or depletion of active histone marks. In HEK293T cells, genes that are targeted by srRNAs (srRNA target genes) are involved in differentiation and development. srRNA target genes are enriched with more actively transcribed genes. Our data suggest that remnants of rDNA sequences and srRNAs may be involved in the upregulation or downregulation of a specific set of genes in human cells. These results have implications for diverse fields, including epigenetics and gene therapy."
"35326450","SWI/SNF Antagonism of PRC2 Mediates Estrogen-Induced Progesterone Receptor Expression.","Cells","Endometrial cancer (EC) is characterized by high estrogen levels unopposed by progesterone. Treatment with progestins is standard for early EC, but the response to progestins is dependent on progesterone receptor (PGR) expression. Here, we show that the expression of PGR in endometrial epithelial cells is dependent on ARID1A, a DNA-binding subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex that is commonly mutated in EC. In endometrial epithelial cells with estrogen receptor overexpression, we find that ARID1A promotes estrogen signaling and regulates common gene expression programs. Normally, endometrial epithelial cells expressing estrogen receptors respond to estrogen by upregulating the PGR. However, when ARID1A expression is lost, upregulation of PGR expression is significantly reduced. This phenomenon can also occur following the loss of the SWI/SNF subunit BRG1, suggesting a role for ARID1A- and BRG1-containing complexes in PGR regulation. We find that PGR is regulated by a bivalent promoter, which harbors both H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 histone tail modifications. H3K27me3 is deposited by EZH2, and inhibition of EZH2 in the context of ARID1A loss results in restoration of estrogen-induced PGR expression. Our results suggest a role for ARID1A deficiency in the loss of PGR in late-stage EC and a therapeutic utility for EZH2 inhibitors in this disease."

Over 50% of cases are gene-elusive on clinical gene panel testing. The contribution of variants in non-coding DNA elements that result in cryptic splicing and regulate gene expression has not been explored. We analyzed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data in a discovery cohort of 209 pediatric CMP patients and 1953 independent replication genomes and exomes. We searched for protein-coding variants, and non-coding variants predicted to affect the function or expression of genes. Thirty-nine percent of cases harbored pathogenic coding variants in known CMP genes, and 5% harbored high-risk loss-of-function (LoF) variants in additional candidate CMP genes. Fifteen percent harbored high-risk regulatory variants in promoters and enhancers of CMP genes (odds ratio 2.25, p = 6.70 × 10-7versus controls). Genes involved in α-dystroglycan glycosylation (FKTN, DTNA) and desmosomal signaling (DSC2, DSG2) were most highly enriched for regulatory variants (odds ratio 6.7-58.1). Functional effects were confirmed in patient myocardium and reporter assays in human cardiomyocytes, and in zebrafish CRISPR knockouts. We provide strong evidence for the genomic contribution of functionally active variants in new genes and in regulatory elements of known CMP genes to early onset CMP.© 2022. The Author(s)."

Drug exposures taken from the National Survey of Drug Use and Health 2003-2017, response rate 74.1%. Federal seizure data provided cannabinoid exposure. US Census Bureau furnished income and ethnicity. Exposure dichotomized as highest v. lowest exposure quintiles. Data processed in R.Nineteen thousand eight hundred seventy-seven age-standardized cancer rates were returned. Based on these rates and state populations this equated to 51,623,922 cancer cases over an aggregated population 2003-2017 of 124,896,418,350. Fifteen cancers displayed elevated E-Values in the highest compared to the lowest quintiles of cannabidiol exposure, namely (in order): prostate, melanoma, Kaposi sarcoma, ovarian, bladder, colorectal, stomach, Hodgkins, esophagus, Non-Hodgkins lymphoma, All cancer, brain, lung, CLL and breast. Eleven cancers were elevated in the highest THC exposure quintile: melanoma, thyroid, liver, AML, ALL, pancreas, myeloma, CML, breast, oropharynx and stomach. Twelve cancers were elevated in the highest tobacco quintile confirming extant knowledge and study methodology. For cannabidiol RR declined from 1.397 (95%C.I. 1.392, 1.402), AFE declined from 28.40% (28.14, 28.66%), PAR declined from 15.3% (15.1, 15.5%) and minimum E-Values declined from 2.13.

For tobacco, THC and cannabidiol based on AFE this implies an excess of 93,860, 91,677 and 48,510 cases; based on PAR data imply an excess of 36,450, 55,780 and 14,819 cases.Data implicate 23/28 cancers as being linked with THC or cannabidiol exposure with epidemiologically-causal relationships comparable to those for tobacco. AFE-attributable cases for cannabinoids (91,677 and 48,510) compare with PAR-attributable cases for tobacco (36,450). Cannabinoids constitute an important multivalent community carcinogen.© 2022.

However, the mechanism and functions of HIF3A, one of three HIFA paralogs, in fat deposition have not been sufficiently studied.In the present study, we investigated whether Hif3a sequence variants are associated with divergent fat deposition in mouse selection lines for fatness and leanness. Sequencing and RFLP were used to analyse sequence variants within Hif3a. To identify candidate regulatory variants, we performed literature screening and used databases and bioinformatics tools like Ensembl, MethPrimer, TargetScanMouse, miRDB, PolyAsite, RISE, LncRRIsearch, RNAfold, PredictProtein, CAIcal, and switches.ELM Resource. There are 90 sequence variants in Hif3a between the two mouse lines. While most Fat line variants locate within intronic regions, Lean line variants are mainly in 3' UTR. We constructed a map of Hif3a potential regulatory regions and identified 39 regulatory variants by integrating data on constrained and regulatory elements, CpGs, and miRNAs and lncRNAs binding sites. Moreover, 3' UTR and two exonic variants may influence mRNA stability, translation rate and protein functionality. We propose as priority candidates for further functional studies a missense (rs37398126) and synonymous (rs37739792) variants, and intronic (rs47471302) variant that overlap conserved element in promoter region and predicted lncRNAs binding site.The results indicate a potential involvement of Hif3a in fat deposition.

"35347248","Dihydroartemisinin suppresses renal fibrosis in mice by inhibiting DNA-methyltransferase 1 and increasing Klotho.","Acta Pharmacol Sin","Renal fibrosis is an unavoidable end result of all forms of progressive chronic kidney diseases (CKD). Discovery of efficacious drugs against renal fibrosis is in crucial need. In a preliminary study we found that a derivative of artemisinin, dihydroartemisinin (DHA), exerted strong renoprotection, and reversed renal fibrosis in adenine-induced CKD mouse model. In this study we investigated the anti-fibrotic mechanisms of DHA, particularly its specific target in renal cells. Renal fibrosis was induced in mice by unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) or oral administration of adenine (80 mg · kg-1), the mice received DHA (30 mg · kg-1 · d-1, i.g.) for 14 or 21 days, respectively. We showed that DHA administration markedly attenuated the inflammation and fibrotic responses in the kidneys and significantly improved the renal function in both the renal fibrosis mouse models. In adenine-treated mice, DHA was more effective than 5-azacytidine against renal fibrosis. The anti-fibrotic effects of DHA were also observed in TGF-β1-treated HK-2 cells. In order to determine the target protein of DHA, we conducted pull-down technology coupled with shotgun proteomics using a small-molecule probe based on the structure of DHA (biotin-DHA). As a results, DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) was identified as the anti-fibrotic target of DHA in 3 different types of renal cell lines (HK-2, HEK293 and 3T3). We demonstrated that DHA directly bound to Asn 1529 and Thr 1528 of DNMT1 with a Kd value of 8.18 μM. In primary mouse renal tubular cells, we showed that DHA (10 μM) promoted DNMT1 degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. DHA-reduced DNMT1 expression effectively reversed Klotho promoter hypermethylation, which led to the reversal of Klotho protein loss in the kidney of UUO mice. This subsequently resulted in inhibition of the Wnt/β-catenin and TGF-β/Smad signaling pathways and consequently conferred renoprotection in the animals. Knockdown of Klotho abolished the renoprotective effect of DHA in UUO mice. Our study reveals a novel pharmacological activity for DHA, i.e., renoprotection. DHA exhibits this effect by targeting DNMT1 to reverse Klotho repression. This study provides an evidence for the possible clinical application of DHA in the treatment of renal fibrosis.© 2022.

One of the promising therapeutic options can focus on MSC-secreted exosomes (MSC-Exo), which have been identified as a type of paracrine interaction. In light of a wide variety of recent experimental studies, the present review aims to seek the recent research advances of therapies based on the MSC-Exo for treating UC and colorectal cancer (CRC).A systematic literature search in MEDLINE, Scopus, and Google Scholar was performed from inception to December 2021 using the terms [(""colorectal cancer"" OR ""bowel cancer"" OR ""colon cancer"" OR ""rectal cancer"") AND (exosome) AND (stem cell) AND (""inflammatory bowel disease"" OR ""Crohn's disease"" OR ""colitis"")] in titles and abstracts.Exosomes derived from various sources of MSCs, including human umbilical cord-derived MSCs (hUC-MSCs), human adipose-derived MSCs (hAD-MSCs), human bone marrow-derived MSCs (hBM-MSCs), and olfactory ecto-MSCs (OE-MSCs), have shown the protective role against UC and CRC. Exosomes from hUC-MSCs, hBM-MSCs, AD-MSCs, and OE-MSCs have been found to ameliorate the experimental UC through suppressing inflammatory cells including macrophages, Th1/Th17 cells, reducing the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, as well as inducing the anti-inflammatory function of Treg and Th2 cells and enhancing the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines. In addition, hBM-MSC-Exo and hUC-MSC-Exo containing tumor-suppressive miRs (miR-3940-5p/miR-22-3p/miR-16-5p) have been shown to suppress proliferation, migration, and invasion of CRC cells via regulation of RAP2B/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and ITGA2/ITGA6.The MSC-Exo can exert beneficial effects on UC and CRC through two different mechanisms including modulating immune responses and inducing anti-tumor responses, respectively.© 2022.

"35379840","Biosynthesis of S-adenosyl-methionine enhances aging-related defects in Drosophila oogenesis.","Sci Rep","Tissue aging is a major cause of aging-related disabilities and a shortened life span. Understanding how tissue aging progresses and identifying the factors underlying tissue aging are crucial; however, the mechanism of tissue aging is not fully understood. Here we show that the biosynthesis of S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM), the major cellular donor of methyl group for methylation modifications, potently accelerates the aging-related defects during Drosophila oogenesis. An aging-related increase in the SAM-synthetase (Sam-S) levels in the germline leads to an increase in ovarian SAM levels. Sam-S-dependent biosynthesis of SAM controls aging-related defects in oogenesis through two mechanisms, decreasing the ability to maintain germline stem cells and accelerating the improper formation of egg chambers. Aging-related increases in SAM commonly occur in mouse reproductive tissue and the brain. Therefore, our results raise the possibility suggesting that SAM is the factor related to tissue aging beyond the species and tissues.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35328771","Impact of Endocrine Disruptors upon Non-Genetic Inheritance.","Int J Mol Sci","Similar to environmental factors, EDCs (endocrine-disrupting chemicals) can influence gene expression without modifying the DNA sequence. It is commonly accepted that the transgenerational inheritance of parentally acquired traits is conveyed by epigenetic alterations also known as ""epimutations"". DNA methylation, acetylation, histone modification, RNA-mediated effects and extracellular vesicle effects are the mechanisms that have been described so far to be responsible for these epimutations. They may lead to the transgenerational inheritance of diverse phenotypes in the progeny when they occur in the germ cells of an affected individual. While EDC-induced health effects have dramatically increased over the past decade, limited effects on sperm epigenetics have been described. However, there has been a gain of interest in this issue in recent years. The gametes (sperm and oocyte) represent targets for EDCs and thus a route for environmentally induced changes over several generations. This review aims at providing an overview of the epigenetic mechanisms that might be implicated in this transgenerational inheritance."

While the established native physiological activity of PONs is its lactonase activity, the enzymes' exact physiological substrates continue to be elucidated. All three PONs have antioxidant potential and play an important anti-atherosclerotic role in several diseases including cardiovascular diseases. PON3 is the last member of the family to be discovered and is also the least studied of the three genes. Unlike the other isoforms that have been reviewed extensively, there is a paucity of knowledge regarding PON3. Thus, the current review focuses on PON3 and summarizes the PON substrates, specific activities, kinetic parameters, and their association with cardiovascular as well as other diseases such as HIV and cancer."

The main aim of this study was to identify ATP11A, which is associated with the biological behavior of pancreatic cancer, and elucidate its relationship with Numb and the underlying mechanism behind this relationship.First, data retrieved from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEX) databases was used to investigate the expression of ATP11A mRNA and its relationship with Numb mRNA in pancreatic cancer. Western blot assays on 31 pairs of pancreatic cancer tissues and paracancerous tissues, and immunohistochemical assays on 81 pancreatic cancer specimens were performed in order to verify the expression of ATP11A in pancreatic cancer at the protein level. Next, ATP11A was overexpressed or knocked down to observe its effects on the invasion and migration ability of pancreatic cancer cells and the changes of downstream proteins. Rescue assays were conducted to determine the mechanism through which ATP11A affects Numb, ZEB1, Snail2 and other proteins. Furthermore, immunoprecipitation assays were performed to explore the interaction between ATP11A and Numb. Finally, pancreatic cancer cells were stimulated with TGFB1 and ATP11A expression was examined to explore whether the effect of ATP11A on EMT was TGFB dependent.At the mRNA level, the expression of ATP11A in pancreatic cancer tissues was significantly higher than in normal pancreatic tissues (P< 0.001). ATP11A expression was also highly correlated with Numb expression (R = 0.676). At the protein level, ATP11A expression in pancreatic cancer tissues was significantly higher than that in paracancerous tissues (P= 0.0009), and high ATP11A expression was also correlated with a worse prognosis. Moreover, our results showed that ATP11A can promote the invasion and migration of pancreatic cancer cells. Additionally, ATP11A could positively regulate the expression of Numb PRRL, Snail2 and ZEB1 proteins. The rescue experiment results showed that the enhancement effect of ATP11A on ZEB1/Snail2 was suppressed by the specific knockdown of Numb PRRL. In addition, the immunoprecipitation results showed that ATP11A could specifically bind to Numb PRRL. The expression of ATP11A was also upregulated after TGFB stimulation, suggesting that the effect of ATP11A on EMT is TGFB dependent.ATP11A is significantly upregulated in pancreatic cancer tissues, where it promotes the invasion and migration ability of pancreatic cancer cells. It is also associated with adverse prognosis in pancreatic cancer. Furthermore, ATP11A affects the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of pancreatic cancer by regulating the TGFB dependent Numb PRRL-ZEB1/Snail2 pathway.© 2022 Chen et al."
"35380397","Early Adverse Childhood Experiences and Social Skills Among Youth in Fragile Families.","J Youth Adolesc","Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are associated with negative health and behavioral outcomes across the life course, yet little is known about the association between early ACEs and social skills among youth. As social skills are often shaped by home environments, and social skills developed in adolescence often persist into adulthood, understanding the processes that drive inequalities in developmental outcomes, such as social skills, is imperative. The present study used data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (FFCW; n = 3245) and ordinary least squares regression analyses to explore the associations between early ACEs by age 5 (i.e., cumulative, timing, duration) and youth social skills (components include: emotional maturity, communication skills, intentionality, and social competence). The weighted sample consisted of urban-born youth (44% female) with a mean age of 15. Racial/ethnic breakdown of the sample is 37% non-Hispanic White, 25% non-Hispanic Black, 28% Hispanic, and 10% 'Other'. Overall, estimates suggest that nearly 79% of these youth experienced at least one ACE by age 5. Furthermore, the results indicated that as the number of early ACEs increased, deficits in social skills also increased. Moreover, the timing of exposure to early ACEs (i.e., high early, intermittent, chronic high) decreased social skills. The findings underscore the unique and robust links between early ACEs and youth social skills, underlining the importance of ACE exposure in social skill development.© 2022.

All study subjects were sequentially divided into four groups based on paternal BMI. We compared the differences in fetal growth and pregnancy complications between different paternal BMI groups by univariate logistic regression and independent t-test. Finally, the independent predictors of SGA and macrosomia were determined.The incidences of preeclampsia, cesarean section, SGA, macrosomia, and postpartum hemorrhage in the paternal obesity group were significantly higher than the normal BMI group. With the increase of paternal BMI, fetal ultrasound measurement parameter, neonatal and placental weight showed an increasing trend (trend P < 0.05). However, these differences disappeared in the obese group. The test for interaction showed the effect of paternal obesity on SGA and macrosomia was significantly affected by maternal obesity. We also found paternal obesity was an independent predictor of both SGA and macrosomia. Based on the above results, we plotted the Nomograms for clinical prediction.Paternal obesity can affect fetal growth parameters and placental development, which has an adverse impact on pregnancy outcomes. Optimizing the paternal BMI will help improve the health of the next generation.Copyright © 2022 Lin, Gu and Huang."
"35327396","Drug-Targeted Genomes: Mutability of Ion Channels and GPCRs.","Biomedicines","Mutations of ion channels and G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are not uncommon and can lead to cardiovascular diseases. Given previously reported multiple factors associated with high mutation rates, we sorted the relative mutability of multiple human genes by (i) proximity to telomeres and/or (ii) high adenine and thymine (A+T) content. We extracted genomic information using the genome data viewer and examined the mutability of 118 ion channel and 143 GPCR genes based on their association with factors (i) and (ii). We then assessed these two factors with 31 genes encoding ion channels or GPCRs that are targeted by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs. Out of the 118 ion channel genes studied, 80 met either factor (i) or (ii), resulting in a 68% match. In contrast, a 78% match was found for the 143 GPCR genes. We also found that the GPCR genes (n= 20) targeted by FDA-approved drugs have a relatively lower mutability than those genes encoding ion channels (n= 11), where targeted genes encoding GPCRs were shorter in length. The result of this study suggests that the use of matching rate analysis on factor-druggable genome is feasible to systematically compare the relative mutability of GPCRs and ion channels. The analysis on chromosomes by two factors identified a unique characteristic of GPCRs, which have a significant relationship between their nucleotide sizes and proximity to telomeres, unlike most genetic loci susceptible to human diseases."
"35323213","Genetic and Epigenetic Inheritance at Telomeres.","Epigenomes","Transgenerational inheritance can occur at telomeres in distinct contexts. Deficiency for telomerase or telomere-binding proteins in germ cells can result in shortened or lengthened chromosome termini that are transmitted to progeny. In human families, altered telomere lengths can result in stem cell dysfunction or tumor development. Genetic inheritance of altered telomeres as well as mutations that alter telomeres can result in progressive telomere length changes over multiple generations. Telomeres of yeast can modulate the epigenetic state of subtelomeric genes in a manner that is mitotically heritable, and the effects of telomeres on subtelomeric gene expression may be relevant to senescence or other human adult-onset disorders. Recently, two novel epigenetic states were shown to occur atC. eleganstelomeres, where very low or high levels of telomeric protein foci can be inherited for multiple generations through a process that is regulated by histone methylation.Together, these observations illustrate that information relevant to telomere biology can be inherited via genetic and epigenetic mechanisms, although the broad impact of epigenetic inheritance to human biology remains unclear."

How to evaluate such heterogeneity and its impact on outcome and drug response is still unclear. Here, we transcriptionally profile 35,276 individual cells from 32 breast cancer cell lines to yield a single cell atlas. We find high degree of heterogeneity in the expression of biomarkers. We then train a deconvolution algorithm on the atlas to determine cell line composition from bulk gene expression profiles of tumour biopsies, thus enabling cell line-based patient stratification. Finally, we link results from large-scale in vitro drug screening in cell lines to the single cell data to computationally predict drug responses starting from single-cell profiles. We find that transcriptional heterogeneity enables cells with differential drug sensitivity to co-exist in the same population.

"35361119","classifieR a flexible interactive cloud-application for functional annotation of cancer transcriptomes.","BMC Bioinformatics","Transcriptionally informed predictions are increasingly important for sub-typing cancer patients, understanding underlying biology and to inform novel treatment strategies. For instance, colorectal cancers (CRCs) can be classified into four CRC consensus molecular subgroups (CMS) or five intrinsic (CRIS) sub-types that have prognostic and predictive value. Breast cancer (BRCA) has five PAM50 molecular subgroups with similar value, and the OncotypeDX test provides transcriptomic based clinically actionable treatment-risk stratification. However, assigning samples to these subtypes and other transcriptionally inferred predictions is time consuming and requires significant bioinformatics experience. There is no ""universal"" method of using data from diverse assay/sequencing platforms to provide subgroup classification using the established classifier sets of genes (CMS, CRIS, PAM50, OncotypeDX), nor one which in provides additional useful functional annotations such as cellular composition, single-sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, or prediction of transcription factor activity.To address this bottleneck, we developed classifieR, an easy-to-use R-Shiny based web application that supports flexible rapid single sample annotation of transcriptional profiles derived from cancer patient samples form diverse platforms. We demonstrate the utility of the "" classifieR"" framework to applications focused on the analysis of transcriptional profiles from colorectal (classifieRc) and breast (classifieRb).

The Oncomine, Human Protein Atlas, Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis, Broad Institute Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia, Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas, OmicShare, cBioPortal, GeneMANIA, STRING, and TIMER databases were utilized to analyze the differential expression, prognostic value, and genetic alteration of HDAC and immune cell infiltration in patients with glioma.HDAC1/2were considerable upregulated whereas HDAC11 was significantly downregulated in cancer tissues.HDAC1/2/3/4/5/7/8/11were significantly correlated with the clinical glioma stage.HDAC1/2/3/10were strongly upregulated in 11 glioma cell lines. HighHDCA1/3/7and lowHDAC4/5/11mRNA levels were significantly associated with overall survival and disease-free survival in glioma.HDAC1/2/3/4/5/7/9/10/11are potential useful biomarkers for predicting the survival of patients with glioma. The functions of HDACs and 50 neighboring genes were primarily related to transcriptional dysregulation in cancers and the Notch, cGMP-PKG, and thyroid hormone signaling pathways.

"35359411","Transcriptomics Reveals the Mevalonate and Cholesterol Pathways Blocking as Part of the Bacterial Cyclodipeptides Cytotoxic Effects in HeLa Cells of Human Cervix Adenocarcinoma.","Front Oncol","The incidence of human cervix adenocarcinoma (CC) caused by papillomavirus genome integration into the host chromosome is the third most common cancer among women. Bacterial cyclodipeptides (CDPs) exert cytotoxic effects in human cervical cancer HeLa cells, primarily by blocking the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, but downstream responses comprising gene expression remain unstudied. Seeking to understand the cytotoxic and anti-proliferative effects of CDPs in HeLa cells, a global RNA-Seq analysis was performed. This strategy permitted the identification of 151 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), which were either up- or down-regulated in response to CDPs exposure. Database analysis, including Gene Ontology (COG), and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), revealed differential gene expression on cancer transduction signals, and metabolic pathways, for which, expression profiles were modified by the CDPs exposure. Bioinformatics confirmed the impact of CDPs in the differential expression of genes from signal transduction pathways such as PI3K-Akt, mTOR, FoxO, Wnt, MAPK, P53, TGF-β, Notch, apoptosis, EMT, and CSC. Additionally, the CDPs exposure modified the expression of cancer-related transcription factors involved in the regulation of processes such as epigenetics, DNA splicing, and damage response. Interestingly, transcriptomic analysis revealed the participation of genes of the mevalonate and cholesterol biosynthesis pathways; in agreement with this observation, total cholesterol diminished, confirming the blockage of the cholesterol synthesis by the exposure of HeLa cells to CDPs. Interestingly, the expression of some genes of the mevalonate and cholesterol synthesis such asHMGS1,HMGCR,IDI1,SQLE,MSMO1,SREBF1, andSOAT1was up-regulated by CDPs exposure. Accordingly, metabolites of the mevalonate pathway were accumulated in cultures treated with CDPs. This finding further suggests that the metabolism of cholesterol is crucial for the occurrence of CC, and the blockade of the sterol synthesis as an anti-proliferative mechanism of the bacterial CDPs, represents a reasonable chemotherapeutic drug target to explore. Our transcriptomic study supports the anti-neoplastic effects of bacterial CDPs in HeLa cells shown previously, providing new insights into the transduction signals, transcription factors and metabolic pathways, such as mevalonate and cholesterol that are impacted by the CDPs and highlights its potential as anti-neoplastic drugs.Copyright © 2022 Lázaro-Mixteco, González-Coronel, Hernández-Padilla, Martínez-Alcantar, Martínez-Carranza, López-Bucio, Guevara-García and Campos-García."

Then, the ClusterProfiler package was used to analyse the Gene Ontology and pathway enrichment of DEGs. Cytoscape was used to build a protein interaction network (PPI) and identify key genes. The GEPIA2 and TIMER databases were used to validate the differential expression of LAMC1. The relationship between LAMC1 and the prognosis of GC was analysed by the KM. GSEA and GSVA were used to analyse the major activated and mutated pathways, respectively. Real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was used to reidentify the expression of LAMC1 in GES-1 and 5 GC cell lines. Finally, we explored the relationship between LAMC1 and FGFR1.A total of 266 DEGs were be selected, which were mainly enriched in extracellular structure organization. LAMC1 was identified as one of the hub genes. The expression of LAMC1 was significantly higher in GC tissue than in paracancerous tissues, and the prognosis of the GC patient with high expression of LAMC1 was relatively poor. Univariate and multivariate Cox analysis indicated that LAMC1 could be used as an independent prognostic indicator. The results of GSEA and GSVA showed that LAMC1 was mainly enriched in pathways such as MYOGENESIS and UV_RESPONSE_DN. The RT-qPCR results showed that the expression level in AGS cells was significantly higher than that in gastric epithelial cells.

Then, we selected four genes, BUB1B, RRM2, ASF1B and CCNB2, as the potential drug targets based on the topology analysis of modules. Further, we repurposed three most effective drugs for each target by applying the proposed drug repositioning approach.

It remains unclear how PDAC can escape autodigestion by digestive enzymes. Here we show that human PDAC tumour cells use gasdermin E (GSDME), a pore-forming protein, to mediate digestive resistance. GSDME facilitates the tumour cells to express mucin 1 and mucin 13, which form a barrier to prevent chymotrypsin-mediated destruction. Inoculation of GSDME-/-PDAC cells results in subcutaneous but not orthotopic tumour formation in mice. Inhibition or knockout of mucin 1 or mucin 13 abrogates orthotopic PDAC growth in NOD-SCID mice. Mechanistically, GSDME interacts with and transports YBX1 into the nucleus where YBX1 directly promotes mucin expression. This GSDME-YBX1-mucin axis is also confirmed in patients with PDAC. These findings uncover a unique survival mechanism of PDAC cells in pancreatic microenvironments.© 2022. The Author(s)."

In this study, we directly investigate the root cause of ALS by examining the changes in gene expression in motor neurons that degenerate in patients. Co-expression networks identified in ALS patients' spinal cord motor neurons revealed 610 switch genes in seven independent microarrays. Switch genes were enriched in several pathways, including viral carcinogenesis, PI3K-Akt, focal adhesion, proteoglycans in cancer, colorectal cancer, and thyroid hormone signaling. Transcription factors ELK1 and GATA2 were identified as key master regulators of the switch genes. Protein-chemical network analysis identified valproic acid, cyclosporine, estradiol, acetaminophen, quercetin, and carbamazepine as potential therapeutics for ALS. Furthermore, the chemical analysis identified metals and organic compounds including, arsenic, copper, nickel, and benzo(a)pyrene as possible mediators of neurodegeneration.

This study investigated whether OCM related genetic variants modified the associations of folate and B12with GDM. Logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) for OCM related nutrients and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes encoding main OCM related enzymes (MTHFR,MTR, andMTRR) on GDM. Higher folate concentrations were associated with increased GDM risk (OR: 1.59; 95% CI: 1.22, 2.13). However, higher B12concentrations were associated with reduced GDM risk (OR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.65, 0.92). Pregnancies withMTHFRrs1801131 G alleles had a significantly lower risk of GDM than pregnancies with T alleles (OR: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.47, 0.91) under the dominant model.

Like healthy stem cells, CSCs possess the ability to self-renew and differentiate. These stemness phenotypes of CSCs rely on multiple molecular cues, including signaling pathways (for example, WNT, Notch and Hedgehog), cell surface molecules that interact with cellular niche components, and microenvironmental interactions with immune cells. Despite the importance of understanding CSC biology, our knowledge of how neighboring immune and tumor cell populations collectively shape CSC stemness is incomplete. Here, we provide a systems biology perspective on the crucial roles of cellular population identification and dissection of cell regulatory states. By reviewing state-of-the-art single-cell technologies, we show how innovative systems-based analysis enables a deeper understanding of the stemness of the tumor niche and the influence of intratumoral cancer cell and immune cell compositions. We also summarize strategies for refining CSC systems biology, and the potential role of this approach in the development of improved anticancer treatments. Because CSCs are amenable to cellular transitions, we envision how systems pharmacology can become a major engine for discovery of novel targets and drug candidates that can modulate state transitions for tumor cell reprogramming. Our aim is to provide deeper insights into cancer stemness from a systems perspective.

Neonates from parturients with intrauterine infection are usually treated with antibiotics, but their gut microbiota and metabolome are seldom studied. In this study, we collected fecal samples from antibiotic-treated neonates of parturients with intrauterine infection (intrauterine infection group), parturients with non-intrauterine infection (antibiotic group), and untreated neonates of healthy parturients (control group). 16S rRNA gene sequencing and untargeted metabolomics analyses were performed. Our results revealed that the α-diversity of intrauterine infection group differed from that of control group. There were significant differences in β-diversity between intrauterine infection group and control group, between antibiotic group and the control group, but there was no difference between the intrauterine infection and antibiotic groups, implying that antibiotic use has an obvious effect on β-diversity and that the effects of intrauterine infection on β-diversity cannot be identified.Enterococcuswas more abundant in intrauterine infection and antibiotic groups than in control group. Gut metabolite differences in intrauterine infection group and antibiotic group (only in negative ion mode) from control group were observed, but no difference between intrauterine infection group and antibiotic group was observed. N-formyl-L-methionine was the most discriminant metabolite between intrauterine infection group and control group. Primary and secondary bile acid biosynthesis, bile secretion, and cholesterol metabolism pathways were altered, and the abundances of bile acids and bile salts were altered in intrauterine infection group compared with control group. Alterations in cholesterol metabolism, arginine biosynthesis and bile secretion pathways were observed both in intrauterine infection and antibiotic groups, which might be caused by the use of antibiotics. In conclusion, we provided a preliminary description of the gut microbiota and gut metabolites in antibiotics-treated neonates from intrauterine infection parturients. Our findings did not show intrauterine infection has a separate role in neonatal gut microbiota dysbiosis, while supporting the idea that antibiotics should be used with caution during neonatal therapy.Copyright © 2022 Li, Fu, Chen, Xu, Jing, Yang, Wan and Chen."

The potential regulatory networks of DEGs related to prognosis were analyzed by multi-omics data in the THCA. Logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards regression were utilized to construct the diagnosis and prognostic model of PTC. The performance of the diagnostic model was verified by bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of our cohort. The tumor immune microenvironment associated with the prognostic model was evaluated using multi-omics data. In addition, qRT-PCR was performed on tumor tissues and adjacent normal tissues of 20 patients to verify the expression levels of DEGs.The DEGs screened by scRNA-seq can distinguish between tumor and healthy samples. DEGs play different roles in the evolution from normal epithelial cells to malignant cells. Three DEGs ((FN1,CLU, andANXA1)) related to prognosis were filtered, which may be regulated by DNA methylation, RNA methylation (m6A) and upstream transcription factors. The area under curve (AUC) of the diagnostic model based on 3-gene in the validation of our RNA-seq was 1. In the prognostic model based on 3-gene, the overall survival (OS) of high-risk patients was shorter. Combined with the clinical information of patients, a nomogram was constructed by using tumor size (pT) and risk score to quantify the prognostic risk.

"35350563","Bioinformatics Analysis Combined With Experiments Predicts PUDP as a Potential Prognostic Biomarker for Hepatocellular Carcinoma Through Its Interaction With Tumor Microenvironment.","Front Oncol","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the deadliest tumors in the world and is notorious for poor prognosis. There is mounting evidence that pseudouridine performs key functions in the initiation and progression of several cancers. A previous study demonstrated that Pseudouridine 5'-phosphatase (PUDP) may be a novel prognostic biomarker in colorectal cancer. However, in the past, we have paid little attention to PUDP and we are still not clear about its function and role in cancer. In this study, a pan-cancer analysis of PUDP expression and prognosis was performed firstly using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) data and we found that PUDP may be a potential oncogene for HCC. Then the most potential upstream microRNA contributing to PUDP was identified as let-7c-5p through expression analysis, correlation analysis, and survival analysis. Subsequently, the result of single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) demonstrated that PUDP was significantly highly expressed on malignant cells. In addition, there are significantly positive correlations between PUDP and tumor immune cell infiltration, biomarkers of immune cells, and immune checkpoint expression, especially with tumor-promoting immune cells such as T cell regulatory (Treg), Myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC), cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF). Moreover, we found the methylation level of three loci was positively correlated with PUDP expression and four loci were negatively correlated. 15 pairs of HCC and normal adjacent tissues from HCC patients who were treated at our center were used to verify the results of the bioinformatics analysis and the results of experiments are similar to the bioinformatics analysis. Our study demonstrated that HCC patients with high PUDP expression are less likely to benefit from immunotherapy, and in addition, we explored the relationship between PUDP and anticancer drugs. Finally, we explored the clinical relevance of PUDP, identified PUDP as an independent risk factor for HCC patients and constructed a prognostic model, used International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) data to do external validation. Collectively, our study demonstrated that high expression of PUDP suggested a poor prognosis and low response to immunotherapy, providing new insight into the treatment and prognosis of HCC.Copyright © 2022 Yu, Zhang, Ding, Hu, Guo, Wang and Han."
"35372062","MD2 Is a Potential Biomarker Associated with Immune Cell Infiltration in Gliomas.","Front Oncol","Glioma is the most common primary malignant tumor in the central nervous system. Myeloid differentiation protein 2 (MD2) acts as a coreceptor of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) to mediate innate immune response. However, the actual roles of MD2 in the regulation of progression and immune cell infiltration in gliomas remain largely unclear. This study aims to explore whether MD2 could be an independent prognostic factor through the mediation of immune cell infiltration in gliomas.The mRNA expression and DNA methylation differential analyses of MD2 were performed using CGGA, TCGA and Rembrandt databases and survival analyses were performed using Kaplan-Meier plotter. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression was applied to analyze the prognostic value of MD2 and nomograms were constructed to evaluate the clinical value of MD2. Then, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) were utilized to analyze MD2-related signal pathways. Furthermore, correlations between MD2 and immune cell infiltration were calculated by TIMER and CIBERSOPT. The correlation between MD2 expression and the infiltrations of macrophages and neutrophils was experimentally verified by the knockdown of MD2 expression using small interfering RNA (siRNA) in glioma cells.We found that MD2 was overexpressed and associated with a poor prognosis in gliomas. Meanwhile, higher expression of MD2 could be a result of lower DNA methylation ofMD2gene in gliomas. In addition, univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that MD2 could be an independent prognostic factor for gliomas. Further functional enrichment analysis revealed that the functions of MD2 were closely related to immune responses. Moreover, the expression level of MD2 was strongly correlated with the infiltration and polarization of pro-tumor phenotype of tumor-associated macrophages and tumor-associated neutrophils in gliomas.These findings have provided strong evidence that MD2 could be served as a valuable immune-related biomarker to diagnose and predict the progression of gliomas.Copyright © 2022 Zhao, Li, Chen and Wang."

Methylation is an epigenetic modification that regulates the expression and roles of DNA and coding RNA and their interactions, as well as of noncoding RNA molecules. Previous studies have focused on the effects of methylation modification on circRNA expression, transport, stability, translation and degradation of circRNAs, as well as how circRNA methylation occurs and the influence of circRNAs on methylation modification processes. circRNA and methylation can also regulate disease pathogenesis via these interactions.

Each protein-coding unit has the structure of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) and can be represented as a Bayesian network. The factorization of the joint probability distribution induced by the DAGs imposes a number of conditional independence relationships among the variables forming a protein-coding unit, corresponding to the missing edges in the DAGs. We show that a large fraction of these conditional independencies are indeed verified by the data. Factors driving this verification appear to be the structural and functional annotation of the transcript isoforms, as well as a notion of structural balance (or frustration-free) of the corresponding sample correlation graph, which naturally leads to reduction of correlation (and hence to independence) upon conditioning.© 2022 The Author(s)."

The main function of tau is to promote the assembly of microtubules and stabilize their structure. After a long period of research on neurodegenerative diseases, the function and dysfunction of the microtubule-associated protein tau in neurodegenerative diseases and tau neurotoxicity have attracted increasing attention. Tauopathies are a series of progressive neurodegenerative diseases caused by pathological changes in tau, such as abnormal phosphorylation. The pathological features of tauopathies are the deposition of abnormally phosphorylated tau proteins and the aggregation of tau proteins in neurons. This article first describes the normal physiological function and dysfunction of tau proteins and then discusses the enzymes and proteins involved in tau phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, the role of tau in cell dysfunction, and the relationships between tau and several neurodegenerative diseases. The study of tau neurotoxicity provides new directions for the treatment of tauopathies.© 2022.

Research on the relationship between breakfast consumption frequency and dyslipidemia in the working population is lacking. Therefore, we aimed to investigate this relationship based on a retrospective cohort study of a large working population in China.This retrospective cohort study used data from the physical examinations and questionnaire survey of working participants at Nanfang Hospital from January 20, 2015 to October 16, 2020. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to explore the relationship between breakfast consumption frequency and dyslipidemia in this working population (n = 7644).The prevalence of dyslipidemia among the participants was 26.4%. The univariate logistic regression test showed that the breakfast consumption frequency was inversely correlated with dyslipidemia. After adjusting for multiple factors, such as sex, age, body mass index, hypertension, hyperuricaemia, diabetes, smoking status, alcohol consumption, education level, marital status, long-term exposure to kitchen oil fumes, attending business dinners, and sleep time, it was found that breakfast consumption remained inversely associated with dyslipidaemia. The odds ratio for daily breakfast consumption was 0.466 (95% confidence interval 0.283-0.770, P = 0.003). After adjusting for confounding factors, we found that the higher the frequency of breakfast consumption, the lower the odds ratios for hypertriglyceridaemia.This study demonstrated that breakfast consumption frequency was inversely correlated with dyslipidemia. The higher the frequency of breakfast, the lower the risk of hypertriglyceridaemia. This study provides a basis on which dietary suggestions for the working population and lifestyle guidance for patients with a clinical need to prevent dyslipidemia can be made.© 2022.

We measured these MRS from digitized film mammograms for 593 monozygotic (MZ) and 326 dizygotic (DZ) female twin pairs and 1592 of their sisters. We estimated the correlations in relatives (r) and the proportion of variance due to genetic factors (heritability) using the software FISHER and predicted the familial risk ratio (FRR) associated with each MRS. Theρestimates ranged from: 0.41 to 0.60 (standard error [SE] 0.02) for MZ pairs, 0.16 to 0.26 (SE 0.05) for DZ pairs, and 0.19 to 0.29 (SE 0.02) for sister pairs (including pairs of a twin and her non-twin sister), respectively. Heritability estimates were 39% to 69% under the classic twin model and 36% to 56% when allowing for shared non-genetic factors specific to MZ pairs. The FRRs were 1.08 to 1.17. These MRSs are substantially familial, due mostly to genetic factors that explain one-quarter to one-half as much of the familial aggregation of breast cancer that is explained by the current best polygenic risk score."

To investigate the immune basis and the functional dysregulation of monocytes in this disease, we analyzed gene expression in the peripheral monocytes of pediatric patients with OCD (N = 102) compared to controls (N = 47). We examined gene expression in primary cultures of peripheral monocytes from participants, under basal conditions and under exposure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to stimulate immune response. Whole-genome expression was assessed in 8 patients and 8 controls. Differentially expressed genes were identified followed by protein-protein interaction network construction and functional annotation analysis to identify the genes and biological processes that are altered in the monocytes of OCD patients. We also explored the expression levels of selected genes in monocytes from the other participants using qPCR. Several changes in gene expression were observed in the monocytes of OCD patients, with several immune processes involved under basal conditions (antigen processing and presentation, regulation of immune system and leukocyte cell adhesion) and after LPS stimulation (immune and inflammatory response, cytokine production and leukocyte activation). Despite the qPCR analysis provided no significant differences between patients and controls, high correlations were observed between the expression levels of some of the genes and inflammatory markers (i.e., T helper 17 and regulatory T cell levels, total monocyte and proinflammatory monocyte subset levels, and the cytokine production by resting and stimulated monocytes) of the study participants. Our findings provide more evidence of the involvement of monocyte dysregulation in early-onset OCD, indicating a proinflammatory predisposition and an enhanced immune response to environmental triggers.© 2022.

"35328018","Identification of Key Modules and Genes Associated with Major Depressive Disorder in Adolescents.","Genes (Basel)","Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of disability worldwide. Adolescence is a crucial period for the occurrence and development of depression. There are essential distinctions between adolescent and adult depression patients, and the etiology of depressive disorder is unclear. The interactions of multiple genes in a co-expression network are likely to be involved in the physiopathology of MDD. In the present study, RNA-Seq data of mRNA were acquired from the peripheral blood of MDD in adolescents and healthy control (HC) subjects. Co-expression modules were constructed via weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to investigate the relationships between the underlying modules and MDD in adolescents. In the combined MDD and HC groups, the dynamic tree cutting method was utilized to assign genes to modules through hierarchical clustering. Moreover, functional enrichment analysis was conducted on those co-expression genes from interested modules. The results showed that eight modules were constructed by WGCNA. The blue module was significantly associated with MDD after multiple comparison adjustment. Several Gene Ontology (GO) terms and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways associated with stress and inflammation were identified in this module, including histone methylation, apoptosis, NF-kappa β signaling pathway, and TNF signaling pathway. Five genes related to inflammation, immunity, and the nervous system were identified as hub genes:CNTNAP3,IL1RAP,MEGF9,UBE2W, andUBE2D1. All of these findings supported that MDD was associated with stress, inflammation, and immune responses, helping us to obtain a better understanding of the internal molecular mechanism and to explore biomarkers for the diagnosis or treatment of depression in adolescents."
"35348977","Therapeutic Potential of the Purinergic System in Major Depressive Disorder Associated with COVID-19.","Cell Mol Neurobiol","Neuroinflammation is closely related to the development of depression, since the latter is caused, among other factors, by inflammatory processes, mainly related to the activation of microglia and expression of specific genes, which occurs during the neuroinflammatory process. Thus, COVID-19 is an important risk factor for the development of depression, since in addition to generating the feeling of stress, which also increases the activity of the immune system, it is also the cause of pathological processes and physiological ones that lead to the development of neuroinflammation, microglial activation, gene expression dysfunction and decreased concentration of available serotonin. That said, drugs are being used to combat COVID-19 to reduce the oxidative stress presented in the disease. Thus, tramadol and fluoxetine are highlighted as drugs used, however, although they present some positive results, such as the reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, they are also associated with negative effects such as dependence, pulmonary, cardiac and brain impairment. From this, the purinergic system is highlighted in the literature as a possible therapeutic target. This is because its mechanisms are related to the regulation of microglia, astrocytes and the physiology of important neurotransmitters and hormones. Added to this, there is a modulation of inflammatory activity, especially with regard to the P2X7 receptors of this system. The latter is an important target for the treatment of depression and COVID-19, since positive results were obtained through the genetic exclusion of this receptor and the use of selective antagonists.© 2022.

Although clinical treatments of PCa have made great progress in recent decades, once tolerance to treatments occurs, the disease progresses rapidly after recurrence. PCa exhibits a unique metabolic rewriting that changes from initial neoplasia to advanced neoplasia. However, systematic and comprehensive studies on the relationship of changes in the metabolic landscape of PCa with tumor recurrence and treatment response are lacking. We aimed to construct a metabolism-related gene landscape that predicts PCa recurrence and treatment response.In the present study, we used differentially expressed gene analysis, protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks, univariate and multivariate Cox regression, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression to construct and verify a metabolism-related risk model (MRM) to predict the disease-free survival (DFS) and response to treatment for PCa patients.The MRM predicted patient survival more accurately than the current clinical prognostic indicators. By using two independent PCa datasets (International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) PCa and Taylor) and actual patients to test the model, we also confirmed that the metabolism-related risk score (MRS) was strongly related to PCa progression. Notably, patients in different MRS subgroups had significant differences in metabolic activity, mutant landscape, immune microenvironment, and drug sensitivity. Patients in the high-MRS group were more sensitive to immunotherapy and endocrine therapy, while patients in the low-MRS group were more sensitive to chemotherapy.We developed an MRM, which might act as a clinical feature to more accurately assess prognosis and guide the selection of appropriate treatment for PCa patients. It is promising for further application in clinical practice.Copyright © 2022 Zhou, Fan, Luo, Zhang, Jia, Wang, Zeng, Ren, Du, Pan, Yang, Tian and Gu."
"35342423","The Diagnostic and Prognostic Values of HOXA Gene Family in Kidney Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma.","J Oncol","Kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) is one of the most common cancers with high mortality worldwide. As members of the homeobox (HOX) family, homeobox-A (HOXA) genes have been reported to play an increasingly important role in tumorigenesis and the progression of multiple cancers. However, limited studies have investigated the potential diagnostic and prognostic roles of HOXA genes in KIRC. In this research, we explored the expression pattern of the HOXA gene family in KIRC progression by differential analysis of expression profiles from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). By using univariate Cox analysis and lasso regression analysis, we comprehensively evaluated the prognostic value of HOXA genes and eventually identified a prognostic risk model consisting of five HOXA genes (HOXA2, HOXA3, HOXA7, HOXA11, and HOXA13). The risk model was further validated as a novel independent prognostic factor for KIRC patients based on the calculated risk score by Kaplan-Meier analysis, univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses, and time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Moreover, to explore the potential mechanism of tumorigenesis and clinical application of KIRC, we also developed the HOXA-based competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) regulatory network and machine learning classification model. Valproic acid and tretinoin were predicted to be the most promising small molecules to adjuvant treatment of KIRC by mining the CMAP and DGIdb drug database. Subsequently, pathway and functional enrichment analyses provided us with new ways to search for a possible mechanism of action of drugs. Taken together, our study demonstrated the nonnegligible role of HOXA genes in KIRC and constructed an effective prognostic and diagnostic model, which offers novel insights into KIRC prognosis.Copyright © 2022 Xiaofang Zong et al."

PTSD has a prevalence of approximately 6-8% in the general population, although this can increase to 25% among groups who have experienced severe psychological trauma, such as combat veterans, refugees and victims of assault. The risk of developing PTSD in the aftermath of severe trauma is determined by multiple factors, including genetics - at least 30-40% of the risk of PTSD is heritable - and past history, for example, prior adult and childhood trauma. Many of the primary symptoms of PTSD, including hyperarousal and sleep dysregulation, are increasingly understood through translational neuroscience. In addition, a large amount of evidence suggests that PTSD can be viewed, at least in part, as a disorder that involves dysregulation of normal fear processes. The neural circuitry underlying fear and threat-related behaviour and learning in mammals, including the amygdala-hippocampus-medial prefrontal cortex circuit, is among the most well-understood in behavioural neuroscience. Furthermore, the study of threat-responding and its underlying circuitry has led to rapid progress in understanding learning and memory processes. By combining molecular-genetic approaches with a translational, mechanistic knowledge of fear circuitry, transformational advances in the conceptual framework, diagnosis and treatment of PTSD are possible. In this Review, we describe the clinical features and current treatments for PTSD, examine the neurobiology of symptom domains, highlight genomic advances and discuss translational approaches to understanding mechanisms and identifying new treatments and interventions for this devastating syndrome.© 2022.

However, the underpinning genetic heterogeneity of depression co-occurrence with LOAD, and the various genetic etiologies predisposing depression in LOAD, are largely unknown.Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics were used to create polygenic risk scores (PRS). The Religious Orders Society and Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP,n= 1,708) and National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC,n= 10,256) datasets served as discovery and validation cohorts, respectively, to assess the PRS performance in predicting depression onset in LOAD patients.The PRS showed marginal results in standalone models for predicting depression onset in both ROSMAP (AUC = 0.540) and NACC (AUC = 0.527). Full models, with baseline age, sex, education, andAPOEε4allele count, showed improved prediction of depression onset (ROSMAP AUC: 0.606, NACC AUC: 0.581). In time-to-event analysis, standalone PRS models showed significant effects in ROSMAP (P= 0.0051), but not in NACC cohort. Full models showed significant performance in predicting depression in LOAD for both datasets (P< 0.001 for all).This study provided new insights into the genetic factors contributing to depression onset in LOAD and advanced our knowledge of the genetics underlying the heterogeneity of depression in LOAD.

By promoting the activation of Rab5, RIN3 plays an important role in regulating endocytosis and endocytic trafficking. In addition, RIN3 activates Ras, another small GTPase, that controls multiple signaling pathways to regulate cellular function. Increasing evidence suggests that dysregulation of RIN3 activity may contribute to the pathogenesis of several disease conditions ranging from Paget's Disease of the Bone (PDB), Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and to obesity. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified variants in theRIN3gene to be linked with these disease conditions. Interestingly, some variants appear to be missense mutations in the functional domains of the RIN3 protein while most variants are located in the noncoding regions of theRIN3gene, potentially altering its gene expression. However, neither the protein structure of RIN3 nor its exact function(s) (except for its GEF activity) has been fully defined. Furthermore, how the polymorphisms/variants contribute to disease pathogenesis remain to be understood.

Research studies advocate to further sequence transcriptomes to directly and systematically probe gene expression defects. However, collection of additional biopsies and establishment of lab workflows, analytical pipelines, and defined concepts in clinical interpretation of aberrant gene expression are still needed for adopting RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) in routine diagnostics.We implemented an automated RNA-seq protocol and a computational workflow with which we analyzed skin fibroblasts of 303 individuals with a suspected mitochondrial disease that previously underwent WES. We also assessed through simulations how aberrant expression and mono-allelic expression tests depend on RNA-seq coverage.We detected on average 12,500 genes per sample including around 60% of all disease genes-a coverage substantially higher than with whole blood, supporting the use of skin biopsies. We prioritized genes demonstrating aberrant expression, aberrant splicing, or mono-allelic expression. The pipeline required less than 1 week from sample preparation to result reporting and provided a median of eight disease-associated genes per patient for inspection. A genetic diagnosis was established for 16% of the 205 WES-inconclusive cases. Detection of aberrant expression was a major contributor to diagnosis including instances of 50% reduction, which, together with mono-allelic expression, allowed for the diagnosis of dominant disorders caused by haploinsufficiency. Moreover, calling aberrant splicing and variants from RNA-seq data enabled detecting and validating splice-disrupting variants, of which the majority fell outside WES-covered regions.Together, these results show that streamlined experimental and computational processes can accelerate the implementation of RNA-seq in routine diagnostics.© 2022.

Although biological mechanisms underlying hypertension at the single omic level have been discovered, multi-omics integrative analyses using continuous variations in blood pressure values remain limited. We used a multi-omics regression-based method, called sparse multi-block partial least square, for integrative, explanatory, and predictive interests in study of systolic and diastolic blood pressure values. Various datasets were obtained from the Finnish Twin Cohort for up to 444 twins. Blocks of omics-including transcriptomic, methylation, metabolomic-data as well as polygenic risk scores and clinical data were integrated into the modeling and supported by cross-validation. The predictive contribution of each omics block when predicting blood pressure values was investigated using external participants from the Young Finns Study. In addition to revealing interesting inter-omics associations, we found that each block of omics heterogeneously improved the predictions of blood pressure values once the multi-omics data were integrated. The modeling revealed a plurality of clinical, transcriptomic, and metabolomic factors consistent with the literature and that play a leading role in explaining unit variations in blood pressure. These findings demonstrate (1) the robustness of our integrative method to harness results obtained by single omics discriminant analyses, and (2) the added value of predictive and exploratory gains of a multi-omics approach in studies of complex phenotypes such as blood pressure."

Telomere length (TL) and mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNAcn) have been proposed as markers of cellular aging and comparisons between individuals with BD and healthy controls (HC) sometimes led to conflicting results. Previous studies had moderate sample sizes and studies combining these two markers into a single analysis are scarce. Using quantitative polymerase chain reaction, we measured both TL and mtDNAcn in DNA (peripheral blood) in a sample of 130 individuals with BD and 78 HC. Regression analyses, receiver operating characteristic (ROC), and clustering analyses were performed. We observed significantly lower TL and mtDNAcn in individuals with BD as compared to HC (respective decrease of 26.5 and 35.8%). ROC analyses showed that TL and mtDNAcn highly discriminated groups (AUC = 0.904 for TL and AUC = 0.931 for mtDNAcn). In the whole population, clustering analyses identified a group of young individuals (age around 36 years), with accelerated cellular aging (both shorter TL and lower mtDNAcn), which consisted mostly of individuals with BD (85.5%). The subgroup of patients with young age but accelerated aging was not characterized by specific clinical variables related to the course of BD or childhood maltreatment. However, patients in this subgroup were more frequently treated with anticonvulsants. Further characterization of this subgroup is required to better understand the molecular mechanisms and the risk factors of accelerated cellular aging in BD.© 2022. The Author(s)."

Intriguingly, SMARCB1-deficient pediatric MRT and RMC have recently been reported to be immunogenic, despite their very simple genome and low tumor mutational burden. Responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors have further been reported in some SMARCB1-deficient diseases.

"35320835","How to Mitigate Risk of Premature Cardiovascular Disease Among Children and Adolescents with Mental Health Conditions.","Curr Atheroscler Rep","The goal of this article is to characterize the myriad of ways that children with mental health conditions can be at risk for premature cardiovascular disease (CVD) and various modalities to ameliorate this risk in childhood in order to improve the life course of these children.Child and adolescent mental health conditions are a common yet underrecognized risk factor for premature CVD. The American Heart Association has recently included psychiatric conditions as a CVD risk factor (CVDRF) and the evidence linking childhood adversity to cardiometabolic disease. There are bidirectional and additive effects from the intrinsic emotional dysregulation and inflammatory changes from the mental health condition, the associations with risky health behaviors, and in some cases, metabolic side effects from pharmacotherapy. These pathways can be potentiated by toxic stress, a physiologic response to stressors from childhood adversity. Toxic stress is also associated with development of mental health conditions with epigenetic effects that can result in transgenerational inheritance of cardiometabolic risk. Exposure to toxic stress and mental health conditions in isolation sometimes compounded by pharmacotherapies used in treatment increase the risk of cardiometabolic diseases in childhood. The multiple pathways, which adversely influence cardiometabolic outcomes, encourage clinicians to consider strategies to mitigate these factors and justify the importance of early screening and treatment for CVDRFs. Mental health, health behaviors, and environmental factors co-occur and intersect in complex pathways that can increase CVD risk over the lifespan. Early detection and response can mitigate the risks associated with premature development of CVD.© 2022.

The biofunctions of miR-1270 in apoptosis and proliferation of breast cancer cells were evaluated. Downstream target of miR-1270 was predicted and confirmed. The involvement of monocyte to macrophage differentiation associated 2 (MMD2) in BCa development was finally illustrated. miR-1270 was lowly expressed in BCa tissues. Lowly expressed miR-1270 was associated with tumor staging, larger tumor size, and also worse prognostic results in patients with BCa. miR-1270 overexpression suppressed proliferation and increased apoptotic rate of BCa cells. Further exploration showed that MMD2 might be the target of miR-1270. MMD2 was upregulated in BCa tissues and negatively correlated to miR-1270 level. Importantly, MMD2 significantly neutralized the above biofunctions of miR-1270 in malignant phenotypes of BCa. Lowly expressed miR-1270 is a hallmark of poor prognosis in patients with BCa. It inhibits proliferative ability and increases apoptosis in BCa by negatively regulating the MMD2 level.Copyright © 2022 Shaojun Hu et al."
"35327513","Stathmins and Motor Neuron Diseases: Pathophysiology and Therapeutic Targets.","Biomedicines","Motor neuron diseases (MNDs) are a group of fatal, neurodegenerative disorders with different etiology, clinical course and presentation, caused by the loss of upper and lower motor neurons (MNs). MNs are highly specialized cells equipped with long, axonal processes; axonal defects are some of the main players underlying the pathogenesis of these disorders. Microtubules are key components of the neuronal cytoskeleton characterized by dynamic instability, switching between rapid polymerization and shrinkage. Proteins of the stathmin family affect microtubule dynamics regulating the assembly and the dismantling of tubulin. Stathmin-2 (STMN2) is one of the most abundantly expressed genes in MNs. Following axonal injury, STMN2 expression is upregulated, and the protein is transported toward the growth cones of regenerating axons. STMN2 has a critical role in axonal maintenance, and its dysregulation plays an important role in neurodegenerative processes. Stathmin-1 (STMN1) is a ubiquitous protein that is highly expressed during the development of the nervous system, and its phosphorylation controls microtubule dynamics. In the present review, we summarize what is currently known about the involvement of stathmin alterations in MNDs and the potential therapeutic effect of their modulation, with a specific focus on the most common forms of MND, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA)."

A skewing of the XCI pattern may suggest a carrier status for an X-linked disease or explain the presence of a severe phenotype. In these cases, it is important to determine the XCI pattern, conventionally using the gold standard Human Androgen-Receptor Assay (HUMARA), based on the analysis of the methylation status at a polymorphic CAG region in the first exon of the human androgen receptor gene (AR). The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the methylation status of the fragile mental retardation protein translational regulator gene (FMR1) can provide an XCI pattern similar to that obtained by HUMARA. A set of 48 female carriers ofFMR1gene normal-sized alleles was examined using two assays: HUMARA and aFMR1methylation PCR (mPCR). Ranges were defined to establish the XCI pattern using the methylation pattern of theFMR1gene by mPCR. Overall, a 77% concordance of the XCI patterns was obtained between the two assays, which led us to propose a set of key points and a stepwise analysis towards obtaining an accurate result for the XCI pattern and to minimize the underlying pitfalls."
"35342607","Epigenetics underpins phenotypic plasticity of protandrous sex change in fish.","Ecol Evol","Phenotypic plasticity is an important driver of species resilience. Often mediated by epigenetic changes, phenotypic plasticity enables individual genotypes to express variable phenotypes in response to environmental change. Barramundi (Lates calcarifer) are a protandrous (male-first) sequential hermaphrodite that exhibits plasticity in length-at-sex change between geographic regions. This plasticity is likely to be mediated by changes in DNA methylation (DNAm), a well-studied epigenetic modification. To investigate the relationships between length, sex, and DNAm in a sequential hermaphrodite, here, we compare DNAm in four conserved vertebrate sex-determining genes in male and female barramundi of differing lengths from three geographic regions of northern Australia. Barramundi first mature as male and later sex change to female upon the attainment of a larger body size; however, a general pattern of increasing female-specific DNAm markers with increasing length was not observed. Significant differences in DNAm between males and females of similar lengths suggest that female-specific DNAm arises rapidly during sex change, rather than gradually with fish growth. The findings also reveal that region-specific differences in length-at-sex change are accompanied by differences in DNAm and are consistent with variability in remotely sensed sea temperature and salinity. Together, these findings provide the firstin situevidence for epigenetically and environmentally mediated sex change in a protandrous hermaphrodite and offer significant insight into the molecular and ecological processes governing the marked and unique plasticity of sex in fish.© 2022 The Authors.

Among them, gastric and pancreatic cancers have a dismal prognosis (survival of 5-20%) and are defined as difficult-to-treat cancers. This reflects the urge for novel therapeutic targets and aims for personalised therapies. As a prerequisite for identifying targets and test therapeutic interventions, the development of well-established, translational and reliable preclinical research models is instrumental. This review discusses the development, advantages and limitations of both patient-derived organoids (PDO) and patient-derived xenografts (PDX) for gastric and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). First and next generation multicellular PDO/PDX models are believed to faithfully generate a patient-specific avatar in a preclinical setting, opening novel therapeutic directions for these difficult-to-treat cancers. Excitingly, future opportunities such as PDO co-cultures with immune or stromal cells, organoid-on-a-chip models and humanised PDXs are the basis of a completely new area, offering close-to-human models. These tools can be exploited to understand cancer heterogeneity, which is indispensable to pave the way towards more tumour-specific therapies and, with that, better survival for patients."

The first ALS gene associated with the autosomal dominant form of the disease wasSOD1. This gene has a high rate of rare variants, and an appropriate classification is essential for a correct ALS diagnosis. In this study, we re-evaluated the classification of all previously reportedSOD1variants (n= 202) from ALSoD, project MinE, and in-house databases by applying the ACMG-AMP criteria to ALS. New bioinformatics analysis, frequency rating, and a thorough search for functional studies were performed. We also proposed adjusting criteria strength describing how to apply them toSOD1variants. Most of the previously reported variants have been reclassified as likely pathogenic and pathogenic based on the modified weight of the PS3 criterion, highlighting how in vivo or in vitro functional studies are determining their interpretation and classification. Furthermore, this study reveals the concordance and discordance of annotations between open databases, indicating the need for expert review to adapt the study of variants to a specific disease. Indeed, in complex diseases, such as ALS, the oligogenic inheritance, the presence of genes that act as risk factors and the reduced penetration must be considered. Overall, the diagnosis of ALS remains clinical, and improving variant classification could support genetic data as diagnostic criteria."

Today, computation implementation and vast patient data repositories can enable a concurrent analysis of personal, social, and environmental processes, providing insight into changes in health status transitions over time. We applied computational and data visualization techniques to categorize decade-long health records of 235,003 patients with TBI in Canada, from preceding injury to the injury event itself. Our results highlighted that health status transition patterns in TBI emerged along with the projection of comorbidity where many disorders, social and environmental adversities preceding injury are reflected in external causes of injury and injury severity. The strongest associations between health status preceding TBI and health status at the injury event were between multiple body system pathology and advanced age-related brain pathology networks. The interwoven aspects of health status on a time continuum can influence post-injury trajectories and should be considered in TBI risk analysis to improve prevention, diagnosis, and care.© 2022.

A plethora of evidence suggests that aberrant epigenetic signatures in breast cancer cells can result in differential responses to various chemotherapeutics and often leads to the development of resistant cancer cells. Such aberrant epigenetic changes are mostly dictated by the microenvironment. The local concentration of oxygen and metabolites in the microenvironment of breast cancer are known to influence the development of breast cancer. Hence, we hypothesized that 27-HC, an oxysterol, which has been shown to induce breast cancer progressionviaestrogen receptor alpha (ERα) and liver X receptor (LXR) and by modulating immune cells, may also induce epigenetic changes. For deciphering the same, we treated the estrogen receptor-positive cells with 27-HC and identified DNA hypermethylation on a subset of genes by performing DNA bisulfite sequencing. The genes that showed significant DNA hypermethylation werephosphatidylserine synthase 2 (PTDSS2), MIR613, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1), thyroid hormone receptor alpha (THRA), dystrotelin (DTYN),andmesoderm induction early response 1, family member 3 (MIER). Furthermore, we found that 27-HC weakens the DNMT3B association with the ERα in MCF-7 cells. This study reports that 27-HC induces aberrant DNA methylation changes on the promoters of a subset of genes through modulation of ERα and DNMT3B complexes to induce the local DNA methylation changes, which may dictate drug responses and breast cancer development.Copyright © 2022 Vini, Rajavelu and Sreeharshan."

In cell culture or rodent models of age-related neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), numerous studies have shown that astrocytes can adopt neurotoxic phenotypes that could enhance disease progression. Chronic inflammatory responses, oxidative stress, unbalanced phagocytosis, or alteration of their core physiological roles are the main manifestations of their detrimental states. However, if astrocytes are directly involved in brain deterioration by exerting neurotoxic functions in patients with NDDs is still controversial. The large spectrum of NDDs, with often overlapping pathologies, and the technical challenges associated with the study of human brain samples complexify the analysis of astrocyte involvement in specific neurodegenerative cascades. With this review, we aim to provide a translational overview about the multi-facets of astrocyte neurotoxicity ranging fromin vitrofindings over mouse and human cell-based studies to rodent NDDs research and finally evidence from patient-related research. We also discuss the role of ageing in astrocytes encompassing changes in physiology and response to pathologic stimuli and how this may prime detrimental responses in NDDs. To conclude, we discuss how potentially therapeutic strategies could be adopted to alleviate or reverse astrocytic toxicity and their potential to impact neurodegeneration and dementia progression in patients.Copyright © 2022 Bouvier, Fixemer, Heurtaux, Jeannelle, Frauenknecht and Mittelbronn."
"35271564","A copula based topology preserving graph convolution network for clustering of single-cell RNA-seq data.","PLoS Comput Biol","Annotation of cells in single-cell clustering requires a homogeneous grouping of cell populations. There are various issues in single cell sequencing that effect homogeneous grouping (clustering) of cells, such as small amount of starting RNA, limited per-cell sequenced reads, cell-to-cell variability due to cell-cycle, cellular morphology, and variable reagent concentrations. Moreover, single cell data is susceptible to technical noise, which affects the quality of genes (or features) selected/extracted prior to clustering. Here we introduce sc-CGconv (copula based graph convolution network for single clustering), a stepwise robust unsupervised feature extraction and clustering approach that formulates and aggregates cell-cell relationships using copula correlation (Ccor), followed by a graph convolution network based clustering approach. sc-CGconv formulates a cell-cell graph using Ccor that is learned by a graph-based artificial intelligence model, graph convolution network. The learned representation (low dimensional embedding) is utilized for cell clustering. sc-CGconv features the following advantages. a. sc-CGconv works with substantially smaller sample sizes to identify homogeneous clusters. b. sc-CGconv can model the expression co-variability of a large number of genes, thereby outperforming state-of-the-art gene selection/extraction methods for clustering. c. sc-CGconv preserves the cell-to-cell variability within the selected gene set by constructing a cell-cell graph through copula correlation measure. d. sc-CGconv provides a topology-preserving embedding of cells in low dimensional space."

Although remarkable therapeutic advances have been made during the last few years, there still exists a high residual risk of disease progression to end-stage renal failure. To further understand the pathogenesis of tissue injury in this disease, by means of the Next-Generation Sequencing, we have studied the microRNA (miRNA) differential expression pattern in kidneys of Black and Tan Brachyury (BTBR) ob/ob (leptin deficiency mutation) mouse. This experimental model of type 2 diabetes and obesity recapitulates the key histopathological features described in advanced human DN and therefore can provide potential useful translational information. The miRNA-seq analysis, performed in the renal cortex of 22-week-old BTBR ob/ob mice, pointed out a set of 99 miRNAs significantly increased compared to non-diabetic, non-obese control mice of the same age, whereas no miRNAs were significantly decreased. Among them, miR-802, miR-34a, miR-132, miR-101a, and mir-379 were the most upregulated ones in diabetic kidneys. Thein silicoprediction of potential targets for the 99 miRNAs highlighted inflammatory and immune processes, as the most relevant pathways, emphasizing the importance of inflammation in the pathogenesis of kidney damage associated to diabetes. Other identified top canonical pathways were adipogenesis (related with ectopic fatty accumulation), necroptosis (an inflammatory and regulated form of cell death), and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, the latter supporting the importance of tubular cell phenotype changes in the pathogenesis of DN.

Many pharmaceutical formulations screened from natural plant extracts offer safe, inexpensive, and multi-target therapeutic options. In this study, we demonstrated thatBerberis vulgarisL. (Berberine) andAndrographis paniculata(Burm. f.) Nees (Andrographis) extracts exerted their synergistic amplified anti-cancer effects by jointly inhibiting cell viability, suppressing colony formation, and inducing cell cycle arrest. Consistent with our in-vitro findings, the amplified synergistic anti-cancer effects were also observed in subcutaneous xenograft preclinical animal models, as well as patient-derived primary tumor organoids. To explore the molecular mechanisms underlying the amplified synergistic anti-cancer effects, RNA sequencing was performed to identify candidate pathways and genes. A transcriptome analysis revealed that DNA-replication-related genes, including FEN1, MCM7, PRIM1, MCM5, POLA1, MCM4, and PCNA, may be responsible for the enhanced anticancer effects of these two natural extracts. Taken together, our data revealed the powerful enhanced synergistic anti-CRC effects of berberine and Andrographis and provide evidence for the combinational targeting of DNA-replication-related genes as a promising new strategy for the therapeutic option in the management of CRC patients."

A 4-miRNA diagnostic model was developed from the lung cancer training set (n= 416, 208 lung cancer patients and 208 non-cancer participants). The model showed 99% sensitivity and specificity in the lung cancer validation set (n= 3328, 1358 cancer patients and 1970 non-cancer participants); and the sensitivity remained to be &gt;99% for patients with stage 1 disease. When applied to the additional combined dataset of 3792 participants including 2038 cancer patients across 12 different cancer types and 1754 independent non-cancer controls, the model demonstrated high sensitivities ranging from 83.2 to 100% for biliary tract, bladder, colorectal, esophageal, gastric, glioma, liver, pancreatic, and prostate cancers, and showed reasonable sensitivities of 68.2 and 72.0% for ovarian cancer and sarcoma, respectively, while maintaining 99.3% specificity.

To extend the complexity in cancer, there are substantial differences from cell to cell within an individual tumour (intra-tumour heterogeneity, ITH) and the features of cancer cells evolve in space and time. Currently, treatment-decision making usually relies on the molecular characteristics of a limited tumour tissue sample at the time of diagnosis or disease progression but does not take into account the complexity of the bulk tumours and their constant evolution over time. In this review, we explore the extent of tumour heterogeneity with an emphasis on ITH and report the mechanisms that promote and sustain this diversity in cancers.

Although the modern era has ushered in numerous changes to our daily living conditions, changes in ""what"" and ""when"" we eat appear to disproportionately fuel the rise of T2DM. The pancreatic islet is a key biological controller of an organism's glucose homeostasis and thus plays an outsized role to coordinate the response to environmental factors to preserve euglycemia through a delicate balance of endocrine outputs. Both successful and failed adaptation to dynamic environmental stimuli has been postulated to occur due to changes in the transcriptional and epigenetic regulation of pathways associated with islet secretory function and survival. Therefore, in this review we examined and evaluated the current evidence elucidating the key epigenetic mechanisms and transcriptional programs underlying the islet's coordinated response to the interaction between the timing and the composition of dietary nutrients common to modern lifestyles.

Pregnancy rate was defined as the primary outcome while good quality embryo, fertilization rate, ongoing pregnancy, and miscarriage were secondary outcomes. We used Review Manager 5.3 (RevMan) to conduct meta-analysis and examined the robustness of the primary outcome by trial sequential analysis. Five studies were included in the final analysis and it suggested that vitamin D supplementation was associated with improved chemical pregnancy rate (risk ratio [RR] = 1.53, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.06 to 2.20, p = 0.02) but not benefited in improving clinical pregnancy rate (RR = 1.34, 95% CI = 0.81 to 2.24, p = 0.25) and all secondary outcomes.

"35370497","Potential Societal and Cultural Implications of Transgenerational Epigenetic Methylation of Trauma and PTSD: Pathology or Resilience?","Yale J Biol Med","Psychological trauma is unique in that it is an environmental event that could induce biological changes and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, or other mood disorders in some patients. On the other hand, there may be no psychopathology (in most cases), or even sometimes post-traumatic growth and resilience. According to the DSM-5, trauma is a prerequisite for PTSD and traumatic stress disorder, but not for depressive episodes or mood disorders, or other psychiatric conditions. This paper brings attention to the preliminary literature on transgenerational inheritance due to trauma exposure and its societal and cultural implications. There is accumulating evidence that exposure to trauma can be passed transgenerationally through epigenetic inheritance leading to changes in gene expression and possible disorders or resilience. The effects of resilience from transgenerational inheritance have not been studied, but should be, for a full understanding not only of the disease risk across generations, but also of its social and cultural implications. The epigenetic pathologic effects across generations also need further studies, as the current research is preliminary; larger replications are needed for definitive and more complete understanding. I present here a glimpse of where we are, a vision of where we should go in terms of future research direction for disease risk transmission, and recommend studies of resilience and post-traumatic growth across generations, as well as other studies related to the societal implications at the population level.Copyright ©2022, Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine."

"35330028","Exploring the Developmental Potential of Human Germinal Vesicle Oocytes Aiming at Fertility Preservation: Can We Increase the Yields of Competent Oocytes through IVM Combined with Vitrification?","J Clin Med","The rescue in vitro maturation (rIVM) of germinal vesicle oocytes (GVs) has been proposed to improve the total number of mature oocytes in women undergoing fertility preservation. Currently, there is no consensus about the clinical utility of this practice, and heterogeneity in the protocols used may influence the final outcomes. This study investigated the developmental potential of mature metaphase II (MII) human oocytes obtained from GVs after rIVM and the impact of applying vitrification at different timepoints either before or after rIVM. After randomization, oocytes were assigned to undergo rIVM and thereafter vitrification or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), or to undergo direct vitrification-warming and thereafter rIVM and ICSI. The likelihood of obtaining MII oocytes was just slightly higher in the fresh rIVM group compared to the vitrification-warming-rIVM group. When comparing fresh rIVM that underwent subsequently ICSI, the fertilization and developmental rates up to the blastocyst stage were seen to be reduced in both groups that underwent vitrification either before or after rIVM. Although some blastocysts were obtained in the fresh rIVM-ICSI group, the efficacy of these methods was low overall, suggesting that the further development of protocols for IVM conducted early after denudation is needed to improve the final results of rIVM aiming at fertility preservation."
"35331312","Epigenetic remodelling in human hepatocellular carcinoma.","J Exp Clin Cancer Res","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most frequent primary liver cancer, being the sixth most commonly diagnosed cancer and the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death. As other heterogeneous solid tumours, HCC results from a unique synergistic combination of genetic alterations mixed with epigenetic modifications.In HCC the patterns and frequencies of somatic variations change depending on the nearby chromatin. On the other hand, epigenetic alterations often induce genomic instability prone to mutations. Epigenetics refers to heritable states of gene expression without alteration to the DNA sequence itself and, unlike genetic changes, the epigenetic modifications are reversible and affect gene expression more extensively than genetic changes. Thus, studies of epigenetic regulation and the involved molecular machinery are greatly contributing to the understanding of the mechanisms that underline HCC onset and heterogeneity. Moreover, this knowledge may help to identify biomarkers for HCC diagnosis and prognosis, as well as future new targets for more efficacious therapeutic approaches.In this comprehensive review we will discuss the state-of-the-art knowledge about the epigenetic landscape in hepatocarcinogenesis, including evidence on the diagnostic and prognostic role of non-coding RNAs, modifications occurring at the chromatin level, and their role in the era of precision medicine.Apart from other better-known risk factors that predispose to the development of HCC, characterization of the epigenetic remodelling that occurs during hepatocarcinogenesis could open the way to the identification of personalized biomarkers. It may also enable a more accurate diagnosis and stratification of patients, and the discovery of new targets for more efficient therapeutic approaches.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35288457","DNA methylation-independent long-term epigenetic silencing with dCRISPR/Cas9 fusion proteins.","Life Sci Alliance","The programmable CRISPR/Cas9 DNA nuclease is a versatile genome editing tool, but it requires the host cell DNA repair machinery to alter genomic sequences. This fact leads to unpredictable changes of the genome at the cut sites. Genome editing tools that can alter the genome without causing DNA double-strand breaks are therefore in high demand. Here, we show that expression of promoter-associated short guide (sg)RNAs together with dead Cas9 (dCas9) fused to a Krüppel-associated box domains (KRABd) in combination with the transcription repression domain of methyl CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) can lead to persistent gene silencing in mouse embryonic stem cells and in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells. Surprisingly, this effect is achievable and even enhanced in DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase 3A and 3B (Dnmt3A-/-, Dnmt3b-/-) depleted cells. Our results suggest that dCas9-KRABd-MeCP2 fusions are useful for long-term epigenetic gene silencing with utility in cell biology and potentially in therapeutical settings.© 2022 Ding et al."
"35360861","Short Tandem Repeat Variation in the <i>CNR1</i> Gene Associated With Analgesic Requirements of Opioids in Postoperative Pain Management.","Front Genet","Short tandem repeats (STRs) and variable number of tandem repeats (VNTRs) that have been identified at approximately 0.7 and 0.5 million loci in the human genome, respectively, are highly multi-allelic variations rather than single-nucleotide polymorphisms. The number of repeats of more than a few thousand STRs was associated with the expression of nearby genes, indicating that STRs are influential genetic variations in human traits. Analgesics act on the central nervous system via their intrinsic receptors to produce analgesic effects. In the present study, we focused on STRs and VNTRs in theCNR1,GRIN2A,PENK, andPDYNgenes and analyzed two peripheral pain sensation-related traits and seven analgesia-related traits in postoperative pain management. A total of 192 volunteers who underwent the peripheral pain sensation tests and 139 and 252 patients who underwent open abdominal and orthognathic cosmetic surgeries, respectively, were included in the study. None of the four STRs or VNTRs were associated with peripheral pain sensation. Short tandem repeats in theCNR1,GRIN2A, andPENKgenes were associated with the frequency of fentanyl use, fentanyl dose, and visual analog scale pain scores 3 h after orthognathic cosmetic surgery (Spearman's rank correlation coefficientρ= 0.199,p= 0.002,ρ= 0.174,p= 0.006, andρ= 0.135,p= 0.033, respectively), analgesic dose, including epidural analgesics after open abdominal surgery (ρ= -0.200,p= 0.018), and visual analog scale pain scores 24 h after orthognathic cosmetic surgery (ρ= 0.143,p= 0.023), respectively. The associations between STRs in theCNR1gene and the frequency of fentanyl use and fentanyl dose after orthognathic cosmetic surgery were confirmed by Holm's multiple-testing correction. These findings indicate that STRs in theCNR1gene influence analgesia in the orofacial region.Copyright © 2022 Kasai, Nishizawa, Hasegawa, Fukuda, Ichinohe, Nagashima, Hayashida and Ikeda."

Using a complete telomere-to-telomere human genome (T2T-CHM13), we present a comprehensive view of human SD organization. SDs account for nearly one-third of the additional sequence, increasing the genome-wide estimate from 5.4 to 7.0% [218 million base pairs (Mbp)]. An analysis of 268 human genomes shows that 91% of the previously unresolved T2T-CHM13 SD sequence (68.3 Mbp) better represents human copy number variation. Comparing long-read assemblies from human (n= 12) and nonhuman primate (n= 5) genomes, we systematically reconstruct the evolution and structural haplotype diversity of biomedically relevant and duplicated genes. This analysis reveals patterns of structural heterozygosity and evolutionary differences in SD organization between humans and other primates."

The uncertainty of rDNA genomic structure presents a significant barrier for studying their function and evolution.Here we generate ultra-long Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) and short NGS reads to delineate the architecture and variation of the 5S rDNA cluster in the different strains of C. elegans and C. briggsae. We classify the individual rDNA's repeating units into 25 types based on the unique sequence variations in each unit of C. elegans (N2). We next perform assembly of the cluster by taking advantage of the long reads that carry these units, which led to an assembly of 5S rDNA cluster consisting of up to 167 consecutive 5S rDNA units in the N2 strain. The ordering and copy number of various rDNA units are consistent with the separation time between strains. Surprisingly, we observed a drastically reduced level of variation in the unit composition in the 5S rDNA cluster in the C. elegans CB4856 and C. briggsae AF16 strains than in the C. elegans N2 strain, suggesting that N2, a widely used reference strain, is likely to be defective in maintaining the 5S rDNA cluster stability compared with other wild isolates of C. elegans or C. briggsae.The results demonstrate that Nanopore DNA sequencing reads are capable of generating assembly of highly repetitive sequences, and rDNA units are highly dynamic both within and between population(s) of the same species in terms of sequence and copy number. The detailed structure and variation of the 5S rDNA units within the rDNA cluster pave the way for functional and evolutionary studies.© 2022. The Author(s)."

In this study, we focused our attention on chromosome 8p. We report 12 cases of 8p rearrangements, analyzed by molecular karyotype, evidencing a continuum of fragility that involves the entire short arm. The breakpoints seem more concentrated in three intervals: one at the telomeric end, the others at 8p23.1, close to the beta-defensin gene cluster and olfactory receptor low-copy repeats. Hypothetical mechanisms for all cases are described. Our data extend the cohort of published patients with 8p aberrations and highlight the need to pay special attention to these sequences due to the risk of formation of new chromosomal aberrations with pathological effects."
"35327610","DNA Methylation Malleability and Dysregulation in Cancer Progression: Understanding the Role of PARP1.","Biomolecules","Mammalian genomic DNA methylation represents a key epigenetic modification and its dynamic regulation that fine-tunes the gene expression of multiple pathways during development. It maintains the gene expression of one generation of cells; particularly, the mitotic inheritance of gene-expression patterns makes it the key governing mechanism of epigenetic change to the next generation of cells. Convincing evidence from recent discoveries suggests that the dynamic regulation of DNA methylation is accomplished by the enzymatic action of TET dioxygenase, which oxidizes the methyl group of cytosine and activates transcription. As a result of aberrant DNA modifications, genes are improperly activated or inhibited in the inappropriate cellular context, contributing to a plethora of inheritable diseases, including cancer. We outline recent advancements in understanding how DNA modifications contribute to tumor suppressor gene silencing or oncogenic-gene stimulation, as well as dysregulation of DNA methylation in cancer progression. In addition, we emphasize the function of PARP1 enzymatic activity or inhibition in the maintenance of DNA methylation dysregulation. In the context of cancer remediation, the impact of DNA methylation and PARP1 pharmacological inhibitors, and their relevance as a combination therapy are highlighted."

Using tissue microarray (TMA), immunohistochemistry, fluorescent double immunostaining, and western blotting, 208 NSCLC and 5 benign pulmonary patients were studied of their expression of runt-related transcription factor 3 (RUNX3), trimethylated histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3), enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), and Ki-67. Apoptotic index in cancerous tissue was evaluated via TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL). The correlation between clinicopathologic parameters and overall survival was determined by Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier survival estimates and log-rank test. GEPIA and KM plotter were used for validation of some survival analyses. As a result, together with other regular prognostic factors, RUNX3/H3K27me3 co-expression was found to be closely correlated with better prognosis in either pTNM-I or POCT-naive NSCLC patients, which might partially result from a higher cancerous apoptotic index. In conclusion, RUNX3/H3K27me3 co-expression defined some specific NSCLC population with better prognosis and longer OS and could probably be used as a biomarker in the prediction of better postoperative outcomes.Copyright © 2022 Xiaohui Chen et al."

Even though Deep Learning methods such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are becoming widespread in Genomics, developing and training such models is outside the ability of most researchers in the field.Here we present ENNGene-Easy Neural Network model building tool for Genomics. This tool simplifies training of custom CNN or hybrid CNN-RNN models on genomic data via an easy-to-use Graphical User Interface. ENNGene allows multiple input branches, including sequence, evolutionary conservation, and secondary structure, and performs all the necessary preprocessing steps, allowing simple input such as genomic coordinates. The network architecture is selected and fully customized by the user, from the number and types of the layers to each layer's precise set-up. ENNGene then deals with all steps of training and evaluation of the model, exporting valuable metrics such as multi-class ROC and precision-recall curve plots or TensorBoard log files. To facilitate interpretation of the predicted results, we deploy Integrated Gradients, providing the user with a graphical representation of an attribution level of each input position. To showcase the usage of ENNGene, we train multiple models on the RBP24 dataset, quickly reaching the state of the art while improving the performance on more than half of the proteins by including the evolutionary conservation score and tuning the network per protein.As the role of DL in big data analysis in the near future is indisputable, it is important to make it available for a broader range of researchers. We believe that an easy-to-use tool such as ENNGene can allow Genomics researchers without a background in Computational Sciences to harness the power of DL to gain better insights into and extract important information from the large amounts of data available in the field.© 2022.

Single isolated biomarkers have not been enough to improve diagnostic and prognostic strategies and to progress toward therapeutic goals. The information generated by the human genome project has allowed a more holistic approach to the problem. The integration of genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics in sepsis has allowed us to progress in the knowledge of new pathways which are pathophysiologically involved in this disease. Thus, we have understood the importance of and complex interaction between the inflammatory response and the endothelium. Understanding the role of important parts of the microcirculation, such as the endothelial glycocalyx and its interaction with the inflammatory response, has provided early recognition elements for clinical practice that allow the rational use of traditional medical interventions in sepsis. This comprehensive approach, which differs from the classical mechanistic approach, uses systems biology to increase the diagnostic and prognostic spectrum of endothelial damage biomarkers in sepsis, and to provide information on new pathways involved in the pathophysiology of the disease. This, in turn, provides tools for perfecting traditional medical interventions, using them at the appropriate times according to the disease's pathophysiological context, while at the same time discovering new and improved therapeutic alternatives. We have the challenge of transferring this ideal scenario to our daily clinical practice to improve our patients' care.

Age-related impairment of immune function (immunosenescence) is one important cause of age-related morbidity and mortality, which may extend beyond its role in infectious disease. One aspect of immunosenescence that has received less attention is age-related natural killer (NK) cell dysfunction, characterized by reduced cytokine secretion and decreased target cell cytotoxicity, accompanied by and despite an increase in NK cell numbers with age. Moreover, recent studies have revealed that NK cells are the central actors in the immunosurveillance of senescent cells, whose age-related accumulation is itself a probable contributor to the chronic sterile low-grade inflammation developed with aging (""inflammaging""). NK cell dysfunction is therefore implicated in the increasing burden of infection, malignancy, inflammatory disorders, and senescent cells with age. This review will focus on recent advances and open questions in understanding the interplay between systemic inflammation, senescence burden, and NK cell dysfunction in the context of aging. Understanding the factors driving and enforcing NK cell aging may potentially lead to therapies countering age-related diseases and underlying drivers of the biological aging process itself."

Several excellent review papers have been published fairly recently on its pathogenesis, and several theories have been proposed. However, the falsifiability, explanatory power, and predictivity of these theories are often overlooked. Since adenomyosis can occur spontaneously in rodents and many other species, the animal models may help us unveil the pathogenesis of adenomyosis. This review critically tallies experimentally induced models published so far, with a particular focus on their relevance to epidemiological findings, their possible mechanisms of action, and their explanatory and predictive power.PubMed was exhaustively searched using the phrase ""adenomyosis and animal model"", ""adenomyosis and experimental model"", ""adenomyosis and mouse"", and ""adenomyosis and rat"", and the resultant papers were retrieved, carefully read, and the resultant information distilled. All the retrieved papers were then reviewed in a narrative manner.Among all published animal models of adenomyosis, the mouse model of adenomyosis induced by endometrial-myometrial interface disruption (EMID) seems to satisfy the requirements of falsifiability and has the predictive capability and also Hill's causality criteria. Other theories only partially satisfy Hill's criteria of causality. In particular, animal models of adenomyosis induced by hyperestrogenism, hyperprolactinemia, or long-term exposure to progestogens without much epidemiological documentation and adenomyosis is usually not the exclusive uterine pathology consequent to those induction procedures. Regardless, uterine disruption appears to be a necessary but not sufficient condition for causing adenomyosis.EMID is, however, unlikely the sole cause for adenomyosis. Future studies, including animal studies, are warranted to understand how and why in utero and/or prenatal exposure to elevated levels of estrogen or estrogenic compounds increases the risk of developing adenomyosis in adulthood, to elucidate whether prolactin plays any role in its pathogenesis, and to identify sufficient condition(s) that cause adenomyosis."

However, it is unknown as to whether the latter effects occur in vivo and are maintained over extended periods of time and across generations. To address this issue, we asked whether AA supplementation for three consecutive generations (prior to coitus in sires or in utero in dams) affected offspring growth phenotypes, in addition to liver DNAm and FA profiles in mice. Twelve-week-old BALB/c mice were exposed daily to AA dissolved in soybean oil (vehicle, VH), or VH only, for 10 days prior to mating or during the entire pregnancy (20 days). On average, 15 mice were supplemented per generation, followed by analysis of offspring body weight and liver traits (x average = 36 and 10 per generation, respectively). Body weight cumulatively increased in F2 and F3 offspring generations and positively correlated with milligrams of paternal or maternal offspring AA exposure. A concomitant increase in liver weight was observed. Notably, akin to AA-challenged cultured cells, global DNAm and cis-7-hexadecenoic acid (16:1n-9), an anti-inflammatory FA that is dependent on stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) activity, increased with milligrams of AA exposure. In accordance, liverScd1promoter methylation decreased with milligrams of germline AA exposure and was negatively correlated with liver weight. Our results show that mice retain cellular memories of AA exposure across generations that could potentially be beneficial to the innate immune system."
"35336971","Dengue Virus Replication Is Associated with Catecholamine Biosynthesis and Metabolism in Hepatocytes.","Viruses","Previously, the association between the catecholamine biosynthetic enzyme L-Dopa decarboxylase (DDC) and Dengue virus (DV) replication was demonstrated in liver cells and was found to be mediated at least by the interaction between DDC and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). Here, we show that biogenic amines production and uptake impede DV replication in hepatocytes and monocytes, while the virus reduces catecholamine biosynthesis, metabolism, and transport. To examine how catecholamine biosynthesis/metabolism influences DV, first, we verified the role of DDC by altering DDC expression. DDC silencing enhanced virus replication, but not translation, attenuated the negative effect of DDC substrates on the virus and reduced the infection related cell death. Then, the role of the downstream steps of the catecholamine biosynthesis/metabolism was analyzed by chemical inhibition of the respective enzymes, application of their substrates and/or their products; moreover, reserpine, the inhibitor of the vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2), was used to examine the role of uptake/storage of catecholamines on DV. Apart from the role of each enzyme/transporter, these studies revealed that the dopamine uptake, and not the dopamine-signaling, is responsible for the negative effect on DV. Accordingly, all treatments expected to enhance the accumulation of catecholamines in the cell cytosol suppressed DV replication. This was verified by the use of chemical inducers of catecholamine biosynthesis. Last, the cellular redox alterations due to catecholamine oxidation were not related with the inhibition of DV replication. In turn, DV apart from its negative impact on DDC, inhibits tyrosine hydroxylase, dopamine beta-hydroxylase, monoamine oxidase, and VMAT2 expression."

The dissemination of antimicrobial resistance in the human microbiome.","Gut Microbes","A global rise in antimicrobial resistance among pathogenic bacteria has proved to be a major public health threat, with the rate of multidrug-resistant bacterial infections increasing over time. The gut microbiome has been studied as a reservoir of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) that can be transferred to bacterial pathogens via horizontal gene transfer (HGT) of conjugative plasmids and mobile genetic elements (the gut resistome). Advances in metagenomic sequencing have facilitated the identification of resistome modulators, including live microbial therapeutics such as probiotics and fecal microbiome transplantation that can either expand or reduce the abundances of ARG-carrying bacteria in the gut. While many different gut microbes encode for ARGs, they are not uniformly distributed across, or transmitted by, various members of the microbiome, and not all are of equal clinical relevance. Both experimental and theoretical approaches in microbial ecology have been applied to understand differing frequencies of ARG horizontal transfer between commensal microbes as well as between commensals and pathogens. In this commentary, we assess the evidence for the role of commensal gut microbes in encoding antimicrobial resistance genes, the degree to which they are shared both with other commensals and with pathogens, and the host and environmental factors that can impact resistome dynamics. We further discuss novel sequencing-based approaches for identifying ARGs and predicting future transfer events of clinically relevant ARGs from commensals to pathogens."

In SOFT cases, four MT-SNVs survived multiple testing corrections (at FDR &lt; 5%), all potentially conferring increased CAD risk. Of those, m.11251A&gt;G (ND4) and m.15452C&gt;A (CYB) have previously shown significant associations with body height. In line with this, we observed that CAD cases were slightly less physically active, and their average body height was ~2.00 cm lower compared to controls; both traits are known to be related to increased CAD risk. Gene-based tests identified CO2 associated with HARD/SOFT CAD, whereas ND3 and CYB associated with SOFT cases (p&lt; 0.05), dysfunction of which has been related to MT oxidative stress, obesity/T2D (CO2), BMI (ND3), and angina/exercise intolerance (CYB).

JAK2-V617F, the most prevalent mutation in MPNs, has been shown to activate a number of integrins on mature myeloid cells, including granulocytes and erythrocytes, which increase adhesion and drive venous thrombosis in murine knock-in/out models. This review aims to shed light on the current understanding of thromboinflammation, involvement of neutrophils in the prothrombotic state, plausible molecular mechanisms triggering the process of thrombosis, and potential novel therapeutic targets for developing effective strategies to reduce the MPN disease burden."
