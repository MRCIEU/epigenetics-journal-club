No,20210125,DNAm age,33442664,Biological Aging Measures Based on Blood DNA Methylation and Risk of Cancer: A Prospective Study.,JNCI Cancer Spectr,"We previously investigated the association between 5 ""first-generation"" measures of epigenetic aging and cancer risk in the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study. This study assessed cancer risk associations for 3 recently developed methylation-based biomarkers of aging:PhenoAge,GrimAge, and predicted telomere length.We estimated rate ratios (RRs) for the association between these 3 age-adjusted measures and risk of colorectal (N = 813), gastric (N = 165), kidney (N = 139), lung (N = 327), mature B-cell (N = 423), prostate (N = 846), and urothelial (N = 404) cancer using conditional logistic regression models. We also assessed associations by time since blood draw and by cancer subtype, and we investigated potential nonlinearity.We observed relatively strong associations of age-adjustedPhenoAgewith risk of colorectal, kidney, lung, mature B-cell, and urothelial cancers (RR per SD was approximately 1.2-1.3). Similar findings were obtained for age-adjustedGrimAge, but the association with lung cancer risk was much larger (RR per SD = 1.82, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.44 to 2.30), after adjustment for smoking status, pack-years, starting age, time since quitting, and other cancer risk factors. Most associations appeared linear, larger than for the first-generation measures, and were virtually unchanged after adjustment for a large set of sociodemographic, lifestyle, and anthropometric variables. For cancer overall, the comprehensively adjusted rate ratio per SD was 1.13 (95% CI = 1.07 to 1.19) forPhenoAgeand 1.12 (95% CI = 1.05 to 1.20) forGrimAgeand appeared larger within 5 years of blood draw (RR = 1.29, 95% CI = 1.15 to 1.44 and 1.19, 95% CI = 1.06 to 1.33, respectively).The methylation-based measuresPhenoAgeandGrimAgemay provide insights into the relationship between biological aging and cancer and be useful to predict cancer risk, particularly for lung cancer.© The Author(s) 2020.

No,20210125,Gene expression,33436844,Gene expression in blood reflects smoking exposure among cancer-free women in the Norwegian Women and Cancer (NOWAC) postgenome cohort.,Sci Rep,"Active smoking has been linked to modulated gene expression in blood. However, there is a need for a more thorough understanding of how quantitative measures of smoking exposure relate to differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in whole-blood among ever smokers. This study analysed microarray-based gene expression profiles from whole-blood samples according to smoking status and quantitative measures of smoking exposure among cancer-free women (n = 1708) in the Norwegian Women and Cancer postgenome cohort. When compared with never smokers and former smokers, current smokers had 911 and 1082 DEGs, respectively and their biological functions could indicate systemic impacts of smoking. LRRN3 was associated with smoking status with the lowest FDR-adjusted p-value. When never smokers and all former smokers were compared, no DEGs were observed, but LRRN3 was differentially expressed when never smokers were compared with former smokers who quit smoking ≤ 10 years ago. Further, LRRN3 was positively associated with smoking intensity, pack-years, and comprehensive smoking index score among current smokers; and negatively associated with time since cessation among former smokers. Consequently, LRRN3 expression in whole-blood is a molecular signal of smoking exposure that could supplant self-reported smoking data in further research targeting blood-based markers related to the health effects of smoking."
No,20210125,Gene expression,33436912,Longitudinal saliva omics responses to immune perturbation: a case study.,Sci Rep,"Saliva omics has immense potential for non-invasive diagnostics, including monitoring very young or elderly populations, or individuals in remote locations. In this study, multiple saliva omics from an individual were monitored over three periods (100 timepoints) involving: (1) hourly sampling over 24 h without intervention, (2) hourly sampling over 24 h including immune system activation using the standard 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine, (3) daily sampling for 33 days profiling the post-vaccination response. At each timepoint total saliva transcriptome and proteome, and small RNA from salivary extracellular vesicles were profiled, including mRNA, miRNA, piRNA and bacterial RNA. The two 24-h periods were used in a paired analysis to remove daily variation and reveal vaccination responses. Over 18,000 omics longitudinal series had statistically significant temporal trends compared to a healthy baseline. Various immune response and regulation pathways were activated following vaccination, including interferon and cytokine signaling, and MHC antigen presentation. Immune response timeframes were concordant with innate and adaptive immunity development, and coincided with vaccination and reported fever. Overall, mRNA results appeared more specific and sensitive (timewise) to vaccination compared to other omics. The results suggest saliva omics can be consistently assessed for non-invasive personalized monitoring and immune response diagnostics."
No,20210125,Imprinting,33441584,Imprinting methylation predicts hippocampal volumes and hyperintensities and the change with age in later life.,Sci Rep,"Epigenetic imprinting is important for neurogenesis and brain function. Hippocampal volumes and brain hyperintensities in late life have been associated with early life circumstances. Epigenetic imprinting may underpin these associations. Methylation was measured at 982 sites in 13 imprinted locations in blood samples from a longitudinal cohort by bisulphite amplicon sequencing. Hippocampal volumes and hyperintensities were determined at age 64y and 72y using MRI. Hyperintensities were determined in white matter, grey matter and infratentorial regions. Permutation methods were used to adjust for multiple testing. At 64y, H19/IGF2 and NESPAS methylation predicted hippocampal volumes. PEG3 predicted hyperintensities in hippocampal grey matter, and white matter. GNASXL predicted grey matter hyperintensities. Changes with age were predicted for hippocampal volume (MEST1, KvDMR, L3MBTL, GNASXL), white matter (MEST1, PEG3) and hippocampal grey matter hyperintensities (MCTS2, GNASXL, NESPAS, L3MBTL, MCTS2, SNRPN, MEST1). Including childhood cognitive ability, years in education, or socioeconomic status as additional explanatory variables in regression analyses did not change the overall findings. Imprinting methylation in multiple genes predicts brain structures, and their change over time. These findings are potentially relevant to the development of novel tests of brain structure and function across the life-course, strategies to improve cognitive outcomes, and our understanding of early influences on brain development and function."
No,20210125,Methods,33452255,Cellular Heterogeneity-Adjusted cLonal Methylation (CHALM) improves prediction of gene expression.,Nat Commun,"Promoter DNA methylation is a well-established mechanism of transcription repression, though its global correlation with gene expression is weak. This weak correlation can be attributed to the failure of current methylation quantification methods to consider the heterogeneity among sequenced bulk cells. Here, we introduce Cell Heterogeneity-Adjusted cLonal Methylation (CHALM) as a methylation quantification method. CHALM improves understanding of the functional consequences of DNA methylation, including its correlations with gene expression and H3K4me3. When applied to different methylation datasets, the CHALM method enables detection of differentially methylated genes that exhibit distinct biological functions supporting underlying mechanisms."
No,20210125,Omics,33481009,Multi-omics analyses of cognitive traits and psychiatric disorders highlights brain-dependent mechanisms.,Hum Mol Genet,"Integrating findings from genome-wide association studies with molecular datasets can develop insight into the underlying functional mechanisms responsible for trait-associated genetic variants. We have applied the principles of Mendelian randomization (MR) to investigate whether brain-derived gene expression (n = 1194) may be responsible for mediating the effect of genetic variants on eight cognitive and psychological outcomes (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Alzheimer's disease, bipolar disorder, depression, intelligence, insomnia, neuroticism and schizophrenia). Transcriptome-wide analyses identified 83 genes associated with at least one outcome (PBonferroni < 6.72 × 10-6), with multiple-trait colocalization also implicating changes to brain-derived DNA methylation at nine of these loci. Comparing effects between outcomes identified evidence of enrichment which may reflect putative causal relationships, such as an inverse relationship between genetic liability towards schizophrenia risk and cognitive ability in later life. Repeating these analyses in whole blood (n = 31 684), we replicated 58.2% of brain-derived effects (based on P < 0.05). Finally, we undertook phenome-wide evaluations at associated loci to investigate pleiotropic effects with 700 complex traits. This highlighted pleiotropic loci such as FURIN (initially implicated in schizophrenia risk (P = 1.05 × 10-7)) which had evidence of an effect on 28 other outcomes, as well as genes which may have a more specific role in disease pathogenesis (e.g. SLC12A5 which only provided evidence of an effect on depression (P = 7.13 × 10-10)). Our results support the utility of whole blood as a valuable proxy for informing initial target identification but also suggest that gene discovery in a tissue-specific manner may be more informative. Finally, non-pleiotropic loci highlighted by our study may be of use for therapeutic translational endeavours.© The Author(s) 2021. Published by Oxford University Press."
Yes,20210125,Omics,33436383,"Genetic variants shape rheumatoid arthritis-specific transcriptomic features in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells through differential DNA methylation, explaining a substantial proportion of heritability.",Ann Rheum Dis,"CD4+T cells have been suggested as the most disease-relevant cell type in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in which RA-risk non-coding variants exhibit allele-specific effects on regulation of RA-driving genes. This study aimed to understand RA-specific signatures in CD4+T cells using multi-omics data, interpreting inter-omics relationships in shaping the RA transcriptomic landscape.We profiled genome-wide variants, gene expression and DNA methylation in CD4+T cells from 82 patients with RA and 40 healthy controls using high-throughput technologies. We investigated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differential methylated regions (DMRs) in RA and localised quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for expression and methylation. We then integrated these based on individual-level correlations to inspect DEG-regulating sources and investigated the potential regulatory roles of RA-risk variants by a partitioned-heritability enrichment analysis with RA genome-wide association summary statistics.A large number of RA-specific DEGs were identified (n=2575), highlighting T cell differentiation and activation pathways. RA-specific DMRs, preferentially located in T cell regulatory regions, were correlated with the expression levels of 548 DEGs mostly in the same topologically associating domains. In addition, expressional variances in 771 and 83 DEGs were partially explained by expression QTLs for DEGs and methylation QTLs (meQTLs) for DEG-correlated DMRs, respectively. A large number of RA variants were moderately to strongly correlated with meQTLs. DEG-correlated DMRs, enriched with meQTLs, had strongly enriched heritability of RA.Our findings revealed that the methylomic changes, driven by RA heritability-explaining variants, shape the differential expression of a substantial fraction of DEGs in CD4+T cells in patients with RA, reinforcing the importance of a multidimensional approach in disease-relevant tissues.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

No,20210125,Organoids,33436582,A logical network-based drug-screening platform for Alzheimer's disease representing pathological features of human brain organoids.,Nat Commun,"Developing effective drugs for Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia, has been difficult because of complicated pathogenesis. Here, we report an efficient, network-based drug-screening platform developed by integrating mathematical modeling and the pathological features of AD with human iPSC-derived cerebral organoids (iCOs), including CRISPR-Cas9-edited isogenic lines. We use 1300 organoids from 11 participants to build a high-content screening (HCS) system and test blood-brain barrier-permeable FDA-approved drugs. Our study provides a strategy for precision medicine through the convergence of mathematical modeling and a miniature pathological brain model using iCOs."
No,20210125,Reference,33434283,A comprehensive epigenome atlas reveals DNA methylation regulating skeletal muscle development.,Nucleic Acids Res,"DNA methylation is important for the epigenetic regulation of gene expression and plays a critical role in mammalian development. However, the dynamic regulation of genome-wide DNA methylation in skeletal muscle development remains largely unknown. Here, we generated the first single-base resolution DNA methylome and transcriptome maps of porcine skeletal muscle across 27 developmental stages. The overall methylation level decreased from the embryo to the adult, which was highly correlated with the downregulated expression of DNMT1 and an increase in partially methylated domains. Notably, we identified over 40 000 developmentally differentially methylated CpGs (dDMCs) that reconstitute the developmental trajectory of skeletal muscle and associate with muscle developmental genes and transcription factors (TFs). The dDMCs were significantly under-represented in promoter regulatory regions but strongly enriched as enhancer histone markers and in chromatin-accessible regions. Integrative analysis revealed the negative regulation of both promoter and gene body methylation in genes associated with muscle contraction and insulin signaling during skeletal muscle development. Mechanistically, DNA methylation affected the expression of muscle-related genes by modulating the accessibly of upstream myogenesis TF binding, indicating the involvement of the DNA methylation/SP1/IGF2BP3 axis in skeletal myogenesis. Our results highlight the function and regulation of dynamic DNA methylation in skeletal muscle development.© The Author(s) 2021.
