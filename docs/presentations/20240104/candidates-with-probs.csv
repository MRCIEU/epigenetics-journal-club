x,38113735,DNA methylation aging signatures of multiple metals exposure and their mediation effects in metal-associated mortality: Evidence from the Dongfeng-Tongji cohort study.,J Hazard Mater,"Humans were exposed to multiple metals, but the impact of metals on DNA methylation-age (DNAm-age), a well-recognized aging measure, remains inconclusive. This study included 2942 participants from the Dongfeng-Tongji cohort. We detected their plasma concentrations of 23 metals and determined their genome-wide DNA methylation using the Illumina Human-MethylationEPIC BeadChip. Five DNAm-age acceleration indexes (DAIs), including HannumAge-Accel, HorvathAge-Accel, PhenoAge-Accel, GrimAge-Accel (residual from regressing corresponding DNAm-age on chronological age) and DNAm-mortality score (DNAm-MS), were separately calculated. We found that each 1-unit increase in ln-transformed copper (Cu) was associated with a separate 1.02-, 0.83- and 0.07-unit increase in PhenoAge-Accel, GrimAge-Accel, and DNAm-MS (all FDR<0.05). Each 1-unit increase in ln-transformed nickel (Ni) was associated with a 0.34-year increase in PhenoAge-Accel, while each 1-unit increase in ln-transformed strontium (Sr) was associated with a 0.05-unit increase in DNAm-MS. The Cu, Ni and Sr showed joint positive effects on above three DAIs. PhenoAge-Accel, GrimAge-Accel, and DNAm-MS mediated a separate 6.5%, 12.3%, 6.0% of the positive association between Cu and all-cause mortality; GrimAge-Accel mediated 14.3% of the inverse association of selenium with all-cause mortality. Our findings revealed the effects of Cu, Ni, Sr and their co-exposure on accelerated aging and highlighted mediation roles of DNAm-age on metal-associated mortality.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

x,38105971,"An epigenome-wide analysis of DNA methylation, racialized and economic inequities, and air pollution.",bioRxiv,"DNA methylation (DNAm) provides a plausible mechanism by which adverse exposures become embodied and contribute to health inequities, due to its role in genome regulation and responsiveness to social and biophysical exposures tied to societal context. However, scant epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) have included structural and lifecourse measures of exposure, especially in relation to structural discrimination.Our study tests the hypothesis that DNAm is a mechanism by which racial discrimination, economic adversity, and air pollution become biologically embodied.A series of cross-sectional EWAS, conducted in My Body My Story (MBMS, biological specimens collected 2008-2010, DNAm assayed in 2021); and the Multi Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA; biological specimens collected 2010-2012, DNAm assayed in 2012-2013); using new georeferenced social exposure data for both studies (generated in 2022).MBMS was recruited from four community health centers in Boston; MESA was recruited from four field sites in: Baltimore, MD; Forsyth County, NC; New York City, NY; and St. Paul, MN.Two population-based samples of US-born Black non-Hispanic (Black NH), white non-Hispanic (white NH), and Hispanic individuals (MBMS; n=224 Black NH and 69 white NH) and (MESA; n=229 Black NH, n=555 white NH and n=191 Hispanic).Eight social exposures encompassing racial discrimination, economic adversity, and air pollution.Genome-wide changes in DNAm, as measured using the Illumina EPIC BeadChip (MBMS; using frozen blood spots) and Illumina 450k BeadChip (MESA; using purified monocytes). Our hypothesis was formulated after data collection.We observed the strongest associations with traffic-related air pollution (measured via black carbon and nitrogen oxides exposure), with evidence from both studies suggesting that air pollution exposure may induce epigenetic changes related to inflammatory processes. We also found suggestive associations of DNAm variation with measures of structural racial discrimination (e.g., for Black NH participants, born in a Jim Crow state; adult exposure to racialized economic residential segregation) situated in genes with plausible links to effects on health.Overall, this work suggests that DNAm is a biological mechanism through which structural racism and air pollution become embodied and may lead to health inequities.",1
,38066081,Longitudinal changes and variation in human DNA methylation analysed with the Illumina MethylationEPIC BeadChip assay and their implications on forensic age prediction.,Sci Rep,"DNA methylation, a pivotal epigenetic modification, plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression and is known to undergo dynamic changes with age. The present study investigated epigenome-wide methylation profiles in 64 individuals over two time points, 15 years apart, using the Illumina EPIC850k arrays. A mixed-effects model identified 2821 age-associated differentially methylated CpG positions (aDMPs) with a median rate of change of 0.18% per year, consistent with a 10-15% change during a human lifespan. Significant variation in the baseline DNA methylation levels between individuals of similar ages as well as inconsistent direction of change with time across individuals were observed for all the aDMPs. Twenty-three of the 2821 aDMPs were previously incorporated into forensic age prediction models. These markers displayed larger changes in DNA methylation with age compared to all the aDMPs and less variation among individuals. Nevertheless, the forensic aDMPs also showed inter-individual variations in the direction of DNA methylation changes. Only cg16867657 in ELOVL2 exhibited a uniform direction of the age-related change among the investigated individuals, which supports the current knowledge that CpG sites in ELOVL2 are the best markers for age prediction.© 2023.

Differential DNA methylation may provide a mechanistic understanding of these long-term associations. We aimed to quantify the associations of MEA with offspring DNA methylation levels at birth, in childhood and in adolescence. Using 37 studies from high-income countries, we performed meta-analysis of epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) to quantify the associations of completed years of MEA at the time of pregnancy with offspring DNA methylation levels at birth (n?=?9 881), in childhood (n?=?2 017), and adolescence (n?=?2 740), adjusting for relevant covariates. MEA was found to be associated with DNA methylation at 473 cytosine-phosphate-guanine sites at birth, one in childhood, and four in adolescence. We observed enrichment for findings from previous EWAS on maternal folate, vitamin-B12concentrations, maternal smoking, and pre-pregnancy BMI. The associations were directionally consistent with MEA being inversely associated with behaviours including smoking and BMI. Our findings form a bridge between socio-economic factors and biology and highlight potential pathways underlying effects of maternal education. The results broaden our understanding of bio-social associations linked to differential DNA methylation in multiple early stages of life. The data generated also offers an important resource to help a more precise understanding of the social determinants of health.© 2023. The Author(s).",1

Genome-wide DNA methylation was determined using the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip. Variability in methylation was also considered, and mean variances for the two treatment categories were compared.In neonatal buccal smears, there were no significant differences between the CAPA-IVM and conventional IVF groups on the basis of the CpG probe after linear regression analysis using a significant cut-off of false-discovery rate <0.05 and |??|?0.05. In cord blood, only one CpG site showed a significant gain of methylation in the CAPA-IVM group. In the placenta, CAPA-IVM was significantly associated with changes in methylation at five CpG sites. Significantly more variable DNA methylation was found in five probes in the placenta, 54 in cord blood, and two in buccal smears after IVM of oocytes. In cord blood samples, 20 CpG sites had more variable methylation in the conventional IVF vs. IVM group. Isolated CpG sites showing differences in methylation in cord blood were not associated with changes in gene expression of the overlapping genes.Capacitation-IVM appeared to be associated with only a small amount of epigenetic variation in cord blood, placental tissue, and neonate buccal smears.NCT03405701 (www.gov).Copyright © 2023 American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

x,37935791,Trans-ancestry epigenome-wide association meta-analysis of DNA methylation with lifetime cannabis use.,Mol Psychiatry,"Cannabis is widely used worldwide, yet its links to health outcomes are not fully understood. DNA methylation can serve as a mediator to link environmental exposures to health outcomes. We conducted an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of peripheral blood-based DNA methylation and lifetime cannabis use (ever vs. never) in a meta-analysis including 9436 participants (7795 European and 1641 African ancestry) from seven cohorts. Accounting for effects of cigarette smoking, our trans-ancestry EWAS meta-analysis revealed four CpG sites significantly associated with lifetime cannabis use at a false discovery rate of 0.05 [Formula: see text]: cg22572071 near gene ADGRF1, cg15280358 in ADAM12, cg00813162 in ACTN1, and cg01101459 near LINC01132. Additionally, our EWAS analysis in participants who never smoked cigarettes identified another epigenome-wide significant CpG site, cg14237301 annotated to APOBR. We used a leave-one-out approach to evaluate methylation scores constructed as a weighted sum of the significant CpGs. The best model can explain 3.79% of the variance in lifetime cannabis use. These findings unravel the DNA methylation changes associated with lifetime cannabis use that are independent of cigarette smoking and may serve as a starting point for further research on the mechanisms through which cannabis exposure impacts health outcomes.© 2023.

We conducted an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of CpG methylation and progression to high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN2?+) following an abnormal screening test.A prospective US cohort of 289 colposcopy patients with normal or CIN1 enrollment histology was assessed. Baseline cervical sample DNA was analyzed using Illumina HumanMethylation 450K (n?=?76) or EPIC 850K (n?=?213) arrays. Participants returned at provider-recommended intervals and were followed up to 5 years via medical records. We assessed continuous CpG M values for 9 cervical cancer-associated genes and time-to-progression to CIN2+. We estimated CpG-specific time-to-event ratios (TTER) and hazard ratios using adjusted, interval-censored Weibull accelerated failure time models. We also conducted an exploratory EWAS to identify novel CpGs with false discovery rate (FDR)?<?0.05.At enrollment, median age was 29.2 years; 64.0% were high-risk HPV-positive, and 54.3% were non-white. During follow-up (median 24.4 months), 15 participants progressed to CIN2+. Greater methylation levels were associated with a shorter time-to-CIN2+?for CADM1 cg03505501 (TTER?=?0.28; 95%CI 0.12, 0.63; FDR?=?0.03) and RARB Cluster 1 (TTER?=?0.46; 95% CI 0.29, 0.71; FDR?=?0.01). There was evidence of similar trends for DAPK1 cg14286732, PAX1 cg07213060, and PAX1 Cluster 1. The EWAS detected 336 novel progression-associated CpGs, including those located in CpG islands associated with genes FGF22, TOX, COL18A1, GPM6A, XAB2, TIMP2, GSPT1, NR4A2, and APBB1IP.Using prospective time-to-event data, we detected associations between CADM1-, DAPK1-, PAX1-, and RARB-related CpGs and cervical disease progression, and we identified novel progression-associated CpGs.Methylation levels at novel CpG sites may help identify individuals with??CIN1 histology at higher risk of progression to CIN2+?and inform risk-based cervical cancer screening guidelines.© 2023.

PhenoAge and GrimAge values were calculated using a residual-based method. We tested the association of urinary As with epigenetic aging measures using linear regression, the association of epigenetic aging measures with the three health outcomes using additive hazards models, and the mediation of As-related CVD incidence, CVD mortality, and all-cause mortality by epigenetic aging measures using the product of coefficients method.SHS participants with higher vs. lower urinary As levels had similar PhenoAge age, older GrimAge age, and faster DunedinPACE. An interquartile range increase in urinary As was associated with higher of PhenoAge age acceleration [mean?difference?(95%?confidence?interval)=0.48(0.17, 0.80) years], GrimAge age acceleration [0.80 (0.60, 1.00) years], and DunedinPACE [0.011 (0.005, 0.018)], after adjusting for age, sex, center location, genetic components, smoking status, and body mass index. Of the 347 incident CVD events per 100,000 person-years associated with a doubling in As exposure, 21.3% (9.1, 57.1) and 22.6% (9.5, 56.9), were attributable to differences in GrimAge and DunedinPACE, respectively.Arsenic exposure was associated with older GrimAge and faster DunedinPACE measures of biological age. Furthermore, accelerated biological aging measured from DNA methylation accounted for a relevant fraction of As-associated risk for CVD, CVD mortality, and all-cause mortality in the SHS, supporting the role of As in accelerated aging. Research of the biological underpinnings can contribute to a better understanding of the role of aging in arsenic-related disease. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP11981.",1

Epigenomic factors, including DNA methylation clocks that may mark underlying biological aging, have been implicated in the link between social factors and health.To examine the associations of neighborhood segregation and poverty with 4 DNA methylation clocks trained to capture either chronological age or physiological dysregulation.This cohort study uses data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), a longitudinal study that started in 2000 to 2002, with follow-up in 2002 to 2004, 2004 to 2005, 2005 to 2007, and 2010 to 2012. In 2000 to 2002, adults who identified as White or Black race or Hispanic or Chinese ethnicity in 6 US sites (Baltimore, Maryland; Chicago, Illinois; Forsyth County, North Carolina; Los Angeles County, California; Northern Manhattan, New York; and St. Paul, Minnesota) were sampled for recruitment. A random subsample of 4 sites (Maryland, North Carolina, New York, and Minnesota) were selected for inclusion in the MESA epigenomics ancillary study at examination 5 (2010-2012). Participants who identified as White or Black race or Hispanic ethnicity, were aged 45 to 84 years, and did not have clinical cardiovascular disease were included in this analysis. Data were analyzed from May 2021 to October 2023.Information on 2000 census tract poverty and Getis-Ord G statistic segregation of Hispanic residents, non-Hispanic Black residents, or non-Hispanic White residents were linked to participant addresses at examination 1 (2000-2002).At examination 5, DNA methylation was measured in purified monocytes. DNA methylation age acceleration was calculated using 4 clocks trained on either chronological age or physiological dysregulation. Linear regressions were used to test associations.A total of 1102 participants (mean [SD] age, 69.7 [9.4] years; 562 [51%] women) were included, with 348 Hispanic participants, 222 non-Hispanic Black participants, and 533 non-Hispanic White participants. For non-Hispanic Black participants, living in tracts with greater segregation of Black residents was associated with GrimAge DNA methylation age acceleration, a clock designed to capture physiological dysregulation. A 1-SD increase in segregation was associated with 0.42 (95% CI, 0.20-0.64) years age acceleration (P?<?.001); this association was not observed with other clocks. This association was particularly pronounced for participants living in high poverty tracts (interaction term, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.07-0.42; P?=?.006). In the overall sample, census tract poverty level was associated with GrimAge DNA methylation age acceleration (??=?0.45; 95% CI, 0.20-0.71; adjusted P?=?.005).These findings suggest that epigenomic mechanisms may play a role in the associations of segregated and poor neighborhoods with chronic conditions.",1
,37953967,Associations Between Epigenetic Age Acceleration and microRNA Expression Among U.S. Firefighters.,Epigenet Insights,"Epigenetic changes may be biomarkers of health. Epigenetic age acceleration (EAA), the discrepancy between epigenetic age measured via epigenetic clocks and chronological age, is associated with morbidity and mortality. However, the intersection of epigenetic clocks with microRNAs (miRNAs) and corresponding miRNA-based health implications have not been evaluated. We analyzed DNA methylation and miRNA profiles from blood sampled among 332 individuals enrolled across 2 U.S.-based firefighter occupational studies (2015-2018 and 2018-2020). We considered 7 measures of EAA in leukocytes (PhenoAge, GrimAge, Horvath, skin-blood, and Hannum epigenetic clocks, and extrinsic and intrinsic epigenetic age acceleration). We identified miRNAs associated with EAA using individual linear regression models, adjusted for sex, race/ethnicity, chronological age, and cell type estimates, and investigated downstream effects of associated miRNAs with miRNA enrichment analyses and genomic annotations. On average, participants were 38?years old, 88% male, and 75% non-Hispanic white. We identified 183 of 798 miRNAs associated with EAA (FDRq?<?0.05); 126 with PhenoAge, 59 with GrimAge, 1 with Horvath, and 1 with the skin-blood clock. Among miRNAs associated with Horvath and GrimAge, there were 61 significantly enriched disease annotations including age-related metabolic and cardiovascular conditions and several cancers. Enriched pathways included those related to proteins and protein modification. We identified miRNAs associated with EAA of multiple epigenetic clocks. PhenoAge had more associations with individual miRNAs, but GrimAge and Horvath had greater implications for miRNA-associated pathways. Understanding the relationship between these epigenetic markers could contribute to our understanding of the molecular underpinnings of aging and aging-related diseases.© The Author(s) 2023.",1
,37983304,"Epigenetic age acceleration, neonatal morbidities, and neurobehavioral profiles in infants born very preterm.",Epigenetics,"Epigenetic age acceleration is a risk factor for chronic diseases of ageing and may reflect aspects of biological ageing. However, few studies have examined epigenetic ageing during the early neonatal period in preterm infants, who are at heightened risk of developmental problems. We examined relationships between neonatal age acceleration, neonatal morbidities, and neurobehavioral domains among very preterm (<30?weeks gestation) infants to characterize whether infants with early morbidities or different neurobehavioral characteristics had accelerated or decelerated epigenetic ageing. This study uses data from the Neonatal Neurobehavior and Outcomes in Very Preterm Infants (NOVI) study, restricted to infants with data on variables assessed (n?=?519). We used generalized estimating equations to test for differences in age acceleration associated with severe neonatal medical morbidities and neurobehavioral characteristics. We found that infants with neonatal morbidities, in particular, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), had accelerated epigenetic age - and some evidence that infants with hypertonicity and asymmetric reflexes had increased and decreased age acceleration, respectively. Adjustment for gestational age attenuated some associations, suggesting that the relationships observed may be driven by the duration of gestation. Our most robust finding shows that very preterm infants with neonatal morbidities (BPD in particular) exhibit age acceleration, but most neonatal neurobehavioral characteristics and morbidities are not associated with early life age acceleration. Lower gestational age at birth may be an upstream factor driving these associations.",1
x,37968697,Circulating metabolites may illustrate relationship of alcohol consumption with cardiovascular disease.,BMC Med,"Metabolite signatures of long-term alcohol consumption are lacking. To better understand the molecular basis linking alcohol drinking and cardiovascular disease (CVD), we investigated circulating metabolites associated with long-term alcohol consumption and examined whether these metabolites were associated with incident CVD.Cumulative average alcohol consumption (g/day) was derived from the total consumption of beer, wine, and liquor on average of 19 years in 2428 Framingham Heart Study Offspring participants (mean age 56 years, 52% women). We used linear mixed models to investigate the associations of alcohol consumption with 211 log-transformed plasma metabolites, adjusting for age, sex, batch, smoking, diet, physical activity, BMI, and familial relationship. Cox models were used to test the association of alcohol-related metabolite scores with fatal and nonfatal incident CVD (myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease, stroke, and heart failure).We identified 60 metabolites associated with cumulative average alcohol consumption (p?<?0.05/211 ? 0.00024). For example, 1 g/day increase of alcohol consumption was associated with higher levels of cholesteryl esters (e.g., CE 16:1, beta?=?0.023?±?0.002, p?=?6.3e?-?45) and phosphatidylcholine (e.g., PC 32:1, beta?=?0.021?±?0.002, p?=?3.1e?-?38). Survival analysis identified that 10 alcohol-associated metabolites were also associated with a differential CVD risk after adjusting for age, sex, and batch. Further, we built two alcohol consumption weighted metabolite scores using these 10 metabolites and showed that, with adjustment age, sex, batch, and common CVD risk factors, the two scores had comparable but opposite associations with incident CVD, hazard ratio 1.11 (95% CI?=?[1.02, 1.21], p?=?0.02) vs 0.88 (95% CI?=?[0.78, 0.98], p?=?0.02).We identified 60 long-term alcohol consumption-associated metabolites.

Here, we extend prior work by examining the association of maternal ACEs, and their interaction with financial stress and discrimination, with methylation status within eight differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in imprinted domains in newborns. ACEs, financial stress during pregnancy, and experience of discrimination were self-reported among 232 pregnant women. DNA methylation was assessed atPEG10/SGCE, NNAT, IGF2, H19, PLAGL1,PEG3,MEG3-IG, andDLK1/MEG3regulatory sequences using pyrosequencing. Using multivariable linear regression models, we found evidence to suggest that financial stress was associated with hypermethylation ofMEG3-IGin non-Hispanic White newborns; discrimination was associated with hypermethylation ofIGF2andNNATin Hispanic newborns, and with hypomethylation ofPEG3in non-Hispanic Black newborns. We also found evidence that maternal ACEs interacted with discrimination to predict offspringPLAGL1altered DMR methylation, in addition to interactions between maternal ACEs score and discrimination predictingH19andSGCE/PEG10altered methylation in non-Hispanic White newborns. However, these interactions were not statistically significant after multiple testing corrections. Findings from this study suggest that maternal ACEs, discrimination, and financial stress are associated with newborn aberrant methylation in imprinted gene regions.",1
e,37950287,DNA methylation sites in early adulthood characterised by pubertal timing and development: a twin study.,Clin Epigenetics,"Puberty is a highly heritable and variable trait, with environmental factors having a role in its eventual timing and development. Early and late pubertal onset are both associated with various diseases developing later in life, and epigenetic characterisation of pubertal timing and development could lead to important insights. Blood DNA methylation, reacting to both genotype and environment, has been associated with puberty; however, such studies are relatively scarce. We investigated peripheral blood DNA methylation profiles (using Illumina 450 K and EPIC platforms) of 1539 young adult Finnish twins associated with pubertal development scale (PDS) at ages 12 and 14 as well as pubertal age (PA).Fixed effect meta-analysis of the two platforms on 347,521 CpGs in common identified 58 CpG sites associated (p?<?1?×?10-5) with either PDS or PA. All four CpGs associated with PA and 45 CpGs associated with PDS were sex-specific. Thirteen CpGs had a high heritability (h2: 0.51-0.98), while one CpG site (mapped to GET4) had a high shared environmental component accounting for 68% of the overall variance in methylation at the site. Utilising twin discordance analysis, we found 6 CpG sites (5 associated with PDS and 1 with PA) that had an environmentally driven association with puberty. Furthermore, genes with PDS- or PA-associated CpGs were consistently linked to various developmental processes and diseases such as breast, prostate and ovarian cancer, while methylation quantitative trait loci of associated CpG sites were enriched in immune pathways developing during puberty.By identifying puberty-associated DNA methylation sites and examining the effects of sex, environment and genetics, we shed light on the intricate interplay between environment and genetics in the context of puberty. Through our comprehensive analysis, we not only deepen the understanding of the significance of both genetic and environmental factors in the complex processes of puberty and its timing, but also gain insights into potential links with disease risks.© 2023.

e,38041176,DNA methylation profiles reveal sex-specific associations between gestational exposure to ambient air pollution and placenta cell-type composition in the PRISM cohort study.,Clin Epigenetics,"Gestational exposure to ambient air pollution has been associated with adverse health outcomes for mothers and newborns. The placenta is a central regulator of the in utero environment that orchestrates development and postnatal life via fetal programming. Ambient air pollution contaminants can reach the placenta and have been shown to alter bulk placental tissue DNA methylation patterns. Yet the effect of air pollution on placental cell-type composition has not been examined. We aimed to investigate whether the exposure to ambient air pollution during gestation is associated with placental cell types inferred from DNA methylation profiles.We leveraged data from 226 mother-infant pairs in the Programming of Intergenerational Stress Mechanisms (PRISM) longitudinal cohort in the Northeastern US. Daily concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) at 1 km spatial resolution were estimated from a spatiotemporal model developed with satellite data and linked to womens' addresses during pregnancy and infants' date of birth. The proportions of six cell types [syncytiotrophoblasts, trophoblasts, stromal, endothelial, Hofbauer and nucleated red blood cells (nRBCs)] were derived from placental tissue 450K DNA methylation array. We applied compositional regression to examine overall changes in placenta cell-type composition related to PM2.5average by pregnancy trimester. We also investigated the association between PM2.5and individual cell types using beta regression. All analyses were performed in the overall sample and stratified by infant sex adjusted for covariates.In male infants, first trimester (T1) PM2.5was associated with changes in placental cell composition (p?=?0.03), driven by a decrease [per one PM2.5interquartile range (IQR)] of 0.037 in the syncytiotrophoblasts proportion (95% confidence interval (CI) [-?0.066, -?0.012]), accompanied by an increase in trophoblasts of 0.033 (95% CI: [0.009, 0.064]). In females, second and third trimester PM2.5were associated with overall changes in placental cell-type composition (T2: p?=?0.040; T3: p?=?0.049), with a decrease in the nRBC proportion. Individual cell-type analysis with beta regression showed similar results with an additional association found for third trimester PM2.5and stromal cells in females (decrease of 0.054, p?=?0.024).Gestational exposure to air pollution was associated with placenta cell composition. Further research is needed to corroborate these findings and evaluate their role in PM2.5-related impact in the placenta and consequent fetal programming.© 2023. The Author(s).",1
,37977327,Breastfeeding and the Longitudinal Changes of Body Mass Index in Childhood and Adulthood: A Systematic Review.,Adv Nutr,"Mounting evidence supports the beneficial role of breastfeeding in lowering obesity risk, but the enduring impact of breastfeeding on longitudinal changes in body mass index (BMI) (i.e., BMI trajectories) remains unclear. This systematic review summarized evidence on how breastfeeding influenced the longitudinal trajectories of BMI later in life. Literature searches were conducted in Medline, Embase, Web of Science, and ScienceDirect to identify studies that assessed how breastfeeding (versus other feeding types or duration) was associated with longitudinal trajectories of BMI or BMI z-score. Three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 24 longitudinal cohort studies were included. Two-thirds (18/27) of studies were rated as acceptable or high quality. Most cohort studies (9/11) showed that children who continued to breastfeed at 3 to 12 mo of age had a lower BMI trajectory or lower odds of following a high BMI trajectory than those who were formula-fed or mixed-fed. The BMI differences between breastfeeding and other feeding groups were evident from age 7 mo and remained up to 8 y, and the magnitude of between-group BMI differences increased with age. For breastfeeding duration, 12 out of 15 cohort studies found that longer breastfeeding duration was associated with lower BMI trajectories up to age 18 y. Moreover, beneficial associations were observed for both exclusive and any breastfeeding with BMI trajectory. In contrast, mixed findings were reported from 3 RCTs that compared BMI trajectories from birth to ages 12 to 24 mo between breastfeeding promotion versus control or breastfeeding versus formula-feeding groups. The current review provides further longitudinal evidence from cohort studies that breastfeeding versus formula/mixed feeding or longer breastfeeding duration was associated with lower BMI trajectories. Such associations initiated in early childhood became more apparent with age and were sustained into early adulthood. The existing evidence substantiates the importance of breastfeeding promotion and continuation to support obesity prevention.Copyright © 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Liver cancer deaths (n?=?21) were ascertained using death certificates obtained through 2017. The mean follow-up duration (SD) for non-cases was 25.1 (5.6) years and for cases, 11.0 (8.8) years. DNA methylation was assessed from blood samples collected at baseline using MethylationEPIC BeadChip 850 K arrays. We used Cox regression models adjusted for age, sex, center, body mass index, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, smoking, alcohol consumption, and immune cell proportions to examine the associations.We identified 9 CpG sites associated with liver cancer. cg16057201 annotated to MRFAP1) was hypermethylated among cases vs. non-cases (hazard ratio (HR) for one standard deviation increase in methylation was 1.25 (95% CI 1.14, 1.37). The other eight CpGs were hypomethylated and the corresponding HRs (95% CI) ranged from 0.58 (0.44, 0.75) for cg04967787 (annotated to PPRC1) to 0.77 (0.67, 0.88) for cg08550308. We also assessed 7 differentially methylated CpG sites associated with liver cancer in previous studies. The adjusted HR for cg15079934 (annotated to LPS1) was 1.93 (95% CI 1.10, 3.39).Blood DNA methylation may be associated with liver cancer mortality and may be altered during the development of liver cancer.© 2023.

x,38053194,Integration of datasets for individual prediction of DNA methylation-based biomarkers.,Genome Biol,"Epigenetic scores (EpiScores) can provide biomarkers of lifestyle and disease risk. Projecting new datasets onto a reference panel is challenging due to separation of technical and biological variation with array data. Normalisation can standardise data distributions but may also remove population-level biological variation.We compare two birth cohorts (Lothian Birth Cohorts of 1921 and 1936 - nLBC1921= 387 and nLBC1936= 498) with blood-based DNA methylation assessed at the same chronological age (79 years) and processed in the same lab but in different years and experimental batches. We examine the effect of 16 normalisation methods on a novel BMI EpiScore (trained in an external cohort, n = 18,413), and Horvath's pan-tissue DNA methylation age, when the cohorts are normalised separately and together. The BMI EpiScore explains a maximum variance of R2=24.5% in BMI in LBC1936 (SWAN normalisation). Although there are cross-cohort R2differences, the normalisation method makes a minimal difference to within-cohort estimates. Conversely, a range of absolute differences are seen for individual-level EpiScore estimates for BMI and age when cohorts are normalised separately versus together. While within-array methods result in identical EpiScores whether a cohort is normalised on its own or together with the second dataset, a range of differences is observed for between-array methods.Normalisation methods returning similar EpiScores, whether cohorts are analysed separately or together, will minimise technical variation when projecting new data onto a reference panel. These methods are important for cases where raw data is unavailable and joint normalisation of cohorts is computationally expensive.© 2023. The Author(s).",1

In this study, we explored the epigenetic landscape of diabetes using data from the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study (KoGES), specifically the Ansung-Ansan (AS-AS) cohort. Using epigenome-wide association studies, we investigated DNA methylation patterns in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and those with normal glucose regulation. Differential methylation analysis revealed 106 differentially methylated probes (DMPs), with the 10 top DMPs prominently associated with TXNIP, PDK4, NBPF20, ARRDC4, UFM1, PFKFB2, C7orf50, and ABCG1, indicating significant changes in methylation. Correlation analysis highlighted the association between the leading DMPs (e.g., cg19693031 and cg26974062 for TXNIP and cg26823705 for NBPF20) and key glycemic markers (fasting plasma glucose and hemoglobin A1c), confirming their relevance in T2DM. Moreover, we identified 62 significantly differentially methylated regions (DMRs) spanning 61 genes. A DMR associated with PDE1C showed hypermethylation, whereas DMRs associated with DIP2C, FLJ90757, PRSS50, and TDRD9 showed hypomethylation. PDE1C and TDRD9 showed a strong positive correlation between the CpG sites included in each DMR, which have previously been implicated in T2DM-related processes. This study contributes to the understanding of epigenetic modifications in T2DM. These valuable insights can be utilized in identifying potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for effective management and prevention of diabetes.",1

In 2016, the first international consortium paper on cigarette smoking during pregnancy and offspring DNA methylation identified extensive, reproducible exposure signals. This finding raised expectations for epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) of other exposures.We review the current state-of-the-science for DNA methylation associations across prenatal exposures in humans and provide future recommendations.We reviewed 134 prenatal environmental EWAS of DNA methylation in newborns, focusing on 51 epidemiological studies with meta-analysis or replication testing. Exposures spanned cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, air pollution, dietary factors, psychosocial stress, metals, other chemicals, and other exogenous factors. Of the reproducible DNA methylation signatures, we examined implementation as exposure biomarkers.Only 19 (14%) of these prenatal EWAS were conducted in cohorts of 1,000 or more individuals, reflecting the still early stage of the field. To date, the largest perinatal EWAS sample size was 6,685 participants. For comparison, the most recent genome-wide association study for birth weight included more than 300,000 individuals. Replication, at some level, was successful with exposures to cigarette smoking, folate, dietary glycemic index, particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter<10?mand<2.5?m, nitrogen dioxide, mercury, cadmium, arsenic, electronic waste, PFAS, and DDT. Reproducible effects of a more limited set of prenatal exposures (smoking, folate) enabled robust methylation biomarker creation.Current evidence demonstrates the scientific premise for reproducible DNA methylation exposure signatures. Better powered EWAS could identify signatures across many exposures and enable comprehensive biomarker development. Whether methylation biomarkers of exposures themselves cause health effects remains unclear. We expect that larger EWAS with enhanced coverage of epigenome and exposome, along with improved single-cell technologies and evolving methods for integrative multi-omics analyses and causal inference, will expand mechanistic understanding of causal links between environmental exposures, the epigenome, and health outcomes throughout the life course. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP12956.",1
,38045296,Genetic association study of Preterm birth and Gestational age in a population-based case-control study in Peru: Genetics of PTB and GA in pregnant women in Peru.,medRxiv,"Preterm birth (PTB) is an adverse pregnancy outcome affecting ~15 million pregnancies worldwide. Genetic studies have identified several candidate loci for PTB, but results remain inconclusive and limited to European populations. Thus, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of PTB and gestational age at delivery (GA) among 2,212 Peruvian women. PTB cases delivered ? 20 weeks' but < 37 weeks' gestation, while controls delivered at term (? 37 weeks but < 42 weeks). After imputation (TOPMED) and quality control, we assessed the association of ~6 million SNPs with PTB and GA using multivariable regression models adjusted for maternal age and the first two genetic principal components.In silicofunctional analysis (FUMA-GWAS) was conducted among top signals detected with an arbitraryP< 1.0×10-5in each GWAS. We sought to replicate genetic associations with PTB and GA identified in Europeans, and we developed a genetic risk score for GA based on European markers. Mean GA was 30 ± 4 weeks in PTB cases (N=933) and 39 ± 1 in the controls (N=1,279). PTB cases were slightly older and had higher C-sections and vaginal bleeding than controls. No association was identified at genome-wide level. Top suggestive (P< 1.0×10-5) signals were seen at rs13151645 (LINC01182) for PTB, and at rs72824565 (CTNNA2) for GA. Top PTB variants were enriched for biological pathways associated with polyketide, progesterone, steroid hormones, and glycosyl metabolism. Top GA variants were enriched in intronic regions and cancer pathways, and these genes were upregulated in the brain and subcutaneous adipose tissue. In combination with non-genetic risk factors, top SNPs explained 14% and 15% of the phenotypic variance of PTB and GA in our sample, but these results need to be interpreted with caution. Variants inWNT4associated with GA in Europeans were replicated in our study. The genetic risk score based in European markers, was associated with a 2-day longer GA (R2=0.003,P=0.002) per standard deviation increase in the score in our sample. This genetic association study identified various signals suggestively associated with PTB and GA in a non-European population; they were linked to relevant biological pathways related to the metabolism of progesterone, prostanoid, and steroid hormones, and genes associated with GA were significantly upregulated in relevant tissues for the pathophysiology of PTB based on thein-silicofunctional analysis. None of these top variants overlapped with signals previously identified for PTB or GA in Europeans.",1
,37987302,Stress and DNA Methylation of Blood Leukocytes among Pregnant Latina Women.,Epigenomes,"Latinas experience physical and psychological stressors in pregnancy leading to increased morbidity and higher risk for adverse birth outcomes. Epigenetic changes, including DNA methylation (DNAm), have been proposed as markers to create more refined risk stratification, yet few of these studies have examined these changes in Latinas. We conducted a secondary analysis of stored blood leukocytes of Latina women (n = 58) enrolled in a larger National Institutes of Health funded R01 project (2011-2016). We examined DNAm on eight candidate stress genes to compare physically and psychologically stressed participants to healthy (low stress) participants. We found unique CpGs that were differentially methylated in stressed women early- and mid-pregnancy compared to the healthy group, though none remained significant after FDR correction. Both physical and psychological stress were associated with hypomethylation at two consecutive CpG sites on NR3C1 in early pregnancy and one CpG site on NR3C1 in mid-pregnancy before adjustment. Stress was also associated with hypomethylation at two CpG sites on FKBP5 in early and mid-pregnancy but were no longer significant after FDR adjustment. Though we did not find statistically significant differences in DNAm during pregnancy between stressed and healthy women in this sample, signals were consistent with previous findings. Future work in larger samples should further examine the associations between stress and DNAm in pregnancy as this mechanism may explain underlying perinatal health inequities.",1
x,37992405,Examination of newborn DNA methylation among women with polycystic ovary syndrome/hirsutism.,Epigenetics,"Research suggests that polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) traits (e.g., hyperandrogenism) may create a suboptimal intrauterine environment and induce epigenetic modifications. Therefore, we assessed the associations of PCOS traits with neonatal DNA methylation (DNAm) using two independent cohorts. DNAm was measured in both cohorts using the Infinium MethylationEPIC array. Multivariable robust linear regression was used to determine associations of maternal PCOS exposure or preconception testosterone with methylation ?-values at each CpG probe and corrected for multiple testing by false-discovery rate (FDR). In the birth cohort, 12% (102/849) had a PCOS diagnosis (8.1% PCOS without hirsutism; 3.9% PCOS with hirsutism). Infants exposed to maternal PCOS with hirsutism compared to no PCOS had differential DNAm at cg02372539 [?(SE): -0.080 (0.010); FDRp?=?0.009], cg08471713 [?(SE):0.077 (0.014); FDRp?=?0.016] and cg17897916 [?(SE):0.050 (0.009); FDRp?=?0.009] with adjustment for maternal characteristics including pre-pregnancy BMI. PCOS with hirsutism was also associated with 8 differentially methylated regions (DMRs). PCOS without hirsutism was not associated with individual CpGs. In an independent preconception cohort, total testosterone concentrations were associated with 3 DMRs but not with individual CpGs, though the top quartile of testosterone compared to the lowest was marginally associated with increased DNAm at cg21472377 near an uncharacterized locus (FDRp?=?0.09). Examination of these probes and DMRs indicate they may be under foetal genetic control. Overall, we found several associations among newborns exposed to PCOS, specifically when hirsutism was reported, and among newborns of women with relatively higher testosterone around conception.",1
,38022394,Critical windows of greenness exposure during preconception and gestational periods in association with birthweight outcomes.,Environ Res Health,"Few studies have examined the association between greenness exposure and birth outcomes. This study aims to identify critical exposure time windows during preconception and pregnancy for the association between greenness exposure and birth weight. A cohort of 13?890 pregnant women and newborns in Shanghai, China from 2016-2019 were included in the study. We assessed greenness exposure using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) during the preconception and gestational periods, and evaluated the association with term birthweight, birthweightz-score, small-for-gestational age, and large-for-gestational age using linear and logistic regressions adjusting for key maternal and newborn covariates. Ambient temperature, relative humidity, ambient levels of fine particles (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) assessed during the same period were adjusted for as sensitivity analyses. Furthermore, we explored the potential different effects by urbanicity and park accessibility through stratified analysis. We found that higher greenness exposure at the second trimester of pregnancy and averaged exposure during the entire pregnancy were associated with higher birthweight and birthweightZ-score. Specifically, a 0.1 unit increase in second trimester averaged NDVI value was associated with an increase in birthweight of 10.2 g (95% CI: 1.8-18.5 g) and in birthweightZ-score of 0.024 (0.003-0.045). A 0.1 unit increase in an averaged NDVI during the entire pregnancy was associated with 10.1 g (95% CI: 1.0-19.2 g) increase in birthweight and 0.025 (0.001-0.048) increase in birthweightZ-score. Moreover, the associations were larger in effect size among urban residents than suburban residents and among residents without park accessibility within 500 m compared to those with park accessibility within 500 m. Our findings suggest that increased greenness exposure, particularly during the second trimester, may be beneficial to birth weight in a metropolitan area.© 2023 The Author(s).

,38105948,Neuronal-specific methylome and hydroxymethylome analysis reveal replicated and novel loci associated with alcohol use disorder.,medRxiv,"Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a complex condition associated with adverse health consequences that affect millions of individuals worldwide. Epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation (5mC), have been associated with AUD and other alcohol-related traits. Epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) have identified differentially methylated genes associated with AUD in human peripheral and brain tissue. More recently, epigenetic studies of AUD have also evaluated DNA hydroxymethylation (5hmC) in the human brain. However, most of the epigenetic work in postmortem brain tissue has examined bulk tissue. In this study, we investigated neuronal-specific 5mC and 5hmC alterations at CpG sites associated with AUD in the human orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Neuronal nuclei from the OFC were evaluated in 34 human postmortem brain samples (10 AUD, 24 non-AUD). Reduced representation oxidative bisulfite sequencing was used to assess 5mC and 5hmC at the genome-wide level. Differential 5mC and 5hmC were evaluated using the methylKit R package and significance was set at false discovery rate <0.05 and differential methylation >2. Functional enrichment analyses were performed and replication was evaluated replication in an independent dataset that assessed 5mC and 5hmC of AUD in bulk cortical tissue. We identified 417 5mC and 363 5hmC genome-wide significant differential CpG sites associated with AUD, with 59% in gene promoters. We also identified genes previously implicated in alcohol consumption, such asSYK,CHRM2,DNMT3A, andGATA4, for 5mC andGATA4, andGAD1,GATA4,DLX1for 5hmC. Replication was observed for 28 CpG sites from a previous AUD 5mC and 5hmC study, includingFOXP1. Lastly, GWAS enrichment analysis showed an association with AUD for differential 5mC genes. This study reveals neuronal-specific methylome and hydroxymethylome dysregulation associated with AUD. We replicated previous findings and identified novel associations with AUD for both 5mC and 5hmC marks within the OFC. Our findings provide new insights into the epigenomic dysregulation of AUD in the human brain.",1
x,37995466,Cord blood DNA methylation signatures associated with preeclampsia are enriched for cardiovascular pathways: insights from the VDAART trial.,EBioMedicine,"Preeclampsia has been associated with maternal epigenetic changes, in particular DNA methylation changes in the placenta. It has been suggested that preeclampsia could also cause DNA methylation changes in the neonate. We examined DNA methylation in relation to gene expression in the cord blood of offspring born to mothers with preeclampsia.This study included 128 mother-child pairs who participated in the Vitamin D Antenatal Asthma Reduction Trial (VDAART), where assessment of preeclampsia served as secondary outcome. We performed an epigenome-wide association study of preeclampsia and cord blood DNA methylation (Illumina 450 K chip). We then examined gene expression of the same subjects for validation and replicated the gene signatures in independent DNA methylation datasets. Lastly, we applied functional enrichment and network analyses to identify biological pathways that could potentially be involved in preeclampsia.In the cord blood samples (n = 128), 263 CpGs were differentially methylated (FDR <0.10) in preeclampsia (n = 16), of which 217 were annotated. Top pathways in the functional enrichment analysis included apelin signaling pathway and other endothelial and cardiovascular pathways. Of the 217 genes, 13 showed differential expression (p's < 0.001) in preeclampsia and 11 had been previously related to preeclampsia (p's < 0.0001). These genes were linked to apelin, cGMP and Notch signaling pathways, all having a role in angiogenic process and cardiovascular function.Preeclampsia is related to differential cord blood DNA methylation signatures of cardiovascular pathways, including the apelin signaling pathway. The association of these cord blood DNA methylation signatures with offspring's long-term morbidities due to preeclampsia should be further investigated.VDAART is funded by National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute grants of R01HL091528 and UH3OD023268.

x,38012757,A novel approach to risk exposure and epigenetics-the use of multidimensional context to gain insights into the early origins of cardiometabolic and neurocognitive health.,BMC Med,"Each mother-child dyad represents a unique combination of genetic and environmental factors. This constellation of variables impacts the expression of countless genes. Numerous studies have uncovered changes in DNA methylation (DNAm), a form of epigenetic regulation, in offspring related to maternal risk factors. How these changes work together to link maternal-child risks to childhood cardiometabolic and neurocognitive traits remains unknown. This question is a key research priority as such traits predispose to future non-communicable diseases (NCDs). We propose viewing risk and the genome through a multidimensional lens to identify common DNAm patterns shared among diverse risk profiles.We identified multifactorial Maternal Risk Profiles (MRPs) generated from population-based data (n?=?15,454, Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC)). Using cord blood HumanMethylation450 BeadChip data, we identified genome-wide patterns of DNAm that co-vary with these MRPs. We tested the prospective relation of these DNAm patterns (n?=?914) to future outcomes using decision tree analysis. We then tested the reproducibility of these patterns in (1) DNAm data at age 7 and 17 years within the same cohort (n?=?973 and 974, respectively) and (2) cord DNAm in an independent cohort, the Generation R Study (n?=?686).We identified twenty MRP-related DNAm patterns at birth in ALSPAC. Four were prospectively related to cardiometabolic and/or neurocognitive childhood outcomes. These patterns were replicated in DNAm data from blood collected at later ages. Three of these patterns were externally validated in cord DNAm data in Generation R. Compared to previous literature, DNAm patterns exhibited novel spatial distribution across the genome that intersects with chromatin functional and tissue-specific signatures.To our knowledge, we are the first to leverage multifactorial population-wide data to detect patterns of variability in DNAm. This context-based approach decreases biases stemming from overreliance on specific samples or variables. We discovered molecular patterns demonstrating prospective and replicable relations to complex traits. Moreover, results suggest that patterns harbour a genome-wide organisation specific to chromatin regulation and target tissues. These preliminary findings warrant further investigation to better reflect the reality of human context in molecular studies of NCDs.© 2023. The Author(s).",1

AITD etiology is incompletely understood: genetic factors may account for up to 75% of phenotypic variance, whereas epigenetic effects (including DNA methylation (DNAm)) may contribute to the remaining variance (e.g. why some individuals develop GD and others HD).To identify differentially methylated positions (DMPs) and differentially methylated regions (DMRs) comparing GD to HD.Whole blood DNAm was measured across the genome using the Infinium MethylationEPIC array in 32 Australian patients with GD and 30 with HD (discovery cohort) and 32 Danish patients with GD and 32 with HD (replication cohort). Linear mixed models were used to test for differences in quantile-normalized beta values of DNAm between GD and HD and data were later meta-analyzed. Comb-p software was used to identify DMRs.We identified epigenome-wide significant differences (p<9E-8) and replicated (p<0.05) 2 DMPs between GD and HD (cg06315208 within MDC1 and cg00049440 within KLF9). We identified and replicated a DMR within CUTA (5 CpGs at 6p21.32). We also identified 64 DMPs and 137 DMRs in the meta-analysis.Our study reveals differences in DNAm between GD and HD, which may help explain why some people develop GD and others HD and provide a link to environmental risk factors. Additional research is needed to advance understanding of the role of DNAm in AITD and investigate its prognostic and therapeutic potential.© The Author(s) 2023.

Participants were recruited through the University of Maryland Medical Center, with additional collection sites at Baltimore-area hospitals. Data analysis was performed from March 1 through December 1, 2022.Year 2000 census tract-level socioeconomic deprivation measured via neighborhood deprivation index (NDI) as a standardized score, with Black and White race being ascertained through self-report.The primary outcome was tissue DNA methylation using genome-wide measurements. The secondary outcome was tissue gene expression.Participants included 185 women with breast cancer (110 Black [59.5%], 75 White [40.5%]). Mean (SD) age at surgery was 56.0 (14.1) years. Neighborhood deprivation was higher for Black women than for White women (Mean [SD] NDI, 2.96 [3.03] for Black women and -0.54 [1.91] for White women; difference, -3.50; 95% CI, -4.22 to -2.79; P?<?.001). In unstratified analysis, 8 hypomethylated CpG sites were identified as associated with the NDI, including sites in 2 tumor suppressor genes, LRIG1 and WWOX. Moreover, expression of the 2 genes inversely correlated with neighborhood deprivation. In the race-stratified analysis, the negative correlation between the LRIG1 gene body CpG site cg26131019 and the NDI remained significant in Black women. A neighborhood deprivation-associated decrease in gene expression was also observed for LRIG1 and WWOX in tumors from Black women.In this study, high neighborhood deprivation was associated with differences in tissue DNA methylation and gene expression among Black women. These findings suggest that continued investment in public health interventions and policy changes at the neighborhood level may help to remedy biological alterations that could make minoritized populations more susceptible to chronic diseases.",1

A linear mixed model was conducted in Epigenome-wide association study (EWAS). Generalized estimating equation model was for gene expression analysis. We conducted Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) to build co-methylated interconnected network. Additional Qingdao citizens were recruited for validation. Inference about Causation through Examination of Familial Confounding (ICE FALCON) was used to infer the possible direction of these relationships. A total of 476 top CpGs reached suggestively significant level (P?<?10-4), of which, 192 CpGs were significantly associated with TG (FDR?<?0.05). They were used to build interconnected network and highlight crucial genes from WGCNA. Finally, four CpGs in GATA4 were validated as risk factors for TC; six CpGs at ITFG2-AS1 were negatively associated with TG; two CpGs in PLXND1 played protective roles in HDL-C. ICE FALCON indicated abnormal TC was regarded as the consequence of DNA methylation in CpGs at GATA4, rather than vice versa. Four CpGs in ITFG2-AS1 were both causes and consequences of modified TG levels. Our results indicated that DNA methylation levels of 12 CpGs in GATA4, ITFG2-AS1, and PLXND1 were relevant to TC, TG, and HDL-C, respectively, which might provide new epigenetic insights into potential clinical treatment of dyslipidemia.© The Author(s) 2023.

Robust linear regressions were conducted for epigenome-wide association study. Multivariate linear and logistic regressions were performed to explore the associations of UCd with lipid levels and dyslipidemia risk, respectively. Mediation analyses were conducted to explore potential mediating role of DNAM in the associations of Cd with lipid levels and dyslipidemia risk.UCd was negatively associated with HDL levels (p = 0.01) and positively associated with dyslipidemia (p < 0.01). There were 92/11 DMPs/DMRs (FDR<0.05) associated with UCd. Cd-associated DNAM and pathways were connected with cardiometabolic diseases and immunity. Cg07829377 (LINC01060) mediated 42.05%/22.88% of the UCd-HDL/UCd-dyslipidemia associations (p = 0.02 and 0.01, respectively).Cadmium caused site-specific DNAM alterations and the associations of UCd with lipid levels and dyslipidemia risk may be partially mediated by DNAM.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

,38078706,Association of Air Pollution with a Urinary Biomarker of Biological Aging and Effect Modification by Vitamin K in the FLEMENGHO Prospective Population Study.,Environ Health Perspect,"A recently developed urinary peptidomics biological aging clock can be used to study accelerated human aging. From 1990 to 2019, exposure to airborne particulate matter (PM) became the leading environmental risk factor worldwide.This study investigated whether air pollution exposure is associated with accelerated urinary peptidomic aging, independent of calendar age, and whether this association is modified by other risk factors.In a Flemish population, the urinary peptidomic profile (UPP) age (UPP-age) was derived from the urinary peptidomic profile measured by capillary electrophoresis coupled with mass spectrometry. UPP-age-R was calculated as the residual of the regression of UPP-age on chronological age, which reflects accelerated aging predicted by UPP-age, independent of chronological age. A high-resolution spatial-temporal interpolation method was used to assess each individual's exposure toPM10,PM2.5, black carbon (BC), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). Associations of UPP-age-R with these pollutants were investigated by mixed models, accounting for clustering by residential address and confounders. Effect modifiers of the associations between UPP-age-R and air pollutants that included 18 factors reflecting vascular function, renal function, insulin resistance, lipid metabolism, or inflammation were evaluated. Direct and indirect (via UPP-age-R) effects of air pollution on mortality were evaluated by multivariable-adjusted Cox models.Among 660 participants (50.2% women; mean age: 50.7 y), higher exposure toPM10,PM2.5, BC, andNO2was associated with a higher UPP-age-R. Studying effect modifiers showed that higher plasma levels of desphospho-uncarboxylated matrix Gla protein (dpucMGP), signifying poorer vitamin K status, steepened the slopes of UPP-age-R on the air pollutants. In further analyses among participants with dpucMGP?4.26?g/L(median), an interquartile range (IQR) higher level inPM10,PM2.5, BC, andNO2was associated with a higher UPP-age-R of 2.03 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.60, 3.46], 2.22 (95% CI: 0.71, 3.74), 2.00 (95% CI: 0.56, 3.43), and 2.09 (95% CI: 0.77, 3.41) y, respectively. UPP-age-R was an indirect mediator of the associations of mortality with the air pollutants [multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios from 1.094 (95% CI: 1.000, 1.196) to 1.110 (95% CI: 1.007, 1.224)] in participants with a high dpucMGP, whereas no direct associations were observed.Ambient air pollution was associated with accelerated urinary peptidomics aging, and high vitamin K status showed a potential protective effect in this population. Current guidelines are insufficient to decrease the adverse health effects of airborne pollutants, including healthy aging trajectories. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP13414.",1
,38037563,Connections between cross-tissue and intra-tissue biomarkers of aging biology in older adults.,Epigenetics Commun,"Saliva measures are generally more accessible than blood, especially in vulnerable populations. However, connections between aging biology biomarkers in different body tissues remain unknown.The present study included individuals (N= 2406) who consented for saliva and blood draw in the Health and Retirement Telomere length study in 2008 and the Venous blood study in 2016 who had complete data for both tissues. We assessed biological aging based on telomere length in saliva and DNA methylation and physiology measures in blood. DNA methylation clocks combine information from CpGs to produce the aging measures representative of epigenetic aging in humans. We analyzed DNA methylation clocks proposed by Horvath (353 CpG sites), Hannum (71 CpG sites), Levine or PhenoAge, (513 CpG sites), GrimAge, (epigenetic surrogate markers for select plasma proteins), Horvath skin and blood (391 CpG sites), Lin (99 CpG sites), Weidner (3 CpG sites), and VidalBralo (8 CpG sites). Physiology measures (referred to as phenotypic age) included albumin, creatinine, glucose, [log] C-reactive protein, lymphocyte percent, mean cell volume, red blood cell distribution width, alkaline phosphatase, and white blood cell count. The phenotypic age algorithm is based on parametrization of Gompertz proportional hazard models. Average telomere length was assayed using quantitative PCR (qPCR) by comparing the telomere sequence copy number in each patient's sample (T) to a single-copy gene copy number (S). The resulting T/S ratio was proportional to telomere length, mean. Within individual, relationships between aging biology measures in blood and saliva and variations according to sex were assessed.Saliva-based telomere length showed inverse associations with both physiology-based and DNA methylation-based aging biology biomarkers in blood. Longer saliva-based telomere length was associated with 1 to 4 years slower biological aging based on blood-based biomarkers with the highest magnitude being Weidner (?= - 3.97,P= 0.005), GrimAge (?= - 3.33,P< 0.001), and Lin (?= - 3.45,P= 0.008) biomarkers of DNA methylation.There are strong connections between aging biology biomarkers in saliva and blood in older adults. Changes in telomere length vary with changes in DNA methylation and physiology biomarkers of aging biology. We observed variations in the relationship between each body system represented by physiology biomarkers and biological aging, particularly at the DNA methylation level. These observations provide novel opportunities for integration of both blood-based and saliva-based biomarkers in clinical care of vulnerable and clinically difficult to reach populations where either or both tissues would be accessible for clinical monitoring purposes.",1

Outcomes included five scales from the caregiver-reported Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and a self-reported delinquency scale. ND was defined in four ways: (1) a modified Sampson definition which included four neighborhood poverty variables; (2) a poverty-only definition which only included percent households below poverty; (3) an overextended definition which added a mediator between the ND-behavior relationship, and (4) an expanded definition which added six additional ND variables to the modified Sampson definition. Using effect estimates from generalized linear models, differences were calculated using percent change-in-estimate, with the modified Sampson as the referent.Effect estimates were similar for the modified Sampson and expanded definitions (<?5% difference). The poverty-only definition differed from the modified Sampson unsystematically. Estimates for the overextended definition were consistently larger compared to modified Sampson (10-37% greater). The expanded and modified Sampson definitions produced similar results.Poverty-only and overextended ND definitions should be interpreted with caution.© 2023.

However, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. This study aims to explore the mediation roles of obesity-related methylation sites in GLP1R gene variants-obesity association.A total of 300 Chinese adult participants were included in this study and classified into two groups: 180 metabolically healthy obesity (MHO) cases and 120 metabolically healthy normal-weight (MHNW) controls. Questionnaire investigation, physical measurement and laboratory examination were assessed in all participants. 18 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 31 CpG sites were selected for genotype and methylation assays. Causal inference test (CIT) was performed to evaluate the associations between GLP1R genetic variation, DNA methylation and MHO.The study found that rs4714211 polymorphism of GLP1R gene was significantly associated with MHO. Additionally, methylation sites in the intronic region of GLP1R (GLP1R-68-CpG 7.8.9; GLP1R-68-CpG 12.13; GLP1R-68-CpG 17; GLP1R-68-CpG 21) were associated with MHO, and two of these methylation sites (GLP1R-68-CpG 7.8.9; GLP1R-68-CpG 17) partially mediated the association between genotypes and MHO.Not only the gene polymorphism, but also the DNA methylation of GLP1R was associated with MHO.

This study compared the commonly used DNAm clocks, using DNA methylation and SNP data generated from nearly 1000 human blood or buccal swab samples. We evaluated different preprocessing methods for age estimation, investigated the association of epigenetic age acceleration (EAA) with various lifestyle and sociodemographic factors, and undertook a series of novel genome-wide association analyses for different EAA measures to find associated genetic variants. Our results highlighted the Skin&Blood clock with ssNoob normalization as the most accurate predictor of chronological age. We provided novel evidence for an association between the practice of yoga and a reduction in the pace of aging (DunedinPACE). Increased sleep and physical activity were associated with lower mortality risk score (MRS) in our dataset. University degree, vegetable consumption, and coffee intake were associated with reduced levels of epigenetic aging, whereas smoking, higher BMI, meat consumption, and manual occupation correlated well with faster epigenetic aging, with FitAge, GrimAge, and DunedinPACE clocks showing the most robust associations. In addition, we found a novel association signal for SOCS2 rs73218878 (p?=?2.87?×?10-8) and accelerated GrimAge. Our study emphasizes the importance of an optimized DNAm analysis workflow for accurate estimation of epigenetic age, which may influence downstream analyses. The results support the influence of genetic background on EAA. The associated SOCS2 is a member of the suppressor of cytokine signaling family known for its role in human longevity. The reported association between various risk factors and EAA has practical implications for the development of health programs to improve quality of life and reduce premature mortality associated with age-related diseases.© 2023.

We also investigated the association between the ASDR and SDI.There were 517.7 thousand deaths [95% UI: 413.9 to 634.5] in 2019. The number of deaths increased from 1990 to 2019. The ASMR and ASDR were 6.61 (5.24 to 8.17) and 143.02 (118.56 to 168.69) in 2019, respectively, representing a 46% and 44.5% decrease since 1990. China had the highest number of deaths [200,748.4 (151,897.6 to 260,703.9)], while Nepal had the highest ASMR [39 (27.7 to 50)] and ASDR [724.5 (549 to 894.2)]. Males and females 75-79 and 80-84 years old had the highest number of COPD deaths. A negative correlation was observed when SDI > 0.4, whereas a positive correlation was found when SDI < 0.4.From 1990 to 2019, there was an increase in the number of deaths, but a decline in ASMR and ASDR globally. Besides, there was a heterogeneous burden of COPD attributable to occupational particulate matter, gases, and fumes across regions and countries.

DHWFS is a natural-experiment birth-cohort study of survivors of in-utero exposure to famine conditions caused by the German occupation of the Western Netherlands in Winter 1944-5, matched controls, and their siblings. We conducted DNA methylation analysis of blood samples collected when the survivors were aged 58 to quantify biological aging using the DunedinPACE, GrimAge, and PhenoAge epigenetic clocks. Famine survivors had faster DunedinPACE, as compared with controls. This effect was strongest among women. Results were similar for GrimAge, although effect-sizes were smaller. We observed no differences in PhenoAge between survivors and controls. Famine effects were not accounted for by blood-cell composition and were similar for individuals exposed early and later in gestation.

Segmentation was performed using SliceOmatic (Tomovision©). Age prediction was based on the tooth tissue ratio (high signal soft tissue?+?low signal soft tissue)/total. The model included three correlation parameters to account for statistical dependence between the molars. Age prediction performance of different combinations of teeth for the three molars was assessed using interquartile range (IQR).We included data from the 1st molars from 87 participants (F/M 59/28), 2nd molars from 93 (F/M 60/33) and 3rd molars from 67 (F/M 45/22). The age range was 14-24 years with a median age of 18 years. The model with the best age prediction performance (smallest IQR) was 46-47-18 (lower right 1st and 2nd and upper right 3rd molar) in males. The estimated correlation between the different molars was 0.620 (46 vs. 47), 0.430 (46 vs. 18), and 0.598 (47 vs. 18). IQR was the smallest in tooth combinations including a 3rd molar.We have established a model for combining tissue volume measurements from the 1st, 2nd and 3rd molars for age prediction in sub-adults.

The availability of active methyl groups can be influenced by the uptake of folic acid. We conducted a randomized intervention trial to test the influence of folic acid supplementation on DNA methylation in an unfortified population in Germany. A total of 16 healthy male volunteers (age range 23-61?y) were randomized to receive either 400??g (n?=?9) or 800??g (n?=?7) folic acid supplements daily for 8?weeks. Infinium Human Methylation 450K BeadChip Microarrays were used to assay site-specific DNA methylation across the genome. Microarray analyses were conducted on PBL DNA. We estimated several epigenetic clocks and mean DNA methylation across all autosomal probes on the array. AgeAccel was estimated as the residual variation in each metric. In virtually all participants, both serum and red blood cell (RBC) folate increased successively throughout the trial period. Participants with a larger increase in RBC folate had a larger increase in DNAmAge AgeAccel (Spearman Rho: 0.56,p-value?=?0.03). No notable changes in the methylome resulting from the folic acid supplementation emerged.

,38031635,"Polygenic risk for schizophrenia, social dispositions, and pace of epigenetic aging: Results from the Young Finns Study.",Aging Cell,"Schizophrenia is often regarded as a disorder of premature aging. We investigated (a) whether polygenic risk for schizophrenia (PRSsch) relates to pace of epigenetic aging and (b) whether personal dispositions toward active and emotionally close relationships protect against accelerated epigenetic aging in individuals with high PRSsch. The sample came from the population-based Young Finns Study (n?=?1348). Epigenetic aging was measured with DNA methylation aging algorithms such as AgeAccelHannum, EEAAHannum, IEAAHannum, IEAAHorvath, AgeAccelHorvath, AgeAccelPheno, AgeAccelGrim, and DunedinPACE. A PRSschwas calculated using summary statistics from the most comprehensive genome-wide association study of schizophrenia to date. Social dispositions were assessed in terms of extraversion, sociability, reward dependence, cooperativeness, and attachment security. We found that PRSschdid not have a statistically significant effect on any studied indicator of epigenetic aging. Instead, PRSschhad a significant interaction with reward dependence (p?=?0.001-0.004), cooperation (p?=?0.009-0.020), extraversion (p?=?0.019-0.041), sociability (p?=?0.003-0.016), and attachment security (p?=?0.007-0.014) in predicting AgeAccelHannum, EEAAHannum, or IEAAHannum. Specifically, participants with high PRSschappeared to display accelerated epigenetic aging at higher (vs. lower) levels of extraversion, sociability, attachment security, reward dependence, and cooperativeness. A rather opposite pattern was evident for those with low PRSsch. No such interactions were evident when predicting the other indicators of epigenetic aging. In conclusion, against our hypothesis, frequent social interactions may relate to accelerated epigenetic aging in individuals at risk for psychosis. We speculate that this may be explained by social-cognitive impairments (perceiving social situations as overwhelming or excessively arousing) or ending up in less supportive or deviant social groups.© 2023 The Authors.

We characterized protein-BMI trajectory associations in adolescents and adults and how these connect to other omics layers.Our study included two cohorts of longitudinally followed twins: FinnTwin12 (N?=?651) and the Netherlands Twin Register (NTR) (N?=?665). Follow-up comprised 4 BMI measurements over approximately 6 (NTR: 23-27 years old) to 10 years (FinnTwin12: 12-22 years old), with omics data collected at the last BMI measurement. BMI changes were calculated in latent growth curve models. Mixed-effects models were used to quantify the associations between the abundance of 439 plasma proteins with BMI at blood sampling and changes in BMI. In FinnTwin12, the sources of genetic and environmental variation underlying the protein abundances were quantified by twin models, as were the associations of proteins with BMI and BMI changes. In NTR, we investigated the association of gene expression of genes encoding proteins identified in FinnTwin12 with BMI and changes in BMI. We linked identified proteins and their coding genes to plasma metabolites and polygenic risk scores (PRS) applying mixed-effects models and correlation networks.We identified 66 and 14 proteins associated with BMI at blood sampling and changes in BMI, respectively. The average heritability of these proteins was 35%. Of the 66 BMI-protein associations, 43 and 12 showed genetic and environmental correlations, respectively, including 8 proteins showing both. Similarly, we observed 7 and 3 genetic and environmental correlations between changes in BMI and protein abundance, respectively. S100A8 gene expression was associated with BMI at blood sampling, and the PRG4 and CFI genes were associated with BMI changes. Proteins showed strong connections with metabolites and PRSs, but we observed no multi-omics connections among gene expression and other omics layers.Associations between the proteome and BMI trajectories are characterized by shared genetic, environmental, and metabolic etiologies. We observed few gene-protein pairs associated with BMI or changes in BMI at the proteome and transcriptome levels.© 2023. The Author(s).",0.999998539

We aimed to assess the performance of newly developed and existing nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) metabolomic age models for prediction of chronological age (CA), mortality, and age-related disease. 98 metabolic variables were measured in blood from nine UK and Finnish cohort studies (N ? 31,000 individuals, age range 24-86 years). We used non-linear and penalised regression to model CA and time to all-cause mortality. We examined associations of four new and two previously published metabolomic age models, with ageing risk factors and phenotypes. Within the UK Biobank (N? 102,000), we tested prediction of CA, incident disease (cardiovascular disease (CVD), type-2 diabetes mellitus, cancer, dementia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and all-cause mortality. Cross-validated Pearson'srbetween metabolomic age models and CA ranged between 0.47-0.65 in the training set (mean absolute error: 8-9 years). Metabolomic age models, adjusted for CA, were associated with C-reactive protein, and inversely associated with glomerular filtration rate. Positively associated risk factors included obesity, diabetes, smoking, and physical inactivity. In UK Biobank, correlations of metabolomic age with chronological age were modest (r= 0.29-0.33), yet all metabolomic model scores predicted mortality (hazard ratios of 1.01 to 1.06 / metabolomic age year) and CVD, after adjustment for CA. While metabolomic age models were only moderately associated with CA in an independent population, they provided additional prediction of morbidity and mortality over CA itself, suggesting their wider applicability.",0.999998382
,37924924,Accelerated Pace of Aging in Schizophrenia: Five Case-Control Studies.,Biol Psychiatry,"Schizophrenia is associated with increased risk of developing multiple aging-related diseases, including metabolic, respiratory, and cardiovascular diseases, and Alzheimer's and related dementias, leading to the hypothesis that schizophrenia is accompanied by accelerated biological aging. This has been difficult to test because there is no widely accepted measure of biological aging. Epigenetic clocks are promising algorithms that are used to calculate biological age on the basis of information from combined cytosine-phosphate-guanine sites (CpGs) across the genome, but they have yielded inconsistent and often negative results about the association between schizophrenia and accelerated aging. Here, we tested the schizophrenia-aging hypothesis using a DNA methylation measure that is uniquely designed to predict an individual's rate of aging.We brought together 5 case-control datasets to calculate DunedinPACE (Pace of Aging Calculated from the Epigenome), a new measure trained on longitudinal data to detect differences between people in their pace of aging over time. Data were available from 1812 psychosis cases (schizophrenia or first-episode psychosis) and 1753 controls. Mean chronological age was 38.9 (SD = 13.6) years.We observed consistent associations across datasets between schizophrenia and accelerated aging as measured by DunedinPACE. These associations were not attributable to tobacco smoking or clozapine medication.Schizophrenia is accompanied by accelerated biological aging by midlife. This may explain the wide-ranging risk among people with schizophrenia for developing multiple different age-related physical diseases, including metabolic, respiratory, and cardiovascular diseases, and dementia. Measures of biological aging could prove valuable for assessing patients' risk for physical and cognitive decline and for evaluating intervention effectiveness.Copyright © 2023 Society of Biological Psychiatry.

Such factors may partially affect these traits through epigenetic programing. Epigenetic programing is dynamic and plays an important role in controlling gene expression and cell differentiation during (early) development. DNA methylation (DNAm) is the most commonly studied epigenetic feature. In this study we conducted an epigenome-wide DNAm association analysis on height-related traits in a Sub-Saharan African population, in order to detect DNAm biomarkers across four height-related traits. DNAm profiles were acquired in whole blood samples of 704 Ghanaians, sourced from the Research on Obesity and Diabetes among African Migrants study, using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. Linear models were fitted to detect differentially methylated positions (DMPs) and regions (DMRs) associated with height, leg-to-height ratio (LHR), leg length, and sitting height. No epigenome-wide significant DMPs were recorded. However we did observe among our top DMPs five informative probes associated with the height-related traits: cg26905768 (leg length), cg13268132 (leg length), cg19776793 (height), cg23072383 (LHR), and cg24625894 (sitting height). All five DMPs are annotated to genes whose functions were linked to bone cell regulation and development. DMR analysis identified overlapping DMRs within the gene body ofHLA-DPB1gene, and theHOXAgene cluster. In this first epigenome-wide association studies of these traits, our findings suggest DNAm associations with height-related heights, and might influence development and maintenance of these traits. Further studies are needed to replicate our findings, and to elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying human height-related traits.",0.999993386

The variant rs7422195 is an expression quantitative trait locus for MERTK in CD14+monocytes; cells with phagocytic and immunomodulatory potential. We aimed to understand how drivers of disease risk and pathogenesis vary with HLA and MERTK genotype and disease activity.We investigated how proportions of monocytes vary with HLA andMERTKgenotype and disease activity in MS. CD14+monocytes were isolated from patients with MS at relapse (n = 40) and 3 months later (n = 23). Healthy controls (HCs) underwent 2 blood collections 3 months apart. Immunophenotypic profiling of monocytes was performed by flow cytometry. Methylation of 35 CpG sites within and near theMERTKgene was assessed in whole blood samples of individuals experiencing their first episode of clinical CNS demyelination (n = 204) and matched HCs (n = 345) using an Illumina EPIC array.DR15-positive patients had lower proportions of CD14+MERTK+ monocytes than DR15-negative patients, independent of genotype at theMERTKSNP rs7422195. Proportions of CD14+MERTK+ monocytes were further reduced during relapse in DR15-positive but not DR15-negative patients. Patients homozygous for the major G allele at rs7422195 exhibited higher proportions of CD14+MERTK+ monocytes at both relapse and remission compared with controls. We observed that increased methylation of theMERTKgene was significantly associated with the presence of DR15.DR15 and MERTK genotype independently influence proportions of CD14+MERTK+ monocytes in MS. We confirmed previous observations that the MERTK risk SNP rs7422195 is associated with altered MERTK expression in monocytes. We identified that expression of MERTK is stratified by disease in people homozygous for the major G allele of rs7422195. The finding that the proportion of CD14+MERTK+ monocytes is reduced in DR15-positive individuals supports prior data identifying genetic links between these 2 loci in influencing MS risk. DR15 genotype-dependent alterations in methylation of theMERTKgene provides a molecular link between these loci and identifies a potential mechanism by which MERTK expression is influenced by DR15. This links DR15 haplotype to MS susceptibility beyond direct influence on antigen presentation and suggests the need for HLA-based stratification of approaches to MERTK as a therapeutic target.",0.999983456

Reasoning that the unexplained heritability may be because of DNA methylation, an epigenetic phenomenon, we measured genome-wide DNA methylation using the Illumina MethylationEPIC platform with blood samples from participants in the Orofacial Pain: Prospective Evaluation and Risk Assessment (OPPERA) study. Associations with chronic TMD used methylation data from 496 chronic painful TMD cases and 452 TMD-free controls. Changes in methylation between enrollment and a 6-month follow-up visit were determined for a separate sample of 62 people with recent-onset painful TMD. More than 750,000 individual CpG sites were examined for association with chronic painful TMD. Six differentially methylated regions were significantly (P < 5 × 10-8) associated with chronic painful TMD, including loci near genes involved in the regulation of inflammatory and neuronal response. A majority of loci were similarly differentially methylated in acute TMD consistent with observed transience or persistence of symptoms at follow-up. Functional characterization of the identified regions found relationships between methylation at these loci and nearby genetic variation contributing to chronic painful TMD and with gene expression of proximal genes. These findings reveal epigenetic contributions to chronic painful TMD through methylation of the genes FMOD, PM20D1, ZNF718, ZFP57, and RNF39, following the development of acute painful TMD. Epigenetic regulation of these genes likely contributes to the trajectory of transcriptional events in affected tissues leading to resolution or chronicity of pain.Copyright © 2023 International Association for the Study of Pain.",0.999982661

We defined participants who resided<0.5kmfrom an actively cultivated agriculture field to live ""near fields"" and those residing?0.5kmfrom an agricultural field to live ""far from fields"" (n=22and 18, respectively).Among participants living near fields, urinary glyphosate was detected more frequently and at significantly increased GM concentrations during the spray season in comparison with the nonspray season (81% vs. 55%;0.228?g/Lvs.0.150?g/L,p<0.001). In contrast, among participants who lived far from fields, neither glyphosate detection frequency nor GMs differed in the spray vs nonspray season (66% vs. 64%;0.154?g/Lvs.0.165?g/L,p=0.45). Concentrations did not differ by residential proximity to fields during the nonspray season (0.154?g/Lvs.0.165?g/L, for near vs. far,p=0.53).Pregnant people living near agriculture fields had significantly increased urinary glyphosate concentrations during the agricultural spray season than during the nonspray season. They also had significantly higher urinary glyphosate concentrations during the spray season than those who lived far from agricultural fields at any time of year, but concentrations did not differ during the nonspray season. These findings suggest that agricultural glyphosate spray is a source of exposure for people living near fields. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP12768.",0.999980407

The U-BIRTH study aims to (1) assess the impact of exposure to peripartum mental illness on the children's development taking into account biological and environmental factors during intrauterine life and childhood; (2) identify early predictors of child neurodevelopmental and psychological problems using biophysiological, psychosocial and environmental variables available during pregnancy and early post partum.All mothers participating in the previous BASIC cohort are invited, and mother-child dyads recruited in the U-BIRTH study are consecutively invited to questionnaire assessments and biological sampling when the child is 18 months, 6 years and 11 years old. Data collection at 18 months (n=2882) has been completed. Consent for participation has been obtained from 1946 families of children having reached age 6 and from 698 families of children having reached age 11 years.Based on the complete data from pregnancy to 18 months post partum, peripartum mental health was significantly associated with the development of attentional control and gaze-following behaviours, which are critical to cognitive and social learning later in life. Moreover, infants of depressed mothers had an elevated risk of difficult temperament and behavioural problems compared with infants of non-depressed mothers. Analyses of biological samples showed that peripartum depression and anxiety were related to DNA methylation differences in infants. However, there were no methylation differences in relation to infants' behavioural problems at 18 months of age.Given that the data collection at 18 months is complete, analyses are now being undertaken. Currently, assessments for children reaching 6 and 11 years are ongoing.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023. Re-use permitted under CC BY. Published by BMJ.",0.999975501

This study compared the telomere length of children born before versus after maternal bariatric surgery as a surrogate to test the influence of the mother's metabolic status on children's telomere length. DNA methylation telomere length (DNAmTL) was estimated from Methylation-EPIC BeadChip array data from a total of 24 children born before and after maternal bariatric surgery in the greater Quebec City area. DNAmTL was inversely associated with chronological age in children (r?=?- 0.80, p?<?0.001) and significant differences were observed on age-adjusted DNAmTL between children born before versus after the maternal bariatric surgery. The associations found between body mass index and body fat percentage with DNAmTL in children born after the surgery were influenced by maternal triglycerides, TG/HDL-C ratio and TyG index. This study reports the impact of maternal bariatric surgery on offspring telomere length. The influence of maternal metabolic status on the association between telomere length and markers of adiposity in children suggests a putative modulating effect of bariatric surgery on the cardiometabolic risk in offspring.© 2023.

,38063329,A multidimensional social risk atlas of depression and anxiety: An observational and genome-wide environmental interaction study.,J Glob Health,"Mental disorders are largely socially determined, yet the combined impact of multidimensional social factors on the two most common mental disorders, depression and anxiety, remains unclear.We constructed a polysocial risk score (PsRS), a multidimensional social risk indicator including components from three domains: socioeconomic status, neighborhood and living environment and psychosocial factors. Supported by the UK Biobank cohort, we randomly divided 110?332 participants into the discovery cohort (60%; n?=?66?200) and the replication cohort (40%; n?=?44?134). We tested the associations between 13 single social factors with Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) score, Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD) score and self-reported depression and anxiety. The significant social factors were used to calculate PsRS for each mental disorder by considering weights from the multivariable linear model. Generalized linear models were applied to explore the association between PsRS and depression and anxiety. Genome-wide environmental interaction study (GWEIS) was further performed to test the effect of interactions between PsRS and SNPs on the risk of mental phenotypes.In the discovery cohort, PsRS was positively associated with PHQ score (??=?0.37; 95% CI?=?0.35-0.38), GAD score (??=?0.27; 95% CI?=?0.25-0.28), risk of self-reported depression (OR?=?1.29; 95% CI?=?1.28-1.31) and anxiety (OR?=?1.19; 95% CI?=?1.19-1.23). Similar results were observed in the replication cohort. Emotional stress, lack of social support and low household income were significantly associated with the development of depression and anxiety. GWEIS identified multiple candidate loci for PHQ score, such as rs149137169 (ST18) (Pdiscovery?=?1.08?×?10-8, Preplication?=?3.25?×?10-6) and rs3759812 (MYO9A) (Pdiscovery?=?3.87?×?10-9, Preplication?=?6.21?×?10-5).

The goal of this study is to identify plasma biomarkers of constant and chronic tinnitus among selected circulating inflammatory proteins.A case-control retrospective study on 548 cases with constant tinnitus and 548 matched controls from the Swedish Tinnitus Outreach Project (STOP), whose plasma samples were examined using Olink's Inflammatory panel. Replication and meta-analysis were performed using the same method on samples from the TwinsUK cohort. Participants from LifeGene, whose blood was collected in Stockholm and Umeå, were recruited to STOP for a tinnitus subtyping study. An age and sex matching was performed at the individual level. TwinsUK participants (n?=?928) were selected based on self-reported tinnitus status over 2 to 10 years. Primary outcomes include normalized levels for 96 circulating proteins, which were used as an index test. No reference standard was available in this study.After adjustment for age, sex, BMI, smoking, hearing loss, and laboratory site, the top proteins identified were FGF-21, MCP4, GDNF, CXCL9, and MCP-1; however, these were no longer statistically significant after correction for multiple testing. Stratification by sex did not yield any significant associations. Similarly, associations with hearing loss or other tinnitus-related comorbidities such as stress, anxiety, depression, hyperacusis, temporomandibular joint disorders, and headache did not yield any significant associations. Analysis in the TwinsUK failed in replicating the top candidates. Meta-analysis of STOP and TwinsUK did not reveal any significant association. Using elastic net regularization, models exhibited poor predictive capacity tinnitus based on inflammatory markers [sensitivity?=?0.52 (95% CI 0.47-0.57), specificity?=?0.53 (0.48-0.58), positive predictive value?=?0.52 (0.47-0.56), negative predictive values?=?0.53 (0.49-0.58), and AUC?=?0.53 (0.49-0.56)].Our results did not identify significant associations of the selected inflammatory proteins with constant tinnitus.

,38062042,Epigenome-wide association studies of prenatal maternal mental health and infant epigenetic profiles: a systematic review.,Transl Psychiatry,"Prenatal stress and poor maternal mental health are associated with adverse offspring outcomes; however, the biological mechanisms are unknown. Epigenetic modification has linked maternal health with offspring development. Epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) have examined offspring DNA methylation profiles for association with prenatal maternal mental health to elucidate mechanisms of these complex relationships. The objective of this study is to provide a comprehensive, systematic review of EWASs of infant epigenetic profiles and prenatal maternal anxiety, depression, or depression treatment. We conducted a systematic literature search following PRISMA guidelines for EWAS studies between prenatal maternal mental health and infant epigenetics through May 22, 2023. Of 645 identified articles, 20 fulfilled inclusion criteria. We assessed replication of CpG sites among studies, conducted gene enrichment analysis, and evaluated the articles for quality and risk of bias. We found one repeated CpG site among the maternal depression studies; however, nine pairs of overlapping differentially methylatd regions were reported in at least two maternal depression studies. Gene enrichment analysis found significant pathways for maternal depression but not for any other maternal mental health category. We found evidence that these EWAS present a medium to high risk of bias. Exposure to prenatal maternal depression and anxiety or treatment for such was not consistently associated with epigenetic changes in infants in this systematic review and meta-analysis. Small sample size, potential bias due to exposure misclassification and statistical challenges are critical to address in future efforts to explore epigenetic modification as a potential mechanism by which prenatal exposure to maternal mental health disorders leads to adverse infant outcomes.© 2023.

The mean age of the women was 31.0 years, and 40.9% were nulliparous. Maternal early mid-pregnancy adiponectin was measured in microgram/mL. Linear regression models were performed to evaluate the association between adiponectin and infant birth weight. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate adiponectin in relation to the odds of giving birth to an infant large-for-gestational-age (LGA, infant birth weight standard deviation score?>?90th percentile). Adjustments were made for early pregnancy BMI and diabetes mellitus. Prior adjustments, adiponectin was inversely associated with infant birth weight (? - 17.1, 95% confidence interval (CI) - 26.8 to - 7.4 g, P?<?0.001), and one microgram/mL increase in adiponectin was associated with a 9% decrease in the odds of giving birth to an LGA infant (odds ratio 0.91, CI 0.85-0.97, P?=?0.006). The associations did not withstand in the adjusted models. We found a significant interaction between adiponectin and infant sex on birth size. This interaction was driven by an inverse association between maternal adiponectin and birth size in female infants, whereas no such association was found in males.© 2023.

It is critical to identify novel blood-based DNA methylation biomarkers to better understand the extent of the molecular pathways affected in AD. Two sets of blood DNA methylation genetic prediction models developed using different reference panels and modelling strategies were leveraged to evaluate associations of genetically predicted DNA methylation levels with AD risk in 111,326 (46,828 proxy) cases and 677,663 controls. A total of 1,168 cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites showed a significant association with AD risk at a false discovery rate (FDR)?<?0.05. Methylation levels of 196 CpG sites were correlated with expression levels of 130 adjacent genes in blood. Overall, 52 CpG sites of 32 genes showed consistent association directions for the methylation-gene expression-AD risk, including nine genes (CNIH4, THUMPD3, SERPINB9, MTUS1, CISD1, FRAT2, CCDC88B, FES, and SSH2) firstly reported as AD risk genes. Nine of 32 genes were enriched in dementia and AD disease categories (P values ranged from 1.85 × 10-4to 7.46 × 10-6), and 19 genes in a neurological disease network (score = 54) were also observed.

,37983305,Gaps in current methods to detect polymorphic CpGs from Illumina Infinium human methylation microarrays and exploring their potential impact in multi-EWAS analyses.,Epigenetics,"DNA methylation (DNAm) epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) have been performed on diverse ethnicities to discover novel biomarkers associated with various diseases, such as cancers, autoimmune diseases, and neurological disorders. However, genetic polymorphisms can influence DNAm levels resulting in methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTL). These can be either direct effects, by altering the sequence of the methylation (CpG) site itself, or, in the case of array-based measures, indirectly altering the detection probe-binding site interaction. Given that genetic variant frequencies associated with meQTL can differ between population groups, these have the potential to confound EWAS observations, particularly in multi-ethnic populations. In this study, we analysed publicly available DNA methylation profiles (450K array), consisting of 1342 individuals from 6 distinct ancestral groups. We investigate two distinct tools (GapHunterandMethylToSNP)specifically designed to identify CpG sites that may be influenced by genetic variation. Results from this aggregated trans-ancestral epigenome-wide dataset suggest that both tools fail to consistently identify not only rarer (MAF < 0.05) genetic variant effects but also more than half of sites predicted to be associated with variants with much higher allele frequencies (MAF >0.2). In addition, there is a relatively low concordance in the detection of polymorphic CpGs betweenGapHunterandMethylToSNP. Screening of CpG site associations from EWAS using either of these tools is unlikely to be a robust or comprehensive means of identifying all genetic variant confounding effects.",0.988966131

Although it is generally congruent with the sex assigned at birth, for some people it is not. If the incongruity is distressing, it is defined as gender dysphoria (GD). Here, we measured whole-genome DNA methylation by the Illumina © Infinium Human Methylation 850k array and reported its correlation with cortical thickness (CTh) in 22 transgender men (TM) experiencing GD versus 25 cisgender men (CM) and 28 cisgender women (CW). With respect to the methylation analysis, TM vs. CW showed significant differences in 35 CpGs, while 2155 CpGs were found when TM vs. CM were compared. With respect to correlation analysis, TM showed differences in methylation of CBLL1 and DLG1 genes that correlated with global and left hemisphere CTh. Both genes were hypomethylated in TM compared to the cisgender groups. Early onset TM showed a positive correlation between CBLL1 and several cortical regions in the frontal (left caudal middle frontal), temporal (right inferior temporal, left fusiform) and parietal cortices (left supramarginal and right paracentral).

This study assessed the effects of adjusting prenatal iron supplementation to maternal iron stores during early pregnancy on children's behavioural problems. Randomized controlled trial conducted in Tarragona (Spain) involving 230 nonanaemic pregnant women and their children after a 4-year follow-up. Based on haemoglobin (Hb) levels before gestational week (GW) 12, women receive different iron doses: those with Hb?=?110-130?g/L were randomized to receive 80 or 40?mg/day and those with Hb?>?130?g/L were randomized to receive 20 or 40?mg/day. Maternal iron stores at GW12 were classified using serum ferritin (SF) as low (SF?<?15?µg/L), normal (SF?=?15-65?µg/L), and normal-high (SF?>?65?µg/L). Children's behaviour was assessed by parents using the Child Behaviour Checklist for ages 1.5-5 years and the Behaviour Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Preschool Version, and by teachers using the Teacher's Report Form for ages 1.5-5 years. Multivariable regression models were performed. Taking 80?mg/day of iron improved child behaviour when women had low iron stores but worsened it when mothers had normal-high iron stores, except for depressive and attention/hyperactivity problems. Taking 20?mg/day of iron improved behaviour only in those children whose mothers had SF?>?65?µg/L in early pregnancy. Additionally, executive functioning improved at high doses of prenatal iron when maternal baseline SF?<?15?µg/L. Adjusting prenatal iron supplementation to both maternal baseline Hb levels and iron stores reduces behavioural problems in 4-year-old children.© 2023 The Authors.

Here, we sought to conduct large-scale (Epi)Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS/EWAS) to investigate the associations between genomic (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism; SNP) and epigenomic (Cytosine-Phospho-Guanine; CpG) markers, with multiple phenotypic traits in a population-based context. We used data from SKIPOGH, a family- and population-based cohort conducted in the cities of Lausanne, Geneva, and Bern (N=1100). We used 7,577,572 SNPs, 420,444 CpGs, and 825 phenotypes, including anthropometric, clinical, blood, urine, metabolite, and metal measures. GWAS analyses assessed the associations between SNPs and metabolites and metals (N=279), using regression models adjusted for age, sex, recruitment center, and familial structure, whereas EWAS analyses explored the relations between CpGs and 825 phenotypes, additionally adjusting for the seasonality of blood sampling and technical nuisance. Following the implementation of GWAS and EWAS analyses, we developed a web-based platform, PhenoExplorer, aimed at providing an open access to the obtained results. Of the 279 phenotypes included in GWAS, 103 displayed significant associations with 2804 SNPs (2091 unique SNPs) at Bonferroni threshold, whereas 109 of the 825 phenotypes included in EWAS analyses were associated with 4893 CpGs (2578 unique CpGs). All of the obtained GWAS and EWAS results were eventually made available using the in-house built web-based PhenoExplorer platform, with the purpose of providing an open-access to the tested associations. In conclusion, we provide a comprehensive outline of GWAS and EWAS associations performed in a Swiss population-based study. Further, we set up a web-based PhenoExplorer platform with the purpose of contributing to the overall understanding of the role of molecular variants in regulating complex phenotypes.Copyright 2022 Jean-Pierre Ghobril, Dusan Petrovic, Georg Ehret, Belén Ponte, Menno Pruijm, Daniel Ackermann, Bruno Vogt, Silvia Stringhini, Aurélien Thomas, Jonviea Chamberlain, Semira Gonseth-Nusslé, Murielle Bochud.

Adult patients with medically recalcitrant CRS receiving initial ESS were engaged. Self-reported snoring was measured at baseline and 3-year follow-up, along with Sino-Nasal Outcome Test-22 and snoring visual analog scale assessment. Mouth breathing (MB), demographics, behavior, comorbidity factors, and objective CRS severity were considered.In 210 patients who completed this study, 63 (30%) patients reported pre-ESS habitual snoring, and post-operative habitual snoring was observed in 52 (25%) patients. The presence of self-reported snoring was correlated with worse CRS QOL at baseline and 3-year follow-up. Obesity (odds ratio [OR] = 4.30; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.64-11.28; p < 0.01) and posterior-to-anterior ethmoid sinus ratio greater than one (PE/AE, OR = 0.32; 95% CI, 0.10-0.99; p = 0.05) were associated with pre-ESS snoring in univariable and multivariable analysis. The post-operative reduction of snoring frequency was related with patient age over 65 (OR = 11.55; 95%CI, 1.35-98.79; p = 0.03) and bilateral opacification in the Lund-Mackay system (OR = 8.04; 95%CI, 1.24-51.90; p = 0.03) in multivariable analysis. Pre-operative snoring and MB were associated with increased risk of post-operative snoring (p < 0.01 for each comparison).Post-ESS, self-reported snoring was associated with worse CRS QOL. Obesity and PE/AE > 1 were risk factors of pre-operative snoring. Advanced age and bilateral opacification were associated with greater improvement of snoring after ESS.© 2023.

,38034479,Partnership status and positive DNA methylation age acceleration across the adult lifespan in the UK.,SSM Popul Health,"Although a significant body of research has shown that married people are healthier and live longer, empirical research on sex differences in the link between marital status and health suggests results are mixed. Moreover, the sex disparities in marital status and health relationships vary across adulthood. The literature on partnership status and measures of ageing is largely focused on older age groups and is limited in its view of early adulthood. Data from waves 2 and 3 (2010-2012) of Understanding Society: UKHLS were used to examine the association of current partnership status with epigenetic age acceleration (AA) assessed with DNA methylation (DNAm) algorithms 'Phenoage' and ' DunedinPACE ' in 3492 participants (aged 16-97). Regression models were estimated separately for men and women, and further stratified by age groups. Divorced/separated and widowed people showed positive age acceleration compared to the married/cohabiting people (reference group). Some sex differences were apparent, especially, among the single and divorced/separated groups. Age differences were also apparent, for example in men, being single was negatively associated with DNAmAA in the youngest group, but positively in the oldest group compared to partnered counterparts. These findings illustrate the importance of partnerships on the ageing process, in particular marital change through divorce and widowhood for positive age acceleration in adults. For single groups, observations were heterogenous by age and sex.© 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.",0.844373899

Logistic-regression models were used to examine the association between these adipocyte-derived hormones after stratification (sex, geographic area) and adjustments for potential confounders.A total of 2518 Ghanaians were included. Rural participants had the highest serum adiponectin and lowest leptin levels compared to Amsterdam and urban Ghanaians (P?<?.001). In fully adjusted models, participants living in urban Ghana had significantly higher odds of hyperleptinemia compared to rural participants (women-odds ratio 2.88; 95% CI, 1.12-7.38,P?=?.028 and men 43.52, 95% CI, 4.84-391.25,P?<?.001). Urban Ghanaian men also had higher odds of elevated leptin: adiponectin ratio (6.29, 95% CI, 1.43-27.62,P?=?.015). The odds of hyperleptinemia were only higher in Amsterdam Ghanaian men (10.56; 95% CI, 1.11-100.85,P?=?.041), but not in women (0.85; 95% CI, 0.30-2.41,P?=?.759). There was no significant association between hypoadiponectinemia and geographical location in both sexes.Urbanization is associated with serum adiponectin and leptin levels after adjusting for confounding covariates in sub-Saharan Africans.

Here, the genetically predicted DNA methylation markers associated with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) risk by a two-stage case-control design were investigated.The genetic prediction models for methylation levels based on genetic and methylation data of 1595 subjects from the Framingham Heart Study were established. The prediction models were applied to a fixed-effect meta-analysis of screening data sets with 27,120 NSCLC cases and 27,355 controls to identify the methylation markers, which were then replicated in independent data sets with 7844 lung cancer cases and 421,224 controls. Also performed was a multi-omics functional annotation for the identified CpGs by integrating genomics, epigenomics, and transcriptomics and investigation of the potential regulation pathways.Of the 29,894 CpG sites passing the quality control, 39 CpGs associated with NSCLC risk (Bonferroni-corrected p ? 1.67 × 10-6) were originally identified. Of these, 16 CpGs remained significant in the validation stage (Bonferroni-corrected p ? 1.28 × 10-3), including four novel CpGs. Multi-omics functional annotation showed nine of 16 CpGs were potentially functional biomarkers for NSCLC risk. Thirty-five genes within a 1-Mb window of 12 CpGs that might be involved in regulatory pathways of NSCLC risk were identified.Sixteen promising DNA methylation markers associated with NSCLC were identified. Changes of the methylation level at these CpGs might influence the development of NSCLC by regulating the expression of genes nearby.The epigenetic consequences of DNA methylation in lung cancer development are still largely unknown. This study used summary data of large-scale genome-wide association studies to investigate the associations between genetically predicted levels of methylation biomarkers and non-small cell lung cancer risk at the first time. This study looked at how well larotrectinib worked in adult patients with sarcomas caused by TRK fusion proteins. These findings will provide a unique insight into the epigenetic susceptibility mechanisms of lung cancer.© 2023 American Cancer Society.",0.420466303
,37945640,Self-rated physical health predicts mortality in aging persons beyond objective health risks.,Sci Rep,"Previous studies on self-rated health and mortality have usually not differentiated between physical and mental health, respectively have not considered physical diseases. This study aims to determine self-rated physical and mental health from middle to old age, examine associations with mortality adjusted for objective risk factors and assess effect modification by gender. In a large population-based sample (N?=?14,993 at baseline), self-rated physical and mental health were rated separately by a single-item. Associations to mortality were modelled by Cox regressions, adjusting for potential confounding variables. Most participants rated their physical (79.4%), resp. mental health (82.3%) as good. Poor self-rated physical health was lowest in the youngest group (19.6%, age 35-44), and highest in midlife (29.1%, age 55-64). Poor self-rated mental health was lowest among the oldest (18.5%), and highest from 45 to 54 years (29.3%). Poor self-rated physical, but not mental health was predictive of mortality when adjusting for objective risk factors. Male gender and poor self-rated physical health interacted (RERI 0.43 95%-CI 0.02-0.85). Self-rated physical health was best in the youngest and worst in the midlife group, this pattern was reversed regarding self-rated mental health. Poor self-rated physical, but not mental health was predictive of mortality, adjusting for objective risk factors. It was more strongly predictive of mortality in men than in women. Poor subjective physical health ratings, should be taken seriously as an unfavorable prognostic sign, particularly in men.© 2023. The Author(s).",0.40917609

Within-population differences may explain some of the variability observed.To investigate sex differences in the association between FTO single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and obesity traits among self-identified non-Hispanic Black and non-Hispanic White US adults, to examine whether the SNVs were associated with cardiometabolic diseases, and to evaluate whether obesity mediated the association between FTO SNVs and cardiometabolic diseases.This cross-sectional study used data from the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study, a US population-based cohort study with available genetic data (assayed in 2018) and phenotypic data at baseline (enrolled 2003-2007). Participants were aged 45 to 98 years at baseline. Data were analyzed from October 2021 to October 2022.Eleven SNVs in the FTO gene present among both Black and White participants.Objectively measured obesity indicators (body mass index and waist-to-height ratio), objectively measured and/or self-reported cardiometabolic diseases (hypertension, stroke history, heart disease, and diabetes), and self-reported social-economic and psychosocial status.A total of 10?447 participants (mean [SD] age, 64.4 [9.7] years; 5276 [55.8%] women; 8743 [83.7%] Black and 1704 [16.3%] White) were included. In the White group, 11 FTO SNVs were significantly associated with obesity, hypertension, and diabetes using linear models (eg, body mass index: ??=?0.536; 95% CI, 0.197-0.875), but none of the FTO SNVs were associated with obesity traits in the Black group. White males had a higher risk of obesity while White females had a higher risk of hypertension and diabetes. However, 1 FTO SNV (rs1121980) was associated with a direct increase in the risk of heart disease in Black participants not mediated by obesity (c'?=?0.145 [SE, 0.0517]; P?=?.01).In this cross-sectional study of obesity phenotypes and their association with cardiometabolic diseases, the tested FTO SNVs reflected sex differences in White participants. Different patterns of associations were observed among self-identified Black participants. Therefore, these results could inform future work discovering risk alleles or risk scores unique to Black individuals or further investigating genetic risk in all US residents.",0.291819006

,38132863,Technical Report: A Comprehensive Comparison between Different Quantification Versions of Nightingale Health's (1)H-NMR Metabolomics Platform.,Metabolites,"1H-NMR metabolomics data is increasingly used to track health and disease. Nightingale Health, a major supplier of1H-NMR metabolomics, has recently updated the quantification strategy to further align with clinical standards. Such updates, however, might influence backward replicability, particularly affecting studies with repeated measures. Using data from BBMRI-NL consortium (~28,000 samples from 28 cohorts), we compared Nightingale data, originally released in 2014 and 2016, with a re-quantified version released in 2020, of which both versions were based on the same NMR spectra. Apart from two discontinued and twenty-three new analytes, we generally observe a high concordance between quantification versions with 73 out of 222 (33%) analytes showing a mean ? > 0.9 across all cohorts. Conversely, five analytes consistently showed lower Spearman's correlations (? < 0.7) between versions, namely acetoacetate, LDL-L, saturated fatty acids, S-HDL-C, and sphingomyelins. Furthermore, previously trained multi-analyte scores, such asMetaboAgeorMetaboHealth, might be particularly sensitive to platform changes. WhereasMetaboHealthreplicated well, theMetaboAgescore had to be retrained due to use of discontinued analytes. Notably, both scores in the re-quantified data recapitulated mortality associations observed previously. Concluding, we urge caution in utilizing different platform versions to avoid mixing analytes, having different units, or simply being discontinued.",0.065180593
,38136971,Alu Methylation Patterns in Type 1 Diabetes: A Case-Control Study.,Genes (Basel),"Evidence suggests that genome-wide hypomethylation may promote genomic instability and cellular senescence, leading to chronic complications in people with diabetes mellitus. Limited data are however available on the Alu methylation status in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D).Methods: We investigated DNA methylation levels and patterns of Alu methylation in the peripheral blood of 36 patients with T1D and 29 healthy controls, matched for age and sex, by using the COmbined Bisulfite Restriction Analysis method (COBRA).Results: Total Alu methylation rate (mC) was similar between patients with T1D and controls (67.3% (64.4-70.9%) vs. 68.0% (62.0-71.1%),p= 0.874). However, patients with T1D had significantly higher levels of the partial Alu methylation pattern (mCuC + uCmC) (41.9% (35.8-45.8%) vs. 36.0% (31.7-40.55%),p= 0.004) compared to healthy controls. In addition, a positive correlation between levels of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and the partially methylated loci (mCuC + uCmC) was observed (Spearman's rho = 0.293,p= 0.018). Furthermore, significant differences were observed between patients with T1D diagnosed before and after the age of 15 years regarding the total methylation mC, the methylated pattern mCmC and the unmethylated pattern uCuC (p= 0.040,p= 0.044 andp= 0.040, respectively).Conclusions: In conclusion, total Alu methylation rates were similar, but the partial Alu methylation pattern (mCuC + uCmC) was significantly higher in patients with T1D compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, this pattern was associated positively with the levels of HbA1c and negatively with the age at diagnosis.",0.032266366

We aimed to investigate the methylation patterns of two regions, one inRB1and another inGJB2in Filipino patients with SNHL compared to hearing control individuals.We investigated anRB1promoter region that was previously identified as differentially methylated in children with SNHL and lead exposure. Additionally, we investigated a sequence in an enhancer-like region withinGJB2that contains four CpGs in close proximity. Bisulfite conversion was performed on salivary DNA samples from 15 children with SNHL and 45 unrelated ethnically-matched individuals. We then performed methylation-specific real-time PCR analysis (qMSP) using TaqMan®probes to determine percentage methylation of the two regions.Using qMSP, both our cases and controls had zero methylation at the targetedGJB2andRB1regions.Our study showed no changes in methylation at the selected CpG regions inRB1andGJB2in the two comparison groups with or without SNHL. This may be due to a lack of environmental exposures to these target regions. Other epigenetic marks may be present around these regions as well as those of other HL-associated genes.",0.012661956
,38001857,"Associations between the New DNA-Methylation-Based Telomere Length Estimator, the Mediterranean Diet and Genetics in a Spanish Population at High Cardiovascular Risk.",Antioxidants (Basel),"Biological aging is a relevant risk factor for chronic diseases, and several indicators for measuring this factor have been proposed, with telomere length (TL) among the most studied. Oxidative stress may regulate telomere shortening, which is implicated in the increased risk. Using a novel estimator for TL, we examined whether adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet), a highly antioxidant-rich dietary pattern, is associated with longer TL. We determined TL using DNA methylation algorithms (DNAmTL) in 414 subjects at high cardiovascular risk from Spain. Adherence to the MedDiet was assessed by a validated score, and genetic variants in candidate genes and at the genome-wide level were analyzed. We observed several significant associations (p< 0.05) between DNAmTL and candidate genes (TERT,TERF2,RTEL1, andDCAF4), contributing to the validity of DNAmTL as a biomarker in this population. Higher adherence to the MedDiet was associated with lower odds of having a shorter TL in the whole sample (OR = 0.93; 95% CI: 0.85-0.99;p= 0.049 after fully multivariate adjustment). Nevertheless, this association was stronger in women than in men. Likewise, in women, we observed a direct association between adherence to the MedDiet score and DNAmTL as a continuous variable (beta = 0.015; SE: 0.005;p= 0.003), indicating that a one-point increase in adherence was related to an average increase of 0.015 ± 0.005 kb in TL. Upon examination of specific dietary items within the global score, we found that fruits, fish, ""sofrito"", and whole grains exhibited the strongest associations in women. The novel score combining these items was significantly associated in the whole population. In the genome-wide association study (GWAS), we identified ten polymorphisms at the suggestive level of significance (p< 1 × 10-5) for DNAmTL (intergenics, in theIQSEC1,NCAPG2, andABI3BPgenes) and detected some gene-MedDiet modulations on DNAmTL. As this is the first study analyzing the DNAmTL estimator, genetics, and modulation by the MedDiet, more studies are needed to confirm these findings.",0.011293185

We observed a consistent interaction between rs117878928 at 15q25.1 (minor allele frequency = 0.03) and the DASH diet score (P for interaction = 4e-8; P for heterogeneity = 0.35) in European population, where the interaction effect size was 0.42±0.09 mm Hg (P for interaction = 9.4e-7) and 0.20±0.06 mm Hg (P for interaction = 0.001) in CHARGE and the UK Biobank, respectively.

But few studies have explored the association between NO2and blood lipids or fasting plasma glucose (FPG), as well as gene-air pollution interactions. This study aims to fill this knowledge gap based on a pedigree cohort in southern China. (2) Methods: Employing a pedigree-based design, 1563 individuals from 452 families participated in this study. Serum levels of triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC), and FPG were measured. We investigated the associations between short-term NO2exposure and lipid profiles or FPG using linear mixed regression models. The genotype-environment interaction (GenoXE) for each trait was estimated using variance component models. (3) Results: NO2was inversely associated with HDLC but directly associated with TG and FPG. The results showed that each 1 ?g/m3increase in NO2on day lag0 corresponded to a 1.926% (95%CI: 1.428-2.421%) decrease in HDLC and a 1.400% (95%CI: 0.341-2.470%) increase in FPG. Moreover, we observed a significant genotype-NO2interaction with HDLC and FPG. (4) Conclusion: This study highlighted the association between NO2exposure and blood lipid profiles or FPG. Additionally, our investigation suggested the presence of genotype-NO2interactions in HDLC and FPG, indicating potential loci-specific interaction effects. These findings have the potential to inform and enhance the interpretation of studies that are focused on specific gene-environment interactions.",0.006709623

,38108996,A Developmentally-Informative Genome-wide Association Study of Alcohol Use Frequency.,Behav Genet,"Contemporary genome-wide association study (GWAS) methods typically do not account for variability in genetic effects throughout development. We applied genomic structural equation modeling to combine developmentally-informative phenotype data and GWAS to create polygenic scores (PGS) for alcohol use frequency that are specific to developmental stage. Longitudinal cohort studies targeted for gene-identification analyses include the Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism (adolescence n?=?1,118, early adulthood n?=?2,762, adulthood n?=?5,255), the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (adolescence n?=?3,089, early adulthood n?=?3,993, adulthood n?=?5,149), and the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC; adolescence n?=?5,382, early adulthood n?=?3,613). PGS validation analyses were conducted in the COGA sample using an alternate version of the discovery analysis with COGA removed. Results suggest that genetic liability for alcohol use frequency in adolescence may be distinct from genetic liability for alcohol use frequency later in developmental periods. The age-specific PGS predicts an increase of 4 drinking days per year per PGS standard deviation when modeled separately from the common factor PGS in adulthood. The current work was underpowered at all steps of the analysis plan. Though small sample sizes and low statistical power limit the substantive conclusions that can be drawn regarding these research questions, this work provides a foundation for future genetic studies of developmental variability in the genetic underpinnings of alcohol use behaviors and genetically-informed, age-matched phenotype prediction.© 2023.

,38055050,Glyphosate Use and Mosaic Loss of Chromosome Y among Male Farmers in the Agricultural Health Study.,Environ Health Perspect,"Glyphosate is the most commonly used herbicide worldwide and has been implicated in the development of certain hematologic cancers. Although mechanistic studies in human cells and animals support the genotoxic effects of glyphosate, evidence in human populations is scarce.We evaluated the association between lifetime occupational glyphosate use and mosaic loss of chromosome Y (mLOY) as a marker of genotoxicity among male farmers.We analyzed blood-derived DNA from 1,606 farmers?50years of age in the Biomarkers of Exposure and Effect in Agriculture study, a subcohort of the Agricultural Health Study. mLOY was detected using genotyping array intensity data in the pseudoautosomal region of the sex chromosomes. Cumulative lifetime glyphosate use was assessed using self-reported pesticide exposure histories. Using multivariable logistic regression, we estimated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the associations between glyphosate use and any detectable mLOY (overall mLOY) or mLOY affecting?10%of cells (expanded mLOY).Overall, mLOY was detected in 21.4% of farmers, and 9.8% of all farmers had expanded mLOY. Increasing total lifetime days of glyphosate use was associated with expanded mLOY [highest vs. lowest quartile;OR=1.75(95% CI: 1.00, 3.07),ptrend=0.03] but not with overall mLOY; the associations with expanded mLOY were most apparent among older (?70years of age) men [OR=2.30(95% CI: 1.13, 4.67),ptrend=0.01], never smokers [OR=2.32(95% CI: 1.04, 5.21),ptrend=0.04], and nonobese men [OR=2.04(95% CI: 0.99, 4.19),ptrend=0.03]. Similar patterns of associations were observed for intensity-weighted lifetime days of glyphosate use.High lifetime glyphosate use could be associated with mLOY affecting a larger fraction of cells, suggesting glyphosate could confer genotoxic or selective effects relevant for clonal expansion. As the first study to investigate this association, our findings contribute novel evidence regarding the carcinogenic potential of glyphosate and require replication in future studies. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP12834.",0.004211835

Individual differences exist in maintaining cognitive function due to daily physical activity and sleep. We examined the relationship between leisure experiences as proxies for cognitive reserve (CR) and cognitive function in patients with bipolar disorder after adjusting for daily physical activity and sleep. The CR of patients with BP (n = 24) and healthy study controls (HC) (n = 24) was assessed using premorbid IQ, years of education, and leisure activity history. Performance-based neuropsychological tests were performed to evaluate cognitive function. A self-reported scale was used to assess resilience. Physical activity and sleep were measured using an activity meter. Verbal fluency, story memory, and verbal memory were significantly positively correlated with the kinds of leisure experiences in patients with BP. A hierarchical regression analysis accounting for confounding factors showed that verbal fluency and memory were associated with the kinds of leisure experiences. Neither years of education nor resilience were significantly associated with neuropsychological scores. Various leisure experiences in patients with BP are associated with higher language-related cognitive functioning. Engaging in various leisure experiences may affect higher cognitive functions related to language.© 2023 The Authors.",0.003134324

The brain enriched guanylate kinase associated (BEGAIN) protein is involved in protein-protein interactions at and transmission across synapses. Since several epigenome-wide methylation screens reported a paternal age effect on spermBEGAINmethylation, here we confirmed a significant negative correlation betweenBEGAINpromoter methylation and paternal age, using more sensitive bisulfite pyrosequencing and a larger number of sperm samples. Paternal age-associatedBEGAINhypomethylation was also observed in fetal cord blood (FCB) of male but not of female offspring. There was no comparable maternal age effect on FCB methylation. In addition, we found a significant negative correlation betweenBEGAINmethylation and chronological age (ranging from 1 to 70 years) in peripheral blood samples of male but not of female donors.BEGAINhypomethylation was more pronounced in male children, adolescents and adults suffering from ASD compared to controls. Both genetic variation (CC genotype of SNP rs7141087) and epigenetic factors may contribute toBEGAINpromoter hypomethylation. The age- and sex-specificBEGAINmethylation trajectories in the male germ line and somatic tissues, in particular the brain, support a role of this gene in ASD development.",0.001864166

Participants in the intervention group tended to have a decrease in DNA methylation age and age acceleration after completing an exercise program (mean difference = -0.83 ± 1.26). The change in DNA methylation age was significantly correlated with the change in resilience score (r = -0.897,p= 0.015).

DNAm changes of 588,798 individual CpGs (including 41,207 promoter regions) were evaluated using linear regression models adjusted for monocyte proportion. Gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA) were conducted to identify key Gene Ontology (GO) biological processes or Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways associated with chemotherapy. Results were validated in a separate cohort of breast cancer patients who were treated (n?=?1273) and not treated (n?=?872) by chemotherapy (1808 blood, 337 saliva).A total of 141 differentially methylated CpGs and 11 promoters were significantly associated with chemotherapy after multiple testing corrections in both the paired sample and single time point analyses. GSEA of promoter regions (pre-ranked by test statistics) identified six suppressed biological processes (p?<?4.67e-8) related to sensory perception and detection of chemical stimuli, including smell perception (GO:0007606, GO:0007608, GO:0009593, GO:0050906, GO:0050907, and GO:0050911). The same six biological processes were significantly suppressed in the validation dataset (p?<?9.02e-14).

These estimators exhibit natural variations across human groups, but data about indigenous populations remain underrepresented in research. This study aims to investigate differences in epigenetic estimators between two distinct human populations, both residing in the Gran Chaco region of Argentina, the Native-American Wichí, and admixed Criollos who are descendants of intermarriages between Native Americans and the first European colonizers, using a population genetic approach.We analyzed 24 Wichí (mean age: 39.2 ± 12.9 yo) and 24 Criollos (mean age: 41.1 ± 14.0 yo) for DNA methylation levels using the Infinium MethylationEPIC (Illumina) to calculate 16 epigenetic estimators. Additionally, we examined genome-wide genetic variation using the HumanOmniExpress BeadChip (Illumina) to gain insights into the genetic history of these populations.Our results indicate that Native-American Wichí are epigenetically older compared to Criollos according to five epigenetic estimators. Analyses within the Criollos population reveal that global ancestry does not influence the differences observed, while local (chromosomal) ancestry shows positive associations between specific SNPs located in genomic regions over-represented by Native-American ancestry and measures of epigenetic age acceleration (AgeAccelHannum). Furthermore, we demonstrate that differences in population ecologies also contribute to observed epigenetic differences.Overall, our study suggests that while the genomic history may partially account for the observed epigenetic differences, non-genetic factors, such as lifestyle and ecological factors, play a substantial role in the variability of epigenetic estimators, thereby contributing to variations in human epigenetic aging.© The Author(s) 2023.

Here we performed a large-scale multi-ancestry meta-analysis of Parkinson's disease with 49,049 cases, 18,785 proxy cases and 2,458,063 controls including individuals of European, East Asian, Latin American and African ancestry. In a meta-analysis, we identified 78 independent genome-wide significant loci, including 12 potentially novel loci (MTF2, PIK3CA, ADD1, SYBU, IRS2, USP8, PIGL, FASN, MYLK2, USP25, EP300 and PPP6R2) and fine-mapped 6 putative causal variants at 6 known PD loci. By combining our results with publicly available eQTL data, we identified 25 putative risk genes in these novel loci whose expression is associated with PD risk. This work lays the groundwork for future efforts aimed at identifying PD loci in non-European populations.© 2023.

Here we develop and validate ancestry-specific Polygenic Risk Scores (PRSs) for Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) using 29,389 individuals from diverse cohorts and genetic ancestry groups. The CAD PRSs outperform published scores with an average Odds Ratio per Standard Deviation of 1.57 (SD = 0.14) and identify between 12% and 24% of individuals with high genetic risk. Using this risk factor to reclassify borderline or intermediate 10 year Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease (ASCVD) risk improves assessments for both CAD (Net Reclassification Improvement (NRI) = 13.14% (95% CI 9.23-17.06%)) and ASCVD (NRI = 10.70 (95% CI 7.35-14.05)) in an independent cohort of 9,691 individuals. Our analyses demonstrate that using PRSs as Risk Enhancers improves ASCVD risk assessments outlining an approach for guiding ASCVD prevention with genetic information.© 2023.

We use machine learning and statistical analyses to determine the circadian gene variants and clinical features most highly associated with symptoms of seasonality and seasonal affective disorder (SAD) in a deeply phenotyped population sample. We report sex-specific clock gene effects on seasonality and SAD symptoms; genotypic combinations of CLOCK3111/ZBTB20 and PER2/PER3B were significant genetic risk factors for males, and CRY2/PER3C and CRY2/PER3-VNTR were significant risk factors for females. Anxiety, eveningness, and increasing age were significant clinical risk factors for seasonality and SAD for females. Protective factors for SAD symptoms (in females only) included single gene variants: CRY1-GG and PER3-VNTR-4,5. Clock gene effects were partially or fully mediated by diurnal preference or chronotype, suggesting multiple indirect effects of clock genes on seasonality symptoms. Interestingly, protective effects of CRY1-GG, PER3-VNTR-4,5, and ZBTB20 genotypes on seasonality and depression were not mediated by chronotype, suggesting some clock variants have direct effects on depressive symptoms related to SAD. Our results support previous links between CRY2, PER2, and ZBTB20 genes and identify novel links for CLOCK and PER3 with symptoms of seasonality and SAD. Our findings reinforce the sex-specific nature of circadian clock influences on seasonality and SAD and underscore the multiple pathways by which clock variants affect downstream mood pathways via direct and indirect mechanisms.",0.000170331

,38028709,Anticoagulant treatment and COVID-19 mortality among older adults living in nursing homes in Sweden.,Health Sci Rep,"Anticoagulants (AC) were introduced in March 2020 as standard of care in nursing home (NH) residents affected with COVID-19 in the Stockholm region, Sweden. ACs are proven to reduce the risk of complications and mortality from COVID-19 among patients of other ages and settings, but there is limited scientific evidence underpinning this practice in the NH setting.This matched cohort study included 182 NH residents in the Stockholm Region diagnosed with COVID-19 in March-May 2020. The main exposure was any AC treatment. Exposed (n?=?91), 49% prevalent (pre-COVID-19 diagnosis) AC and 51% incident AC were compared with unexposed controls (n?=?91). The outcome was 28-days all-cause mortality after COVID-19 infection. The mortality odds ratios (OR) were assessed using logistic regression, adjusted for age, sex, multimorbidity, and mobility, also stratified by incident or prevalent AC-type, age group, and sex.Of the 182 individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 (median age 88 years, 68% women), 39% died within 28 days after diagnosis. Use of either incident or prevalent AC was associated with a reduced, adjusted 28-day mortality (OR[95% CI]: 0.31[0.16-0.62]). In stratified analyses, the association was significant in both age groups: 70-89 (OR: 0.37 [0.15-0.89]) and 90-99 years of age (OR: 0.22 [0.07-0.65]. In sex-stratified analysis, the AC-lowering effect was significant in women only (OR: 0.28[0.11-0.67]). In the analyses stratified by AC type, the mortality-lowering effect was observed for both prevalent AC (OR: 0.35[0.12-0.99]) and incident AC (OR: 0.29[0.11-0.76]).Both prevalent and incident use of ACs in prophylactic dosing was associated with reduced 28-day mortality among older individuals with COVID-19 in a NH setting. The effect was seen across age-strata and in women. The findings present new insight in best practice for individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 in the NH setting.© 2023 The Authors.

,38007590,The rate of epigenetic drift scales with maximum lifespan across mammals.,Nat Commun,"Epigenetic drift or ""disorder"" increases across the mouse lifespan and is suggested to underlie epigenetic clock signals. While the role of epigenetic drift in determining maximum lifespan across species has been debated, robust tests of this hypothesis are lacking. Here, we test if epigenetic disorder at various levels of genomic resolution explains maximum lifespan across four mammal species. We show that epigenetic disorder increases with age in all species and at all levels of genomic resolution tested. The rate of disorder accumulation occurs faster in shorter lived species and corresponds to species adjusted maximum lifespan. While the density of cytosine-phosphate-guanine dinucleotides (""CpGs"") is negatively associated with the rate of age-associated disorder accumulation, it does not fully explain differences across species. Our findings support the hypothesis that the rate of epigenetic drift explains maximum lifespan and provide partial support for the hypothesis that CpG density buffers against epigenetic drift.© 2023.

,38003036,Comprehensive Identification of Mitochondrial Pseudogenes (NUMTs) in the Human Telomere-to-Telomere Reference Genome.,Genes (Basel),"Practices related to mitochondrial research have long been hindered by the presence of mitochondrial pseudogenes within the nuclear genome (NUMTs). Even though partially assembled human reference genomes like hg38 have included NUMTs compilation, the exhaustive NUMTs within the only complete reference genome (T2T-CHR13) remain unknown. Here, we comprehensively identified the fixed NUMTs within the reference genome using human pan-mitogenome (HPMT) from GeneBank. The inclusion of HPMT serves the purpose of establishing an authentic mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutational spectrum for the identification of NUMTs, distinguishing it from the polymorphic variations found in NUMTs. Using HPMT, we identified approximately 10% of additional NUMTs in three human reference genomes under stricter thresholds. And we also observed an approximate 6% increase in NUMTs in T2T-CHR13 compared to hg38, including NUMTs on the short arms of chromosomes 13, 14, and 15 that were not assembled previously. Furthermore, alignments based on 20-mer from mtDNA suggested the presence of more mtDNA-like short segments within the nuclear genome, which should be avoided for short amplicon or cell free mtDNA detection. Finally, through the assay of transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) on cell lines before and after mtDNA elimination, we concluded that NUMTs have a minimal impact on bulk ATAC-seq, even though 16% of sequencing data originated from mtDNA.",0.0000315

We developed a statistically robust framework to compare methylation rates at conserved age-related sites across mammals. We found that methylation rates negatively scale with maximum lifespan in both blood and skin. The emergence of explicit scaling suggests that methylation rates are, or are linked to, an evolutionary constraint on maximum lifespan acting across diverse mammalian lineages.© 2023.

DNA methylation (DNAm) alterations have been implicated in both the aging processes and the development of AD.

We created MIAMI-AD, a comprehensive knowledge base containing manually curated summary statistics from 97 published tables in 37 studies, all of which included at least 100 participants. MIAMI-AD enables easy browsing, querying, and downloading DNAm associations at multiple levels - at individual CpG, gene, genomic regions, or genome-wide, in one or multiple studies. Moreover, it also offers tools to perform integrative analyses, such as comparing DNAm associations across different phenotypes or tissues, as well as interactive visualizations. Using several use case examples, we demonstrated that MIAMI-AD facilitates our understanding of age-associated CpGs in AD and the sex-specific roles of DNAm in AD.

We integrated association studies of three types of omics data to provide insights into the pathophysiology of subclinical coronary disease and myocardial infarction (MI). Using multivariable regression models, we associated: (1) single nucleotide polymorphism, (2) DNA methylation, and (3) gene expression with coronary artery calcification (CAC) scores and MI. Among 3106 participants of the Framingham Heart Study, 65 (2.1%) had prevalent MI and 60 (1.9%) had incident MI, median CAC value was 67.8 [IQR 10.8, 274.9], and 1403 (45.2%) had CAC scores?>?0 (prevalent CAC). Prevalent CAC was associated with AHRR (linked to smoking) and EXOC3 (affecting platelet function and promoting hemostasis). CAC score was associated with VWA1 (extracellular matrix protein associated with cartilage structure in endomysium). For prevalent MI we identified FYTTD1 (down-regulated in familial hypercholesterolemia) and PINK1 (linked to cardiac tissue homeostasis and ischemia-reperfusion injury). Incident MI was associated with IRX3 (enhancing browning of white adipose tissue) and STXBP3 (controlling trafficking of glucose transporter type 4 to plasma). Using an integrative trans-omics approach, we identified both putatively novel and known candidate genes associated with CAC and MI. Replication of findings is warranted.© 2023.

,38130880,Identifying unique exposure-specific transgenerational differentially DNA methylated region epimutations inÂ the genome using hybrid deep learning prediction models.,Environ Epigenet,"Exposure to environmental toxicants can lead to epimutations in the genome and an increase in differential DNA methylated regions (DMRs) that have been linked to increased susceptibility to various diseases. However, the unique effect of particular toxicants on the genome in terms of leading to unique DMRs for the toxicants has been less studied. One hurdle to such studies is the low number of observed DMRs per toxicants. To address this hurdle, a previously validated hybrid deep-learning cross-exposure prediction model is trained per exposure and used to predict exposure-specific DMRs in the genome. Given these predicted exposure-specific DMRs, a set of unique DMRs per exposure can be identified. Analysis of these unique DMRs through visualization, DNA sequence motif matching, and gene association reveals known and unknown links between individual exposures and their unique effects on the genome. The results indicate the potential ability to define exposure-specific epigenetic markers in the genome and the potential relative impact of different exposures. Therefore, a computational approach to predict exposure-specific transgenerational epimutations was developed, which supported the exposure specificity of ancestral toxicant actions and provided epigenome information on the DMR sites predicted.© The Author(s) 2023.

A systems biology approach identified several biological processes significantly enriched with genes in association with DMCs with FDR?<?0.05, including regulation of transcription, regulation of epinephrine secretion, norepinephrine biosynthesis, receptor transactivation, forebrain regionalization and several terms related to kidney and cardiovascular development. Gene ontology analysis of the genes in association with the 48 DMRs identified several significantly enriched biological processes related to kidney development, including mesonephric duct development and nephron tubule development. Furthermore, our dataset identified several DNA methylation markers enriched in gene networks involved in biological pathways and rare diseases of the cardiovascular system, kidneys, and metabolism.Our study identified several DMCs/DMRs in association with fetal overgrowth.

Prosocial behavior, which includes cooperation and helping others, develops within a bioecological context. Considering it through such a lens enhances the understanding of the roles of different bioecological factors in its development.Using data from a longitudinal study of adopted children and children reared with their biological parents, this paper examined if positive aspects of a child's bioecological system at age 7 predict prosocial behavior in early adolescence (age 11), and whether these bioecological factors could offset risk due to biological family psychopathology and/or maternal prenatal substance use. The analyses incorporated variables from different levels of Bronfenbrenner's bioecological model (the individual, microsystem, exosystem, and macrosystem) and examined the promotive, and potentially protective, effect of each contextual factor, while also considering their interplay with biological family psychopathology and prenatal substance use.Results from linear regression models indicated that the microsystem variable of parental warmth at age 7 had a promotive effect on age 11 prosocial behavior. Further, in addition to its main effect, parental warmth was protective against maternal substance use during pregnancy when children were raised with their biological parent (s). Household type (biological family) and biological family internalizing psychopathology were the only other significant predictors in the model, with each associated with lower prosocial behavior at age 11.Study results extend prior work on the benefits of parental warmth on child outcomes by employing a strength-based, bioecological approach to the development of prosocial behavior during early adolescence and examining ""for whom"" the effects of parental warmth are most protective.Copyright © 2023 Bates, Berny, Ganiban, Natsuaki, Neiderhiser, Shaw and Leve.",0.00000257

However, there is no consensus regarding the effects of co-exposure to multiple metal(loid)s (designated hereafter metals) on blood lipid levels. Thus, blood concentrations of six human essential metals and five toxic metals in 720 general populations from southeastern China were simultaneously determined as a measure of exposure. In addition, quantile g-computation, Bayesian kernel machine regression, elastic net regression, and generalized linear model were used to investigate both the joint and individual effects of exposure to this metal mixture on human blood lipid levels. The significant positive joint effect of exposure to this metal mixture on serum total cholesterol (TC) levels, rather than on serum triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, Castelli risk index I, Castelli risk index II, atherogenic coefficient, and non-HDL-C levels, was found. In addition, the positive effect may be primarily driven by selenium (Se), lead (Pb), and mercury (Hg) exposure. In addition, on the effect of TC levels, the synergistic effect between Pb and Hg and the antagonistic effect between Se and Pb were identified. Our finding suggests that combined exposure to this metal mixture may affect human blood lipid levels. Therefore, reducing exposure to heavy metals, such as Pb and Hg, should be a priority for the general population. In addition, Se supplementation should also be considered with caution.© 2023.

The usual treatment is a reduction in calorie intake and an increase in energy expenditure, but not all individuals respond equally to these treatments. Epigenetics could be a factor that contributes to this heterogeneity. The aim of this research was to determine the association between DNA methylation at baseline and the percentage of BMI loss (%BMIL) after two dietary interventions, in order to design a prediction model to evaluate %BMIL based on methylation data.Spanish participants with overweight or obesity (n= 306) were randomly assigned to two lifestyle interventions with hypocaloric diets: one moderately high in protein (MHP) and the other low in fat (LF) for 4 months (Obekit study; ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT02737267). Basal DNA methylation was analyzed in white blood cells using the Infinium MethylationEPIC array. After identifying those methylation sites associated with %BMIL (p< 0.05 and SD > 0.1), two weighted methylation sub-scores were constructed for each diet: 15 CpGs were used for the MHP diet and 11 CpGs for the LF diet. Afterwards, a total methylation score was made by subtracting the previous sub-scores. These data were used to design a prediction model for %BMIL through a linear mixed effect model with the interaction between diet and total score.Overall, DNA methylation predicts the %BMIL of two 4-month hypocaloric diets and was able to determine which type of diet is the most appropriate for each individual.

,38052159,New insights into the (epi)genetics of twinning.,Hum Reprod,"Spontaneous dizygotic (DZ) twins, i.e. twins conceived without the use of ARTs, run in families and their prevalence varies widely around the globe. In contrast, monozygotic (MZ) twins occur at a constant rate across time and geographical regions and, with some rare exceptions, do not cluster in families. The leading hypothesis for MZ twins, which arise when a zygote splits during preimplantation stages of development, is random occurrence. We have found the first series of genes underlying the liability of being the mother of DZ twins and have shown that being an MZ twin is strongly associated with a stable DNA methylation signature in child and adult somatic tissues. Because identical twins keep this molecular signature across the lifespan, this discovery opens up completely new possibilities for the retrospective diagnosis of whether a person is an MZ twin whose co-twin may have vanished in the early stages of pregnancy. Here, we summarize the gene finding results for mothers of DZ twins based on genetic association studies followed by meta-analysis, and further present the striking epigenetic results for MZ twins.© The Author(s) 2023.

,37983031,Deficit Accumulation Index and Biological Markers of Aging in Survivors of Childhood Cancer.,JAMA Netw Open,"Survivors of childhood cancer experience premature aging compared with community controls. The deficit accumulation index (DAI) uses readily available clinical data to measure physiological age in survivors; however, little data exist on how well deficit accumulation represents underlying biological aging among survivors of cancer.To examine the associations between the DAI and epigenetic age acceleration (EAA) and mean leukocyte telomere length (LTL).This cross-sectional study analyzed data from the St Jude Lifetime Cohort, an assessment of survivors of childhood cancer who were treated at St Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee. Data were collected between 2007 and 2016, assayed between 2014 and 2019, and analyzed between 2022 and 2023. Participants were adult survivors who were diagnosed between 1962 and 2012 and who survived 5 years or more from time of diagnosis. The analyses were restricted to survivors with European ancestry, as there were too few survivors with non-European ancestry.The DAI included 44 aging-related items, such as chronic health conditions and functional, psychosocial, and mental well-being. Item responses were summed and divided by the total number of items, resulting in a ratio ranging from 0 to 1. These DAI results were categorized based on reported associations with hospitalization and mortality: low, defined as a DAI less than 0.2; medium, defined as a DAI of 0.2 to less than 0.35; and high, defined as a DAI of 0.35 or higher.Genome-wide DNA methylation was generated from peripheral blood mononuclear cell-derived DNA. The EAA was calculated as the residuals from regressing the Levine epigenetic age on chronological age. The mean LTL was estimated using whole-genome sequencing data.This study included 2101 survivors of childhood cancer (1122 males [53.4%]; mean [SD] age, 33.9 [9.1] years; median [IQR] time since diagnosis, 25.1 [18.7-31.9] years) with European ancestry. Compared with survivors in the low DAI group, those in the high DAI group experienced 3.7 more years of EAA (??=?3.66; 95% CI, 2.47-4.85; P?<?.001), whereas those in the medium DAI group experienced 1.8 more years of EAA (??=?1.77; 95% CI, 0.84-2.69; P?<?.001), independent of treatment exposures. The EAA and DAI association was consistent across 3 common diagnoses (acute lymphoblastic leukemia, Hodgkin lymphoma, and central nervous system tumors) and across chronological age groups. For example, among acute lymphoblastic leukemia survivors, those in the medium DAI group (??=?2.27; 95% CI, 0.78-3.76; P?=?.001) experienced greater EAA vs those in the low DAI group. Similarly, among survivors younger than 30 years, the high DAI group experienced 4.9 more years of EAA vs the low DAI group (??=?4.95; 95% CI, 2.14-7.75; P?<?.001). There were no associations between mean LTL residual and the DAI.This cross-sectional study of survivors of childhood cancer showed that the DAI was associated with EAA, suggesting an underlying biological process to the accumulation of deficits. Both the DAI and EAA were effective at identifying aging phenotypes, and either may be used to measure aging and response to interventions targeting aging pathways.",0.000000195

Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based genome-wide association studies (GWASs) do not fully capture STR effects. To study these effects, we imputed 445,720 STRs into genotype arrays from 408,153 White British UK Biobank participants and tested for association with 44 blood phenotypes. Using two fine-mapping methods, we identify 119 candidate causal STR-trait associations and estimate that STRs account for 5.2%-7.6% of causal variants identifiable from GWASs for these traits. These are among the strongest associations for multiple phenotypes, including a coding CTG repeat associated with apolipoprotein B levels, a promoter CGG repeat with platelet traits, and an intronic poly(A) repeat with mean platelet volume. Our study suggests that STRs make widespread contributions to complex traits, provides stringently selected candidate causal STRs, and demonstrates the need to consider a more complete view of genetic variation in GWASs.© 2023 The Author(s).",7.35E-08

The aim of the study was to explore the association of several ageing biomarkers with the risk of several types of coronary heart disease using the Mendelian randomization approach.Summary data for telomere length, four epigenetic clocks (such as intrinsic epigenetic age acceleration), four types of coronary heart disease (such as myocardial infarction) were collected from the most updated and available genome-wide association studies. Instrumental variables were extracted from the exposure-related summary data according to correlation, independence and exclusivity assumptions. Three Mendelian randomization methods (such as inverse variance weighted) were used for causal inference. Four sensitivity analyses (such as MR-Egger intercept) were performed to prevent horizontal pleiotropy.Inverse variance weighted reported that longer telomere length was related to the lower risk of myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, unstable angina pectoris and coronary atherosclerosis (P?=?8.840e-11, P?=?9.830e-04, P?=?1.539e-05, P?=?2.607e-09). Inverse variance weighted also reported that four epigenetic clocks might be not implicated in the risk of these coronary heart diseases. Furthermore, there was not enough evidence to confirm the effect of coronary heart disease on these ageing biomarkers.Longer telomere length, but not the epigenetic clock changes, genetically decreased the risk of coronary heart disease. Considering that telomere length and epigenetic clocks were two independent ageing biomarkers, the correlation between ageing and coronary heart disease might be redefined at the genetic level.© 2023.

,38042866,Identification of intergenerational epigenetic inheritance by whole genome DNA methylation analysis in trios.,Sci Rep,"Genome-wide association studies have identified thousands of loci associated with common diseases and traits. However, a large fraction of heritability remains unexplained. Epigenetic modifications, such as the observed in DNA methylation have been proposed as a mechanism of intergenerational inheritance. To investigate the potential contribution of DNA methylation to the missing heritability, we analysed the methylomes of four healthy trios (two parents and one offspring) using whole genome bisulphite sequencing. Of the 1.5 million CpGs (19%) with over 20% variability between parents in at least one family and compatible with a Mendelian inheritance pattern, only 3488 CpGs (0.2%) lacked correlation with any SNP in the genome, marking them as potential sites for intergenerational epigenetic inheritance. These markers were distributed genome-wide, with some preference to be located in promoters. They displayed a bimodal distribution, being either fully methylated or unmethylated, and were often found at the boundaries of genomic regions with high/low GC content. This analysis provides a starting point for future investigations into the missing heritability of simple and complex traits.© 2023. The Author(s).",4.41E-08

DNBC-data were linked with health and social data identified from Statistics Denmark registers. Spinal pain was self-reported in both the 11-year- and 18-year follow-up of DNBC and classified according to severity. Body height was measured from birth and onwards and further modelled as distinct developmental height trajectories by using latent growth curve modelling. Associations were estimated by using multinomial logistic regression models.Taller body height in childhood and adolescence was associated with approximately 20% increased likelihood of spinal pain in pre- and late adolescence among girls compared to their peers in the normal height group. For boys, taller body height was associated with spinal pain by late adolescence only. Spinal pain in pre-adolescence almost doubled the likelihood of spinal pain in late adolescence regardless of body height at age 18. Height trajectories confirmed the relationship for girls with the tall individuals being most likely to have spinal pain in both pre- and late adolescence.Tall body height during childhood and adolescence predisposes to spinal pain among girls in both pre-and late adolescence, and among boys in late adolescence. Body height is a contributing factor to the pathogenesis of spinal pain in adolescence; however, the mechanisms may be related to growth velocity, but for now uncertain.© 2023.

Novel biomarkers are thus greatly needed. Here, we investigated how common genetic factors (epilepsy polygenic risk scores, [PRSs]) influence epilepsy risk in detailed longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs) of > 360k Finns spanning up to 50 years of individuals' lifetimes. Individuals with a high genetic generalized epilepsy PRS (PRSGGE) in FinnGen had an increased risk for genetic generalized epilepsy (GGE) (hazard ratio [HR] 1.55 per PRSGGEstandard deviation [SD]) across their lifetime and after unspecified seizure events. Effect sizes of epilepsy PRSs were comparable to effect sizes in clinically curated data supporting our EHR-derived epilepsy diagnoses. Within 10 years after an unspecified seizure, the GGE rate was 37% when PRSGGE> 2 SD compared to 5.6% when PRSGGE< -2 SD. The effect of PRSGGEwas even larger on GGE subtypes of idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) (HR 2.1 per SD PRSGGE). We further report significantly larger effects of PRSGGEon epilepsy in females and in younger age groups. Analogously, we found significant but more modest focal epilepsy PRS burden associated with non-acquired focal epilepsy (NAFE). We found PRSGGEspecifically associated with GGE in comparison with >2000 independent diseases while PRSNAFEwas also associated with other diseases than NAFE such as back pain. Here, we show that epilepsy specific PRSs have good discriminative ability after a first seizure event i.e. in circumstances where the prior probability of epilepsy is high outlining a potential to serve as biomarkers for an epilepsy diagnosis.",1.71E-08
,38006773,Waterpipe and cigarette epigenome analysis reveals markers implicated in addiction and smoking type inference.,Environ Int,"Waterpipe smoking is frequent in the Middle East and Africa with emerging prevalence worldwide. The epigenome acts as a molecular sensor to exposures and a crucial driver in several diseases. With the widespread use of waterpipe smoking, it is timely to investigate its epigenomic markers and their role in addiction, as a central player in disease prevention and therapeutic strategies. DNA methylome-wide profiling was performed on an exposure-rich population from the Middle East, constituting of 216 blood samples split equally between never, cigarette-only and waterpipe-only smokers. Waterpipe smokers showed predominantly distinct epigenetic markers from cigarette smokers, even though both smoking forms are tobacco-based. Moreover, each smoking form could be accurately (?90 %) inferred from the DNA methylome using machine learning. Top markers showed dose-response relationship with extent of smoking and were validated using independent technologies and additional samples (total N = 284). Smoking markers were enriched in regulatory regions and several biological pathways, primarily addiction. The epigenetically altered genes were not associated with genetic etiology of tobacco use, and the methylation levels of addiction genes, in particular, were more likely to reverse after smoking cessation. In contrast, other epigenetic markers continued to feature smoking exposure after cessation, which may explain long-term health effects observed in former smokers. This study reports, for the first time, blood epigenome-wide markers of waterpipe smokers and reveals new markers of cigarette smoking, with implications in mechanisms of addiction and the capacity to discriminate between different smoking types. These markers may offer actionable targets to reverse the epigenetic memory of addiction and can guide future prevention strategies for tobacco smoking as the most preventable cause of illnesses worldwide.Copyright © 2023.

Thirty children, were formed two groups, one of low birth weight children (LBW,n= 15) and another of normal weight (NBW = 15) were initially identified in a hospital and reapproached at 3 and 6 months of age. Birth weight and alterations in GH/IGF-1 curves were measured at birth and the third and sixth months of life.Weight gain during the 6 months of follow-up in newborns with a low birth weight was greater compared to newborns with a normal birth weight. All children who were born with a low birth weight had an altered GH/IGF-1 curve at birth (p= 0.002). Most newborns with a low birth weight maintained the alteration in the GH/IGF-1 curve at the third month of life (p= 0.027). Regarding the GH/IGF-1 curve at the sixth month, alteration persisted in greater proportion among children with a low birth weight.Alterations in insulin resistance markers, demonstrated by increased GH without a proportional increase in IGF-1, were observed to be significant in children with a low birth weight with greater adiposity in this group which may increase the risk of metabolic diseases in later life.",8.15E-09

Among the considered choices, the best-performing methods for detecting active mediators in simulations are the Bayesian sparse linear mixed model (BSLMM) and high-dimensional mediation analysis (HDMA); while the preferred methods for estimating the global mediation effect are high-dimensional linear mediation analysis (HILMA) and principal component mediation analysis (PCMA).

Epigenome-wide association analyses (EWAS) using uniform (Illumina) methodology have identified novel epigenetic profiles of WTC exposure.Methods: We reviewed all published data, comparing differentially methylated gene profiles identified in the prior EWAS studies of WTC exposure. This included DNA methylation changes in blood-derived DNA from cases of cancer-free ""Survivors"" and those with breast cancer, as well as tissue-derived DNA from ""Responders"" with prostate cancer. Emerging molecular pathways related to the observed DNA methylation changes in WTC-exposed groups were explored and summarized.Results: WTC dust exposure appears to be associated with DNA methylation changes across the genome. Notably, WTC dust exposure appears to be associated with increased global DNA methylation; direct dysregulation of cancer genes and pathways, including inflammation and immune system dysregulation; and endocrine system disruption, as well as disruption of cholesterol homeostasis and lipid metabolism.Conclusion: WTC dust exposure appears to be associated with biologically meaningful DNA methylation changes, with implications for carcinogenesis and development of other chronic diseases.",5.7E-09
,37924108,Epigenetics insights from perceived facial aging.,Clin Epigenetics,"Facial aging is the most visible manifestation of aging. People desire to look younger than others of the same chronological age. Hence, perceived age is often used as a visible marker of aging, while biological age, often estimated by methylation markers, is used as an objective measure of age. Multiple epigenetics-based clocks have been developed for accurate estimation of general biological age and the age of specific organs, including the skin. However, it is not clear whether the epigenetic biomarkers (CpGs) used in these clocks are drivers of aging processes or consequences of aging. In this proof-of-concept study, we integrate data from GWAS on perceived facial aging and EWAS on CpGs measured in blood. By running EW Mendelian randomization, we identify hundreds of putative CpGs that are potentially causal to perceived facial aging with similar numbers of damaging markers that causally drive or accelerate facial aging and protective methylation markers that causally slow down or protect from aging. We further demonstrate that while candidate causal CpGs have little overlap with known epigenetics-based clocks, they affect genes or proteins with known functions in skin aging, such as skin pigmentation, elastin, and collagen levels. Overall, our results suggest that blood methylation markers reflect facial aging processes, and thus can be used to quantify skin aging and develop anti-aging solutions that target the root causes of aging.© 2023.

Famine intensity was measured based on the excess mortality during the famine.T2DM diagnosis was based on WHO (1999) criteria.We observed in univariate analysis a 1.8-fold increase in T2DM (OR 1.80; 95% CI 1.74-1.85) among individuals born in the first half-year of 1934 in regions with extreme, severe, or significant famine. We observed no increase among individuals born in regions with no famine. In multivariate analysis across regions and adjusting for season of birth we observed a larger than 2-fold increase (OR 2.21; 95% CI 2.00-2.45). There was a dose-response by famine intensity, with ORs increasing from 1.94 to 2.39 across regions. The pattern was similar in men and women.Births in the first half-year of 1934 were conceived at the height of the Ukraine famine in 1933.

We utilized levels of human blood plasma proteins originating from specific organs to measure organ-specific aging differences in living individuals. Using machine learning models, we analysed aging in 11 major organs and estimated organ age reproducibly in five independent cohorts encompassing 5,676 adults across the human lifespan. We discovered nearly 20% of the population show strongly accelerated age in one organ and 1.7% are multi-organ agers. Accelerated organ aging confers 20-50% higher mortality risk, and organ-specific diseases relate to faster aging of those organs. We find individuals with accelerated heart aging have a 250% increased heart failure risk and accelerated brain and vascular aging predict Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression independently from and as strongly as plasma pTau-181 (ref.5), the current best blood-based biomarker for AD. Our models link vascular calcification, extracellular matrix alterations and synaptic protein shedding to early cognitive decline.

Occupational exposure of firefighters to carcinogenic chemicals may increase their risk of developing different types of cancer. PFAS are one of the major classes of carcinogenic chemicals that firefighters are exposed to as occupational hazard. Elevated levels of PFAS have been observed in firefighters' blood serum in recent studies. Possible sources of occupational exposure to PFAS include turnout gear, aqueous film-forming foam, and air and dust at both the fire scene and fire station. Preliminary discussion on PFAS includes definition, classification, and chemical structure. The review is then followed by identifying the sources of PFAS that firefighters may encounter as an occupational hazard. The structural properties of the PFAS used in identified sources, their degradation, and exposure pathways are reviewed. The elevated level of PFAS in the blood serum and how this might associate with an increased risk of cancer is discussed. Our review shows a significant amount of PFAS on turnout gear and their migration to untreated layers, and how turnout gear itself might be a potential source of PFAS exposure. PFAS from aqueous film-forming foams (AFFF), air, and dust of fire stations have been already established as potential exposure sources. Studies on firefighters' cancer suggest that firefighters have a higher cancer risk compared to the general population. This review suggests that increased exposure to PFAS as an occupational hazard could be a potential cancer risk for firefighters.",4.13E-09
x,38106096,Somatic mutation as an explanation for epigenetic aging.,bioRxiv,"DNA methylation marks have recently been used to build models known as ""epigenetic clocks"" which predict calendar age. As methylation of cytosine promotes C-to-T mutations, we hypothesized that the methylation changes observed with age should reflect the accrual of somatic mutations, and the two should yield analogous aging estimates. In analysis of multimodal data from 9,331 human individuals, we find that CpG mutations indeed coincide with changes in methylation, not only at the mutated site but also with pervasive remodeling of the methylome out to ±10 kilobases. This one-to-many mapping enables mutation-based predictions of age that agree with epigenetic clocks, including which individuals are aging faster or slower than expected. Moreover, genomic loci where mutations accumulate with age also tend to have methylation patterns that are especially predictive of age. These results suggest a close coupling between the accumulation of sporadic somatic mutations and the widespread changes in methylation observed over the course of life.",3.3E-09

However, not much is known about the genetic correlation of mtDNA copy number across multiple generations and its physiological significance.We measured the mtDNA copy number in cord blood or peripheral blood from 149 three-generation families, specifically the newborns, parents, and grandparents, of 149 families, totaling 1041 individuals. All of the biological specimens and information were provided by the Tohoku Medical Megabank Project in Japan. We also analyzed their maternal factors during pregnancy and neonatal outcomes.While the maternal peripheral blood mtDNA copy number was lower than that of other adult family members, it was negatively correlated with cord blood mtDNA copy number in male infants. Also, cord blood mtDNA copy numbers were negatively correlated with perinatal outcomes, such as gestation age, birth weight, and umbilical cord length, for both male and female neonates. Furthermore, the mtDNA copy number in the infants born to mothers who took folic acid supplements during pregnancy would be lower than in the infants born to mothers who did not take them.This data-driven study offers the most comprehensive view to date on the genetic and physiological significance of mtDNA copy number in cord blood or peripheral blood taken from three generations, totaling more than 1000 individuals. Our findings indicate that mtDNA copy number would be one of the transgenerational biomarkers for assessing perinatal outcomes, as well as that appropriate medical interventions could improve the outcomes via quantitative changes in mtDNA.© 2023.

There is little information on maternal-fetal transmission of messages which influence fetal growth. We analyzed adipocyte-derived small extracellular vesicular (ADsEV) microRNAs in maternal and cord blood to explore their adipogenic potential.There were 279 mother-neonate pairs with all phenotypic data (normal glucose tolerant NGT?=?148, gestational diabetes mellitus GDM?=?131). Neonates with adiposity were those in the highest tertile (T3) of sex-specific sum of skinfolds and those without adiposity (lean) in the lowest tertile T1 of NGT pregnancies. We studied ADsEV miRNAs in 76 and 51 neonates with and without adiposity respectively and their mothers based on power calculations (68 NGT and 59 GDM pregnancies). ADsEV miRNAs from maternal and cord blood plasma samples were profiled on Agilent 8*60?K microarray. Differential expression (DE) of ADsEV miRNAs in adipose vs. lean groups was studied before and after adjustment for maternal GDM, adiposity, and vitamin B12-folate status.Multiple miRNAs were common in maternal and cord blood and positively correlated. We identified 24 maternal and 5 cord blood miRNAs differentially expressed (discovery p ? 0.1) in the adipose group in unadjusted, and 19 and 26, respectively, in the adjusted analyses. Even though DE miRNAs were different in maternal and cord blood, they targeted similar adipogenic pathways (e.g., the forkhead box O (FOXO) family of transcription factors, mitogen?activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, transforming growth factor beta (TGF-?) pathway). Maternal GDM and adiposity were associated with many DE ADsEV miRNAs.Our results suggest that the ADsEV miRNAs in mothers are potential regulators of fetal adiposity. The expression and functionality of miRNAs appear to be influenced by maternal adiposity, hyperglycemia, and micronutrient status during pregnancy.© 2023.

We performed a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study using the genome-wide association study (GWAS) data from the UK Biobank as the exposure set. For the outcome set, we used stroke in the GWAS data from the GIGASTROKE Consortium. We considered alcohol consumption, atrial fibrillation, and body mass index as confounders. We used PhenoScanner searches for removal of SNPs and multivariable MR analysis for assessing confounders. We observed significant causal associations between GGT level and stroke (odds ratio [OR] = 1.23, 95% CI = [1.05-1.44], andp= 0.012 with IVW; OR = 1.19, 95% CI= [1.02-1.39], andp= 0.031 with MR-PRESSO). These results were consistent after removing SNPs related to confounding factors. Similarly, in multivariable MR, GGT was associated with stroke after adjusting for confounding factors (OR = 1.30, 95% CI 1.07-1.60),p= 0.010). Because GGT level has a causal relationship with stroke, researchers should test its significance as a potential risk factor for stroke. Additional research is required to validate these results.",9.18E-10

The study builds on the successful experiences of the Whitehall II study and aims to investigate the complex relationships between lifestyle, environmental, and occupational risk factors, and the development and progression of chronic age-associated diseases. An important goal of the Semmelweis Study is to identify groups of people who are aging unsuccessfully and therefore have an increased risk of developing age-associated diseases. To achieve this, the study takes a multidisciplinary approach, collecting economic, social, psychological, cognitive, health, and biological data. The Semmelweis Study comprises a baseline data collection with open healthcare data linkage, followed by repeated data collection waves every 5 years. Data are collected through computer-assisted self-completed questionnaires, followed by a physical health examination, physiological measurements, and the assessment of biomarkers. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the Semmelweis Study, including its origin, context, objectives, design, relevance, and expected contributions.© 2023. The Author(s).",8.36E-10
,38076972,Alzheimer's Related Neurodegeneration Mediates Air Pollution Effects on Medial Temporal Lobe Atrophy.,medRxiv,"Exposure to ambient air pollution, especially particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter <2.5 ?m (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), are environmental risk factors for Alzheimer's disease and related dementia. The medial temporal lobe (MTL) is an important brain region subserving episodic memory that atrophies with age, during the Alzheimer's disease continuum, and is vulnerable to the effects of cerebrovascular disease. Despite the importance of air pollution it is unclear whether exposure leads to atrophy of the MTL and by what pathways. Here we conducted a longitudinal study examining associations between ambient air pollution exposure and MTL atrophy and whether putative air pollution exposure effects resembled Alzheimer's disease-related neurodegeneration or cerebrovascular disease-related neurodegeneration. Participants included older women (n = 627; aged 71-87) who underwent two structural brain MRI scans (MRI-1: 2005-6; MRI-2: 2009-10) as part of the Women's Health Initiative Memory Study of Magnetic Resonance Imaging. Regionalized universal kriging was used to estimate annual concentrations of PM2.5and NO2at residential locations aggregated to 3-year averages prior to MRI-1. The outcome was 5-year standardized change in MTL volumes. Mediators included voxel-based MRI measures of the spatial pattern of neurodegeneration of Alzheimer's disease (Alzheimer's disease pattern similarity scores [AD-PS]) and whole-brain white matter small-vessel ischemic disease (WM-SVID) volume as a proxy of global cerebrovascular damage. Structural equation models were constructed to examine whether the associations between exposures with MTL atrophy were mediated by the initial level or concurrent change in AD-PS score or WM-SVID while adjusting for sociodemographic, lifestyle, clinical characteristics, and intracranial volume. Living in locations with higher PM2.5(per interquartile range [IQR]=3.17?g/m3) or NO2(per IQR=6.63ppb) was associated with greater MTL atrophy (?PM2.5= -0.29, 95% confidence interval [CI]=[-0.41,-0.18]; ?NO2=-0.12, 95%CI=[-0.23,-0.02]). Greater PM2.5was associated with larger increases in AD-PS (?PM2.5= 0.23, 95%CI=[0.12,0.33]) over time, which partially mediated associations with MTL atrophy (indirect effect= -0.10; 95%CI=[-0.15, -0.05]), explaining approximately 32% of the total effect. NO2was positively associated with AD-PS at MRI-1 (?NO2=0.13, 95%CI=[0.03,0.24]), which partially mediated the association with MTL atrophy (indirect effect= -0.01, 95% CI=[-0.03,-0.001]). Global WM-SVID at MRI-1 or concurrent change were not significant mediators between exposures and MTL atrophy. Findings support the mediating role of Alzheimer's disease-related neurodegeneration contributing to MTL atrophy associated with late-life exposures to air pollutants. Alzheimer's disease-related neurodegeneration only partially explained associations between exposure and MTL atrophy suggesting the role of multiple neuropathological processes underlying air pollution neurotoxicity on brain aging.",6.14E-10

Preeclampsia is one of leading causes of perinatal morbidity and mortality. Abnormal placentation, immune dysregulation, and maternal inflammatory response are possible etiologies. The burden of atopic diseases is increasing worldwide. Prenatal exposure might play a role in the pathogenesis of these two diseases. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between gestational hypertension and atopic diseases from a nationwide perspective.The primary data were retrieved from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database. The Maternal and Child Health Database was used to generate links between mothers and children. From 2004 to 2019, mothers with a diagnosis of gestational hypertension were identified as cases. The control groups were matched to the cases by maternal age, neonatal gender, date of birth, at a control-to-case ratio of 4:1. Each child was reviewed to confirm the diagnosis of atopic disease. Covariates including both maternal and neonatal factors were also collected.A total of 1,935,874 primiparas were enrolled in this study. After excluding 16,851 mothers with a history of hypertension, a total of 1,919,023 offspring were included in the study for the period 2004-2019. Gestational hypertension was associated with asthma (HR, 1.12, 95% CI, 1.02-1.23) and atopic dermatitis (HR, 1.10, 95% CI, 1.00-1.21) in offspring after controlling for cofactors. Nevertheless, gestational hypertension did not play an independent factor for allergic rhinitis (HR, 1.02, 95% CI, 0.95-1.10) or urticaria (HR, 1.02, 95% CI, 0.91-1.15).Maternal gestational hypertension increases the cumulative risk for asthma and atopic dermatitis in offspring.© 2023 Yang, Lin and Lin.",5.36E-10
,38105248,Evidence for a shared genetic contribution to loneliness and borderline personality disorder.,Transl Psychiatry,"Loneliness, influenced by genetic and environmental factors such as childhood maltreatment, is one aspect of interpersonal dysfunction in Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). Numerous studies link loneliness and BPD and twin studies indicate a genetic contribution to this association. The aim of our study was to investigate whether genetic predisposition for loneliness and BPD risk overlap and whether genetic risk for loneliness contributes to higher loneliness reported by BPD patients, using genome-wide genotype data. We assessed the genetic correlation of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of loneliness and BPD using linkage disequilibrium score regression and tested whether a polygenic score for loneliness (loneliness-PGS) was associated with case-control status in two independent genotyped samples of BPD patients and healthy controls (HC; Witt2017-sample: 998 BPD, 1545 HC; KFO-sample: 187 BPD, 261 HC). In the KFO-sample, we examined associations of loneliness-PGS with reported loneliness, and whether the loneliness-PGS influenced the association between childhood maltreatment and loneliness. We found a genetic correlation between the GWAS of loneliness and BPD in the Witt2017-sample (rg?=?0.23, p?=?0.015), a positive association of loneliness-PGS with BPD case-control status (Witt2017-sample: NkR²?=?2.3%, p?=?2.7*10-12; KFO-sample: NkR²?=?6.6%, p?=?4.4*10-6), and a positive association between loneliness-PGS and loneliness across patient and control groups in the KFO-sample (??=?0.186, p?=?0.002). The loneliness-PGS did not moderate the association between childhood maltreatment and loneliness in BPD. Our study is the first to use genome-wide genotype data to show that the genetic factors underlying variation in loneliness in the general population and the risk for BPD overlap. The loneliness-PGS was associated with reported loneliness. Further research is needed to investigate which genetic mechanisms and pathways are involved in this association and whether a genetic predisposition for loneliness contributes to BPD risk.© 2023.

DNA methylation analysis was performed using the Illumina Infinium Methylation EPIC Bead Chip microarrays. The methylation levels were fitted in a multivariate linear regression model to identify the differentially methylated probes. A binary SVM classification model was constructed to differentiate IDD21 samples from controls.We identified a highly specific, reproducible, and sensitive episignature associated with CTCF variants. Six variants of uncertain significance were tested, of which two mapped to the IDD21 episignature and clustered alongside IDD21 cases in both heatmap and multidimensional scaling plots. Comparison of the genomic DNA methylation profile of IDD21 to that of 56 other neurodevelopmental disorders provided insights into the underlying molecular pathophysiology of this disorder.The robust and specific CTCF/IDD21 episignature expands the growing list of neurodevelopmental disorders with distinct DNA methylation profiles, which can be applied as supporting evidence in variant classification.Copyright © 2023.

,38030696,Mitochondrial DNA copy number is associated with Crohn's disease: a comprehensive Mendelian randomization analysis.,Sci Rep,"Mitochondrial DNA plays a critical role in the pathophysiological process of inflammation. However, the relationship between mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNA-CN) and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) remains poorly understood. We conducted a comprehensive Mendelian randomization (MR) using three instrumental variables (IVs) to explore the causal associations between mtDNA-CN and IBD, including Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC). MR-Egger regression, weighted median, inverse-variance weighted (IVW), and weighted mode methods were used to evaluate the potential causal associations. The robustness of the IVW estimates was determined using the leave-one-out sensitivity test. A meta-analysis was conducted to pool the results from the three sets of IVs. Upon analysis, the findings of the current study revealed that genetically predicted mtDNA-CN was not associated with IBD (CD?+?UC) and UC. The results of MR analyses between mtDNA-CN and CD risk were inconsistent by using three sets of IVs. After a meta-analysis, we found that genetically predicted mtDNA-CN was associated with CD risk (odds ratio?=?2.09; 95% confidence interval: 1.37-3.18). This finding was also confirmed by multivariable MR analyses and remained robust when tested with the leave-one-out sensitivity test. In conclusion, genetically predicted mtDNA-CN was found to be associated with CD risk. Therefore, mtDNA levels in the blood could potentially be used as a marker for CD risk assessment. Further studies are needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and validate the results of this study.© 2023. The Author(s).",3.6E-10
,38017502,Epigenetic age acceleration in surviving versus deceased COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome following hospitalization.,Clin Epigenetics,"Aging has been reported as a major risk factor for severe symptoms and higher mortality rates in COVID-19 patients. Molecular hallmarks such as epigenetic alterations and telomere attenuation reflect the biological process of aging. Epigenetic clocks have been shown to be valuable tools for measuring biological age in various tissues and samples. As such, these epigenetic clocks can determine accelerated biological aging and time-to-mortality across various tissues. Previous reports have shown accelerated biological aging and telomere attrition acceleration following SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the effect of accelerated epigenetic aging on outcome (death/recovery) in COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has not been well investigated.In this study, we measured DNA methylation age and telomere attrition in 87 severe COVID-19 cases with ARDS under mechanical ventilation. Furthermore, we compared dynamic changes in epigenetic aging across multiple time points until recovery or death. Epigenetic age was measured using the Horvath, Hannum, DNAm skin and blood, GrimAge, and PhenoAge clocks, whereas telomere length was calculated using the surrogate marker DNAmTL. Our analysis revealed significant accelerated epigenetic aging but no telomere attrition acceleration in severe COVID-19 cases. In addition, we observed epigenetic age deceleration at inclusion versus end of follow-up in recovered but not in deceased COVID-19 cases using certain clocks. When comparing dynamic changes in epigenetic age acceleration (EAA), we detected higher EAA using both the Horvath and PhenoAge clocks in deceased versus recovered patients. The DNAmTL measurements revealed telomere attrition acceleration in deceased COVID-19 patients between inclusion and end of follow-up and a significant change in dynamic telomere attrition acceleration when comparing patients who recovered versus those who died.EAA and telomere attrition acceleration were associated with treatment outcomes in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with ARDS. A better understanding of the long-term effects of EAA in COVID-19 patients and how they might contribute to long COVID symptoms in recovered individuals is urgently needed.© 2023.

Proteomics is the systematic study of proteins and peptides to provide comprehensive descriptions. Aiming to obtain a more accurate and convenient clinical diagnosis, researchers are working for better biomarkers. Urine is more convenient which could reflect the change of disease at an earlier stage. Thus, we conducted a cross-sectional study to investigate novel diagnostic panels.We firstly enrolled participants from China-Japan Friendship Hospital from April 2022 to November 2022, collected urine samples, and conducted an LC-MS/MS analysis. In parallel, clinical data were collected, and clinical examinations were performed. After statistical and bioinformatics analyses, significant risk factors and differential urinary proteins were determined. We attempt to investigate diagnostic panels based on machine learning including LASSO and SVM.Fifty-seven AD patients, 43 MCI patients, and 62 CN subjects were enrolled. A total of 3366 proteins were identified, and 608 urine proteins were finally included in the analysis. There were 33 significantly differential proteins between the AD and CN groups and 15 significantly differential proteins between the MCI and CN groups. AD diagnostic panel included DDC, CTSC, EHD4, GSTA3, SLC44A4, GNS, GSTA1, ANXA4, PLD3, CTSH, HP, RPS3, CPVL, age, and APOE ?4 with an AUC of 0.9989 in the training test and 0.8824 in the test set while MCI diagnostic panel included TUBB, SUCLG2, PROCR, TCP1, ACE, FLOT2, EHD4, PROZ, C9, SERPINA3, age, and APOE ?4 with an AUC of 0.9985 in the training test and 0.8143 in the test set. Besides, diagnostic proteins were weakly correlated with cognitive functions.In conclusion, the procedure is convenient, non-invasive, and useful for diagnosis, which could assist physicians in differentiating AD and MCI from CN.© 2023.

The pace of ageing determines the magnitude of that risk and can be expressed as biological age. Targeting fundamental pathways of human aging with geroprotectors has the potential to lower the biological age and therewith prolong the healthspan, the period of life one spends in good health. Target populations for geroprotective interventions should be chosen based on the ageing mechanisms being addressed and the expected effect of the geroprotector on the primary outcome. Biomarkers of ageing, such as DNA methylation age, can be used to select populations for geroprotective interventions and as a surrogate outcome. Here, the use of DNA methylation clocks for selecting target populations for geroprotective intervention is explored.© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",2.11E-10

Urine cell-free DNA (ucfDNA) isolated from a discovery cohort of 31 non-HCC and 30 HCC was used for biomarker discovery, identifying 29 genes with differentially methylated regions (DMRs). Methylation-specific qPCR (MSqPCR) assays were developed to verify the selected DMRs corresponding to 8 genes (GRASP, CCND2, HOXA9, BMP4, VIM, EMX1, SFRP1, and ECE). Using archived ucfDNA, methylation of GRASP, HOXA9, BMP4, and ECE1, were found to be significantly different (p?<?0.05) between HCC and non-HCC patients. The four markers together with previously reported GSTP1 and RASSF1A markers were assessed as a 6-marker panel in an independent training cohort of 87 non-HCC and 78 HCC using logistic regression modeling. AUROC of 0.908 (95% CI, 0.8656-0.9252) was identified for the 6-marker panel with AFP, which was significantly higher than AFP-alone (AUROC 0.841 (95% CI, 0.778-0.904), p?=?0.0026). Applying backward selection method, a 4-marker panel was found to exhibit similar performance to the 6-marker panel with AFP having 80% sensitivity compared to 29.5% by AFP-alone at a specificity of 85%.

,38019829,Cohort profile: Genetic data in the German Socio-Economic Panel Innovation Sample (SOEP-G).,PLoS One,"The German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) serves a global research community by providing representative annual longitudinal data of respondents living in private households in Germany. The dataset offers a valuable life course panorama, encompassing living conditions, socioeconomic status, familial connections, personality traits, values, preferences, health, and well-being. To amplify research opportunities further, we have extended the SOEP Innovation Sample (SOEP-IS) by collecting genetic data from 2,598 participants, yielding the first genotyped dataset for Germany based on a representative population sample (SOEP-G). The sample includes 107 full-sibling pairs, 501 parent-offspring pairs, and 152 triads, which overlap with the parent-offspring pairs. Leveraging the results from well-powered genome-wide association studies, we created a repository comprising 66 polygenic indices (PGIs) in the SOEP-G sample. We show that the PGIs for height, BMI, and educational attainment capture 22?24%, 12?13%, and 9% of the variance in the respective phenotypes. Using the PGIs for height and BMI, we demonstrate that the considerable increase in average height and the decrease in average BMI in more recent birth cohorts cannot be attributed to genetic shifts within the German population or to age effects alone. These findings suggest an important role of improved environmental conditions in driving these changes. Furthermore, we show that higher values in the PGIs for educational attainment and the highest math class are associated with better self-rated health, illustrating complex relationships between genetics, cognition, behavior, socio-economic status, and health. In summary, the SOEP-G data and the PGI repository we created provide a valuable resource for studying individual differences, inequalities, life-course development, health, and interactions between genetic predispositions and the environment.Copyright: © 2023 Koellinger et al.

We conducted a retrospective longitudinal study including ELBW infants followed-up for up to 10 years after discharge. EAR was defined as occurring before 5 years of age. A multivariate binary logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate maternal and perinatal variables independently associated with EAR. Out of 212 ELBW infants included in the analysis, 40.6% developed EAR and 21.5% showed it before 4 years of age. Only formula milk feeding at discharge was independently associated with a higher risk of EAR. The mean BMI of children with EAR was higher than that of children without EAR. Furthermore, the prevalence of overweight and obesity was higher in the EAR group than in the timely AR group.  Conclusions: ELBW infants in our cohort developed EAR in a relatively high percentage of cases. In this already at-risk population, EAR may represent a further risk factor for an adverse metabolic outcome. Monitoring preterm infants' growth within a long-term follow-up program and promoting and supporting human milk feeding is advisable. What is Known:  Preterm-born infants are at high risk for long-term adverse health outcomes, especially cardiovascular and metabolic.  The occurrence of early adiposity rebound (EAR) is associated with the risk of later obesity and metabolic syndrome. What is New:  The occurrence of EAR in ELBW infants may represent an additional risk factor for later adverse metabolic outcomes in an already vulnerable population.  Future preventive strategies should include a long-term follow-up and the promotion of exclusive breastfeeding.© 2023.

We identified existing medications for potential pharmacological studies by a computational drug repurposing analysis. Cross-ancestry polygenic risk scores showed better performance of association in independent samples than single-ancestry polygenic risk scores. Genetic correlations between PAU and other traits were observed in multiple ancestries, with other substance use traits having the highest correlations.

We obtained pooled statistics from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on depression and the age proxy indicators. We employed five MR analysis methods to address potential biases and ensure robustness of our results, with the inverse variance weighted (IVW) method being the primary outcome. We also conducted outlier exclusion using Radial MR, MRPRESSO, and MR Steiger filters. Additionally, sensitivity analyses were performed to assess heterogeneity and pleiotropy.Our MR analysis revealed that depression causally leads to shortened telomere length (??=?-?0.014; P?=?0.038), increased frailty index (??=?0.076; P?=?0.000), and accelerated GrimAge (??=?0.249; P?=?0.024). Furthermore, our findings showed that the frailty index (OR?=?1.679; P?=?0.001) was causally associated with an increased risk of depression. Additionally, we found that appendicular lean mass (OR?=?0.929; P?=?0.000) and left-hand grip strength (OR?=?0.836; P?=?0.014) were causally associated with a reduced risk of depression. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated the robustness of our findings.Our study provides evidence that depression contributes to the accelerated aging process, resulting in decreased telomere length, increased frailty index, and accelerated GrimAge. Additionally, we found that the frailty index increases the risk of depression, while appendicular lean mass and left-handed grip strength reduce the risk of depression.© 2023.

We conducted a placebo-controlled randomized pilot study with the primary objective of determining safety of NR in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Twenty subjects with MCI were randomized to receive placebo or NR using dose escalation to achieve, and maintain, a final dose of 1 g/day over a 10-week study duration. The primary outcome was post-treatment change from baseline measures of cognition (Montreal Cognitive Assessment, MoCA). Predefined secondary outcomes included post-treatment changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF); blood NAD+ levels; and additional neurocognitive, psychometric, and physical performance tests. DNA methylation was assessed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as an exploratory outcome. The target NR dose was safely achieved as evidenced by a 2.6-fold increase in blood NAD+ in the NR group (p < 0.001, 95% CI [17.77, 43.49]) with no between-group difference in adverse event reporting. MoCA and other neurocognitive and psychometric metrics remained stable throughout the study. NR reduced CBF in the default mode network (DMN) with greatest differences observed in the left inferior parietal lobe (IPL) (DMN p = 0.013, ? = 0.92, 95% CI [0.23, 1.62]; left IPL p = 0.009, ? = 1.66, 95% CI [0.5, 2.82]). Walking speed in the placebo group significantly improved across the study duration suggestive of a practice effect but did not change in the NR group (p = 0.0402 and p = 0.4698, respectively). Other secondary outcome measures remained stable. Global methylation analyses indicated a modest NR-associated increase in DNA methylation and concomitant reduction in epigenetic age as measured by PhenoAge and GrimAge epigenetic clock analyses. In summary, NR significantly increased blood NAD+ concentrations in older adults with MCI. NR was well tolerated and did not alter cognition. While CBF was reduced by NR treatment, statistical significance would not have withstood multiple comparisons correction. A larger trial of longer duration is needed to determine the potential of NR as a strategy to improve cognition and alter CBF in older adults with MCI. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02942888.© 2023.

Statistically significant single nucleotide polymorphism-based heritability for CanUD was observed in all but the smallest population (East Asian). We discovered genome-wide significant loci unique to each ancestry: 22 in European, 2 each in African and East Asian, and 1 in admixed American ancestries. A genetically informed causal relationship analysis indicated a possible effect of genetic liability for CanUD on lung cancer risk, suggesting potential unanticipated future medical and psychiatric public health consequences that require further study to disentangle from other known risk factors such as cigarette smoking.© 2023.

,38030643,Using trials of caloric restriction and bariatric surgery to explore the effects of body mass index on the circulating proteome.,Sci Rep,"Thousands of proteins circulate in the bloodstream; identifying those which associate with weight and intervention-induced weight loss may help explain mechanisms of diseases associated with adiposity. We aimed to identify consistent protein signatures of weight loss across independent studies capturing changes in body mass index (BMI). We analysed proteomic data from studies implementing caloric restriction (Diabetes Remission Clinical trial) and bariatric surgery (By-Band-Sleeve), using SomaLogic and Olink Explore1536 technologies, respectively. Linear mixed models were used to estimate the effect of the interventions on circulating proteins. Twenty-three proteins were altered in a consistent direction after both bariatric surgery and caloric restriction, suggesting that these proteins are modulated by weight change, independent of intervention type. We also integrated Mendelian randomisation (MR) estimates of the effect of BMI on proteins measured by SomaLogic from a UK blood donor cohort as a third line of causal evidence. These MR estimates provided further corroborative evidence for a role of BMI in regulating the levels of six proteins including alcohol dehydrogenase-4, nogo receptor and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist protein. These results indicate the importance of triangulation in interrogating causal relationships; further study into the role of proteins modulated by weight in disease is now warranted.© 2023.

The blood proteome is an important source for biomarker discovery but so far, few proteins have been identified with breast cancer risk. Here, we measure 2929 unique proteins in plasma from 598 women selected from the Karolinska Mammography Project to explore the association between protein levels, clinical characteristics, and gene variants, and to identify proteins with a causal role in breast cancer. We present 812 cis-acting protein quantitative trait loci for 737 proteins which are used as instruments in Mendelian randomisation analyses of breast cancer risk. Of those, we present five proteins (CD160, DNPH1, LAYN, LRRC37A2 and TLR1) that show a potential causal role in breast cancer risk with confirmatory results in independent cohorts. Our study suggests that these proteins should be further explored as biomarkers and potential drug targets in breast cancer.© 2023. The Author(s).",3.19E-11
,38036779,Improving fine-mapping by modeling infinitesimal effects.,Nat Genet,"Fine-mapping aims to identify causal genetic variants for phenotypes. Bayesian fine-mapping algorithms (for example, SuSiE, FINEMAP, ABF and COJO-ABF) are widely used, but assessing posterior probability calibration remains challenging in real data, where model misspecification probably exists, and true causal variants are unknown. We introduce replication failure rate (RFR), a metric to assess fine-mapping consistency by downsampling. SuSiE, FINEMAP and COJO-ABF show high RFR, indicating potential overconfidence in their output. Simulations reveal that nonsparse genetic architecture can lead to miscalibration, while imputation noise, nonuniform distribution of causal variants and quality control filters have minimal impact. Here we present SuSiE-inf and FINEMAP-inf, fine-mapping methods modeling infinitesimal effects alongside fewer larger causal effects. Our methods show improved calibration, RFR and functional enrichment, competitive recall and computational efficiency. Notably, using our methods' posterior effect sizes substantially increases polygenic risk score accuracy over SuSiE and FINEMAP. Our work improves causal variant identification for complex traits, a fundamental goal of human genetics.© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.",2.39E-11

Pharmacogenomics can help guide individualized drug therapy and improve outcomes.We report a case of a preterm infant with multiple complications, including bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), sepsis, intracranial hemorrhage, and hypertension. The infant was treated with various drugs, including dexamethasone and amlodipine. The infant was diagnosed with neonatal hypertension based on blood pressure measurements exceeding the 95thpercentile for his age and sex. The possible causes of hypertension included dexamethasone, hydrochlorothiazide, spironolactone, and BPD. The infant was treated with oral amlodipine to lower his blood pressure. A pharmacogenomic test was performed to evaluate the genetic polymorphisms ofABCB1andCYP3A5, which are involved in the metabolism and transport of dexamethasone and amlodipine. The infant's blood pressure was well controlled after the dose of amlodipine was reduced according to the pharmacogenomic results. The infant had a stable general condition and was discharged on the 100thd after birth.This case illustrates the importance of regular blood pressure monitoring and etiological investigation in preterm infants with hypertension. Pharmacogenomics can provide useful information for individualized drug therapy and safety in this population.©The Author(s) 2023. Published by Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

We enrolled 132 pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) patients and 30 controls. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples were collected from all participants to detect organochlorine pesticides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, metal elements, and DNA methylation of immunity-related genes. We observed that ?-HCH, Bap, Sr, Ag, and Sn were related to an increased risk of PTB, while Cu and Ba had a negative effect. IFN-?, IL-17A, IL-2, and IL-23 had a higher level in the PTB group, while IL-4 was lower. The methylation of 18 CpG sites was statistically associated with PTB risk. The methylation at the IL-4_06_121 site showed a significant mediating role on ?-HCH, Sr, and Sn.

In the past, most efforts to improve dairy cattle fertility have been focused on either management or genetics, while epigenetics have received less attention. In this study, 12 bulls were selected from a provided 100 bull list and studied (High daughter fertility?=?6, Low daughter fertility?=?6) for Enzymatic methylation sequencing in the Illumina HiSeq platform according to the Canadian daughter fertility index (DFI), sires with high and low daughter fertility have average DFI of 92 and 112.6, respectively.

However, current age estimation methods are challenging to apply to many species, and no standardised technique has been adopted yet. This study examined the potential use of methylation-sensitive high-resolution melting (MS-HRM), a labour-, time-, and cost-effective method to estimate chronological age from DNA methylation in Asian elephants (Elephas maximus). The objective of this study was to investigate the accuracy and validation of MS-HRM use for age determination in long-lived species, such as Asian elephants. The average lifespan of Asian elephants is between 50-70 years but some have been known to survive for more than 80 years. DNA was extracted from 53 blood samples of captive Asian elephants across 11 zoos in Japan, with known ages ranging from a few months to 65 years. Methylation rates of two candidate age-related epigenetic genes, RALYL and TET2, were significantly correlated with chronological age. Finally, we established a linear, unisex age estimation model with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 7.36 years. This exploratory study suggests an avenue to further explore MS-HRM as an alternative method to estimate the chronological age of Asian elephants.Copyright: © 2023 Arai et al.

,37923780,Cryopreservation effect on DNA methylation profile in rainbow trout spermatozoa.,Sci Rep,"Spermatozoa are the cells that are most commonly used for cryopreservation of valuable genetic resources in aquaculture. It is known that fish spermatozoa transmit to the embryo not only their genetic but also their epigenetic profile, especially DNA methylation. Therefore, any alteration of the DNA methylation profile in spermatozoa induces the risk of transmitting epigenetic alterations to the offspring. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of cryopreservation on DNA methylation in rainbow trout spermatozoa. To trigger variable cellular response after freezing-thawing, spermatozoa from mature males were cryopreserved with dimethyl sulfoxide, methanol or glycerol as cryoprotectant. We observed that dimethyl sulfoxide was the best to preserve thawed spermatozoa functions. Methanol only slightly preserved all the cellular parameters, while glycerol failed to protect motility and fertilization ability. The consequences on DNA methylation were assessed using Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (RRBS). Sperm cryopreservation did not thoroughly impact DNA methylation, although 335-564 differentially methylated cytosines were characterized depending on the cryoprotectant. Very few of them were shared between cryoprotectants, and no correlation with the extent of cellular damage was found. Our study showed that DNA methylation was only slightly altered after sperm cryopreservation, and this may render further analysis of the risk for the progeny very challenging.© 2023.

,37988465,Phantom oscillations in principal component analysis.,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,"Principal component analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction method that is known for being simple and easy to interpret. Principal components are often interpreted as low-dimensional patterns in high-dimensional space. However, this simple interpretation fails for timeseries, spatial maps, and other continuous data. In these cases, nonoscillatory data may have oscillatory principal components. Here, we show that two common properties of data cause oscillatory principal components: smoothness and shifts in time or space. These two properties implicate almost all neuroscience data. We show how the oscillations produced by PCA, which we call ""phantom oscillations,"" impact data analysis. We also show that traditional cross-validation does not detect phantom oscillations, so we suggest procedures that do. Our findings are supported by a collection of mathematical proofs. Collectively, our work demonstrates that patterns which emerge from high-dimensional data analysis may not faithfully represent the underlying data.",4.13E-12
,38090719,Exploring epigenetic drift and rare epivariations in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis by epigenome-wide association study.,Front Aging Neurosci,"During the last decades, our knowledge about the genetic architecture of sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (sALS) has significantly increased. However, besides the recognized genetic risk factors, also the environment is supposed to have a role in disease pathogenesis. Epigenetic modifications reflect the results of the interaction between environmental factors and genes and may play a role in the development and progression of ALS. A recent epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) in blood identified differentially methylated positions mapping to 42 genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis and immune-related pathways. Here we performed a genome-wide DNA methylation analysis in the blood of an Italian cohort of 61 sALS patients and 61 healthy controls. Initially, a conventional genome-wide association analysis was performed, and results were subsequently integrated with the findings from the previous EWAS using a meta-analytical approach. To delve deeper into the significant outcomes, over-representation analysis (ORA) was employed. Moreover, the epigenetic signature obtained from the meta-analysis was examined to determine potential associations with chemical compounds, utilizing the Toxicogenomic Database. Expanding the scope of the epigenetic analysis, we explored both epigenetic drift and rare epivariations. Notably, we observed an elevated epigenetic drift in sALS patients compared to controls, both at a global and single gene level. Interestingly, epigenetic drift at a single gene level revealed an enrichment of genes related to the neurotrophin signaling pathway. Moreover, for the first time, we identified rare epivariations exclusively enriched in sALS cases associated with 153 genes, 88 of whom with a strong expression in cerebral areas. Overall, our study reinforces the evidence that epigenetics may contribute to the pathogenesis of ALS and that epigenetic drift may be a useful diagnostic marker. Moreover, this study suggests the potential role of epivariations in ALS.Copyright © 2023 Brusati, Peverelli, Calzari, Tiloca, Casiraghi, Sorce, Invernizzi, Carbone, Cavagnola, Verde, Silani, Ticozzi, Ratti and Gentilini.",3.51E-12

We carried out a quality control study of a modified aptamer assay (SomaScan v.4.0) that measures ~ 5000 proteins, in preparation for a larger study using this platform in cohorts with kidney failure.Forty participants from the Cardiac, Endothelial Function and Arterial Stiffness in End-Stage Renal Disease (CERES study) were selected to analyze technical and short-term biological variability, orthogonal correlations and differential protein expression in plasma from patients who died during 2.5 year follow-up. Long-term (one year) variability was studied in 421 participants in the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort. We evaluated 4849 aptamers (4607 unique proteins) using data formats including raw data and data formatted using Adaptive Normalization by Maximum Likelihood (ANML), an algorithm developed for SomaScan data in individuals with normal kidney function.In ANML format, median[IQR] intra-assay coefficient of variation (CV) was 2.38%[1.76, 3.40] and inter-assay CV was 7.38%[4.61, 13.12]. Short-term within-subject CV was 5.76% [3.35, 9.72]; long-term CV was 8.71%[5.91, 13.37]. Spearman correlations between aptamer and traditional assays for PTH, NT-proBNP, FGF-23 and CRP were all > 0.7. Fold-change (FC) in protein levels among non-survivors, significant after Bonferroni correction, included SVEP1 (FC[95% CI] 2.14 [1.62, 2.82]), keratocan (1.74 [1.40, 2.15]) and LanC-like protein 1 (0.56 [0.45, 0.70]). Compared to raw aptamer data, technical and short-term biological variability in paired samples was lower in ANML-formatted data. ANML formatting had minimal impact on orthogonal correlations with traditional assays or the associations of proteins with the phenotype of mortality.SomaScan had excellent technical variability and low within-subject short-term variability. ANML formatting could facilitate comparison of biomarker results with other studies that utilize this format.

Whether conditions associated with inflammation during pregnancy increase the likelihood of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or other neurodevelopmental disorders (DDs) is not well understood.We conducted a case-control study among children born in California from 2011 to 2016 to investigate maternal immune-mediated and cardiometabolic conditions during pregnancy and risk of ASD (n = 311) and DDs (n = 1291) compared with children from the general population (n = 967). Data on maternal conditions and covariates were retrieved from electronic health records. Maternal genetic data were used to assess a causal relationship.Using multivariable logistic regression, we found that mothers with asthma were more likely to deliver infants later diagnosed with ASD (odds ratio [OR] = 1.62, 95% CI: 1.15-2.29) or DDs (OR = 1.30, 95% CI: 1.02-1.64). Maternal obesity was also associated with child ASD (OR = 1.51, 95% CI: 1.07-2.13). Mothers with both asthma and extreme obesity had the greatest odds of delivering an infant later diagnosed with ASD (OR = 16.9, 95% CI: 5.13-55.71). These increased ASD odds were observed among female children only. Polygenic risk scores for obesity, asthma, and their combination showed no association with ASD risk. Mendelian randomization did not support a causal relationship between maternal conditions and ASD.Inflammatory conditions during pregnancy are associated with risk for neurodevelopmental disorders in children. These risks do not seem to be due to shared genetic risk; rather, inflammatory conditions may share nongenetic risk factors with neurodevelopmental disorders. Children whose mothers have both asthma and obesity during pregnancy may benefit from earlier screening and intervention.© 2023 The Authors.",1.86E-12

,38069189,Decelerated Epigenetic Aging in Long Livers.,Int J Mol Sci,"Epigenetic aging is a hot topic in the field of aging research. The present study estimated epigenetic age in long-lived individuals, who are currently actively being studied worldwide as an example of successful aging due to their longevity. We used Bekaert's blood-based age prediction model to estimate the epigenetic age of 50 conditionally ""healthy"" and 45 frail long-livers over 90 years old. Frailty assessment in long-livers was conducted using the Frailty Index. The control group was composed of 32 healthy individuals aged 20-60 years. The DNA methylation status of 4 CpG sites (ASPACpG1,PDE4CCpG1,ELOVL2CpG6, andEDARADDCpG1) included in the epigenetic clock was assessed through pyrosequencing. According to the model calculations, the epigenetic age of long-livers was significantly lower than their chronological age (on average by 21 years) compared with data from the group of people aged 20 to 60 years. This suggests a slowing of epigenetic and potentially biological aging in long livers. At the same time, the obtained results showed no statistically significant differences in delta age (difference between the predicted and chronological age) between ""healthy"" long livers and long livers with frailty. We also failed to detect sex differences in epigenetic age either in the group of long livers or in the control group. It is possible that the predictive power of epigenetic clocks based on a small number of CpG sites is insufficient to detect such differences. Nevertheless, this study underscores the need for further research on the epigenetic status of centenarians to gain a deeper understanding of the factors contributing to delayed aging in this population.",1.48E-12

Considering that genetic and environmental factors interactively influence adolescent development, this study examined whether the parent-adolescent relationship mediated the link between PPC and adolescent NSSI, and whether this mediating process was moderated by the oxytocin receptor gene rs53576 polymorphism (OXTR rs53576). Participants comprised 673 adolescents (Meanage= 12.81 years, SD = ?0.48 years) who completed questionnaires regarding PPC, the parent-adolescent relationship, and NSSI. DNA was extracted from each participant's saliva samples. The results indicated that the positive association between PPC and adolescent NSSI was mediated by the parent-adolescent relationship. Moreover, this indirect link was stronger for adolescents with AA homozygotes of OXTR rs53576 than for those with the GG or AG genotype. These findings extend our understanding of the association between PPC and adolescent NSSI and suggest that a simultaneous focus on PPC, the parent-adolescent relationship, and OXTR rs53576 may favor NSSI interventions.© 2023.

,38062254,Longitudinal machine learning uncouples healthy aging factors from chronic disease risks.,Nat Aging,"To understand human longevity, inherent aging processes must be distinguished from known etiologies leading to age-related chronic diseases. Such deconvolution is difficult to achieve because it requires tracking patients throughout their entire lives. Here, we used machine learning to infer health trajectories over the entire adulthood age range using extrapolation from electronic medical records with partial longitudinal coverage. Using this approach, our model tracked the state of patients who were healthy and free from known chronic disease risk and distinguished individuals with higher or lower longevity potential using a multivariate score. We showed that the model and the markers it uses performed consistently on data from Israeli, British and US populations. For example, mildly low neutrophil counts and alkaline phosphatase levels serve as early indicators of healthy aging that are independent of risk for major chronic diseases. We characterize the heritability and genetic associations of our longevity score and demonstrate at least 1 year of extended lifespan for parents of high-scoring patients compared to matched controls. Longitudinal modeling of healthy individuals is thereby established as a tool for understanding healthy aging and longevity.© 2023.

There are numerous biological systems involved in the absorption, metabolism, and excretion of Hg, and it is possible that some systems may be impacted by genetic variation. If so, genotype may affect tissue concentrations of Hg and subsequent toxic effects. Genome-wide association testing was performed on blood Hg samples from pregnant women of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (n= 2893) and children of the Human Early Life Exposome (n= 1042). Directly-genotyped single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were imputed to the Haplotype Reference Consortium r1.1 panel of whole genotypes and modelled againstlog-transformed Hg. Heritability was estimated using linkage disequilibrium score regression. The heritability of Hg was estimated as 24.0% (95% CI: 16.9% to 46.4%) in pregnant women, but could not be determined in children. There were 16 SNPs associated with Hg in pregnant women above a suggestivep-value threshold (p< 1 × 10-5), and 21 for children. However, no SNP passed this threshold in both studies, and none were genome-wide significant (p< 5 × 10-8). SNP-Hg associations were highly discordant between women and children, and this may reflect differences in metabolism, a gene-age interaction, or dose-response effects. Several suggestive variants had plausible links to Hg metabolism, such as rs146099921 in metal transporter SLC39A14, and two variants (rs28618224, rs7154700) in potassium voltage-gated channel genes.

AdmixPipe v3 ameliorates many of these issues in a single bioinformatic pipeline that facilitates all facets of population structure analysis by integrating outputs generated by several popular packages (i.e. CLUMPAK, EvalAdmix). The pipeline interfaces disparate software packages to parse Admixture outputs and conduct EvalAdmix analyses in the context of multimodal population structure results identified by CLUMPAK. We further streamline these tasks by packaging AdmixPipe v3 within a Docker container to create a standardized analytical environment that allows for complex analyses to be replicated by different researchers. This also grants operating system flexibility and mitigates complex software dependencies.Source code, documentation, example files, and usage examples are freely available at https://github.com/stevemussmann/admixturePipeline. Installation is facilitated via Docker container available from https://hub.docker.com/r/mussmann/admixpipe.

We measured 1,463 proteins in the stored baseline samples using the OLINK EXPLORE panel. Cox regression yielded adjusted HRs for IHD associated with individual proteins after accounting for multiple testing. Moreover, cis-protein quantitative loci (pQTLs) identified for proteins in genome-wide association studies of CKB and of UK Biobank were used as instrumental variables in separate 2-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) studies involving global CARDIOGRAM+C4D consortium (210,842 IHD cases and 1,378,170 controls).Overall 361 proteins were significantly associated at false discovery rate <0.05 with risk of IHD (349 positively, 12 inversely) in CKB, including N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9. Of these 361 proteins, 212 had cis-pQTLs in CKB, and MR analyses of 198 variants in CARDIOGRAM+C4D identified 13 proteins that showed potentially causal associations with IHD. Independent MR analyses of 307 cis-pQTLs identified in Europeans replicated associations for 4 proteins (FURIN, proteinase-activated receptor-1, Asialoglycoprotein receptor-1, and matrix metalloproteinase-3). Further downstream analyses showed that FURIN, which is highly expressed in endothelial cells, is a potential novel target and matrix metalloproteinase-3 a potential repurposing target for IHD.Integrated analyses of proteomic and genetic data in Chinese and European adults provided causal support for FURIN and multiple other proteins as potential novel drug targets for treatment of IHD.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

,38073978,Prevalence and Risk Factors of Speech Delay in Children Less Than Seven Years Old in Saudi Arabia.,Cureus,"Introduction Verbal communication relies on the ability to speak and understand language. Speech is only one part of language; language can also be expressed through gestures, writing, and other nonverbal means. Speech and language disorders are impairments in the ability to produce and comprehend language, including problems with mouth movements and vocalization. There is a scarcity of literature on this topic in Saudi Arabia; therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the prevalence and risk factors of speech delay in children aged less than seven years in Saudi Arabia. Methods A cross-sectional self-reported descriptive study was conducted from May 2023 to June 2023 among parents of children less than seven years of age in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Simple convenience sampling was implemented. A structured, self-administered questionnaire was designed and presented to the parents of children less than seven years of age. Categorical data were presented as frequencies and percentages. The analysis included a chi-squared test and a Fisher's exact test. Results A total of 617 participants were included in the study. The majority of children were between 1 and 3 years of age (223, 36.1%) and were male (336, 54.5%). Around 45.5% of the respondents reported that their children may have a speech delay. Children aged >3 to 5 years had a significantly higher prevalence of speech delay (112, 53.1%). Additionally, there was a significant difference in speech delay prevalence between male (170, 50.6%) and female (111, 39.5%, p = 0.006) children. A family history of a developmental communication disorder was significantly associated with speech delay (p < 0.001). Children with speech delay were more likely to have hearing issues (19, 70.4%) and motor issues (19, 70.4%). Moreover, autism spectrum disorder in the child was significantly associated with speech delay (p < 0.001). Conclusions The study found that children aged 3 to 5 years had a significantly higher prevalence of speech delay than younger children. There was a significant difference in speech delay prevalence between male and female children. Children with speech delays were more likely to suffer hearing and motor issues. Speech delay was significantly associated with a family history of a developmental communication problem.Copyright © 2023, Alzahrani et al.",3.51E-13

The Interferon Regulatory Factor (IRF)-5 is a key transcription factor in the pro-inflammatory polarization of M1-like macrophages. GWAS have reported that the IRF5 locus is associated with autoimmune diseases and with the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). We study whether allelic variations in IRF5 are associated with the incidence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in a general population. We genotyped eleven IRF5 SNPs in the French D.E.S.I.R. cohort from the general population (n?=?4820). Associations of SNPs with baseline renal parameters were assessed. Data were analyzed for three endpoints during a 9-year follow-up, incidence of:at least stage 3 CKD, the KDIGO criterion ""certain drop in eGFR"", and incidence of micro/macro albuminuria. In the cross-sectional analysis, rs10954213 and rs10954214 were associated with eGFR and rs1874328 with urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR). Rs3807306, rs11761199, rs78658945, rs1874328, rs10954213 and rs11770589 were associated with the incidence of stage 3 CKD in multi-adjusted models. Rs4731532, rs3807306, and rs11761199 were associated with the incidence of CKD defined by the KDIGO. Rs4731532, rs3807306, rs11761199 and rs79288514 were associated with the incidence of micro/macro albuminuria.

This study aimed to comprehensively evaluate the associations between maternal chronic disease and CAKUT in their offspring.Data of mothers and children were extracted from the Taiwan Maternal and Child Health Database and National Health Insurance Research Database. The concept of developmental origins of health and disease (DOHaD) was used to select maternal chronic diseases.The study cohort included 1 196 175 mothers and 1 628 706 offspring. Analysis showed that maternal chronic diseases, especially type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, gestational diabetes, connective tissue disorders and CAKUT were highly associated with CAKUT in the offspring. Higher maternal age, abnormal birthweight (>3500 g or <2500 g), gestational age <36 weeks and birth order <2 were all associated with a higher risk of CAKUT. Maternal chronic hypertension and taking angiotensin-related drugs increased the odds ratios of obstructive kidney disease in the offspring. Offspring tended to have the same type of CAKUT as their mothers.Maternal chronic diseases, older maternal age and abnormal birthweight are risk factors for CAKUT. Also, a percentage of patients with CAKUT were not full-term newborns. Results support prenatal counselling and health management of pregnant women with chronic diseases and extra care for infants with a high risk of anomalies. It is strongly recommended that prevention of CAKUT in offspring should start with care of the mothers' prenatal chronic diseases.© The Author(s) 2023.

The epigenetic mechanisms of adaptation to such ecologies and environments and, in particular, epigenetic age acceleration in the local population have not been studied before.This work reports the first epigenetic study of the Yakutian population using whole-blood DNA methylation data, supplemented with the comparison to the residents of Central Russia. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed, among others, geographic region-specific differentially methylated regions associated with adaptation to climatic conditions (water consumption, digestive system regulation), aging processes (actin filament activity, cell fate), and both of them (channel activity, regulation of steroid and corticosteroid hormone secretion). Further, it is demonstrated that the epigenetic age acceleration of the Yakutian representatives is significantly higher than that of Central Russia counterparts. For both geographic regions, we showed that epigenetically males age faster than females, whereas no significant sex differences were found between the regions.We performed the first study of the epigenetic data of the Yakutia cohort, paying special attention to region-specific features, aging processes, age acceleration, and sex specificity.© 2023.

,38001305,Evaluating 17 methods incorporating biological function with GWAS summary statistics to accelerate discovery demonstrates a tradeoff between high sensitivity and high positive predictive value.,Commun Biol,"Where sufficiently large genome-wide association study (GWAS) samples are not currently available or feasible, methods that leverage increasing knowledge of the biological function of variants may illuminate discoveries without increasing sample size. We comprehensively evaluated 17 functional weighting methods for identifying novel associations. We assessed the performance of these methods using published results from multiple GWAS waves across each of five complex traits. Although no method achieved both high sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) for any trait, a subset of methods utilizing pleiotropy and expression quantitative trait loci nominated variants with high PPV (>75%) for multiple traits. Application of functionally weighting methods to enhance GWAS power for locus discovery is unlikely to circumvent the need for larger sample sizes in truly underpowered GWAS, but these results suggest that applying functional weighting to GWAS can accurately nominate additional novel loci from available samples for follow-up studies.© 2023.

The Senior Fitness Test was used to assess functional fitness. Body weight and height were measured. Moreover, data on age, education, taking up physical activity and place of residence were collected.A significantly lower level of functional fitness of SWH residents was demonstrated compared to men living in the society (p?<?0.001). A significant percentage of seniors living in SWH did not reach the normal range for the Polish population. Also, the level of education, physical activity and health self-assessment differentiated the institutionalized men from those living in the community.The place of residence is a factor that differentiates seniors' functional fitness levels. The reduced fitness of social welfare home residents may also result from the low level of their daily physical activity, education and health.

Temporal variation in brain MRI data has often been attributed to circadian or diurnal oscillations; however, it is not clear if such oscillations exist. Here, we provide evidence that diurnal oscillations indeed govern multiple MRI metrics. We recorded cerebral blood flow, diffusion-tensor metrics, T1 relaxation, and cortical structural features every three hours over a 24-hr period in each of 16 adult male controls and eight adult male participants with bipolar disorder. Diurnal oscillations are detected in numerous MRI metrics at the whole-brain level, and regionally. Rhythmicity parameters in the participants with bipolar disorder are similar to the controls for most metrics, except for a larger phase variation in cerebral blood flow. The ubiquitous nature of diurnal oscillations has broad implications for neuroimaging studies and furthers our understanding of the dynamic nature of the human brain.© 2023. Crown.",6.89E-14
,38004209,New Insights into Polygenic Score-Lifestyle Interactions for Cardiometabolic Risk Factors from Genome-Wide Interaction Analyses.,Nutrients,"The relationship between lifestyles and cardiometabolic outcomes varies between individuals. In 382,275 UK Biobank Europeans, we investigate how lifestyles interact with polygenic scores (PGS) of cardiometabolic risk factors. We identify six interactions (PGS for body mass index with meat diet, physical activity, sedentary behaviour and insomnia; PGS for high-density lipoprotein cholesterol with sedentary behaviour; PGS for triglycerides with meat diet) in multivariable linear regression models including an interaction term and show stronger associations between lifestyles and cardiometabolic risk factors among individuals with high PGSs than those with low PGSs. Genome-wide interaction analyses pinpoint three genetic variants (FTOrs72805613 for BMI;CETPrs56228609 for high-density lipoprotein cholesterol;TRIB2rs4336630 for triglycerides;PInteraction< 5 × 10-8). The associations between lifestyles and cardiometabolic risk factors differ between individuals grouped by the genotype of these variants, with the degree of differences being similar to that between individuals with high and low values for the corresponding PGSs. This study demonstrates that associations between lifestyles and cardiometabolic risk factors can differ between individuals based upon their genetic profiles. It further suggests that genetic variants with interaction effects contribute more to such differences compared to those without interaction effects, which has potential implications for developing PGSs for personalised intervention.",6.87E-14

This paper aims to investigate the association between PM2.5exposure and cancer risks.This work was performed on data from 409,876 All of Us Research Program participants using the All of Us Researcher Workbench. Cancer case ascertainment was performed using data from electronic health records and the self-reported Personal Medical History questionnaire. PM2.5exposure was retrieved from NASA's Earth Observing System Data and Information Center and assigned using participants' 3-digit zip code prefixes. Multivariate logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Generalized additive models (GAMs) were used to investigate non-linear relationships.A total of 33,387 participants and 46,176 prevalent cancer cases were ascertained from participant EHR data, while 20,297 cases were ascertained from self-reported survey data from 18,133 participants; 9,502 cancer cases were captured in both the EHR and survey data.

We compared expression of?>?60,000 genes in whole blood specimens taken from LC cases at diagnosis (n?=?128) and controls (n?=?62) using genome-wide RNA sequencing, and identified 14 candidate genes associated with LC. High expression of ANXA3, ARG1 and HP was strongly associated with lower survival in late-stage LC cases (hazard ratios (HRs)?=?2.81, 2.16 and 2.54, respectively). We validated these markers in two independent population-based studies with pre-diagnostic whole blood specimens taken up to eight years prior to LC diagnosis (n?=?163 cases, 184 matched controls). ANXA3 and ARG1 expression was strongly associated with LC in these specimens, especially with late-stage LC within two years of diagnosis (odds ratios (ORs)?=?3.47 and 5.00, respectively). Additionally, blood CD4 T cells, NK cells and neutrophils were associated with LC at diagnosis and improved LC discriminative ability beyond candidate genes.

However, a causal relationship between the two factors remains unclear. Therefore, we investigated the causal relationship between household income status and genetic liability of mental disorders using a bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) study.This MR study included a large cohort of the European population from publicly available genome-wide association study datasets. A random-effects inverse-variance weighting model was used as the main standard, with MR-Egger regression, weighted median, and maximum likelihood estimations performed concurrently as supplements. Sensitivity analysis, consisting of heterogeneity and horizontal pleiotropy tests, was performed using Cochran's Q test, MR-Egger intercept, and MR-PRESSO tests to ensure the reliability of the conclusions.A higher household income tended to be associated with a lower risk of genetic liability for depression (odds ratio [OR]: 0.655, 95% confidence interval [CI]?=?0.522-0.822,p?<?0.001) and anxiety disorder (OR: 0.666, 95% CI?=?0.526-0.843,p?<?0.001).

The lack of longitudinal cohort studies hinders the early prediction and intervention of sFGR.We constructed a prospective longitudinal cohort study of sFGR, and quantified 25 key metabolites in 337 samples from maternal plasma in the first, second, and third trimester and from cord plasma. In particular, our study examined fetal growth and brain injury data from ultrasonography and used the Ages and Stages Questionnaire-third edition subscale (ASQ-3) to evaluate the long-term neurocognitive behavioral development of infants aged 2-3 years. Furthermore, we correlated metabolite levels with ultrasound data, including physical development and brain injury indicators, and ASQ-3 data using Spearman's-based correlation tests. In addition, special combinations of differential metabolites were used to construct predictive models for the occurrence of sFGR and fetal brain injury.Our findings revealed various dynamic patterns for these metabolites during pregnancy and a maximum of differential metabolites between sFGR and MCDA in the second trimester (n?=?8). The combination of L-phenylalanine, L-leucine, and L-isoleucine in the second trimester, which were closely related to fetal growth indicators, was highly predictive of sFGR occurrence (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.878). The combination of L-serine, L-histidine, and L-arginine in the first trimester and creatinine in the second trimester was correlated with long-term neurocognitive behavioral development and showed the capacity to identify fetal brain injury with high accuracy (AUC: 0.94).The performance of maternal plasma metabolites from the first and second trimester is superior to those from the third trimester and cord plasma in discerning sFGR and fetal brain injury. These metabolites may serve as useful biomarkers for early prediction and promising targets for early intervention in clinical settings.© 2023. The Author(s).",1.76E-14

However, this AD-specific epigenetic information remains brain-locked and unreachable during patients' lifetimes. In a previous methylome performed in the hippocampus of 26 AD patients and 12 controls, we found higher methylation levels in AD patients in the promoter region ofPRLHR, a gene involved in energy balance regulation. Our aim was to further characterizePRLHR's role in AD and to evaluate if the liquid biopsy technique would provide life access to this brain information in a non-invasive way. First, we extended the methylation mapping ofPRLHRand validated previous methylome results via bisulfite cloning sequencing. Next, we observed a positive correlation betweenPRLHRmethylation levels and AD-related neuropathological changes and a decreased expression ofPRLHRin AD hippocampus. Then, we managed to replicate the hippocampal methylation differences in plasma cfDNA from an additional cohort of 35 AD patients and 35 controls. The isolation of cfDNA from the plasma of AD patients may constitute a source of potential epigenetic biomarkers to aid AD clinical management.",1.43E-14

Risk variants at the MHC and other loci genome-wide had heterogeneity in effects on T1D dependent on DR3/DR4, and non-DR3/DR4 T1D had evidence for a greater polygenic burden. T1D-assocated variants in non-DR3/DR4 were more enriched for loci, regulatory elements, and pathways for antigen presentation, innate immunity, and beta cells, and depleted in T cells, compared to DR3/DR4. Non-DR3/DR4 T1D cases were poorly classified based on an existing genetic risk score GRS2, and we created a new GRS which highly discriminated non-DR3/DR4 T1D from both non-diabetes and T2D. In total we identified heterogeneity in T1D genetic risk and disease mechanisms dependent on high-risk HLA haplotype and which enabled accurate classification of T1D across HLA background.",1.4E-14
,37949886,Leveraging information between multiple population groups and traits improves fine-mapping resolution.,Nat Commun,"Statistical fine-mapping helps to pinpoint likely causal variants underlying genetic association signals. Its resolution can be improved by (i) leveraging information between traits; and (ii) exploiting differences in linkage disequilibrium structure between diverse population groups. Using association summary statistics, MGflashfm jointly fine-maps signals from multiple traits and population groups; MGfm uses an analogous framework to analyse each trait separately. We also provide a practical approach to fine-mapping with out-of-sample reference panels. In simulation studies we show that MGflashfm and MGfm are well-calibrated and that the mean proportion of causal variants with PP?>?0.80 is above 0.75 (MGflashfm) and 0.70 (MGfm). In our analysis of four lipids traits across five population groups, MGflashfm gives a median 99% credible set reduction of 10.5% over MGfm. MGflashfm and MGfm only require summary level data, making them very useful fine-mapping tools in consortia efforts where individual-level data cannot be shared.© 2023. The Author(s).",7.5E-15
,38049885,Haplotype-resolved assemblies and variant benchmark of a Chinese Quartet.,Genome Biol,"Recent state-of-the-art sequencing technologies enable the investigation of challenging regions in the human genome and expand the scope of variant benchmarking datasets. Herein, we sequence a Chinese Quartet, comprising two monozygotic twin daughters and their biological parents, using four short and long sequencing platforms (Illumina, BGI, PacBio, and Oxford Nanopore Technology).The long reads from the monozygotic twin daughters are phased into paternal and maternal haplotypes using the parent-child genetic map and for each haplotype. We also use long reads to generate haplotype-resolved whole-genome assemblies with completeness and continuity exceeding that of GRCh38. Using this Quartet, we comprehensively catalogue the human variant landscape, generating a dataset of 3,962,453 SNVs, 886,648 indels (<?50 bp), 9726 large deletions (??50 bp), 15,600 large insertions (??50 bp), 40 inversions, 31 complex structural variants, and 68 de novo mutations which are shared between the monozygotic twin daughters. Variants underrepresented in previous benchmarks owing to their complexity-including those located at long repeat regions, complex structural variants, and de novo mutations-are systematically examined in this study.In summary, this study provides high-quality haplotype-resolved assemblies and a comprehensive set of benchmarking resources for two Chinese monozygotic twin samples which, relative to existing benchmarks, offers expanded genomic coverage and insight into complex variant categories.© 2023.

,38008881,A scoping review of multigenerational impacts of grandparental exposures on mental health in grandchildren.,Curr Environ Health Rep,"The multigenerational effects of grandparental exposures on their grandchildren's mental health and neurodevelopment are gaining research attention. We conducted a scoping review to summarize the current epidemiological studies investigating pregnancy-related and environmental factors that affected grandparental pregnancies and mental health outcomes in their grandchildren. We also identified methodological challenges that affect these multigenerational health studies and discuss opportunities for future research.We performed a literature search using PubMed and Embase and included 18 articles for this review. The most investigated grandparental pregnancy-related factors were the grandparental age of pregnancy (N = 6), smoking during pregnancy (N = 4), and medication intake (N = 3). The most frequently examined grandchild outcomes were autism spectrum disorder (N = 6) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (N = 4). Among these studies, grandparental smoking and the use of diethylstilbestrol were more consistently reported to be associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, while the findings for grandparental age vary across the maternal or paternal line. Grandmaternal weight, adverse delivery outcomes, and other spatial-temporal markers of physical and social environmental stressors require further scrutiny. The current body of literature has suggested that mental and neurodevelopmental disorders may be outcomes of unfavorable exposures originating from the grandparental generation during their pregnancies. To advance the field, we recommend research efforts into setting up multigenerational studies with prospectively collected data that span through at least three generations, incorporating spatial, environmental, and biological markers for exposure assessment, expanding the outcome phenotypes evaluated, and developing a causal analytical framework including mediation analyses specific for multigenerational research.© 2023.

,37986722,Enhancing Phenotype Recognition in Clinical Notes Using Large Language Models: PhenoBCBERT and PhenoGPT.,ArXiv,"To enhance phenotype recognition in clinical notes of genetic diseases, we developed two models - PhenoBCBERT and PhenoGPT - for expanding the vocabularies of Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms. While HPO offers a standardized vocabulary for phenotypes, existing tools often fail to capture the full scope of phenotypes, due to limitations from traditional heuristic or rule-based approaches. Our models leverage large language models (LLMs) to automate the detection of phenotype terms, including those not in the current HPO. We compared these models to PhenoTagger, another HPO recognition tool, and found that our models identify a wider range of phenotype concepts, including previously uncharacterized ones. Our models also showed strong performance in case studies on biomedical literature. We evaluated the strengths and weaknesses of BERT-based and GPT-based models in aspects such as architecture and accuracy. Overall, our models enhance automated phenotype detection from clinical texts, improving downstream analyses on human diseases.",4.87E-15

We attempted to examine whether arsenic metabolism in different trimesters was related to cord blood mtDNAcn alteration. We included 819 mother-newborn pairs embedded in an in-progress birth cohort survey performed from April 2014 to October 2016 in Wuhan, China. We determined maternal urinary arsenic species concentrations in different trimesters using HPLC-ICPMS. We decided on cord blood mtDNAcn using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. In covariate-adjusted models, each two-fold increment of dimethylated arsenic (DMA) and total arsenic (TAs) in the 3rd trimester were related to 8.43% (95% CI: 1.13%, 16.26%) and 12.15% (95% CI:4.35%, 20.53%) increases in mtDNAcn, respectively. The dose-response trend with statistical significance was observed across tertiles of DMA and TAs in the 3rd trimester with mtDNAcn.

We examined the association between neonatal circulating C3 and C4 protein concentrations in 68,768 neonates and the risk of six mental disorders. We completed genome-wide association studies (GWASs) for C3 and C4 and applied the summary statistics in Mendelian randomization and phenome-wide association studies related to mental and autoimmune disorders. The GWASs for C3 and C4 protein concentrations identified 15 and 36 independent loci, respectively. We found no associations between neonatal C3 and C4 concentrations and mental disorders in the total sample (both sexes combined); however, post-hoc analyses found that a higher C3 concentration was associated with a reduced risk of schizophrenia in females. Mendelian randomization based on C4 summary statistics found an altered risk of five types of autoimmune disorders.

In our study, we consider 13,245 samples profiled on this array encompassing 348 species and 59 tissues from 746 species-tissue combinations. While having some coverage of many different species and tissue types, this data captures only 3.6% of potential species-tissue combinations. To address this gap, we developed CMImpute (Cross-species Methylation Imputation), a method based on a Conditional Variational Autoencoder, to impute DNA methylation for non-profiled species-tissue combinations. In cross-validation, we demonstrate that CMImpute achieves a strong correlation with actual observed values, surpassing several baseline methods. Using CMImpute we imputed methylation data for 19,786 new species-tissue combinations. We believe that both CMImpute and our imputed data resource will be useful for DNA methylation analyses across a wide range of mammalian species.",3.62E-15

We aimed to investigate the genetic associations and underlying mechanisms between RA and CVD by leveraging large-scale genomic data and genetic cross-trait analytic approaches. Methods and Results Within UK Biobank data, we examined the genetic correlation, shared genetics, and potential causality between RA (Ncases=6754, Ncontrols=452?384) and cardiovascular diseases (CVD, Ncases=44?238, Ncontrols=414?900) using linkage disequilibrium score regression, cross-trait meta-analysis, and Mendelian randomization. We observed significant genetic correlations of RA with myocardial infarction (rg:0.40 [95% CI, 0.24-0.56), angina (rg:0.42 [95% CI, 0.28-0.56]), coronary heart diseases (rg:0.41 [95% CI, 0.27-0.55]), and CVD (rg:0.43 [95% CI, 0.29-0.57]) after correcting for multiple testing (P<0.05/5). When stratified by frequent use of analgesics, we found increased genetic correlation between RA and CVD among participants without aspirin usage (rg:0.54 [95% CI, 0.30-0.78] for angina;Pvalue=6.69×10-6) and among participants with paracetamol usage (rg:0.75 [95% CI, 0.20-1.29] for myocardial infarction;Pvalue=8.90×10-3), whereas others remained similar. Cross-trait meta-analysis identified 9 independent shared loci between RA and CVD, includingPTPN22atchr1p13.2,BCL2L11atchr2q13, andCCR3atchr3p21.31(Psingle trait<1×10-3andPmeta<5×10-8), highlighting potential shared pathogenesis including accelerating atherosclerosis, upregulating oxidative stress, and vascular permeability. Finally, Mendelian randomization estimates showed limited evidence of causality between RA and CVD. Conclusions Our results supported shared genetic pathogenesis rather than causality in explaining the observed association between RA and CVD. The identified shared genetic factors provided insights into potential novel therapeutic target for RA-CVD comorbidities.",3.35E-15

Plasma proteins with causal evidence may represent promising drug targets. We aimed to identify plasma proteins in the causal pathway of MASLD and explore their interaction with obesity.We analysed 2,941 plasma proteins in 43,978 European participants from UK Biobank. We performed genome-wide association study (GWAS) for all MASLD-associated proteins and created the largest MASLD GWAS (109,885 cases/1,014,923 controls). We performed Mendelian Randomization (MR) and integrated proteins and their encoding genes in MASLD ranges to identify candidate causal proteins. We then validated them through independent replication, exome sequencing, liver imaging, bulk and single-cell gene expression, liver biopsies, pathway, and phenome-wide data. We explored the role of obesity by MR and multivariable MR across proteins, body mass index, and MASLD.We found 929 proteins associated with MASLD, reported five novel genetic loci associated with MASLD, and identified 17 candidate MASLD protein targets. We identified four novel targets for MASLD (CD33, GRHPR, HMOX2, and SCG3), provided protein evidence supporting roles of AHCY, FCGR2B, ORM1, and RBKS in MASLD, and validated nine previously known targets. We found that CD33, FCGR2B, ORM1, RBKS, and SCG3 mediated the association of obesity and MASLD, and HMOX2, ORM1, and RBKS had effect on MASLD independent of obesity.This study identified new protein targets in the causal pathway of MASLD, providing new insights into the multi-omics architecture and pathophysiology of MASLD.

Vitamin and mineral cofactors related to methylation and indolamine-catecholamine metabolism were investigated. Biomarker status for 67 symptomatically well-defined cases and 67 asymptomatic control participants was determined using receiver operating characteristics, Spearman's correlation, and logistic regression. The 5.2%-prevalentMTHFR677 TT genotype demonstrated a 100% sensitive and specific case-predictive biomarkers of increased riboflavin (vitamin B2) excretion. This was accompanied by low plasma zinc and indicators of a shift from low methylation to high methylation state. The 48.5% prevalentMTHFR677 CC genotype model demonstrated a low-methylation phenotype with 93% sensitivity and 92% specificity and a negative predictive value of 100%.

,38116123,Single-cell methylation analysis of brain tissue prioritizes mutations that alter transcription.,Cell Genom,"Relating genetic variants to behavior remains a fundamental challenge. To assess the utility of DNA methylation marks in discovering causative variants, we examined their relationship to genetic variation by generating single-nucleus methylomes from the hippocampus of eight inbred mouse strains. At CpG sequence densities under 40 CpG/Kb, cells compensate for loss of methylated sites by methylating additional sites to maintain methylation levels. At higher CpG sequence densities, the exact location of a methylated site becomes more important, suggesting that variants affecting methylation will have a greater effect when occurring in higher CpG densities than in lower. We found this to be true for a variant's effect on transcript abundance, indicating that candidate variants can be prioritized based on CpG sequence density. Our findings imply that DNA methylation influences the likelihood that mutations occur at specific sites in the genome, supporting the view that the distribution of mutations is not random.© 2023 The Author(s).",2.57E-15

,38064565,Evidence for the role of selection for reproductively advantageous alleles in human aging.,Sci Adv,"The antagonistic pleiotropy hypothesis posits that natural selection for pleiotropic mutations that confer earlier or more reproduction but impair the post-reproductive life causes aging. This hypothesis of the evolutionary origin of aging is supported by case studies but lacks unambiguous genomic evidence. Here, we genomically test this hypothesis using the genotypes, reproductive phenotypes, and death registry of 276,406 U.K. Biobank participants. We observe a strong, negative genetic correlation between reproductive traits and life span. Individuals with higher polygenetic scores for reproduction (PGSR) have lower survivorships to age 76 (SV76), andPGSRincreased over birth cohorts from 1940 to 1969. Similar trends are seen from individual genetic variants examined. The antagonistically pleiotropic variants are often associated with cis-regulatory effects across multiple tissues or on multiple target genes. These and other findings support the antagonistic pleiotropy hypothesis of aging in humans and point to potential molecular mechanisms of the reproduction-life-span antagonistic pleiotropy.",2.47E-15

DNA methylation assay was done using quantitative methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (qMSP). Genotyping was done using Sanger sequencing.DNA methylation levels of ADCY2, MAP2K1 and AKT1 were significantly different among AD, MCI and controls. In the comparisons of each two groups, AKT1 and MAP2K1's methylation was both significantly different between AD and MCI (p < 0.05), whereas MAP2K1's methylation was also significantly different between MCI and controls. Therefore, AKT1's methylation was considered as the candidate serum marker to distinguish AD from MCI, and its association with AD was independent of APOE ?4 allele (p < 0.05). AKT1 hypermethylation was an independent risk factor for AD and MAP2K1 hypomethylation was an independent risk factor for MCI in logistic regression analysis (p < 0.05).This study found that the serum of AKT1 hypermethylation is related to AD independently of APOE ?4, which was differentially expressed in the Entorhinal Cortex of the brain and was an independent risk factor for AD. It could be used as one of the candidate serum markers to distinguish AD and MCI. Serum of MAP2K1 hypomethylation is an independent risk factor for MCI.Copyright: © 2023 Zou et al.

Genomic data were then subjected to biostatistical analysis, followed by the application of the elastic net feature selection method. This technique identified a restricted number of genomic biomarkers associated with BC metastasis. A light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM), categorical boosting (CatBoost), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Gradient Boosting Trees (GBT), and Ada boosting (AdaBoost) algorithms were utilized for prediction. To assess the models' predictive abilities, the accuracy, F1 score, precision, recall, area under the ROC curve (AUC), and Brier score were calculated as performance evaluation metrics. To promote interpretability and overcome the ""black box"" problem of ML models, a SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method was employed.The LightGBM model outperformed other models, yielding remarkable accuracy of 96% and an AUC of 99.3%.

Second, it autonomously estimates and leverages chromosome-wise cross-population genetic correlations to infer the effect sizes of genetic variants. Lastly, it provides an auto version that has comparable performance to the tuning version to accommodate the situation with no validation dataset. Through extensive simulations and real data applications to 22 quantitative traits and four binary traits in East Asian populations, nine quantitative traits and one binary trait in African populations, and four quantitative traits in South Asian populations, we demonstrate that JointPRS outperforms state-of-art methods, improving the prediction accuracy for both quantitative and binary traits in non-European populations.",1.81E-15
,38025047,GCparagon: evaluating and correcting GC biases in cell-free DNA at the fragment level.,NAR Genom Bioinform,"Analyses of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) are increasingly being employed for various diagnostic and research applications. Many technologies aim to increase resolution, e.g. for detecting early-stage cancer or minimal residual disease. However, these efforts may be confounded by inherent base composition biases of cfDNA, specifically the over - and underrepresentation of guanine (G) and cytosine (C) sequences. Currently, there is no universally applicable tool to correct these effects on sequencing read-level data. Here, we present GCparagon, a two-stage algorithm for computing and correcting GC biases in cfDNA samples. In the initial step, length and GC base count parameters are determined. Here, our algorithm minimizes the inclusion of known problematic genomic regions, such as low-mappability regions, in its calculations. In the second step, GCparagon computes weights counterbalancing the distortion of cfDNA attributes (correction matrix). These fragment weights are added to a binary alignment map (BAM) file as alignment tags for individual reads. The GC correction matrix or the tagged BAM file can be used for downstream analyses. Parallel computing allows for a GC bias estimation below 1 min. We demonstrate that GCparagon vastly improves the analysis of regulatory regions, which frequently show specific GC composition patterns and will contribute to standardized cfDNA applications.© The Author(s) 2023.

Here, we demonstrate that with Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing we can achieve delivery of genomic and fragmentomic data from liquid biopsies. Copy number aberrations and cfDNA fragmentation patterns can be determined in less than 24?h from sample collection. The tumor-derived cfDNA fraction calculated from plasma of lung cancer patients and urine of bladder cancer patients was highly correlated (R?=?0.98) with the tumor fraction calculated from short-read sequencing of the same samples. cfDNA size profile, fragmentation patterns, fragment-end composition, and nucleosome profiling near transcription start sites in plasma and urine exhibited the typical cfDNA features. Additionally, a high proportion of long tumor-derived cfDNA fragments (>?300?bp) are recovered in plasma and urine using ONT sequencing.

However, it remains unclear whether this approach can be applied to cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and whether it can address the issue of low tumor purity encountered in tissue-based methylation profiling. In this study, we developed an assay named iMethyl, designed to estimate the genomic hypomethylation status from cfDNA. This was achieved through deep targeted sequencing of young LINE-1 elements with?>?400,000 reads per sample. iMethyl was applied to a total of 653 ICB samples encompassing lung cancer (cfDNA n?=?167; tissue n?=?137; cfDNA early during treatment n?=?40), breast cancer (cfDNA n?=?91; tissue n?=?50; PBMC n?=?50; cfDNA at progression n?=?44), and ovarian cancer (tissue n?=?74). iMethyl-liquid predicted ICB responses accurately regardless of the tumor purity of tissue samples. iMethyl-liquid was also able to monitor therapeutic responses early during treatment (3 or 6 weeks after initiation of ICB) and detect progressive hypomethylation accompanying tumor progression. iMethyl-tissue had better predictive power than tumor mutation burden and PD-L1 expression.

Systematic reviews of the literature were conducted to assess evidence on priority adverse health effects of excess intake of folate (including folic acid and the other authorised forms, (6S)-5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid glucosamine and l-5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid calcium salts), namely risk of cobalamin-dependent neuropathy, cognitive decline among people with low cobalamin status, and colorectal cancer and prostate cancer. The evidence is insufficient to conclude on a positive and causal relationship between the dietary intake of folate and impaired cognitive function, risk of colorectal and prostate cancer. The risk of progression of neurological symptoms in cobalamin-deficient patients is considered as the critical effect to establish an UL for folic acid. No new evidence has been published that could improve the characterisation of the dose-response between folic acid intake and resolution of megaloblastic anaemia in cobalamin-deficient individuals. The ULs for folic acid previously established by the Scientific Committee on Food are retained for all population groups, i.e. 1000??g/day for adults, including pregnant and lactating women, 200??g/day for children aged 1-3?years, 300??g/day for 4-6?years, 400??g/day for 7-10?years, 600??g/day for 11-14?years and 800??g/day for 15-17?years. A UL of 200??g/day is established for infants aged 4-11?months. The ULs apply to the combined intake of folic acid, (6S)-5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid glucosamine and l-5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid calcium salts, under their authorised conditions of use. It is unlikely that the ULs for supplemental folate are exceeded in European populations, except for regular users of food supplements containing high doses of folic acid/5-methyl-tetrahydrofolic acid salts.© 2023 European Food Safety Authority.

,38155188,A rapid and reference-free imputation method for low-cost genotyping platforms.,Sci Rep,"Most current genotype imputation methods are reference-based, which posed several challenges to users, such as high computational costs and reference panel inaccessibility. Thus, deep learning models are expected to create reference-free imputation methods performing with higher accuracy and shortening the running time. We proposed a imputation method using recurrent neural networks integrating with an additional discriminator network, namely GRUD. This method was applied to datasets from genotyping chips and Low-Pass Whole Genome Sequencing (LP-WGS) with the reference panels from The 1000 Genomes Project (1KGP) phase 3, the dataset of 4810 Singaporeans (SG10K), and The 1000 Vietnamese Genome Project (VN1K). Our model performed more accurately than other existing methods on multiple datasets, especially with common variants with large minor allele frequency, and shrank running time and memory usage. In summary, these results indicated that GRUD can be implemented in genomic analyses to improve the accuracy and running-time of genotype imputation.© 2023. The Author(s).",6.42E-16

SPEEDI introduces data-driven batch inference and transforms the often heterogeneous data matrices obtained from different samples into a uniformly annotated and integrated dataset. Without requiring user input, it automatically selects parameters and executes pre-processing, sample integration, and cell type mapping. It can also perform downstream analyses of differential signals between treatment conditions and gene functional modules. SPEEDI's data-driven batch inference method works with widely used integration and cell-typing tools. By developing data-driven batch inference, providing full end-to-end automation, and eliminating parameter selection, SPEEDI improves reproducibility and lowers the barrier to obtaining biological insight from these valuable single-cell datasets.

In this study, we introduce CREaTor, an attention-based deep neural network designed to model cis-regulatory patterns for genomic elements up to 2 Mb from target genes. Coupled with a training strategy that predicts gene expression from flanking candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs), CREaTor can model cell type-specific cis-regulatory patterns in new cell types without prior knowledge of cCRE-gene interactions or additional training. The zero-shot modeling capability, combined with the use of only RNA-seq and ChIP-seq data, allows for the ready generalization of CREaTor to a broad range of cell types.© 2023.

,38092913,Single-cell DNA methylome and 3D multi-omic atlas of the adult mouse brain.,Nature,"Cytosine DNA methylation is essential in brain development and is implicated in various neurological disorders. Understanding DNA methylation diversity across the entire brain in a spatial context is fundamental for a complete molecular atlas of brain cell types and their gene regulatory landscapes. Here we used single-nucleus methylome sequencing (snmC-seq3) and multi-omic sequencing (snm3C-seq)1technologies to generate 301,626 methylomes and 176,003 chromatin conformation-methylome joint profiles from 117 dissected regions throughout the adult mouse brain. Using iterative clustering and integrating with companion whole-brain transcriptome and chromatin accessibility datasets, we constructed a methylation-based cell taxonomy with 4,673 cell groups and 274 cross-modality-annotated subclasses. We identified 2.6?million differentially methylated regions across the genome that represent potential gene regulation elements. Notably, we observed spatial cytosine methylation patterns on both genes and regulatory elements in cell types within and across brain regions. Brain-wide spatial transcriptomics data validated the association of spatial epigenetic diversity with transcription and improved the anatomical mapping of our epigenetic datasets. Furthermore, chromatin conformation diversities occurred in important neuronal genes and were highly associated with DNA methylation and transcription changes. Brain-wide cell-type comparisons enabled the construction of regulatory networks that incorporate transcription factors, regulatory elements and their potential downstream gene targets. Finally, intragenic DNA methylation and chromatin conformation patterns predicted alternative gene isoform expression observed in a whole-brain SMART-seq2dataset. Our study establishes a brain-wide, single-cell DNA methylome and 3D multi-omic atlas and provides a valuable resource for comprehending the cellular-spatial and regulatory genome diversity of the mouse brain.© 2023.

We evaluate BridgePRS via simulations and real UK Biobank data across 19 traits in individuals of African, South Asian and East Asian ancestry, using both UK Biobank and Biobank Japan genome-wide association study summary statistics; out-of-cohort validation is performed in the Mount Sinai (New York) BioMe biobank. BridgePRS is compared with the leading alternative, PRS-CSx, and two other PRS methods. Simulations suggest that the performance of BridgePRS relative to PRS-CSx increases as uncertainty increases: with lower trait heritability, higher polygenicity and greater between-population genetic diversity; and when causal variants are not present in the data. In real data, BridgePRS has a 61% larger average R2than PRS-CSx in out-of-cohort prediction of African ancestry samples in BioMe (P?=?6?×?10-5).

,37993634,Common and ethnic-specific derangements in skeletal muscle transcriptome associated with obesity.,Int J Obes (Lond),"Obesity is a common disease with a higher prevalence among African Americans. Obesity alters cellular function in many tissues, including skeletal muscle, and is a risk factor for many life-threatening diseases, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The similarities and differences in molecular mechanisms that may explain ethnic disparities in obesity between African and European ancestry individuals have not been studied.In this study, data from transcriptome-wide analyses on skeletal muscle tissues from well-powered human cohorts were used to compare genes and biological pathways affected by obesity in European and African ancestry populations. Data on obesity-induced differentially expressed transcripts and GWAS-identified SNPs were integrated to prioritize target genes for obesity-associated genetic variants.Linear regression analysis in the FUSION (European, N?=?301) and AAGMEx (African American, N?=?256) cohorts identified a total of 2569 body mass index (BMI)-associated transcripts (q?<?0.05), of which 970 genes (at p?<?0.05) are associated in both cohorts, and the majority showed the same direction of effect on BMI. Biological pathway analyses, including over-representation and gene-set enrichment analyses, identified enrichment of protein synthesis pathways (e.g., ribosomal function) and the ceramide signaling pathway in both cohorts among BMI-associated down- and up-regulated transcripts, respectively. A comparison using the IPA-tool suggested the activation of inflammation pathways only in Europeans with obesity. Interestingly, these analyses suggested repression of the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation pathway in Europeans but showed its activation in African Americans. Integration of SNP-to-Gene analyses-predicted target genes for obesity-associated genetic variants (GWAS-identified SNPs) and BMI-associated transcripts suggested that these SNPs might cause obesity by altering the expression of 316 critical target genes (e.g., GRB14) in the muscle.This study provides a replication of obesity-associated transcripts and biological pathways in skeletal muscle across ethnicities, but also identifies obesity-associated processes unique in either African or European ancestry populations.© 2023.

Socio-economic strata (SES) of wealth and education have parallel differences of mortality and these diseases. Children from impoverished homes differ in brain development at birth and in risk of early fat excess and hypertension. To further enhance the healthspan, biogerontologists may consider a wider range of environmental exposures from gestation through later life morbidity that comprise the Gero-Exposome. Experimental studies with rodents and nematodes document shared transcriptional responses to AirPoll. In rodents, AirPoll exposure activates gene systems for body-wide detoxification through Nrf2 and NFkB transcription factors that mediate multiple aging processes. Gestational environmental factors include maternal diet and exposure to AirPoll and cigarette smoke. Correspondingly, gestational exposure of mice to AirPoll increased adult body fat, impaired glucose clearance, and decreased adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus, a brain region damaged in dementia. Nematode larvae also respond to AirPoll with Alzheimer relevant responses. These experimental approaches could identify to interventions for expanded human health and longevity across SES gradients.Copyright © 2023 Finch.",3.17E-16
,37985819,Deep learning-based phenotype imputation on population-scale biobank data increases genetic discoveries.,Nat Genet,"Biobanks that collect deep phenotypic and genomic data across many individuals have emerged as a key resource in human genetics. However, phenotypes in biobanks are often missing across many individuals, limiting their utility. We propose AutoComplete, a deep learning-based imputation method to impute or 'fill-in' missing phenotypes in population-scale biobank datasets. When applied to collections of phenotypes measured across ~300,000 individuals from the UK Biobank, AutoComplete substantially improved imputation accuracy over existing methods. On three traits with notable amounts of missingness, we show that AutoComplete yields imputed phenotypes that are genetically similar to the originally observed phenotypes while increasing the effective sample size by about twofold on average. Further, genome-wide association analyses on the resulting imputed phenotypes led to a substantial increase in the number of associated loci. Our results demonstrate the utility of deep learning-based phenotype imputation to increase power for genetic discoveries in existing biobank datasets.© 2023. The Author(s).",3.16E-16

Our study partitions phenotypic variance in metabolic syndrome (MetS), blood glucose (GLU), triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and blood pressure through genome, transcriptome, metabolome, and exposome (i.e., lifestyle exposome) analyses. Our analysis included a cohort of 62,822 unrelated individuals with white British ancestry, sourced from the UK biobank. We employed linear mixed models to partition phenotypic variance using the restricted maximum likelihood (REML) method, implemented in MTG2 (v2.22). We initiated the analysis by individually modeling omics, followed by subsequent integration of pairwise omics in a joint model that also accounted for the covariance and interaction between omics layers. Finally, we estimated the correlations of various omics effects between the phenotypes using bivariate REML. Significant proportions of the MetS variance were attributed to distinct data sources: genome (9.47%), transcriptome (4.24%), metabolome (14.34%), and exposome (3.77%). The phenotypic variances explained by the genome, transcriptome, metabolome, and exposome ranged from 3.28% for GLU to 25.35% for HDL-C, 0% for GLU to 19.34% for HDL-C, 4.29% for systolic blood pressure (SBP) to 35.75% for TG, and 0.89% for GLU to 10.17% for HDL-C, respectively. Significant correlations were found between genomic and transcriptomic effects for TG and HDL-C. Furthermore, significant interaction effects between omics data were detected for both MetS and its components. Interestingly, significant correlation of omics effect between the phenotypes was found. This study underscores omics' roles, interaction effects, and random-effects covariance in unveiling phenotypic variation in multi-omics domains.© 2023.

Machine learning models are potentially useful for risk evaluation. In this study we used two cohorts to test the feasibility of machine learning with transfer learning for developing an ASCVD risk prediction model in Taiwan.Two multi-center observational registry cohorts, T-SPARCLE and T-PPARCLE were used in this study. The variables selected were based on European, U.S. and Asian guidelines. Both registries recorded the ASCVD outcomes of the patients. Ten-fold validation and temporal validation methods were used to evaluate the performance of the binary classification analysis [prediction of major adverse cardiovascular (CV) events in one year]. Time-to-event analyses were also performed.In the binary classification analysis, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and random forest had the best performance, with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) of 0.72 (0.68-0.76) and 0.73 (0.69-0.77), respectively, although it was not significantly better than other models. Temporal validation was also performed, and the data showed significant differences in the distribution of various features and event rate. The AUC-ROC of XGBoost dropped to 0.66 (0.59-0.73), while that of random forest dropped to 0.69 (0.62-0.76) in the temporal validation method, and the performance also became numerically worse than that of the logistic regression model. In the time-to-event analysis, most models had a concordance index of around 0.70.Machine learning models with appropriate transfer learning may be a useful tool for the development of CV risk prediction models and may help improve patient care in the future.",2.22E-16

Formidable technical challenges arise when attempting to combine data from technically diverse 16S rRNA gene variable region amplicon sequencing (16S) studies. Closed operational taxonomic units and taxonomy are criticized as being heavily dependent upon reference sets and with limited precision relative to the underlying biology. Phylogenetic placement has been demonstrated to be a promising taxonomy-free manner of harmonizing microbiome data, but it has lacked a validated count-based feature suitable for use in machine learning and association studies. Here we introduce a phylogenetic-placement-based, taxonomy-independent, compositional feature of microbiota: phylotypes. Phylotypes were predictive of clinical outcomes such as obesity or pre-term birth on technically diverse independent validation sets harmonized post hoc. Thus, phylotypes enable the rigorous cross-validation of 16S-based clinical prognostic models and associative microbiome studies.Copyright © 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The search was conducted using PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Google Scholar, SCOPUS, and the Cochrane Library. Inclusion criteria included: human literature which was peer reviewed and found in primary sources, printed in the English language. In addition, the study must have reported genetic/epigenetic data in either the oxytocin or oxytocin receptor gene (maternal or infant up to 12 months after birth) in relation to a breastfeeding, maternal caregiving behavior or a maternal mental health outcome. There was no date limitation. Four authors reviewed studies for eligibility. Data was extracted using a structured data extraction form.A total of 23 studies met inclusion criteria for this review (breastfeeding n = 4, maternal caregiving behavior n = 7, and maternal mental health n = 16). Seventeen papers reported on oxytocin or oxytocin receptor genotype and nine reported epigenetic associations (namely DNA methylation). These totals are greater than 23, as studies reported on multiple outcomes. One paper assessed the interaction between genotype and methylation. While a number of genotype variations were reported, the single nucleotide polymorphism rs53576 on the oxytocin receptor gene was the most studied. Overall, variation in this polymorphism was related to postnatal depression symptoms. Among numerous epigenetic markers, site -934 was the most studied methylation site, and methylation status was associated with maternal depression and maternal caregiving behavior outcomes. Results suggest that early life experiences impact adult maternal caregiving behaviors and mental health outcomes, and vary based on genetic vulnerability. Breastfeeding outcomes were minimally studied.This scoping review found that genetic and epigenetic variation at the oxytocin and oxytocin receptor genes were associated with maternal caregiving behavior and mental health, likely through complex gene and environment interactions. The findings suggest that maternal early life experiences and stress impact later caregiving behaviors and mental health in the postnatal period. The findings highlight potential pathways by which environment, experiences, and genes interact to impact maternal caregiving behavior and maternal mental health.© 2023 The Authors.",1.62E-16

With a comprehensive genomic dataset, including newly generated data of modern-day and ancient DNA from previously unsampled regions in Africa, we contribute insights into this expansion that started 6,000-4,000?years ago in western Africa. We genotyped 1,763 participants, including 1,526 Bantu speakers from 147 populations across 14 African countries, and generated whole-genome sequences from 12 Late Iron Age individuals8. We show that genetic diversity amongst Bantu-speaking populations declines with distance from western Africa, with current-day Zambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo as possible crossroads of interaction. Using spatially explicit methods9and correlating genetic, linguistic and geographical data, we provide cross-disciplinary support for a serial-founder migration model. We further show that Bantu speakers received significant gene flow from local groups in regions they expanded into. Our genetic dataset provides an exhaustive modern-day African comparative dataset for ancient DNA studies10and will be important to a wide range of disciplines from science and humanities, as well as to the medical sector studying human genetic variation and health in African and African-descendant populations.© 2023.

However, the precise molecular mechanism remains unclear. In this study, p,p'-DDE was given by gavage to pregnant rat dams from gestational day (GD) 8 to GD15 to generate male germline to investiagate the transgenerational effects. We found that early-life p,p'-DDE exposure increased the transgenerational diabetic susceptibility through male germline inheritance. In utero exposure to p,p'-DDE altered the sperm DNA methylome in F1 progeny, and a significant number of those differentially methylated genes could be inherited by F2 progeny. Furthermore, early-life p,p'-DDE exposure altered DNA methylation in glucose metabolic genes Gck and G6pc in sperm and the methylation modification were also found in liver of the next generation. Our study demonstrate that DNA methylation plays a critical role in mediating transgenerational diabetogenic effect induced by early-life p,p'-DDE exposure.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

The high mutation rate of TRs, which can be orders of magnitude higher than single-nucleotide polymorphisms and indels, indicates that they are likely to make significant contributions to phenotypic variation, yet their contribution to schizophrenia has been largely ignored by recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Tandem repeat expansions are already known causative factors for over 50 disorders, while common tandem repeat variation is increasingly being identified as significantly associated with complex disease and gene regulation. The current review summarizes key background concepts of tandem repeat variation as pertains to disease risk, elucidating their potential for schizophrenia association.

While, in general, machine learning models can be applied to a wide range of data types, graph neural networks (GNNs) are particularly developed for graphs, which are very common in the biomedical domain. For instance, a patient can be represented by a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network where the nodes contain the patient-specific omics features. Here, we present our Ensemble-GNN software package, which can be used to deploy federated, ensemble-based GNNs in Python. Ensemble-GNN allows to quickly build predictive models utilizing PPI networks consisting of various node features such as gene expression and/or DNA methylation. We exemplary show the results from a public dataset of 981 patients and 8469 genes from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).The source code is available at https://github.com/pievos101/Ensemble-GNN, and the data at Zenodo (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.8305122).© The Author(s) 2023.

In this Perspective, we suggest that ideas and tools from the emerging field of geroscience offer opportunities to advance the environmental science of aging. Specifically, the capacity to measure the pace and progress of biological processes of aging within individuals from relatively young ages makes it possible to study how changing environments can change aging trajectories from early in life, in time to prevent or delay aging-related disease and disability and build aging health equity.© 2023.

,37945700,The genetics of falling susceptibility and identification of causal risk factors.,Sci Rep,"Falls represent a huge health and economic burden. Whilst many factors are associated with fall risk (e.g. obesity and physical inactivity) there is limited evidence for the causal role of these risk factors. Here, we used hospital and general practitioner records in UK Biobank, deriving a balance specific fall phenotype in 20,789 cases and 180,658 controls, performed a Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) and used Mendelian Randomisation (MR) to test causal pathways. GWAS indicated a small but significant SNP-based heritability (4.4%), identifying one variant (rs429358) in APOE at genome-wide significance (P?<?5e-8). MR provided evidence for a causal role of higher BMI on higher fall risk even in the absence of adverse metabolic consequences. Depression and neuroticism predicted higher risk of falling, whilst higher hand grip strength and physical activity were protective. Our findings suggest promoting lower BMI, higher physical activity as well as psychological health is likely to reduce falls.© 2023. The Author(s).",4.93E-17

However, the genetic etiology of anxiety disorders remains largely unknown. Here we conducted a genome-wide meta-analysis on anxiety disorders by including 74,973 (28,392 proxy) cases and 400,243 (146,771 proxy) controls. We identified 14 risk loci, including 10 new associations near CNTNAP5, MAP2, RAB9BP1, BTN1A1, PRR16, PCLO, PTPRD, FARP1, CDH2 and RAB27B. Functional genomics and fine-mapping pinpointed the potential causal variants, and expression quantitative trait loci analysis revealed the potential target genes regulated by the risk variants. Integrative analyses, including transcriptome-wide association study, proteome-wide association study and colocalization analyses, prioritized potential causal genes (including CTNND1 and RAB27B). Evidence from multiple analyses revealed possibly causal genes, including RAB27B, BTN3A2, PCLO and CTNND1. Finally, we showed that Ctnnd1 knockdown affected dendritic spine density and resulted in anxiety-like behaviours in mice, revealing the potential role of CTNND1 in anxiety disorders. Our study identified new risk loci, potential causal variants and genes for anxiety disorders, providing insights into the genetic architecture of anxiety disorders and potential therapeutic targets.© 2023.

Technical issues like data integration, missing value imputation, batch effect correction and the exploration of inter-connections amongst these technical issues, can produce errors but are not well studied. Although proteomic technologies have improved significantly in recent years, this alone cannot resolve these issues. What is needed are better algorithms and data processing knowledge. But to obtain these, we need appropriate proteomics datasets for exploration, investigation, and benchmarking. To meet this need, we developed MultiPro (Multi-purpose Proteome Resource), a resource comprising four comprehensive large-scale proteomics datasets with deliberate batch effects using the latest parallel accumulation-serial fragmentation in both Data-Dependent Acquisition (DDA) and Data Independent Acquisition (DIA) modes. Each dataset contains a balanced two-class design based on well-characterized and widely studied cell lines (A549 vs K562 or HCC1806 vs HS578T) with 48 or 36 biological and technical replicates altogether, allowing for investigation of a multitude of technical issues.

The toxicity is partly dependent on age, as older individuals metabolize alcohol more slowly leading to increased cellular injury. This study aimed to investigate the effects of moderate binge drinking on the liver of young and aged mice in a genome-wide multi-omics approach. We determined DNA methylation (DNAm) using the Illumina MouseMethylation array and gene expression by RNA sequencing in 18 female Balb/c mice in a 2?×?2 design. The animals underwent three moderate binge drinking cycles (ethanol vs. vehicle) and liver tissue was harvested at 4 or 19?months of age. We tested differential gene expression (DE) and DNAm associated with ethanol intake in linear models separately in young and aged mice, performed enrichment analyses for pathways and GWAS signatures of problematic alcohol use, and analysed the overlap of DNAm and gene expression. We observed DE in young and aged animals and substantial overlap in genes such as Bhlhe40, Klf10, and Frmd8. DE genes in aged animals were enriched for biological processes related to alcohol metabolism, inflammation, liver fibrosis, and GWAS signatures of problematic alcohol use. We identified overlapping signatures from DNAm and gene expression, for example, Frmd8 in aged and St6galnac4 in young mice. This study offers converging evidence of novel age-related targets in a moderate alcohol consumption model highlighting dysregulations in genes related to alcohol metabolism, inflammation, and liver fibrosis. Future studies are needed to confirm these results and elucidate the underlying mechanisms.© 2023 The Authors.

Accumulating evidence suggests that operating epi- or above the genetic DNA sequence, covalent DNA methylation (DNAme) can be recorded onto DNA in response to environmental insults, some sites which escape normal germline erasure. These appear to intrinsically regulate future disease propensity, even transgenerationally. Thus, an organism's genome can undergo epigenetic adjustment based on environmental influences experienced by prior generations. During the earliest stages of mammalian development, the three-dimensional presentation of the genome is dramatically changed, and DNAme is removed genome wide. Why, then, do some pathological DNAme patterns appear to be heritable? Are these correctable? In the following sections, I review concepts of transgenerational epigenetics and recent work towards programming transgenerational DNAme. A framework for editing heritable DNAme and challenges are discussed, and ethics in human research is introduced.",3.36E-17

To advance a personalized approach to healthcare, such biomarkers must reliably and accurately capture individual biology, predict biological age, and provide scalable and cost-effective measurements. We developed a novel approach - image-based chromatin and epigenetic age (ImAge) that captures intrinsic progressions of biological age, which readily emerge as principal changes in the spatial organization of chromatin and epigenetic marks in single nuclei without regression on chronological age. ImAge captured the expected acceleration or deceleration of biological age in mice treated with chemotherapy or following a caloric restriction regimen, respectively. ImAge from chronologically identical mice inversely correlated with their locomotor activity (greater activity for younger ImAge), consistent with the widely accepted role of locomotion as an aging biomarker across species. Finally, we demonstrated that ImAge is reduced following transient expression of OSKM cassette in the liver and skeletal muscles and reveals heterogeneity of in vivo reprogramming. We propose that ImAge represents the first-in-class imaging-based biomarker of aging with single-cell resolution.",2.02E-17

In particular, we focus on the role of epigenome-wide studies of human and mouse liver in understanding these age-related processes with respect to xenobiotic processing. We highlight genes encoding drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters revealed to be affected by epigenetic aging in these studies.

The resurrection of particular retroelements has been linked to biological aging. Whether the DNA methylation states of locus specific HERVs and LINEs can be used as a biomarker of chronological age in humans remains unclear. We show that highly predictive epigenetic clocks of chronological age can be constructed from retroelement DNA methylation states in the immune system, across human tissues, and pan-mammalian species. We found retroelement epigenetic clocks were reversed during transient epigenetic reprogramming, accelerated in people living with HIV-1, responsive to antiretroviral therapy, and accurate in estimating long-term culture ages of human brain organoids. Our findings support the hypothesis of epigenetic dysregulation of retroelements as a potential contributor to the biological hallmarks of aging.",1.69E-17

To identify genes underlying Bergmann's Rule, which posits that spatial correlations of body mass and temperature reflect natural selection and local adaptation in endotherms, we compare 79 genomes from nine song sparrow (Melospiza melodia) subspecies that vary ~300% in body mass (17 - 50?g). Comparing large- and smaller-bodied subspecies revealed 9 candidate genes in three genomic regions associated with body mass. Further comparisons to the five smallest subspecies endemic to California revealed eight SNPs within four of the candidate genes (GARNL3, RALGPS1, ANGPTL2, and COL15A1) associated with body mass and varying as predicted by Bergmann's Rule. Our results support the hypothesis that co-variation in environment, body mass and genotype reflect the influence of natural selection on local adaptation and a capacity for contemporary evolution in this diverse species.© 2023.

We recently identified and validated a specific case where the methylation of a CpG site influences the relationship between the genetic variant and gene expression.Here, to systematically evaluate this regulatory mechanism, we develop an extended eQTL mapping method, termed DNA methylation modulated eQTL (memo-eQTL). Applying this memo-eQTL mapping method to 128 normal prostate samples enables identification of 1063 memo-eQTLs, the majority of which are not recognized as conventional eQTLs in the same cohort. We observe that the methylation of the memo-eQTL CpG sites can either enhance or insulate the interaction between SNP and gene expression by altering CTCF-based chromatin 3D structure.This study demonstrates the prevalence of memo-eQTLs paving the way to identify novel causal genes for traits or diseases associated with genetic variations.© 2023.

Theoretically, nucleosome footprints and nucleosome-depleted regions can be identified using M.EcoGII, which methylates adenines in any sequence context, providing a high-resolution map of accessible regions in each DNA molecule. Here we report PacBio long-read sequence data for budding yeast nuclei treated with M.EcoGII and a bioinformatic pipeline which corrects for three key challenges undermining this promising method. First, detection of m6A in individual DNA molecules by the PacBio software is inefficient, resulting in false footprints predicted by random gaps of seemingly unmethylated adenines. Second, there is a strong bias against m6A base calling as AT content increases. Third, occasional methylation occurs within nucleosomes, breaking up their footprints. After correcting for these issues, our pipeline calculates a correlation coefficient-based score indicating the extent of chromatin heterogeneity within the cell population for every gene. Although the population average is consistent with that derived using other techniques, we observe a wide range of heterogeneity in nucleosome positions at the single-molecule level, probably reflecting cellular chromatin dynamics.",1.57E-17

LDpred2-auto can infer the two parameters from the LDpred model, the SNP heritability h2and polygenicity p, so that it does not require an additional validation dataset to choose best-performing parameters. The main aim of this paper is to properly validate the use of LDpred2-auto for inferring multiple genetic parameters. Here, we present a new version of LDpred2-auto that adds an optional third parameter ? to its model, for modeling negative selection. We then validate the inference of these three parameters (or two, when using the previous model). We also show that LDpred2-auto provides per-variant probabilities of being causal that are well calibrated and can therefore be used for fine-mapping purposes. We also introduce a formula to infer the out-of-sample predictive performance r2of the resulting PGS directly from the Gibbs sampler of LDpred2-auto. Finally, we extend the set of HapMap3 variants recommended to use with LDpred2 with 37% more variants to improve the coverage of this set, and we show that this new set of variants captures 12% more heritability and provides 6% more predictive performance, on average, in UK Biobank analyses.Copyright © 2023 American Society of Human Genetics.

Here, we hypothesize that Mendelian phenotypes represent the extremes of a phenotypic spectrum and, using achondroplasia as an example, we introduce a syndrome-informed phenotyping approach to identify genomic loci associated with achondroplasia-like facial variation in the normal population. We compared three-dimensional facial scans from 43 individuals with achondroplasia and 8246 controls to calculate achondroplasia-like facial scores. Multivariate GWAS of the control scores revealed a polygenic basis for normal facial variation along an achondroplasia-specific shape axis, identifying genes primarily involved in skeletal development. Jointly modeling these genes in two independent control samples showed craniofacial effects approximating the characteristic achondroplasia phenotype. These findings suggest that both complex and Mendelian genetic variation act on the same developmentally determined axes of facial variation, providing new insights into the genetic intersection of complex traits and Mendelian disorders.",1.03E-17

Based on the analyses of terminal restriction fragment (TRF) length of telomere, individual genotypes, and gene expressions on 166 healthy placental tissues, we systematically interrogate TL-modulated genes and their potential functions. We discover that the TL in the placenta is comparatively longer than in other adult tissues, but exhibiting an intra-tissue homogeneity. Trans-ancestral TL genome-wide association studies (GWASs) on 644,553 individuals identify 20 newly discovered genetic associations and provide increased polygenic determination of human TL. Next, we integrate the powerful TL GWAS with placental expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping to prioritize 23 likely causal genes, among which 4 are functionally validated, including MMUT, RRM1, KIAA1429, and YWHAZ. Finally, modeling transcriptomic signatures and TRF-based TL improve the prediction performance of human TL.

Meanwhile, we also scrutinize the size profile of plasma cfDNA in 901 healthy human subjects and 38 dogs, as well as 438 patients with six common cancer types by sWGS.Distinct size distribution profiles were observed in the HL60 cell pellet and supernatant, suggesting fragmentation is a stepwise process.

Various supervised machine learning approaches were used to predict PTSD in family members and evaluated on an independent held-out test dataset. To better understand variables' contributions to PTSD predicted probability, we used machine learning interpretability methods on the best predictive algorithm.Non-linear ensemble learning tree-based methods showed better predictive performances (Random Forest-area under curve, AUC?=?0.73 [0.68-0.77] and XGBoost-AUC?=?0.73 [0.69-0.78]) than regularized linear models, kernel-based models, or deep learning models. In the best performing algorithm, most important features that positively contributed to PTSD's predicted probability were all non-modifiable factors, namely, lower patient's age, longer duration of ICU stay, relative's female sex, lower relative's age, relative being a spouse/child, and patient's death in ICU. A sensitivity analysis in bereaved relatives did not alter the algorithm's predictive performance.We propose a machine learning-based approach to predict PTSD in relatives of ICU patients at an individual level. In this model, PTSD is mostly influenced by non-modifiable factors.© 2023. Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",5.21E-18

In the UK Biobank (UKB), we compared mtDNA-CN in mild and moderate-severe asthmatics to non-asthmatics. In the Severe Asthma Research Program (SARP), we evaluated mtDNA-CN in relation to asthma severity, biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation, and exacerbations.In UK Biobank, asthmatics (n= 29,768) have lower mtDNA-CN compared to non-asthmatics (n= 239,158) (beta, -0.026 [95% CI, -0.038 to -0.014],P= 2.46×10-5). While lower mtDNA-CN is associated with asthma, mtDNA-CN did not differ by asthma severity in either UKB or SARP. Biomarkers of inflammation show that asthmatics have higher white blood cells (WBC), neutrophils, eosinophils, fraction exhaled nitric oxide (FENO), and lower superoxide dismutase (SOD) than non-asthmatics, confirming greater oxidative stress in asthma.

Noninvasive tissues may improve disease-relevant discovery by enabling more complex longitudinal study designs, by capturing different and potentially more applicable cell types, and by increasing sample sizes due to reduced collection costs and possible higher enrollment from vulnerable populations. Here, we develop methods for sampling noninvasive biospecimens, investigate their performance across commercial and in-house library preparations, characterize their biology, and assess the feasibility of using noninvasive tissues in a multitude of transcriptomic applications. We collected buccal swabs, hair follicles, saliva, and urine cell pellets from 19 individuals over three to four timepoints, for a total of 300 unique biological samples, which we then prepared with replicates across three library preparations, for a final tally of 472 transcriptomes. Of the four tissues we studied, we found hair follicles and urine cell pellets to be most promising due to the consistency of sample quality, the cell types and expression profiles we observed, and their performance in disease-relevant applications.

Recent studies suggest that deep learning, due to its capacity to extract profound insights, provides a more precise DNA methylation prediction. However, issues related to the stability and generalization performance of these models persist.In this study, we introduce an efficient and stable DNA methylation prediction model. This model incorporates a feature fusion approach, adaptive feature correction technology, and a contrastive learning strategy. The proposed model presents several advantages. First, DNA sequences are encoded at four levels to comprehensively capture intricate information across multi-scale and low-span features. Second, we design a sequence-specific feature correction module that adaptively adjusts the weights of sequence features. This improvement enhances the model's stability and scalability, or its generality. Third, our contrastive learning strategy mitigates the instability issues resulting from sparse data. To validate our model, we conducted multiple sets of experiments on commonly used datasets, demonstrating the model's robustness and stability. Simultaneously, we amalgamate various datasets into a single, unified dataset. The experimental outcomes from this combined dataset substantiate the model's robust adaptability.Our research findings affirm that the StableDNAm model is a general, stable, and effective instrument for DNA methylation prediction. It holds substantial promise for providing invaluable assistance in future methylation-related research and analyses.© 2023. The Author(s).",8.38E-19
,38036788,Isoform-level transcriptome-wide association uncovers genetic risk mechanisms for neuropsychiatric disorders in the human brain.,Nat Genet,"Methods integrating genetics with transcriptomic reference panels prioritize risk genes and mechanisms at only a fraction of trait-associated genetic loci, due in part to an overreliance on total gene expression as a molecular outcome measure. This challenge is particularly relevant for the brain, in which extensive splicing generates multiple distinct transcript-isoforms per gene. Due to complex correlation structures, isoform-level modeling from cis-window variants requires methodological innovation. Here we introduce isoTWAS, a multivariate, stepwise framework integrating genetics, isoform-level expression and phenotypic associations. Compared to gene-level methods, isoTWAS improves both isoform and gene expression prediction, yielding more testable genes, and increased power for discovery of trait associations within genome-wide association study loci across 15 neuropsychiatric traits. We illustrate multiple isoTWAS associations undetectable at the gene-level, prioritizing isoforms of AKT3, CUL3 and HSPD1 in schizophrenia and PCLO with multiple disorders. Results highlight the importance of incorporating isoform-level resolution within integrative approaches to increase discovery of trait associations, especially for brain-relevant traits.© 2023.

To uncover potential causal associations, we utilized two-sample univariable and multivariable Mendelian randomization (MR) methods.Methods:Five risk factors related to lifestyles (cigarettes per day, lifetime smoking index, smoking initiation, drinks per week and alcohol intake frequency) were chosen from the Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS). Upper urinary calculi were obtained from the FinnGen and United Kingdom Biobank consortium. Inverse-variance-weighted (IVW) was mainly used to compute odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (Cl). While diligently scrutinizing potential sources of heterogeneity and horizontal pleiotropy via the rigorous utilization of Cochran's Q test, the MR-PRESSO method, and MR-Egger.Results:The summary OR for upper urinary calculi was 0.6 (IVW 95% CI: 0.49-0.74;p= 1.31 × 10-06) per standard deviation decrease in drinks per week. Interestingly, the genetically predicted alcohol intake frequency was associated with a significantly increased risk upper urinary calculi (OR = 1.27; 95% CI: 1.11-1.45;p= 0.0005). Our study found no association between smoking initiation, the number of cigarettes per day, and the lifetime smoking index and the risk of upper urinary calculi. By adjusting for body mass index and education, estimates of drinks per week remained consistent in multivariate MR analyses, while alcohol intake frequency became non-significant.Conclusion:MR analysis showed that drinks per week was negatively associated with upper urinary calculi, whereas the effect of tobacco on upper urinary calculi was not significant and the detrimental effect of alcohol intake frequency on upper urinary calculi became non-significant after adjusting for BMI and education.Copyright © 2023 Wang, Yin, Li, Bao, Wang and Zhu.",6.37E-19

In this work, we focus on exploring the underling mechanism between nucleolus disruption and epigenetic modification in Cd stressed-Pakchoi. Our results indicated that the proportion of nucleolus disruption, decondensation of 45 S rDNA chromatin, and a simultaneous increase in 5' external transcribed spacer region (ETS) transcription were observed with increasing Cd concentration, accompanied by genome-wide alterations in the levels of histone acetylation and methylation. Further results showed that Cd treatment exhibited a significant increase in H3K9ac, H4K5ac, and H3K9me2 levels occurred in promoter regions of the 45 S rDNA. Additionally, DNA methylation assays in the 45 S rDNA promoter region revealed that individual site-specific hypomethylation may be engaged in the activation of 45 S rDNA transcription. Our study provides some molecular mechanisms for the linkage between Cd stress, rDNA epigenetic modifications, and nucleolus disintegration in plants.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

,38082205,Genetic architecture of cardiac dynamic flow volumes.,Nat Genet,"Cardiac blood flow is a critical determinant of human health. However, the definition of its genetic architecture is limited by the technical challenge of capturing dynamic flow volumes from cardiac imaging at scale. We present DeepFlow, a deep-learning system to extract cardiac flow and volumes from phase-contrast cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. A mixed-linear model applied to 37,653 individuals from the UK Biobank reveals genome-wide significant associations across cardiac dynamic flow volumes spanning from aortic forward velocity to aortic regurgitation fraction. Mendelian randomization reveals a causal role for aortic root size in aortic valve regurgitation. Among the most significant contributing variants, localizing genes (near ELN, PRDM6 and ADAMTS7) are implicated in connective tissue and blood pressure pathways. Here we show that DeepFlow cardiac flow phenotyping at scale, combined with genotyping data, reinforces the contribution of connective tissue genes, blood pressure and root size to aortic valve function.© 2023.

However, equally remarkable is the ability of a subset of genes to continue to be expressed from the otherwise inactive X chromosome-in some cases constitutively, while other genes are variable between individuals, tissues or cells. In this review we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the approaches that have been used to identify escapees. The identity of escapees provides important clues to mechanisms underlying escape from XCI, an arena of study now moving from correlation to functional studies. As most escapees show greater expression in females, the not-so-inactive X chromosome is a substantial contributor to sex differences in humans, and we highlight some examples of such impact.",4.14E-19
,38102202,The Information Theory of Aging.,Nat Aging,"Information storage and retrieval is essential for all life. In biology, information is primarily stored in two distinct ways: the genome, comprising nucleic acids, acts as a foundational blueprint and the epigenome, consisting of chemical modifications to DNA and histone proteins, regulates gene expression patterns and endows cells with specific identities and functions. Unlike the stable, digital nature of genetic information, epigenetic information is stored in a digital-analog format, susceptible to alterations induced by diverse environmental signals and cellular damage. The Information Theory of Aging (ITOA) states that the aging process is driven by the progressive loss of youthful epigenetic information, the retrieval of which via epigenetic reprogramming can improve the function of damaged and aged tissues by catalyzing age reversal.© 2023.

With bulk RNA-seq, changes in gene expression across cell types can be lost, potentially masking the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) across different cell types. Through the use of single-cell techniques, the authors benefitted from increased resolution with the potential to uncover cell type-specific DEGs in AD for the first time. However, there were limitations in both their data processing and quality control and their differential expression analysis. Here, we correct these issues and use best-practice approaches to snRNA-seq differential expression, resulting in 549 times fewer DEGs at a false discovery rate of 0.05. Thus, this study highlights the impact of quality control and differential analysis methods on the discovery of disease-associated genes and aims to refocus the AD research field away from spuriously identified genes.© 2023, Murphy et al.",3.31E-19

,38104173,Brain age prediction using combined deep convolutional neural network and multi-layer perceptron algorithms.,Sci Rep,"The clinical applications of brain age prediction have expanded, particularly in anticipating the onset and prognosis of various neurodegenerative diseases. In the current study, we proposed a deep learning algorithm that leverages brain structural imaging data and enhances prediction accuracy by integrating biological sex information. Our model for brain age prediction, built on deep neural networks, employed a dataset of 3004 healthy subjects aged 18 and above. The T1-weighted images were minimally preprocessed and analyzed using the convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm. The categorical sex information was then incorporated using the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) algorithm. We trained and validated both a CNN-only algorithm (utilizing only brain structural imaging data), and a combined CNN-MLP algorithm (using both structural brain imaging data and sex information) for age prediction. By integrating sex information with T1-weighted imaging data, our proposed CNN-MLP algorithm outperformed not only the CNN-only algorithm but also established algorithms, such as brainageR, in prediction accuracy. Notably, this hybrid CNN-MLP algorithm effectively distinguished between mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease groups by identifying variances in brain age gaps between them, highlighting the algorithm's potential for clinical application. Overall, these results underscore the enhanced precision of the CNN-MLP algorithm in brain age prediction, achieved through the integration of sex information.© 2023. The Author(s).",2.88E-19

However, this is a challenging task, as biological effects can be masked by technical variation. Here, we present JOINTLY, an algorithm enabling joint clustering of sxRNA-seq datasets across batches. JOINTLY performs on par or better than state-of-the-art batch integration methods in clustering tasks and outperforms other intrinsically interpretable methods. We demonstrate that JOINTLY is robust against over-correction while retaining subtle cell state differences between biological conditions and highlight how the interpretation of JOINTLY can be used to annotate cell types and identify active signalling programs across cell types and pseudo-time. Finally, we use JOINTLY to construct a reference atlas of white adipose tissue (WATLAS), an expandable and comprehensive community resource, in which we describe four adipocyte subpopulations and map compositional changes in obesity and between depots.© 2023.

Our aim was to examine causal and predictive relationships between 4137 serum proteins and incident AF in the prospective population-based Age, Gene/Environment Susceptibility-Reykjavik (AGES-Reykjavik) study.The study included 4765 participants, of whom 1172 developed AF. Cox proportional hazards regression models were fitted for 4137 baseline protein measurements adjusting for known risk factors. Protein associations were tested for replication in the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS). Causal relationships were examined in a bidirectional, two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis. The time-dependent area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC)-statistic was examined as protein levels and an AF-polygenic risk score (PRS) were added to clinical risk models. The proteomic signature of incident AF consisted of 76 proteins, of which 63 (83%) were novel and 29 (38%) were replicated in CHS. The signature included both N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP)-dependent (e.g. CHST15, ATP1B1, and SVEP1) and independent components (e.g. ASPN, AKR1B, and LAMA1/LAMB1/LAMC1). Nine causal candidates were identified (TAGLN, WARS, CHST15, CHMP3, COL15A1, DUSP13, MANBA, QSOX2, and SRL). The reverse causal analysis suggested that most AF-associated proteins were affected by the genetic liability to AF. N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide improved the prediction of incident AF events close to baseline with further improvements gained by the AF-PRS at all time points.The AF proteomic signature includes biologically relevant proteins, some of which may be causal. It mainly reflects an NT-proBNP-dependent consequence of the genetic liability to AF. N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide is a promising marker for incident AF in the short term, but risk assessment incorporating a PRS may improve long-term risk assessment.© The Author(s) 2023.

x,37982274,Validation of an Integrated Genetic-Epigenetic Test for the Assessment of Coronary Heart Disease.,J Am Heart Assoc,"Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of death in the world. Unfortunately, many of the key diagnostic tools for CHD are insensitive, invasive, and costly; require significant specialized infrastructure investments; and do not provide information to guide postdiagnosis therapy. In prior work using data from the Framingham Heart Study, we provided in silico evidence that integrated genetic-epigenetic tools may provide a new avenue for assessing CHD.In this communication, we use an improved machine learning approach and data from 2 additional cohorts, totaling 449 cases and 2067 controls, to develop a better model for ascertaining symptomatic CHD. Using the DNA from the 2 new cohorts, we translate and validate the in silico findings into an artificial intelligence-guided, clinically implementable method that uses input from 6 methylation-sensitive digital polymerase chain reaction and 10 genotyping assays. Using this method, the overall average area under the curve, sensitivity, and specificity in the 3 test cohorts is 82%, 79%, and 76%, respectively. Analysis of targeted cytosine-phospho-guanine loci shows that they map to key risk pathways involved in atherosclerosis that suggest specific therapeutic approaches.We conclude that this scalable integrated genetic-epigenetic approach is useful for the diagnosis of symptomatic CHD, performs favorably as compared with many existing methods, and may provide personalized insight to CHD therapy. Furthermore, given the dynamic nature of DNA methylation and the ease of methylation-sensitive digital polymerase chain reaction methodologies, these findings may pave a pathway for precision epigenetic approaches for monitoring CHD treatment response.",1.87E-19

While some studies have shown a rise in their incidence in Europe, others have not. Survival remains limited. We addressed two questions about these tumours in Spain: (1) Is incidence increasing? and (2) Has survival improved?This population-based study included 1635 children and 328 adolescents from 11 population-based cancer registries with International Classification of Childhood Cancer Group III tumours, incident in 1983-2007. Age-specific and age-standardised (world population) incidence rates (ASRws) were calculated. Incidence time trends were characterised using annual percent change (APC) obtained with Joinpoint. Cases from 1991 to 2005 (1171) were included in Kaplan-Meier survival analyses, and the results were evaluated with log-rank and log-rank for trend tests. Children's survival was age-standardised using: (1) the age distribution of cases and the corresponding trends assessed with Joinpoint; and (2) European weights for comparison with Europe.ASRw 1983-2007: children: 32.7 cases/106; adolescents: 23.5 cases/106. The overall incidence of all tumours increased across 1983-2007 in children and adolescents. Considering change points, the APCs were: (1) children: 1983-1993, 4.3%^ (1.1; 7.7); 1993-2007, -0.2% (-1.9; 1.6); (2) adolescents: 1983-2004: 2.9%^ (0.9; 4.9); 2004-2007: -7.7% (-40; 41.9). For malignant tumours, the trends were not significant. 5-year survival was 65% (1991-2005), with no significant trends (except for non-malignant tumours).CNS tumour incidence in Spain was found to be similar to that in Europe. Rises in incidence may be mostly attributable to changes in the registration of non-malignant tumours. The overall malignant CNS tumour trend was compatible with reports for Southern Europe. Survival was lower than in Europe, without improvement over time.

The purpose of the current study was to examine the potential correlation between Se levels and the risk of OP by using the Mendelian randomization (MR) study design. The genetic variants related to Se levels were obtained from a meta-analysis of a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) conducted on toenail Se levels (n= 4162) and blood Se levels (n= 5477). The data summary for OP and bone mineral density (BMD) was obtained by utilizing the GWAS database. To examine the association between Se levels and BMD and OP, we employed three statistical methods: inverse variance weighted, weighted median, and MR-Egger. The reliability of the analysis was verified by sensitivity testing. All three methods of MR analysis revealed that Se levels had no effect on OP risk. In addition, the sensitivity analysis revealed no heterogeneity or pleiotropy, and the significance of the overall effect remained unaffected by single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), as determined by the leave-one-out analysis, indicating that our findings are relatively reliable. The results of our study indicate that there is no causal association between Se levels and the risk of OP.

,37961337,Fine-mapping causal tissues and genes at disease-associated loci.,medRxiv,"Heritable diseases often manifest in a highly tissue-specific manner, with different disease loci mediated by genes in distinct tissues or cell types. We propose Tissue-Gene Fine-Mapping (TGFM), a fine-mapping method that infers the posterior probability (PIP) for each gene-tissue pair to mediate a disease locus by analyzing GWAS summary statistics (and in-sample LD) and leveraging eQTL data from diverse tissues to build cis-predicted expression models; TGFM also assigns PIPs to causal variants that are not mediated by gene expression in assayed genes and tissues. TGFM accounts for both co-regulation across genes and tissues and LD between SNPs (generalizing existing fine-mapping methods), and incorporates genome-wide estimates of each tissue's contribution to disease as tissue-level priors. TGFM was well-calibrated and moderately well-powered in simulations; unlike previous methods, TGFM was able to attain correct calibration by modeling uncertainty in cis-predicted expression models. We applied TGFM to 45 UK Biobank diseases/traits (averageN=316K) using eQTL data from 38 GTEx tissues. TGFM identified an average of 147 PIP > 0.5 causal genetic elements per disease/trait, of which 11% were gene-tissue pairs. Implicated gene-tissue pairs were concentrated in known disease-critical tissues, and causal genes were strongly enriched in disease-relevant gene sets. Causal gene-tissue pairs identified by TGFM recapitulated known biology (e.g.,TPO-thyroid for Hypothyroidism), but also included biologically plausible novel findings (e.g.,SLC20A2-artery aorta for Diastolic blood pressure). Further application of TGFM to single-cell eQTL data from 9 cell types in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), analyzed jointly with GTEx tissues, identified 30 additional causal gene-PBMC cell type pairs at PIP > 0.5-primarily for autoimmune disease and blood cell traits, including the well-established role ofCTLA4in CD8+T cells for All autoimmune disease. In conclusion, TGFM is a robust and powerful method for fine-mapping causal tissues and genes at disease-associated loci.",1.3E-19

Regardless, a small proportion of cancer patients recur even after therapy, suggesting more specific molecular tools are required to justify the stage-specific detection and prompt cancer diagnosis. Thus, we aimed to explore the blood-based DNA methylation signature of metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) to establish a holistic methylation biomarker panel. For the identification of methylation signature, the EPIC BeadChip-based array was performed. Comparative analysis for identifying unique probes, validation, and functional studies was investigated by analyzing GEO and TCGA datasets. We observed 4093 differentially methylated probes (DMPs), 1232 hydroxymethylated probes, and 25 CpG islands. Gene expression study revealed both upregulated and downregulated genes. Correlation analysis suggested a positive (with a positive r, p???0.05) and negative (with a negative r, p???0.05) association with different cancers. TFBS analysis exhibited the binding site for many TFs. Furthermore, gene enrichment analysis indicated the involvement of those identified genes in biological pathways. However, blood-based DNA methylation data uncovered a distinct DNA methylation pattern, which might have an additive role in NPC progression by altering the TFs binding. Moreover, based on tissue-specificity, a variation of correlation between methylation and gene expression was noted in different cancers.© 2023. The Author(s).",1.26E-19

However, we still lack a validated baseline predictive biologic signature for the development of more severe disease in both outpatients and inpatients infected with SARS-CoV-2. The objective of this study was to develop and externally validate, via 5 international outpatient and inpatient trials and/or prospective cohort studies, a novel baseline proteomic signature, which predicts the development of moderate or severe (vs mild) disease in patients with COVID-19 from a proteomic analysis of 7000?+?proteins. The secondary objective was exploratory, to identify (1) individual baseline protein levels and/or (2) protein level changes within the first 2 weeks of acute infection that are associated with the development of moderate/severe (vs mild) disease.

We dichotomized 113 patients as having mild or moderate/severe COVID-19 disease. An elastic net approach was used to develop a predictive proteomic signature. For validation, we applied our signature to data from three independent prospective biomarker studies. We found 4110 proteins measured at baseline that significantly differed between patients with mild COVID-19 and those with moderate/severe COVID-19 after adjusting for multiple hypothesis testing.

Effects were comparable after adjusting for EA in the MVMR. UMVR showed bidirectional negative associations between genetic liability to EA and depression and positive associations between genetic liability to EA and BD, with no significant effects on schizophrenia. After accounting for income, MVMR showed a bidirectional positive direction between genetic liability to EA and BD and schizophrenia but not with depression.Our results suggest a heterogeneous link pattern between SES and SMD. We found a negative bidirectional association between genetic liability to income and the risk of schizophrenia and depression. On the contrary, we found a positive bidirectional relationship of genetic liability to EA with schizophrenia and BD, which only becomes apparent after adjusting for income in the case of schizophrenia.These findings shed light on the directional mechanisms between social determinants and mental disorders and suggest that income and EA should be studied separately in relation to mental illness.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023.

In addition, we provide potential drug targets for KSD treatment and insights into shared regulation with other diseases.© 2023. The Author(s).",9.32E-20

Its rapid onset of action, efficacy for treatment-resistant symptoms, and protection against relapse distinguish it from prior antidepressants. Its discovery emerged from a reconceptualization of the neurobiology of depression and, in turn, insights from the elaboration of its mechanisms of action inform studies of the pathophysiology of depression and related disorders. It has been 25 y since we first presented our ketamine findings in depression. Thus, it is timely for this review to consider what we have learned from studies of ketamine and to suggest future directions for the optimization of rapid-acting antidepressant treatment.",8.93E-20

Large population biobanks hold the promise to identify individuals at an elevated risk of AD and related dementias based on health registry information. Here, we establish the protocol for an observational clinical recall and biomarker study called TWINGEN with the aim to identify individuals at high risk of AD by assessing cognition, health and AD-related biomarkers. Suitable candidates were identified and invited to participate in the new study among Finnish biobank donors according to TWINGEN study criteria.A multi-center study (n=800) to obtain blood-based biomarkers, telephone-administered and web-based memory and cognitive parameters, questionnaire information on lifestyle, health and psychological factors, and accelerometer data for measures of physical activity, sedentary behavior and sleep. A sub-cohort are being asked to participate in an in-person neuropsychological assessment (n=200) and wear an Oura ring (n=50). All participants in the TWINGEN study have genome-wide genotyping data and up to 48 years of follow-up data from the population-based older Finnish Twin Cohort (FTC) study of the University of Helsinki. TWINGEN data will be transferred to Finnish Institute of Health and Welfare (THL) biobank and we aim to further to transfer it to the FinnGen study where it will be combined with health registry data for prediction of AD.This recall study consists of FTC/THL/FinnGen participants whose data were acquired in accordance with the Finnish Biobank Act.

,37953923,Open access-enabled evaluation of epigenetic age acceleration in colorectal cancer and development of a classifier with diagnostic potential.,Front Genet,"Aberrant DNA methylation (DNAm) is known to be associated with the aetiology of cancer, including colorectal cancer (CRC). In the past, the availability of open access data has been the main driver of innovative method development and research training. However, this is increasingly being eroded by the move to controlled access, particularly of medical data, including cancer DNAm data. To rejuvenate this valuable tradition, we leveraged DNAm data from 1,845 samples (535 CRC tumours, 522 normal colon tissues adjacent to tumours, 72 colorectal adenomas, and 716 normal colon tissues from healthy individuals) from 14 open access studies deposited in NCBI GEO and ArrayExpress. We calculated each sample's epigenetic age (EA) using eleven epigenetic clock models and derived the corresponding epigenetic age acceleration (EAA). For EA, we observed that most first- and second-generation epigenetic clocks reflect the chronological age in normal tissues adjacent to tumours and healthy individuals [e.g., Horvath (r= 0.77 and 0.79), Zhang elastic net (EN) (r= 0.70 and 0.73)] unlike the epigenetic mitotic clocks (EpiTOC, HypoClock, MiAge) (r< 0.3). For EAA, we used PhenoAge, Wu, and the above mitotic clocks and found them to have distinct distributions in different tissue types, particularly between normal colon tissues adjacent to tumours and cancerous tumours, as well as between normal colon tissues adjacent to tumours and normal colon tissue from healthy individuals. Finally, we harnessed these associations to develop a classifier using elastic net regression (with lasso and ridge regularisations) that predicts CRC diagnosis based on a patient's sex and EAAs calculated from histologically normal controls (i.e., normal colon tissues adjacent to tumours and normal colon tissue from healthy individuals). The classifier demonstrated good diagnostic potential with ROC-AUC = 0.886, which suggests that an EAA-based classifier trained on relevant data could become a tool to support diagnostic/prognostic decisions in CRC for clinical professionals. Our study also reemphasises the importance of open access clinical data for method development and training of young scientists. Obtaining the required approvals for controlled access data would not have been possible in the timeframe of this study.Copyright © 2023 Widayati, Schneider, Panteleeva, Chernysheva, Hrbkova, Beck, Voloshin and Chervova.",8.12E-20

Phase variation is a rapid and reversible switching of gene expression found in many bacterial species, and typically associated with outer-membrane proteins. Phase variation of cytoplasmic DNA methyltransferases has been shown to play important roles in bacterial gene regulation and can act as epigenetic switches, regulating the expression of multiple genes as part of systems called phasevarions (phase-variable regulons). This study characterized two alleles of the ModA phasevarion present inH. influenzaebiogroupaegyptius, ModA13, found in non-BPF causing strains and ModA16, unique to BPF causing isolates. Phase variation of ModA13 and ModA16 led to genome-wide changes to DNA methylation resulting in altered protein expression.

The impact of these pharmacodynamic effects on mortality was also evaluated.Compared with healthy subjects, baseline serum levels of IgM, IgG, and ALC were significantly lower, and ANC, NLR, PCT and CRP significantly higher in sCAP patients (p?<?0.0001). Low Ig concentrations increased with trimodulin. Normalization of ANC (analysis of variance [ANOVA] p?=?0.016) and PCT (ANOVA p?=?0.027) was more rapid with trimodulin compared with placebo. These and other effects were more evident in patients with low baseline IgM levels. Normalization of PCT and CRP levels was both steadier and faster with trimodulin treatment. In patients with low baseline ALC, trimodulin was associated with a lower 28-day all-cause mortality rate (14.5% vs 32.1% in placebo, p?=?0.043) and more ventilator-free days ([VFD]; median VFD: 3.5 vs 11 in placebo, p?=?0.043). These numerical differences were greater if baseline IgM was also low (low ALC, low IgM: 8.1% mortality vs 34.1% placebo, p?=?0.006; 3 VFD vs 15 VFD, p?=?0.009, respectively). Results were consistent in patients with high baseline CRP (low ALC, high CRP: 10.9% mortality vs 34.1% placebo, p?=?0.011).This post hoc pharmacodynamic analysis of a blinded phase II trial suggests that trimodulin compensates for, and more rapidly modifies, the dysregulated inflammatory response seen in sCAP patients. Trimodulin was associated with significantly lower mortality and more VFD in subgroups with high CRP and low ALC. This effect was particularly marked in patients who also had low baseline IgM values. These findings require confirmation in prospective trials.© 2023. The Author(s).",6.34E-20
,38163095,Epigenetic signature of ionizing radiation in therapy-related AML patients.,Heliyon,"Therapy-related acute myeloid leukaemia (t-AML) is a late side effect of previous chemotherapy (ct-AML) and/or radiotherapy (rt-AML) or immunosuppressive treatment. t-AMLs, which account for ?10-20 % of all AML cases, are extremely aggressive and have a poor prognosis compared tode novoAML. Our hypothesis is that exposure to radiation causes genome-wide epigenetic changes in rt-AML. An epigenome-wide association study was undertaken, measuring over 850K methylation sites across the genome from fifteen donors (five healthy, fivede novo, and five t-AMLs). The study predominantly focussed on 94K sites that lie in CpG-rich gene promoter regions. Genome-wide hypomethylation was discovered in AML, primarily in intergenic regions. Additionally, genes specific to AML were identified with promoter hypermethylation. A two-step validation was conducted, both internally, using pyrosequencing to measure methylation levels in specific regions across fifteen primary samples, and externally, with an additional eight AML samples. We demonstrated that theMESTandGATA5gene promoters, which were previously identified as tumour suppressors, were noticeably hypermethylated in rt-AML, as opposed to other subtypes of AML and control samples. These may indicate the epigenetic involvement in the development of rt-AML at the molecular level and could serve as potential targets for drug therapy in rt-AML.Crown Copyright © 2023 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",6.26E-20
,38002940,The Nutriepigenome.,Genes (Basel),"Unlike genetic changes, epigenetics modulates gene expression without stable modification of the genome. Even though all cells, including sperm and egg, have an epigenome pattern, most of these modifications occur during lifetime and interestingly, some of them, are reversible. Lifestyle and especially nutrients as well as diet regimens are presently gaining importance due to their ability to affect the epigenome. On the other hand, since the epigenome profoundly affects gene expression profile it can be speculated that the epigenome could modulate individual response to nutrients. Recent years have thus seen growing interest on nutrients, macronutrients ratio and diet regimens capable to affect the epigenetic pattern. In fact, while genetic alterations are mostly detrimental at the individual level, reshaping the epigenome may be a feasible strategy to positively counteract the detrimental effect of aging. Here, I review nutrient consumption and diet regimens as a possible strategy to counteract aging-driven epigenome derangement.",4.64E-20

Through genome-wide sequencing analysis, we first identified genetic variants associated nominally with ND and then replicated them in an independent sample. Of the six replicated variants, rs148582811 inARVCFlocated in the enhancer-associated marker peak is attractive. The effective-median-based Mendelian randomization analysis indicated thatARVCFis a causal gene for ND. RNA-seq analysis detected decreasedARVCFexpression in smokers compared to nonsmokers. Luciferase reporter assays indicated that rs148582811 and its located DNA fragment allele-specifically regulatedARVCFexpression. Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that transcription factor X-ray repair cross-complementing protein 5 (XRCC5) bound to the DNA fragment containing rs148582811 and allele-specifically regulatedARVCFexpression at the mRNA and protein levels.

Using document analysis this article assesses whether, how and to what extent the common heritage framework is relevant in regulation of human genomic research. The article traces the history of the Human Genome Project to reveal the international community's race against privatization of the human genome and its resulting qualification as the common heritage of humanity. Further, it reviews the archival records of UNESCO's International Bioethics Committee to discover the rationale for qualifying the human genome as common heritage of humankind. The article finds that the common heritage of mankind framework remains relevant to the application of the human genome at the collective level. However, the framework is at odds with the individual dimension of the human genome based on individual personality rights. The article thus argues that the right to benefit from scientific progress and its applications offers an alternative international regulatory framework for human genomic research.Copyright © 2023 Kabata and Thaldar.",3.76E-20

The genetic underpinnings of these patterns remain largely unknown. We apply a stochastic multivariate factorization method to a diverse population of 50,699 individuals (12 studies and 130 sites) and derive data-driven, multi-scale PSCs of regional brain size. PSCs were significantly correlated with 915 genomic loci in the discovery set, 617 of which are newly identified, and 72% were independently replicated. Key pathways influencing PSCs involve reelin signaling, apoptosis, neurogenesis, and appendage development, while pathways of breast cancer indicate potential interplays between brain metastasis and PSCs associated with neurodegeneration and dementia. Using support vector machines, multi-scale PSCs effectively derive imaging signatures of several brain diseases.

Assessing caprine introductions is a complicated task because of their skeletal similarity to endemic wild bovid species and the sparse and fragmentary state of relevant archaeological remains. Palaeoproteomics has previously proved effective in clarifying species attributions in African zooarchaeological materials, but few comparative protein sequences of wild bovid species have been available. Using newly generated type I collagen sequences for wild species, as well as previously published sequences, we assess species attributions for elements originally identified as caprine or 'unidentifiable bovid' from 17 eastern and southern African sites that span seven millennia. We identified over 70% of the archaeological remains and the direct radiocarbon dating of domesticate specimens allows refinement of the chronology of caprine presence in both African regions. These results thus confirm earlier occurrences in eastern Africa and the systematic association of domesticated caprines with wild bovids at all archaeological sites. The combined biomolecular approach highlights repeatability and accuracy of the methods for conclusive contribution in species attribution of archaeological remains in dry African environments.© 2023 The Authors.",2.82E-20

CdCl2at different doses (0, 0.5, 1, 2 mg/kg/day) were dispensed to pregnant SD rats, thus producing generation F1. Adult females in F1 (PND 56) were mated with untreated fertile males so as to produce generation F2. Likewise, adult females in F2 were mated to produce generation F3. Damages to testicular tissue were observed in all the three generations, with serum testosterone (T) increased in F2 and F3. Notably, the genome-wide DNA methylation level in the testicular tissue of F1 was altered, as was the expression of F1-F3 methyltransferases. In addition, the expression of Creb/Crem pathway, a pathway critical for the metamorphosis from postmeiotic round spermatocytes to spermatozoa, was also remarkably altered in the three generations. In concludion, prenatal Cd exposure might bring multigenerational and transgenerational toxic effects to testes via genome-wide DNA methylation and the regulation of CREB/CREM pathway.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

Proposed mechanisms for such alterations in lengths are unequal cross-over between sister chromatids, gene conversion, and break-induced replication. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for the massive, complex, and homogeneous organization of centromeric arrays have not been experimentally validated. Here, we use droplet digital PCR assays to demonstrate that centromeric arrays can expand and contract within ~20 somatic cell divisions of a cell line. We find that the frequency of array variation among single-cell-derived subclones ranges from a minimum of ~7% to a maximum of ~100%. Further clonal evolution revealed that centromere expansion is favored over contraction. We find that the homologous recombination protein RAD52 and the helicase PIF1 are required for extensive array change, suggesting that centromere sequence evolution can occur via break-induced replication.",2.15E-20

One of the limits of the use of this new molecular method during a follow-up is represented by the number of invalid tests in routine practice.A total of 782 patients with a diagnosis of non-muscle-invasive high-grade carcinoma (NMIBC) was studied. The Bladder EpiCheck test (BE) was performed together with cytology in all cases within 1 year after the end of treatment. In 402 patients, the urinary samples were voided urine (UV), while, in 380 cases, the samples were collected after bladder washing (IU). For all the patients with invalid BE results, a second BE test was performed following the instructions for use that indicated the test should be repeated with a new urinary sample in the case of an invalid result.Analyzing the two different groups (UV and IU), we found the invalid BE results seemed to be not related to urinary samples (p= 0.13 Fisher's exact test), suggesting that the collection method was not relevant in order to reduce the number of invalid tests.In the follow-up for NMIBC, for patients for whom a BE test is planned, a combined approach of cytology and a methylation test is recommended in order to repeat the BE test with an invalid result only in those cases with a cytological diagnosis of atypical urothelial cells (AUC) suspicious for high-grade urothelial carcinoma (SHGUC) and high-grade urothelial carcinoma (HGUC).",1.95E-20

The primary goal of this research was to probe the DNAm profile across the genome in the whole blood derived from patients suffering from HT.Using the Illumina 850K BeadChip, we conducted a genome-wide DNAm assessment on 10 matched pairs of HT sufferers and healthy individuals. Genes with differential methylation (DMGs) were identified and underwent functional annotation via the databases of Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes. The transcriptional significance of potential epigenetic biomarker genes was corroborated through qRT-PCR.The DNAm profiling across the genome indicated an overall reduction in methylation in HT subjects in comparison with their healthy counterparts. We detected 283 DMPs (adjusted P < 0.05 and |??| > 0.1), among which 152 exhibited hypomethylation and 131 demonstrated hypermethylation. Further analysis exposed a noteworthy concentration of hypermethylated DMPs in the 3´UTR, North Shore, and CpG islands, while there was a significant decrease in the Open Sea (all P < 0.001). The 283 DMPs were broadly distributed from chromosome 1 to 22, with chromosome 6 harboring the most DMPs (n = 51) and chromosome 12 carrying the most DMGs (n = 15). TheSLFN12gene, which presented with extreme hypomethylation in its promoter DMPs among HT patients, was identified as the epigenetic marker gene. Consequently, theSLFN12mRNA expression was markedly upregulated in HT, displaying a negative relationship with its methylation levels. The area under curve (AUC) value for theSLFN12gene among HT patients was 0.85 (sensitivity: 0.7, specificity: 0.7), a significant difference compared with healthy controls. The methylation levels of all DMPs inSLFN12gene were negatively correlated with TSH and one CpG site (cg24470734) was positively assocciated with FT4.This investigation presents an initial comprehensive DNAm blueprint for individuals with HT, which permits clear differentiation between HT subjects and normal controls through an epigenetic lens. TheSLFN12gene plays a pivotal role in the onset of HT, suggesting that the methylation status of this gene could serve as a potential epigenetic indicator for HT.Copyright © 2023 Zhou, Liu, Chen, Ren, Wan, Chen, He, Wei, Gao, Liu and Shen.",1.66E-20

Here, we present a bisulfite-free single-cell whole-genome 5mC and 5hmC profiling technique, named Cabernet, which can characterize 5mC and 5hmC at single-base resolution with high genomic coverage. Cabernet utilizes Tn5 transposome for DNA fragmentation, which enables the discrimination between different alleles for measuring hemi-methylation status. Using Cabernet, we revealed the 5mC, hemi-5mC and 5hmC dynamics during early mouse embryo development, uncovering genomic regions exclusively governed by active or passive demethylation. We show that hemi-methylation status can be used to distinguish between pre- and post-replication cells, enabling more efficient cell grouping when integrated with 5mC profiles. The property of Tn5 naturally enables Cabernet to achieve high-throughput single-cell methylome profiling, where we probed mouse cortical neurons and embryonic day 7.5 (E7.5) embryos, and constructed the library for thousands of single cells at high efficiency, demonstrating its potential for analyzing complex tissues at substantially low cost.

However, less is known about the specific healthspan-promoting effects of exercise on blood biomarkers in the disease-free population. In this work, we examine 23,237 generally healthy individuals who self-report varying weekly running volumes and compare them to 4,428 generally healthy sedentary individuals, as well as 82 professional endurance runners. We estimate the significance of differences among blood biomarkers for groups of increasing running levels using analysis of variance (ANOVA), adjusting for age, gender, and BMI. We attempt and add insight to our observational dataset analysis via two-sample Mendelian randomization (2S-MR) using large independent datasets. We find that self-reported running volume associates with biomarker signatures of improved wellness, with some serum markers apparently being principally modified by BMI, whereas others show a dose-effect with respect to running volume. We further detect hints of sexually dimorphic serum responses in oxygen transport and hormonal traits, and we also observe a tendency toward pronounced modifications in magnesium status in professional endurance athletes. Thus, our results further characterize blood biomarkers of exercise and metabolic health, particularly regarding dose-effect relationships, and better inform personalized advice for training and performance.Copyright: © 2023 Nogal et al.

,37979581,Assortative mating and parental genetic relatedness contribute to the pathogenicity of variably expressive variants.,Am J Hum Genet,"We examined more than 97,000 families from four neurodevelopmental disease cohorts and the UK Biobank to identify phenotypic and genetic patterns in parents contributing to neurodevelopmental disease risk in children. We identified within- and cross-disorder correlations between six phenotypes in parents and children, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (R = 0.32-0.38, p < 10-126). We also found that measures of sub-clinical autism features in parents are associated with several autism severity measures in children, including biparental mean Social Responsiveness Scale scores and proband Repetitive Behaviors Scale scores (regression coefficient = 0.14, p = 3.38 × 10-4). We further describe patterns of phenotypic similarity between spouses, where spouses show correlations for six neurological and psychiatric phenotypes, including a within-disorder correlation for depression (R = 0.24-0.68, p < 0.001) and a cross-disorder correlation between anxiety and bipolar disorder (R = 0.09-0.22, p < 10-92). Using a simulated population, we also found that assortative mating can lead to increases in disease liability over generations and the appearance of ""genetic anticipation"" in families carrying rare variants. We identified several families in a neurodevelopmental disease cohort where the proband inherited multiple rare variants in disease-associated genes from each of their affected parents. We further identified parental relatedness as a risk factor for neurodevelopmental disorders through its inverse relationship with variant pathogenicity and propose that parental relatedness modulates disease risk by increasing genome-wide homozygosity in children (R = 0.05-0.26, p < 0.05). Our results highlight the utility of assessing parent phenotypes and genotypes toward predicting features in children who carry rare variably expressive variants and implicate assortative mating as a risk factor for increased disease severity in these families.Copyright © 2023 American Society of Human Genetics.

,38130910,Biomarkers of aging through the life course: A Recent Literature Update.,Curr Opin Epidemiol Public Health,"The development of biomarkers of aging has greatly advanced epidemiological studies of aging processes. However, much debate remains on the timing of aging onset and the causal relevance of these biomarkers. In this review, we discuss the most recent biomarkers of aging that have been applied across the life course.The most recently developed aging biomarkers that have been applied across the life course can be designated into three categories: epigenetic clocks, epigenetic markers of chronic inflammation, and mitochondrial DNA copy number. While these have been applied at different life stages, the development, validation, and application of these markers has been largely centered on populations of older adults. Few studies have examined trajectories of aging biomarkers across the life course. As the wealth of molecular and biochemical data increases, emerging biomarkers may be able to capture complex and system-specific aging processes. Recently developed biomarkers include novel epigenetic clocks; clocks based on ribosomal DNA, transcriptomic profiles, proteomics, metabolomics, and inflammatory markers; clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential gene mutations; and multi-omics approaches.Attention should be placed on aging at early and middle life stages to better understand trajectories of aging biomarkers across the life course. Additionally, novel biomarkers will provide greater insight into aging processes. The specific mechanisms of aging reflected by these biomarkers should be considered when interpreting results.",1.03E-20
x,38016990,Plasma proteomic profiles predict individual future health risk.,Nat Commun,"Developing a single-domain assay to identify individuals at high risk of future events is a priority for multi-disease and mortality prevention. By training a neural network, we developed a disease/mortality-specific proteomic risk score (ProRS) based on 1461 Olink plasma proteins measured in 52,006 UK Biobank participants. This integrative score markedly stratified the risk for 45 common conditions, including infectious, hematological, endocrine, psychiatric, neurological, sensory, circulatory, respiratory, digestive, cutaneous, musculoskeletal, and genitourinary diseases, cancers, and mortality. The discriminations witnessed high accuracies achieved by ProRS for 10 endpoints (e.g., cancer, dementia, and death), with C-indexes exceeding 0.80. Notably, ProRS produced much better or equivalent predictive performance than established clinical indicators for almost all endpoints. Incorporating clinical predictors with ProRS enhanced predictive power for most endpoints, but this combination only exhibited limited improvement when compared to ProRS alone. Some proteins, e.g., GDF15, exhibited important discriminative values for various diseases. We also showed that the good discriminative performance observed could be largely translated into practical clinical utility. Taken together, proteomic profiles may serve as a replacement for complex laboratory tests or clinical measures to refine the comprehensive risk assessments of multiple diseases and mortalities simultaneously. Our models were internally validated in the UK Biobank; thus, further independent external validations are necessary to confirm our findings before application in clinical settings.© 2023.

Medical advances have extended our life expectancy, but chronic diseases and geriatric syndrome continue to affect the increasingly aging population. Yet modern medicine perpetuates an approach based on treatment rather than prevention and education. In order to help solve this ever-growing problem, a new discipline has emerged: lifestyle medicine. Nutrition, physical activity, stress management, restorative sleep, social connection, and avoidance of risky substances are the pillars on which lifestyle medicine is founded. The aim of this discipline is to increase healthspan and reduce the duration of morbidity by making changes to our lifestyle. In this review, we propose the use of klotho protein as a novel biomarker for lifestyle medicine in order to quantify and monitor the health status of individuals, as no integrative tool currently exists.",8.39E-21

Adopting a graph adversarial matching strategy, SLAT is the first algorithm capable of aligning heterogenous spatial data across distinct technologies and modalities. Systematic benchmarks demonstrate SLAT's superior precision, robustness, and speed over existing state-of-the-arts.

To efficiently detect spatial structure of interest, an essential step in analyzing such data involves identifying spatially variable genes. Despite researchers having developed several computational methods to accomplish this task, the lack of a comprehensive benchmark evaluating their performance remains a considerable gap in the field. Here, we present a systematic evaluation of 14 methods using 60 simulated datasets generated by four different simulation strategies, 12 real-world transcriptomics, and three spatial ATAC-seq datasets. We find that spatialDE2 consistently outperforms the other benchmarked methods, and Moran's I achieves competitive performance in different experimental settings. Moreover, our results reveal that more specialized algorithms are needed to identify spatially variable peaks.",7.28E-21

We added over 15 Mb of missing sequence to both X chromosomes, 60 Mb to donkey autosomes and corrected numerous errors in donkey and some in horse reference genomes. We resolved functionally important X-linked repeats: the DXZ4 macrosatellite and ampliconic Equine Testis Specific Transcript Y7 (ETSTY7). We pinpointed the location of the pseudoautosomal boundaries (PAB) and determined the size of the horse (1.8 Mb) and donkey (1.88 Mb) pseudoautosomal regions (PARs). We discovered distinct differences in horse and donkey PABs: a testis-expressed gene, XKR3Y, spans horse PAB with exons1-2 located in Y and exon3 in the X-Y PAR, whereas the donkey XKR3Y is Y-specific. DXZ4 had a similar?~?8 kb monomer in both species with 10 copies in horse and 20 in donkey. We assigned hundreds of copies of ETSTY7, a sequence horizontally transferred from Parascaris and massively amplified in equids, to horse and donkey X chromosomes and three autosomes. The findings and products contribute to molecular studies of equid biology and advance research on X-linked conditions, sex chromosome regulation and evolution in equids.© 2023.

Insight into the 3D organization of centromere components would help resolve how centromeres function on the mitotic spindle. We use ChIP-seq and super-resolution microscopy with single particle averaging to examine the geometry of essential centromeric components on human chromosomes. Both modalities suggest cohesin is enriched at pericentromeric DNA. CENP-A localizes to a subset of the ?-satellite DNA, with clusters separated by ~562?nm and a perpendicular intervening ~190?nM wide axis of cohesin in metaphase chromosomes. Differently sized ?-satellite arrays achieve a similar core structure. Here we present a working model for a common core configuration of essential centromeric components that includes CENP-A nucleosomes, ?-satellite DNA and pericentromeric cohesion. This configuration helps reconcile how centromeres function and serves as a foundation to add components of the chromosome segregation machinery.© 2023. The Author(s).",6.76E-21
,37985818,Phenotype integration improves power and preserves specificity in biobank-based genetic studies of major depressive disorder.,Nat Genet,"Biobanks often contain several phenotypes relevant to diseases such as major depressive disorder (MDD), with partly distinct genetic architectures. Researchers face complex tradeoffs between shallow (large sample size, low specificity/sensitivity) and deep (small sample size, high specificity/sensitivity) phenotypes, and the optimal choices are often unclear. Here we propose to integrate these phenotypes to combine the benefits of each. We use phenotype imputation to integrate information across hundreds of MDD-relevant phenotypes, which significantly increases genome-wide association study (GWAS) power and polygenic risk score (PRS) prediction accuracy of the deepest available MDD phenotype in UK Biobank, LifetimeMDD. We demonstrate that imputation preserves specificity in its genetic architecture using a novel PRS-based pleiotropy metric. We further find that integration via summary statistics also enhances GWAS power and PRS predictions, but can introduce nonspecific genetic effects depending on input. Our work provides a simple and scalable approach to improve genetic studies in large biobanks by integrating shallow and deep phenotypes.© 2023. The Author(s).",5.97E-21
,38085182,DNA Conserved in Diverse Animals Since the Precambrian Controls Genes for Embryonic Development.,Mol Biol Evol,"DNA that controls gene expression (e.g. enhancers, promoters) has seemed almost never to be conserved between distantly related animals, like vertebrates and arthropods. This is mysterious, because development of such animals is partly organized by homologous genes with similar complex expression patterns, termed ""deep homology."" Here, we report 25 regulatory DNA segments conserved across bilaterian animals, of which 7 are also conserved in cnidaria (coral and sea anemone). They control developmental genes (e.g. Nr2f, Ptch, Rfx1/3, Sall, Smad6, Sp5, Tbx2/3), including six homeobox genes: Gsx, Hmx, Meis, Msx, Six1/2, and Zfhx3/4. The segments contain perfectly or near-perfectly conserved CCAAT boxes, E-boxes, and other sequences recognized by regulatory proteins. More such DNA conservation will surely be found soon, as more genomes are published and sequence comparison is optimized. This reveals a control system for animal development conserved since the Precambrian.© The Author(s) 2023.

,38110950,The citrate transporter SLC13A5 as a therapeutic target for kidney disease: evidence from Mendelian randomization to inform drug development.,BMC Med,"Solute carrier family 13 member 5 (SLC13A5) is a Na+-coupled citrate co-transporter that mediates entry of extracellular citrate into the cytosol. SLC13A5 inhibition has been proposed as a target for reducing progression of kidney disease. The aim of this study was to leverage the Mendelian randomization paradigm to gain insight into the effects of SLC13A5 inhibition in humans, towards prioritizing and informing clinical development efforts.The primary Mendelian randomization analyses investigated the effect of SLC13A5 inhibition on measures of kidney function, including creatinine and cystatin C-based measures of estimated glomerular filtration rate (creatinine-eGFR and cystatin C-eGFR), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), urine albumin-creatinine ratio (uACR), and risk of chronic kidney disease and microalbuminuria. Secondary analyses included a paired plasma and urine metabolome-wide association study, investigation of secondary traits related to SLC13A5 biology, a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS), and a proteome-wide association study. All analyses were compared to the effect of genetically predicted plasma citrate levels using variants selected from across the genome, and statistical sensitivity analyses robust to the inclusion of pleiotropic variants were also performed. Data were obtained from large-scale genetic consortia and biobanks, with sample sizes ranging from 5023 to 1,320,016 individuals.We found evidence of associations between genetically proxied SLC13A5 inhibition and higher creatinine-eGFR (p?=?0.002), cystatin C-eGFR (p?=?0.005), and lower BUN (p?=?3?×?10-4). Statistical sensitivity analyses robust to the inclusion of pleiotropic variants suggested that these effects may be a consequence of higher plasma citrate levels. There was no strong evidence of associations of genetically proxied SLC13A5 inhibition with uACR or risk of CKD or microalbuminuria. Secondary analyses identified evidence of associations with higher plasma calcium levels (p?=?6?×?10-13) and lower fasting glucose (p?=?0.02). PheWAS did not identify any safety concerns.This Mendelian randomization analysis provides human-centric insight to guide clinical development of an SLC13A5 inhibitor. We identify plasma calcium and citrate as biologically plausible biomarkers of target engagement, and plasma citrate as a potential biomarker of mechanism of action. Our human genetic evidence corroborates evidence from various animal models to support effects of SLC13A5 inhibition on improving kidney function.© 2023. The Author(s).",5.09E-21
,38037131,Comparing methods for constructing and representing human pangenome graphs.,Genome Biol,"As a single reference genome cannot possibly represent all the variation present across human individuals, pangenome graphs have been introduced to incorporate population diversity within a wide range of genomic analyses. Several data structures have been proposed for representing collections of genomes as pangenomes, in particular graphs.In this work, we collect all publicly available high-quality human haplotypes and construct the largest human pangenome graphs to date, incorporating 52 individuals in addition to two synthetic references (CHM13 and GRCh38). We build variation graphs and de Bruijn graphs of this collection using five of the state-of-the-art tools: Bifrost, mdbg, Minigraph, Minigraph-Cactus and pggb. We examine differences in the way each of these tools represents variations between input sequences, both in terms of overall graph structure and representation of specific genetic loci.This work sheds light on key differences between pangenome graph representations, informing end-users on how to select the most appropriate graph type for their application.© 2023.

The genetic contributions to such heterogeneity are not well understood. Here we show several genetic links to clinical heterogeneity in ADHD in a case-only study of 14,084 diagnosed individuals. First, we identify one genome-wide significant locus by comparing cases with ADHD and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) to cases with ADHD but not ASD. Second, we show that cases with ASD and ADHD, substance use disorder and ADHD, or first diagnosed with ADHD in adulthood have unique polygenic score (PGS) profiles that distinguish them from complementary case subgroups and controls. Finally, a PGS for an ASD diagnosis in ADHD cases predicted cognitive performance in an independent developmental cohort. Our approach uncovered evidence of genetic heterogeneity in ADHD, helping us to understand its etiology and providing a model for studies of other disorders.© 2023.

,38143258,Protein-centric omics integration analysis identifies candidate plasma proteins for multiple autoimmune diseases.,Hum Genet,"It remains challenging to translate the findings from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of autoimmune diseases (AIDs) into interventional targets, presumably due to the lack of knowledge on how the GWAS risk variants contribute to AIDs. In addition, current immunomodulatory drugs for AIDs are broad in action rather than disease-specific. We performed a comprehensive protein-centric omics integration analysis to identify AIDs-associated plasma proteins through integrating protein quantitative trait loci datasets of plasma protein (1348 proteins and 7213 individuals) and totally ten large-scale GWAS summary statistics of AIDs under a cutting-edge systematic analytic framework. Specifically, we initially screened out the protein-AID associations using proteome-wide association study (PWAS), followed by enrichment analysis to reveal the underlying biological processes and pathways. Then, we performed both Mendelian randomization (MR) and colocalization analyses to further identify protein-AID pairs with putatively causal relationships. We finally prioritized the potential drug targets for AIDs. A total of 174 protein-AID associations were identified by PWAS. AIDs-associated plasma proteins were significantly enriched in immune-related biological process and pathways, such as inflammatory response (P?=?3.96?×?10-10). MR analysis further identified 97 protein-AID pairs with potential causal relationships, among which 21 pairs were highly supported by colocalization analysis (PP.H4?>?0.75), 10 of 21 were the newly discovered pairs and not reported in previous GWAS analyses. Further explorations showed that four proteins (TLR3, FCGR2A, IL23R, TCN1) have corresponding drugs, and 17 proteins have druggability. These findings will help us to further understand the biological mechanism of AIDs and highlight the potential of these proteins to develop as therapeutic targets for AIDs.© 2023.

,38098682,Updates in Cleft Care.,Semin Plast Surg,"Cleft lip and/or palate is a congenital malformation with a wide range of presentations, and its effective treatment necessitates sustained, comprehensive care across an affected child's life. Early diagnosis, ideally through prenatal imaging or immediately postbirth, is paramount. Access to longitudinal care and long-term follow-up with a multidisciplinary approach, led by the recommendations of the American Cleft Palate Association, is the best way to ensure optimal outcomes. Multiple specialties including plastic surgery, otolaryngology, speech therapy, orthodontists, psychologists, and audiologists all may be indicated in the care of the child. Primary repair of the lip, nose, and palate are generally conducted during infancy. Postoperative care demands meticulous oversight to detect potential complications. If necessary, revisional surgeries should be performed before the child begin primary school. As the child matures, secondary procedures like alveolar bone grafting and orthognathic surgery may be requisite. The landscape of cleft care has undergone significant transformation since early surgical correction, with treatment plans now tailored to the specific type and severity of the cleft. The purpose of this text is to outline the current standards of care in children born with cleft lip and/or palate and to highlight ongoing advancements in the field.Thieme.

Here, we integrated transcriptomes and 46 genetically complex growth traits in a large cross between two strains of the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae. We discovered thousands of genetic correlations between gene expression and growth, suggesting functional connections. Local regulatory variation was a minor source of these genetic correlations. Instead, genetic correlations tended to arise from multiple independenttrans-acting regulatory loci.Trans-acting hotspots that affect the expression of numerous genes accounted for particularly large fractions of genetic growth variation and of genetic correlations between gene expression and growth. Genes with genetic correlations were enriched for similar biological processes across traits, but with heterogeneous direction of effect.

Previous studies have suggested genetic overlap between global cognitive ability and schizophrenia, but further work is needed to delineate the shared genetic architecture. Here, we apply genomic structural equation modelling to identify latent cognitive factors capturing genetic liabilities to 12 cognitive traits measured in the UK Biobank (UKB). We explore the overlap between latent cognitive factors, schizophrenia, and schizophrenia symptom dimensions using a complementary set of statistical approaches, applied to data from the latest schizophrenia genome-wide association study (Ncase = 53,386, Ncontrol = 77,258) and the Thematically Organised Psychosis study (Ncase = 306, Ncontrol = 1060). We identified three broad factors (visuo-spatial, verbal analytic and decision/reaction time) that underly the genetic correlations between the UKB cognitive tests. Global genetic correlations showed a significant but moderate negative genetic correlation between each cognitive factor and schizophrenia. Local genetic correlations implicated unique genomic regions underlying the overlap between schizophrenia and each cognitive factor. We found evidence of substantial polygenic overlap between each cognitive factor and schizophrenia but show that most loci shared between the latent cognitive factors and schizophrenia have unique patterns of association with the cognitive factors. Biological annotation of the shared loci implicated gene-sets related to neurodevelopment and neuronal function. Lastly, we find that the common genetic determinants of the latent cognitive factors are not predictive of schizophrenia symptom dimensions. Overall, these findings inform our understanding of cognitive function in schizophrenia by demonstrating important differences in the shared genetic architecture of schizophrenia and cognitive abilities.",3.17E-21

However, mining and analyzing the xQTLs data presents several significant bioinformatics challenges, particularly when it comes to integration with GWAS data. Here, we developed xQTLbiolinks as the first comprehensive and scalable tool for bulk and single-cell xQTLs data retrieval, quality control and pre-processing from public repositories and our integrated resource. In addition, xQTLbiolinks provided a robust colocalization module through integration with GWAS summary statistics.

The circulating levels of proteins and metabolites reflect the overall state of the human body. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of dapagliflozin on the proteome and metabolome in patients with newly diagnosed T2D.A total of 57 newly diagnosed T2D patients were enrolled, and received 12 weeks of dapagliflozin treatment (10 mg/d, AstraZeneca). Serum proteome and metabolome were investigated at the baseline and after dapagliflozin treatment.Dapagliflozin significantly decreased HbA1c, BMI, and HOMA-IR in T2D patients (all p?<?0.01). Multivariate models indicated clear separations of proteomics and metabolomics data between the baseline and after dapagliflozin treatment. A total of 38 differentially abundant proteins including 23 increased and 15 decreased proteins, and 35 differentially abundant metabolites including 17 increased and 18 decreased metabolites, were identified. In addition to influencing glucose metabolism (glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and pentose phosphate pathway), dapagliflozin significantly increased sex hormone-binding globulin, transferrin receptor protein 1, disintegrin, and metalloprotease-like decysin-1 and apolipoprotein A-IV levels, and decreased complement C3, fibronectin, afamin, attractin, xanthine, and uric acid levels.The circulating proteome and metabolome in newly diagnosed T2D patients were significantly changed after dapagliflozin treatment.

,38124130,A targeted long-read sequencing approach questions the association of OXTR methylation with high-functioning autism.,Clin Epigenetics,"DNA sequence variation and altered epigenetic regulation of the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) have been implicated in autism and autistic-like behaviors. While previous studies have examined subsegments of OXTR, nanopore Cas9-targeted sequencing (nCATS) allows deep characterization of entire genes with simultaneous assessment of epigenetic 5-methylcytosine (5mC) modification and without the need for prior DNA amplification or bisulfite conversion. This pilot study uses an nCATS approach to sequence the entire OXTR gene and its regulatory construct and screen for 5mC modification to compare results between individuals with high-functioning autism (HFA) and neurotypical controls (NC).Using DNA extracted from peripheral blood, OXTR (Hg38, chr3: 8750381-8770434, 20,054 base pairs) was analyzed by nCATS. 5mC modification probabilities were calculated and visualized across the gene and differential methylation analysis was performed.Twenty adults with HFA (10 males, 10 females) and 20 age- and sex-matched NC (±?5 years) were included. There were no apparent group differences in the entire OXTR gene sequence, except for the intron variant rs918316, which was clustered in the HFA group. However, differential methylation analysis did not reveal a single significant group-dependent differentially methylated site among the 412 CpG sites captured.Limitations of this study include the small number of samples due to the pilot nature of the study, which particularly limits the relevance of the sequence variants found. It should also be noted that the use of peripheral blood material limits the ability to draw conclusions about central processes.Previous findings of autism-associated OXTR epigenetic alterations were not reproducible with our method. In our opinion, this may lead to a reconsideration of the relevance of altered methylation at individual OXTR CpG positions in autism research. However, given the pilot nature of the study, these results need to be replicated in independent cohorts and with larger sample sizes.© 2023. The Author(s).",2.66E-21
x,38014125,Methyl-TWAS: A powerful method for in silico transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) using long-range DNA methylation.,bioRxiv,"In silicotranscriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) are commonly used to test whether expression of specific genes is linked to a complex trait. However, genotype-basedin silicoTWAS such as PrediXcan, exhibit low prediction accuracy for a majority of genes because genotypic data lack tissue- and disease-specificity and are not affected by the environment. Because methylation is tissue-specific and, like gene expression, can be modified by environment or disease status, methylation should predict gene expression with more accuracy than SNPs. Therefore, we propose Methyl-TWAS, the first approach that utilizes long-range methylation markers to impute gene expression forin silicoTWAS through penalized regression. Methyl-TWAS 1) predicts epigenetically regulated/associated expression (eGReX), which incorporates tissue-specific expression and both genetically- (GReX) and environmentally-regulated expression to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that could not be identified by genotype-based methods; and 2) incorporates bothcis-andtrans-CpGs, including various regulatory regions to identify DEGs that would be missed usingcis- methylation only. Methyl-TWAS outperforms PrediXcan and two other methods in imputing gene expression in the nasal epithelium, particularly for immunity-related genes and DEGs in atopic asthma. Methyl-TWAS identified 3,681 (85.2%) of the 4,316 DEGs identified in a previous TWAS of atopic asthma using measured expression, while PrediXcan could not identify any gene. Methyl-TWAS also outperforms PrediXcan for expression imputation as well asin silicoTWAS in white blood cells. Methyl-TWAS is a valuable tool forin silicoTWAS, leveraging a growing body of publicly available genome-wide DNA methylation data for a variety of human tissues.",1.97E-21

Previous epidemiologic findings revealed that weight gain, higher body mass index (BMI), smoking, and high insulinemic potential of lifestyle were associated with lower leukocyte mtDNAcn. Carnitines are a group of compounds that play a critical role in energy production. We quantified the associations of plasma L-carnitine levels with leukocyte mtDNAcn. We then examined the association between mtDNAcn and L-carnitine (HMDB0000062) in 538 U.S. men without cancers, diabetes, or cardiovascular disease at blood collection from the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (HPFS). We found a significant inverse association between L-carnitine and mtDNAcn (? = -0.1, P?=?0.02).

,38102128,Maternal dominance contributes to subgenome differentiation in allopolyploid fishes.,Nat Commun,"Teleost fishes, which are the largest and most diverse group of living vertebrates, have a rich history of ancient and recent polyploidy. Previous studies of allotetraploid common carp and goldfish (cyprinids) reported a dominant subgenome, which is more expressed and exhibits biased gene retention. However, the underlying mechanisms contributing to observed 'subgenome dominance' remains poorly understood. Here we report high-quality genomes of twenty-one cyprinids to investigate the origin and subsequent subgenome evolution patterns following three independent allopolyploidy events. We identify the closest extant relatives of the diploid progenitor species, investigate genetic and epigenetic differences among subgenomes, and conclude that observed subgenome dominance patterns are likely due to a combination of maternal dominance and transposable element densities in each polyploid. These findings provide an important foundation to understanding subgenome dominance patterns observed in teleost fishes, and ultimately the role of polyploidy in contributing to evolutionary innovations.© 2023.

Identification of new proteins involved in this process is essential to understand how DNA lesions accumulate in cancer cells and how they tolerate them. Here, we show that human GNL3/nucleostemin, a GTP-binding protein localized mostly in the nucleolus and highly expressed in cancer cells, prevents nuclease-dependent resection of nascent DNA in response to replication stress. We demonstrate that inhibiting origin firing reduces resection. This suggests that the heightened replication origin activation observed upon GNL3 depletion largely drives the observed DNA resection probably due to the exhaustion of the available RPA pool. We show that GNL3 and DNA replication initiation factor ORC2 interact in the nucleolus and that the concentration of GNL3 in the nucleolus is required to limit DNA resection. We propose that the control of origin firing by GNL3 through the sequestration of ORC2 in the nucleolus is critical to prevent nascent DNA resection in response to replication stress.© 2023 The Authors.

Genomic- and epigenetic wide association studies provide insights into the genetic susceptibility and potential underlying disease pathogenesis. This study sought to functionally characterise an AD-associated single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located deep intronic of the tight junction protein 2 (TJP2) gene (9q21.11 locus), identified through a genome-wide association study (GWAS).The association between the 9q21.11 locus (rs7872806) and AD was identified through a GWAS of 956 cases and 723 controls. TJP2 expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was assessed against the rs7872806 genotypes. Allele-specific methylation was evaluated at CpG sites 10kb up- and down-stream of the 9q21.11 locus. Effects of DNA methylation on TJP2 expression was validated via in vitro methylation and 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine-induced transcriptional activation studies. Trans-epidermal water loss measurements were used to determine skin barrier function.The major allele of rs7872806 was determined to increase AD risk by 2.64-fold (adjusted p-value=2.40 x 10-18, OR=0.38), associated with increased methylation levels at cg13920460 site (p<0.001) and lower TJP2 expression in PBMCs (Pearson's p=1.09 x 10-6, Pearson's R=-0.313, p<0.001). Methylation inhibition by 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine increased TJP2 promoter activity by up to 85%. Elimination of the cg13920460 methylation site increased expression by approximately 25%. The rs7872806 major allele was also found to be associated with increased trans-epidermal water loss (p<0.001).Epigenetic influence at CpG site cg13920460 is associated with rs7872806 located deep intronic at 9q21.11. The SNP confers susceptibility to AD through altering TJP2 expression and promoting trans-epidermal water loss.",1.52E-21
,38046097,TaxaHFE: a machine learning approach to collapse microbiome datasets using taxonomic structure.,Bioinform Adv,"Biologists increasingly turn to machine learning models not just to predict, but to explain. Feature reduction is a common approach to improve both the performance and interpretability of models. However, some biological datasets, such as microbiome data, are inherently organized in a taxonomy, but these hierarchical relationships are not leveraged during feature reduction. We sought to design a feature engineering algorithm to exploit relationships in hierarchically organized biological data.We designed an algorithm, called TaxaHFE, to collapse information-poor features into their higher taxonomic levels. We applied TaxaHFE to six previously published datasets and found, on average, a 90% reduction in the number of features (SD?=?5.1%) compared to using the most complete taxonomy. Using machine learning to compare the most resolved taxonomic level (i.e. species) against TaxaHFE-preprocessed features, models based on TaxaHFE features achieved an average increase of 3.47% in receiver operator curve area under the curve. Compared to other hierarchical feature engineering implementations, TaxaHFE introduces the novel ability to consider both categorical and continuous response variables to inform the feature set collapse. Importantly, we find TaxaHFE's ability to reduce hierarchically organized features to a more information-rich subset increases the interpretability of models.TaxaHFE is available as a Docker image and as R code at https://github.com/aoliver44/taxaHFE.Published by Oxford University Press 2023.",1.44E-21
,38036792,A mutation rate model at the basepair resolution identifies the mutagenic effect of polymerase III transcription.,Nat Genet,"De novo mutations occur at substantially different rates depending on genomic location, sequence context and DNA strand. The success of methods to estimate selection intensity, infer demographic history and map rare disease genes, depends strongly on assumptions about the local mutation rate. Here we present Roulette, a genome-wide mutation rate model at basepair resolution that incorporates known determinants of local mutation rate. Roulette is shown to be more accurate than existing models. We use Roulette to refine the estimates of population growth within Europe by incorporating the full range of human mutation rates. The analysis of significant deviations from the model predictions revealed a tenfold increase in mutation rate in nearly all genes transcribed by polymerase III (Pol III), suggesting a new mutagenic mechanism. We also detected an elevated mutation rate within transcription factor binding sites restricted to sites actively used in testis and residing in promoters.© 2023.

It is a big challenge for us to predict fetal clinical outcomes with these chromosome abnormalities because of their highly heterogeneous clinical manifestations and limited phenotype attainable by ultrasound.Amniotic fluid samples were collected from four cases. Karyotype, chromosome microarray analysis, short tandem repeats, and whole exome sequencing were adopted to analyze fetal chromosomal aneuploidy, UPD, and gene variation. Meanwhile, CNVseq analysis proceeded for cultured and uncultured amniocytes in case 2 and case 4 and MS-MLPA for chr11 and chr15 in case 3.All four fetuses showed mosaic chromosomal aneuploidy and UPD simultaneously. The results were: Case 1: T2(7%) and UPD(2)mat(12%). Case 2: T15(60%) and UPD(15)mat(40%). Case 3: 45,X(13%) and genome-wide paternal UPD(20%). Case 4: <10% of T20 and >?90% UPD(20)mat in uncultured amniocyte. By analyzing their formation mechanism of mosaic chromosomal aneuploidy and UPD, at least two adverse genetic events happened during their meiosis and mitosis. The fetus of case 1 presented a benign with a normal intrauterine phenotype, consistent with a low proportion of trisomy cells. However, the other three fetuses had adverse pregnancy outcomes, resulting from the UPD chromosomes with imprinted regions involved or a higher level of mosaic aneuploidy.UPD is often present with mosaic aneuploidy. It is necessary to analyze them simultaneously using a whole battery of analyses for these cases when their chromosomes with imprinted regions are involved or known carriers of a recessive allele. Fetal clinical outcomes were related to the affected chromosomes aneuploidy and UPD, mosaic levels and tissues, methylation status, and homozygous variation of recessive genes on the UPD chromosome. Genetic counseling for pregnant women with such fetuses is crucial to make informed choices.© 2023. The Author(s).",1.23E-21
,37978512,Assessing the causal effect of genetically predicted metabolites and metabolic pathways on stroke.,J Transl Med,"Stroke is a common neurological disorder that disproportionately affects middle-aged and elderly individuals, leading to significant disability and mortality. Recently, human blood metabolites have been discovered to be useful in unraveling the underlying biological mechanisms of neurological disorders. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the causal relationship between human blood metabolites and susceptibility to stroke.Summary data from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of serum metabolites and stroke and its subtypes were obtained separately. A total of 486 serum metabolites were used as the exposure. Simultaneously, 11 different stroke phenotypes were set as the outcomes, including any stroke (AS), any ischemic stroke (AIS), large artery stroke (LAS), cardioembolic stroke (CES), small vessel stroke (SVS), lacunar stroke (LS), white matter hyperintensities (WMH), intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), transient ischemic attack (TIA), and brain microbleeds (BMB). A two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study was conducted to investigate the causal effects of serum metabolites on stroke and its subtypes. The inverse variance-weighted MR analyses were conducted as causal estimates, accompanied by a series of sensitivity analyses to evaluate the robustness of the results. Furthermore, a reverse MR analysis was conducted to assess the potential for reverse causation. Additionally, metabolic pathway analysis was performed using the web-based MetOrigin.After correcting for the false discovery rate (FDR), MR analysis results revealed remarkable causative associations with 25 metabolites. Further sensitivity analyses confirmed that only four causative associations involving three specific metabolites passed all sensitivity tests, namely ADpSGEGDFXAEGGGVR* for AS (OR: 1.599, 95% CI 1.283-1.993, p?=?2.92?×?10-5) and AIS (OR: 1.776, 95% CI 1.380-2.285, p?=?8.05?×?10-6), 1-linoleoylglycerophosph-oethanolamine* for LAS (OR: 0.198, 95% CI 0.091-0.428, p?=?3.92?×?10-5), and gamma-glutamylmethionine* for SAH (OR: 3.251, 95% CI 1.876-5.635, p?=?2.66?×?10-5), thereby demonstrating a high degree of stability. Moreover, eight causative associations involving seven other metabolites passed both sensitivity tests and were considered robust. The association result of one metabolite (glutamate for LAS) was considered non-robust. As for the remaining metabolites, we speculate that they may potentially possess underlying causal relationships. Notably, no common metabolites emerged from the reverse MR analysis. Moreover, after FDR correction, metabolic pathway analysis identified 40 significant pathways across 11 stroke phenotypes.The identified metabolites and their associated metabolic pathways are promising circulating metabolic biomarkers, holding potential for their application in stroke screening and preventive strategies within clinical settings.© 2023.

,38128790,Preliminary Study on Whole Genome Methylation and Transcriptomics in Age-Related Cataracts.,Gene,"DNA methylation plays an important role in the occurrence and development of age-related cataracts (ARC). This study aims to reveal potential epigenetic biomarkers of ARC by detecting modifications to the DNA methylation patterns of genes shown to be related to ARC by transcriptomics. The MethylationEPIC BeadChip (850K) was used to analyze the DNA methylation levels in ARC patients and unaffected controls, and the Pearson correlation test was used to perform genome-wide integration analysis of DNA methylation and transcriptome data. The Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases were used to perform functional analysis of the whole genome, promoter regions (TSS1500/TSS200), and the associated differentially methylated genes (DMG). Pyrosequencing was used to verify the methylation levels of the selected genes. The results showed that, compared with the control group, a total of 52,705 differentially methylated sites were detected in the ARC group, of which 13,858 were hypermethylated and 38,847 were hypomethylated. GO and KEGG analyses identified functions related to the cell membrane, the calcium signaling pathway, and their possible molecular mechanisms. Then, 57 DMGs with negative promoter methylation correlations were screened by association analysis. Pyrosequencing verified that the ARC group had higher methylation levels of C3 and CCKAR and lower methylation levels of NLRP3, LEFTY1, and GPR35 compared with the control group. In summary, our study reveals the whole-genome DNA methylation patterns and gene expression profiles in ARC, and the molecular markers of methylation identified herein may aid in the prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of ARC.Copyright © 2023.

,38111603,Altered dietary behaviour during pregnancy impacts systemic metabolic phenotypes.,Front Nutr,"Evidence suggests consumption of a Mediterranean diet (MD) can positively impact both maternal and offspring health, potentially mediated by a beneficial effect on inflammatory pathways. We aimed to apply metabolic profiling of serum and urine samples to assess differences between women who were stratified into high and low alignment to a MD throughout pregnancy and investigate the relationship of the diet to inflammatory markers.From the ORIGINS cohort, 51 pregnant women were stratified for persistent high and low alignment to a MD, based on validated MD questionnaires.1H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was used to investigate the urine and serum metabolite profiles of these women at 36?weeks of pregnancy. The relationship between diet, metabolite profile and inflammatory status was investigated.There were clear differences in both the food choice and metabolic profiles of women who self-reported concordance to a high (HMDA) and low (LMDA) Mediterranean diet, indicating that alignment with the MD was associated with a specific metabolic phenotype during pregnancy. Reduced meat intake and higher vegetable intake in the HMDA group was supported by increased levels of urinary hippurate (p?=?0.044) and lower creatine (p?=?0.047) levels. Serum concentrations of the NMR spectroscopic inflammatory biomarkers GlycA (p?=?0.020) and GlycB (p?=?0.016) were significantly lower in the HDMA group and were negatively associated with serum acetate, histidine and isoleucine (p?<?0.05) suggesting a greater level of plant-based nutrients in the diet. Serum branched chain and aromatic amino acids were positively associated with the HMDA group while both urinary and serum creatine, urine creatinine and dimethylamine were positively associated with the LMDA group.Metabolic phenotypes of pregnant women who had a high alignment with the MD were significantly different from pregnant women who had a poor alignment with the MD. The metabolite profiles aligned with reported food intake. Differences were most significant biomarkers of systemic inflammation and selected gut-microbial metabolites. This research expands our understanding of the mechanisms driving health outcomes during the perinatal period and provides additional biomarkers for investigation in pregnant women to assess potential health risks.Copyright © 2023 Rowley, Lodge, Egan, Itsiopoulos, Christophersen, Silva, Kicic-Starcevich, OSullivan, Wist, Nicholson, Frost, Holmes and DVaz.",1.06E-21
,38077078,Ancient AMY1 gene duplications primed the amylase locus for adaptive evolution upon the onset of agriculture.,bioRxiv,"Starch digestion is a cornerstone of human nutrition. The amylase enzyme, which digests starch, plays a key role in starch metabolism. Indeed, the copy number of the human amylase gene has been associated with metabolic diseases and adaptation to agricultural diets. Previous studies suggested that duplications of the salivary amylase gene are of recent origin. In the course of characterizing 51 distinct amylase haplotypes across 98 individuals employing long-read DNA sequencing and optical mapping methods, we detected four 31mers linked to duplication of the amylase locus. Analyses with these 31mers suggest that the first duplication of the amylase locus occurred more than 700,000 years ago before the split between modern humans and Neanderthals. After the original duplication events, amplification of theAMY1genes likely occurred via nonallelic homologous recombination in a manner that consistently results in an odd number of copies per chromosome. These findings suggest that amylase haplotypes may have been primed for bursts of natural-selection associated duplications that coincided with the incorporation of starch into human diets.",9.64E-22
,38146362,Large-scale genome-wide association study to identify causal relationships and potential mediators between education and autoimmune diseases.,Front Immunol,"Epidemiological studies suggested a potential connection between education and autoimmune disorders. This study investigated the possible cause-and-effect relationship using a Mendelian randomization approach.We explored the causality between four education traits (n = 257,841~1,131,881) and 22 autoimmune diseases. The mediating role of smoking (632,802 individuals), BMI (681,275 individuals), alcohol (335,394 individuals), and income (397,751 individuals) was also investigated. Transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) and enriched signaling pathways analysis were used to investigate the underlying biological mechanisms.Especially, higher cognitive performance was protective for psoriasis (odds ratio (OR) = 0.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.60-0.79,p= 6.12×10-8), rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (OR = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.67-0.83,p= 4.62×10-6), and hypothyroidism (OR = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.77-0.90,p= 9.82×10-6). Higher levels of educational attainment decreased risks of psoriasis (OR = 0.61, 95% CI = 0.52-0.72,p= 1.12×10-9), RA (OR = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.59-0.79,p= 1.56×10-7), and hypothyroidism (OR = 0.80, 95% CI = 0.72-0.88,p= 5.00×10-6). The completion of highest-level math class genetically downregulates the incidence of psoriasis (OR = 0.66, 95% CI = 0.58-0.76,p= 2.47×10-9), RA (OR = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.63-0.81,p= 5.28×10-8), and hypothyroidism (OR = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.79-0.92,p= 8.88×10-5). Higher self-reported math ability showed protective effects on Crohn's disease (CD) (OR = 0.67, 95% CI = 0.55-0.81,p= 4.96×10-5), RA (OR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.67-0.87,p= 5.21×10-5), and psoriasis (OR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.65-0.88,p= 4.08×10-4). Protein modification and localization, response to arsenic-containing substances may participate in the genetic association of cognitive performance on UC, RA, psoriasis, and hypothyroidism. According to mediation analyses, BMI, smoking, and income served as significant mediators in the causal connection between educational traits and autoimmune diseases.Higher levels of education-related factors have a protective effect on the risk of several autoimmune disorders. Reducing smoking and BMI and promoting income equality can mitigate health risks associated with low education levels.Copyright © 2023 Li, Zhang, Wen, Liu, Liu and Li.",9.06E-22
,38023347,Getting it right: Teaching undergraduate biology to undermine racial essentialism.,Biol Methods Protoc,"How we teach human genetics matters for social equity. The biology curriculum appears to be a crucial locus of intervention for either reinforcing or undermining students' racial essentialist views. The Mendelian genetic models dominating textbooks, particularly in combination with racially inflected language sometimes used when teaching about monogenic disorders, can increase middle and high school students' racial essentialism and opposition to policies to increase equity. These findings are of particular concern given the increasing spread of racist misinformation online and the misappropriation of human genomics research by white supremacists, who take advantage of low levels of genetics literacy in the general public. Encouragingly, however, teaching updated information about the geographical distribution of human genetic variation and the complex, multifactorial basis of most human traits, reduces students' endorsement of racial essentialism. The genetics curriculum is therefore a key tool in combating misinformation and scientific racism. Here, we describe a framework and example teaching materials for teaching students key concepts in genetics, human evolutionary history, and human phenotypic variation at the undergraduate level. This framework can be flexibly applied in biology and anthropology classes and adjusted based on time availability. Our goal is to provide undergraduate-level instructors with varying levels of expertise with a set of evidence-informed tools for teaching human genetics to combat scientific racism, including an evolving set of instructional resources, as well as learning goals and pedagogical approaches. Resources can be found at https://noto.li/YIlhZ5.

,38132357,The Impact of Apolipoprotein E (APOE) Epigenetics on Aging and Sporadic Alzheimer's Disease.,Biology (Basel),"Sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) derives from an interplay among environmental factors and genetic variants, while epigenetic modifications have been expected to affect the onset and progression of its complex etiopathology. Carriers of one copy of the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE)?4allele have a 4-fold increased AD risk, whileAPOE ?4/?4-carriers have a 12-fold increased risk of developing AD in comparison with theAPOE ?3-carriers. The main longevity factor is the homozygousAPOE?3/?3 genotype. In the present narrative review article, we summarized and described the role ofAPOEepigenetics in aging and AD pathophysiology. It is not fully understood howAPOEvariants may increase or decrease AD risk, but this gene may affect tau- and amyloid-mediated neurodegeneration directly or indirectly, also by affecting lipid metabolism and inflammation. For sporadic AD, epigenetic regulatory mechanisms may control and influenceAPOEexpression in response to external insults. Diet, a major environmental factor, has been significantly associated with physical exercise, cognitive function, and the methylation level of several cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) dinucleotide sites ofAPOE.",7.26E-22

However, no current single-cell DNA sequencing (scDNA-seq) technology produces accurate measurements of both SNVs and CNAs, complicating the inference of tumor phylogenies. We introduce a new evolutionary model, the constrained k-Dollo model, that uses SNVs as phylogenetic markers but constrains losses of SNVs according to clusters of cells.

In birds, red blood cells (RBCs) offer a minimally invasive method to estimate metabolic rate (MR). In this study with European starlingsSturnus vulgaris, we examined how RBC oxygen consumption relates to oxygen use in key tissues (brain, liver, heart, and pectoral muscle) and versus the whole organism measured at basal levels. The pectoral muscle accounted for 34%-42% of organismal MR, while the heart and liver, despite their high mass-specific metabolic rate, each contributed 2.5%-3.0% to organismal MR. Despite its low contribution to organismal MR (0.03%-0.04%), RBC MR best predicted organismal MR (r = 0.70). Oxygen consumption of the brain and pectoralis was also associated with whole-organism MR, unlike that of heart and liver. Overall, our findings demonstrate that the metabolism of a systemic tissue like blood is a superior proxy for organismal energy metabolism than that of other tissues.© 2023 The Author(s).",6.69E-22

The ERAP2 gene is highly polymorphic and encodes haplotypes that confer resistance against lethal infectious diseases, but also increase the risk for autoimmune disorders. Identifying how ERAP2 influences susceptibility to these traits requires an understanding of the selective pressures that shaped and maintained allelic variation throughout human evolution. Our review discusses the genetic regulation of haplotypes and diversity in naturally occurring ERAP2 allotypes in the global population. We outline how these ERAP2 haplotypes evolved during human history and highlight the presence of Neanderthal DNA sequences in ERAP2 of modern humans. Recent evidence suggests that human adaptation during the last ~10,000 years and historic pandemics left a significant mark on the ERAP2 gene that determines susceptibility to infectious and inflammatory diseases today.© 2023.

We leveraged rectal mucosa to identify patients who harbor CRC field carcinogenesis by evaluating chromatin 3D architecture. Supranucleosomal disordered chromatin chains (~5-20 nm, ~1 kbp) fold into chromatin packing domains (~100-200 nm, ~100-1,000 kbp). In turn, the fractal-like conformation of DNA within chromatin domains and the folding of the genome into packing domains has been shown to influence multiple facets of gene transcription, including the transcriptional plasticity of cancer cells. We deployed an optical spectroscopic nanosensing technique, chromatin-sensitive partial wave spectroscopic microscopy (csPWS), to evaluate the packing density scaling D of the chromatin chain conformation within packing domains from rectal mucosa in 256 patients with varying degrees of progression to colorectal cancer. We found average packing scaling D of chromatin domains was elevated in tumor cells, histologically normal-appearing cells 4 cm proximal to the tumor, and histologically normal-appearing rectal mucosa compared to cells from control patients (p<0.001). Nuclear D had a robust correlation with the model of 5-year risk of CRC with r2=0.94. Furthermore, rectal D was evaluated as a screening biomarker for patients with advanced adenomas presenting an AUC of 0.85 and 85% sensitivity and specificity.

Over half of eQTL genes exhibited at least two eQTL signals. Compared to primary signals, non-primary signals had lower effect sizes, lower minor allele frequencies, and less promoter enrichment; they corresponded to genes with higher heritability and higher tolerance for loss of function. Colocalization of eQTL with conditionally distinct genome-wide association study signals for 28 cardiometabolic traits identified 3,605 eQTL signals for 1,861 genes. Inclusion of non-primary eQTL signals increased colocalized signals by 46%. Among 30 genes with ?2 pairs of colocalized signals, 21 showed a mediating gene dosage effect on the trait.

Current research focused on genetic variant-to-function experiments aims to identify molecular QTLs, but the lack of data from genetically diverse individuals has limited analyses to mostly populations of European ancestry. Although some efforts have been established to increase diversity in functional genomic studies, much remains to be done to consistently generate data for underrepresented populations from now on. We discuss the major barriers for this continuity and suggest actionable insights, aiming to empower research and researchers from underserved populations.Copyright © 2023 American Society of Human Genetics.

T2D in adolescence appears to be increasing in prevalence over the past several decades, necessitating studies to understand for the onset of the disease to occur early in the lifespan. Given the high burden of disease, specifically in young African American adolescents, our study chose to focus initially on feasibility of recruitment of this population.Data was collected at a single study center at Children's of Alabama. The protocol was completed as part of routine care or at a study visit. The study team was able to leverage the Electronic Medical Record to prescreen eligible patients to discuss the study. A variety of times of day were utilized to improve likely of success with reaching potential participants. Inclusion criteria for patients with T2D was focused on the adolescent population (ages 12-18 years), with no history of an obesity syndrome. DNA methylation age will be calculated using the EPIC 850K array. Statistical analysis will be done using linear regression analysis, adjusting for covariates.This study's aim was to screen and enroll young African American adolescents for a study investigating epigenetic aging and T2D. Our study found that more direct contact (face-to-face- or phone call) improve success of recruitment. Leveraging the electronic medical record also helped improve success with pre-screening participants. Challenges included recruiting participants who might come from long distances to a tertiary care center. Consolidating appointments helped improve the success of reaching these participants. Other challenges included frequent address changes and changed phone numbers. Close attention to the barriers as well as the successes will aid in understanding effective strategies for this important population.© 2023 The Authors.

We leveraged rectal mucosa to identify patients who harbor CRC field carcinogenesis by evaluating chromatin 3D architecture. Supranucleosomal disordered chromatin chains (~ 5-20 nm, ~ 1 kbp) fold into chromatin packing domains (~ 100-200 nm, ~ 100-1,000 kbp). In turn, the fractal-like conformation of DNA within chromatin domains and the folding of the genome into packing domains has been shown to influence multiple facets of gene transcription, including the transcriptional plasticity of cancer cells. We deployed an optical spectroscopic nanosensing technique, chromatin-sensitive partial wave spectroscopic microscopy (csPWS), to evaluate the packing density scaling D of the chromatin chain conformation within packing domains from rectal mucosa in 256 patients with varying degrees of progression to colorectal cancer. We found average packing scaling D of chromatin domains was elevated in tumor cells, histologically normal-appearing cells 4 cm proximal to the tumor, and histologically normal-appearing rectal mucosa compared to cells from control patients (p < 0.001). Nuclear D had a robust correlation with the model of 5-year risk of CRC with r2 = 0.94. Furthermore, rectal D was evaluated as a screening biomarker for patients with advanced adenomas presenting an AUC of 0.85 and 85% sensitivity and specificity. Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enhanced csPWS improved diagnostic performance with AUC = 0.90. Considering the low sensitivity of existing CRC tests, including liquid biopsies, to early-stage cancers our work highlights the potential of chromatin biomarkers of field carcinogenesis in detecting early, significant precancerous colon lesions.",2.37E-22

Understanding the source of cfDNA and mechanisms of release is crucial for designing and interpreting cfDNA-based liquid biopsy assays. Using cell type-specific methylation markers as well as genome-wide methylation analysis, we determine that megakaryocytes, the precursors of anuclear platelets, are major contributors to cfDNA (~26%), while erythroblasts contribute 1-4% of cfDNA in healthy individuals. Surprisingly, we discover that platelets contain genomic DNA fragments originating in megakaryocytes, contrary to the general understanding that platelets lack genomic DNA. Megakaryocyte-derived cfDNA is increased in pathologies involving increased platelet production (Essential Thrombocythemia, Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura) and decreased upon reduced platelet production due to chemotherapy-induced bone marrow suppression. Similarly, erythroblast cfDNA is reflective of erythrocyte production and is elevated in patients with thalassemia. Megakaryocyte- and erythroblast-specific DNA methylation patterns can thus serve as biomarkers for pathologies involving increased or decreased thrombopoiesis and erythropoiesis, which can aid in determining the etiology of aberrant levels of erythrocytes and platelets.© 2023.

,38039139,TsImpute: an accurate two-step imputation method for single-cell RNA-seq data.,Bioinformatics,"Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology has enabled discovering gene expression patterns at single cell resolution. However, due to technical limitations, there are usually excessive zeros, called ""dropouts,"" in scRNA-seq data, which may mislead the downstream analysis. Therefore, it is crucial to impute these dropouts to recover the biological information.We propose a two-step imputation method called tsImpute to impute scRNA-seq data. At the first step, tsImpute adopts zero-inflated negative binomial distribution to discriminate dropouts from true zeros and performs initial imputation by calculating the expected expression level. At the second step, it conducts clustering with this modified expression matrix, based on which the final distance weighted imputation is performed. Numerical results based on both simulated and real data show that tsImpute achieves favorable performance in terms of gene expression recovery, cell clustering, and differential expression analysis.The R package of tsImpute is available at https://github.com/ZhengWeihuaYNU/tsImpute.© The Author(s) 2023.

To aid in overcoming this limitation, we measured gene expression using RNA sequencing in lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) from 599 individuals from six African populations to identify novel transcripts including those not represented in the hg38 reference genome. We used whole genomes from the 1000 Genomes Project and 164 Maasai individuals to identify 8,881 expression and 6,949 splicing quantitative trait loci (eQTLs/sQTLs), and 2,611 structural variants associated with gene expression (SV-eQTLs). We further profiled chromatin accessibility using ATAC-Seq in a subset of 100 representative individuals, to identity chromatin accessibility quantitative trait loci (caQTLs) and allele-specific chromatin accessibility, and provide predictions for the functional effect of 78.9 million variants on chromatin accessibility. Using this map of eQTLs and caQTLs we fine-mapped GWAS signals for a range of complex diseases. Combined, this work expands global functional genomic data to identify novel transcripts, functional elements and variants, understand population genetic history of molecular quantitative trait loci, and further resolve the genetic basis of multiple human traits and disease.",1.82E-22

However, the postnatal development and aging of the dentate gyrus throughout the human lifespan has yet to be fully characterized in the same molecular and spatial detail as other species. Here, we generated a spatially-resolved molecular atlas of the dentate gyrus in postmortem human tissue using the 10x Genomics Visium platform to retain extranuclear transcripts and identify changes in molecular topography across the postnatal lifespan. We found enriched expression of extracellular matrix markers during infancy and increased expression of GABAergic cell-type markersGAD1, LAMP5,andCCKafter infancy. While we identified a conserved gene signature for mouse neuroblasts in the granule cell layer (GCL), many of those genes are not specific to the GCL, and we found no evidence of signatures for other granule cell lineage stages at the GCL post-infancy. We identified a wide-spread hippocampal aging signature and an age-dependent increase in neuroinflammation associated genes. Our findings suggest major changes to the putative neurogenic niche after infancy and identify molecular foci of brain aging in glial and neuropil enriched tissue.",1.79E-22
,37974509,Benchmarking of local genetic correlation estimation methods using summary statistics from genome-wide association studies.,Brief Bioinform,"Local genetic correlation evaluates the correlation of additive genetic effects between different traits across the same genetic variants at a genomic locus. It has been proven informative for understanding the genetic similarities of complex traits beyond that captured by global genetic correlation calculated across the whole genome. Several summary-statistics-based approaches have been developed for estimating local genetic correlation, including $\rho$-hess, SUPERGNOVA and LAVA. However, there has not been a comprehensive evaluation of these methods to offer practical guidelines on the choices of these methods. In this study, we conduct benchmark comparisons of the performance of these three methods through extensive simulation and real data analyses. We focus on two technical difficulties in estimating local genetic correlation: sample overlaps across traits and local linkage disequilibrium (LD) estimates when only the external reference panels are available. Our simulations suggest the likelihood of incorrectly identifying correlated regions and local correlation estimation accuracy are highly dependent on the estimation of the local LD matrix. These observations are corroborated by real data analyses of 31 complex traits. Overall, our findings illuminate the distinct results yielded by different methods applied in post-genome-wide association studies (post-GWAS) local correlation studies. We underscore the sensitivity of local genetic correlation estimates and inferences to the precision of local LD estimation. These observations accentuate the vital need for ongoing refinement in methodologies.© The Author(s) 2023. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

Studies indicate that 27-46% of the risk of age-related chronic imbalance is genetic; nevertheless, the underlying genes remain unknown.The cohort consisted of 50,339 cases and 366,900 controls in the Million Veteran Program. The phenotype comprised cases with two ICD diagnoses of vertigo or dizziness at least 6 months apart, excluding acute or recurrent vertiginous syndromes and other non-vestibular disorders. Genome-wide association studies were performed as individual logistic regressions on European, African American, and Hispanic ancestries followed by trans-ancestry meta-analysis. Downstream analysis included case-case-GWAS, fine mapping, probabilistic colocalization of significant variants and genes with eQTLs, and functional analysis of significant hits.Two significant loci were identified in Europeans, another in the Hispanic population, and two additional in trans-ancestry meta-analysis, including three novel loci. Fine mapping revealed credible sets of intronic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in MLLT10 - a histone methyl transferase cofactor, BPTF - a subunit of a nucleosome remodeling complex implicated in neurodevelopment, and LINC01224 - a proto-oncogene receptor tyrosine kinase.Despite the difficulties of phenotyping the nature of chronic imbalance, we replicated two loci from previous vertigo GWAS studies and identified three novel loci.

,38104199,TWAS revealed significant causal loci for milk production and its composition in Murrah buffaloes.,Sci Rep,"Milk yield is the most complex trait in dairy animals, and mapping all causal variants even with smallest effect sizes has been difficult with the genome-wide association study (GWAS) sample sizes available in geographical regions with small livestock holdings such as Indian sub-continent. However, Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) could serve as an alternate for fine mapping of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). This is a maiden attempt to identify milk production and its composition related genes using TWAS in Murrah buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis). TWAS was conducted on a test (N?=?136) set of Murrah buffaloes genotyped through ddRAD sequencing. Their gene expression level was predicted using reference (N?=?8) animals having both genotype and mammary epithelial cell (MEC) transcriptome information. Gene expression prediction was performed using Elastic-Net and Dirichlet Process Regression (DPR) model with fivefold cross-validation and without any cross-validation. DPR model without cross-validation predicted 80.92% of the total genes in the test group of Murrah buffaloes which was highest compared to other methods. TWAS in test individuals based on predicted gene expression, identified a significant association of one unique gene for Fat%, and two for SNF% at Bonferroni corrected threshold. The false discovery rates (FDR) corrected P-values of the top ten SNPs identified through GWAS were comparatively higher than TWAS. Gene ontology of TWAS-identified genes was performed to understand the function of these genes, it was revealed that milk production and composition genes were mainly involved in Relaxin, AMPK, and JAK-STAT signaling pathway, along with CCRI, and several key metabolic processes. The present study indicates that TWAS offers a lower false discovery rate and higher significant hits than GWAS for milk production and its composition traits. Hence, it is concluded that TWAS can be effectively used to identify genes and cis-SNPs in a population, which can be used for fabricating a low-density genomic chip for predicting milk production in Murrah buffaloes.© 2023.

Utilizing high-throughput proteomic measurements in serum from a prospective population-based cohort of older adults (n=5,294), we identified 303 unique proteins associated with incident LOAD (median follow-up 12.8 years). Over 40% of these proteins were associated with LOADindependentlyofAPOE-?4carrier status. These proteins were implicated in neuronal processes and overlapped with protein signatures of LOAD in brain and cerebrospinal fluid. We found 17 proteins which LOAD-association was stronglydependentonAPOE-?4carrier status. Most of them showed consistent associations with LOAD in cerebrospinal fluid and a third had brain-specific gene expression. Remarkably, four proteins in this group (TBCA, ARL2, S100A13 and IRF6) were downregulated byAPOE-?4yet upregulated as a consequence of LOAD as determined in a bi-directional Mendelian randomization analysis, reflecting a potential response to the disease onset. Accordingly, the direct association of these proteins to LOAD was reversed uponAPOE-?4genotype adjustment, a finding which we replicate in an external cohort (n=719). Our findings provide an insight into the dysregulated pathways that may lead to the development and early detection of LOAD, including those both independent and dependent onAPOE-?4. Importantly, many of the LOAD-associated proteins we find in the circulation have been found to be expressed - and have a direct link with AD - in brain tissue. Thus, the proteins identified here, and their upstream modulating pathways, provide a new source of circulating biomarker and therapeutic target candidates for LOAD.",1.35E-22

Up to now, several computational methods were developed to predict enhancer gene interactions, but they require either many epigenomic and transcriptomic experimental assays to generate cell-type (CT)-specific predictions or a single experiment applied to a large cohort of CTs to extract correlations between activities of regulatory elements. Thus, inferring CT-specific enhancer gene interactions in unstudied or poorly annotated CTs becomes a laborious and costly task.Here, we aim to infer CT-specific enhancer target interactions, using minimal experimental input. We introduce Cell-specific ENhancer Target pREdiction (CENTRE), a machine learning framework that predicts enhancer target interactions in a CT-specific manner, using only gene expression and ChIP-seq data for three histone modifications for the CT of interest. CENTRE exploits the wealth of available datasets and extracts cell-type agnostic statistics to complement the CT-specific information. CENTRE is thoroughly tested across many datasets and CTs and achieves equivalent or superior performance than existing algorithms that require massive experimental data.CENTRE's open-source code is available at GitHub via https://github.com/slrvv/CENTRE.© The Author(s) 2023.

A total of 367 patients from Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center with whole-mount histopathology of radical prostatectomy specimens were assigned to the internal set, and cancer lesions were delineated with whole-mount pathology as the reference. The external test set included 147 patients with BCR data from five other institutes. The prediction model (NAFNet-classifier) and integrated nomogram (DL-nomogram) were constructed based on NAFNet. We then compared DL-nomogram with radiology score (PI-RADS), and clinical score (Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment score (CAPRA)). After training and validation in the internal set, ROC curves in the external test set showed that NAFNet-classifier alone outperformed ResNet50 in predicting adverse pathology. The DL-nomogram, including the NAFNet-classifier, clinical T stage and biopsy results, showed the highest AUC (0.915, 95% CI: 0.871-0.959) and accuracy (0.850) compared with the PI-RADS and CAPRA scores. Additionally, the DL-nomogram outperformed the CAPRA score with a higher C-index (0.732, P?<?0.001) in predicting bRFS.

Here, we aimed to investigate associations between the onset-age of overweight/obesity and risk of developing diabetes mellitus in China.42,144 people with the normal weight range and without diabetes at baseline, were enrolled from the Kailuan cohort which began on the 1stJune 2006. All participants were followed-up, biennially, until 31stDecember 2017. During follow-up, 11,220 participants had become overweight/obese. For each case, one normal-weight control was matched according to age ( ± 1 year) and sex. Our final analysis included 10,858 case-control pairs. An age-scaled Cox model was implemented to estimate hazard ratios (HR) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) for diabetes mellitus incidence across age-groups.At a median follow-up of 5.46 years, 1,403 cases of diabetes mellitus were identified. After multivariate adjustments, age-scaled Cox modelling suggested that risk gradually attenuated with every 10 year increase in age of onset of overweight/obesity. Diabetes mellitus adjusted HRs (aHRs) for new-onset overweight/obesity at <45years, 45-54 years, and 55-64 years were 1.47 (95%CI, 1.12-1.93), 1.38 (95%CI, 1.13-1.68), 1.32 (95%CI, 1.09-1.59), respectively. However, new-onset of overweight/obesity at ?65 years did not relate to diabetes mellitus (aHR, 1.20; 95%CI, 0.92-1.57). This trend was not observed in women or the new-onset obesity subgroup but was evident in men and the new overweight onset subgroup.Participants with early onset of excessive weight gain issues are at considerably higher risk of developing diabetes mellitus compared to those who maintain a normal weight.Copyright © 2023 Fang, Yuan, Li, Seery, Chen, Cai, Huang, Wang, Wu, Chen, Li, Wu and Chen.",1.06E-22

In this study, we aimed to apply 2b-RAD sequencing for Microbiome (2b-RAD-M) to characterize the oral microbiota in patients with GC.We performed 2b-RAD-M analysis on the saliva and tongue coating of GC patients and healthy controls. We carried out diversity, relative abundance, and composition analyses of saliva and tongue coating bacteria and fungi in the two groups. In addition, indicator analysis, the Gini index, and the mean decrease accuracy were used to identify oral fungal indicators of GC.In this study, fungal imbalance in the saliva and tongue coating was observed in the GC group. At the species level, enriched Malassezia globosa (M. globosa) and decreased Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae) were observed in saliva and tongue coating samples of the GC group. Random forest analysis indicated that M. globosa in saliva and tongue coating samples could serve as biomarkers to diagnose GC. The Gini index and mean decreases in accuracy for M. globosa in saliva and tongue coating samples were the largest. In addition, M. globosa in saliva and tongue coating samples classified GC from the control with areas under the receiver operating curve (AUCs) of 0.976 and 0.846, respectively. Further ecological analysis revealed correlations between oral bacteria and fungi.For the first time, our data suggested that changes in oral fungi between GC patients and controls may help deepen our understanding of the complex spectrum of the different microbiotas involved in GC development.

,38092834,"Network dynamical stability analysis reveals key ""mallostatic"" natural variables that erode homeostasis and drive age-related decline of health.",Sci Rep,"Using longitudinal study data, we dynamically model how aging affects homeostasis in both mice and humans. We operationalize homeostasis as a multivariate mean-reverting stochastic process. We hypothesize that biomarkers have stable equilibrium values, but that deviations from equilibrium of each biomarker affects other biomarkers through an interaction network-this precludes univariate analysis. We therefore looked for age-related changes to homeostasis using dynamic network stability analysis, which transforms observed biomarker data into independent ""natural"" variables and determines their associated recovery rates. Most natural variables remained near equilibrium and were essentially constant in time. A small number of natural variables were unable to equilibrate due to a gradual drift with age in their homeostatic equilibrium, i.e. allostasis. This drift caused them to accumulate over the lifespan course and makes them natural aging variables. Their rate of accumulation was correlated with risk of adverse outcomes: death or dementia onset. We call this tendency for aging organisms to drift towards an equilibrium position of ever-worsening health ""mallostasis"". We demonstrate that the effects of mallostasis on observed biomarkers are spread out through the interaction network. This could provide a redundancy mechanism to preserve functioning until multi-system dysfunction emerges at advanced ages.© 2023. The Author(s).",9.16E-23

By employing local ancestry methods, we isolated the Non-African parts of modern-day Northeast African genomes and identified the best putative source populations. Egyptians and Sudanese Copts bore most similarities to Levantine populations whilst other populations in the region generally had predominantly genetic contributions from the Arabian peninsula rather than Levantine populations for their Non-African genetic component.

Based on these DL model results, we proposed an organ feature, and the Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated between the proposed organ feature and ipsilateral lung volume receiving 20 Gray (Gy) or more (V20).For the lead wire marker detection model, the mean and standard deviation of the distance error, AP (5 mm) and AR (5 mm) reached 3.415?±?4.529, 0.860, 0.883, and 4.189?±?8.390, 0.848, 0.830 in the internal testing cohort and external testing cohort, respectively. The proposed organ feature calculated from the detected marker correlated with ipsilateral lung V20 (Pearson correlation coefficient, 0.542 with p?<?0.001 in the internal correlation testing cohort and 0.554 with p?=?0.008 in the external testing cohort).The proposed artificial Intelligence-based CT organ feature was correlated with normal lung dose in adjuvant radiotherapy following breast-conserving surgery in patients with invasive breast cancer.NCT05609058 (08/11/2022).© 2023.

,38027522,Prefrontal photobiomodulation produces beneficial mitochondrial and oxygenation effects in older adults with bipolar disorder.,Front Neurosci,"There is growing evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction and prefrontal cortex (PFC) hypometabolism in bipolar disorder (BD). Older adults with BD exhibit greater decline in PFC-related neurocognitive functions than is expected for age-matched controls, and clinical interventions intended for mood stabilization are not targeted to prevent or ameliorate mitochondrial deficits and neurocognitive decline in this population. Transcranial infrared laser stimulation (TILS) is a non-invasive form of photobiomodulation, in which photons delivered to the PFC photo-oxidize the mitochondrial respiratory enzyme, cytochrome-c-oxidase (CCO), a major intracellular photon acceptor in photobiomodulation. TILS at 1064-nm can significantly upregulate oxidized CCO concentrations to promote differential levels of oxygenated vs. deoxygenated hemoglobin (HbD), an index of cerebral oxygenation. The objective of this controlled study was to use non-invasive broadband near-infrared spectroscopy to assess if TILS to bilateral PFC (Brodmann area 10) produces beneficial effects on mitochondrial oxidative energy metabolism (oxidized CCO) and cerebral oxygenation (HbD) in older (?50?years old) euthymic adults with BD (N?=?15). As compared to sham, TILS to the PFC in adults with BD increased oxidized CCO both during and after TILS, and increased HbD concentrations after TILS. By significantly increasing oxidized CCO and HbD concentrations above sham levels, TILS has the potential ability to stabilize mitochondrial oxidative energy production and prevent oxidative damage in the PFC of adults with BD. In conclusion, TILS was both safe and effective in enhancing metabolic function and subsequent hemodynamic responses in the PFC, which might help alleviate the accelerated neurocognitive decline and dysfunctional mitochondria present in BD.Copyright © 2023 ODonnell, Barrett, OConnor and Gonzalez-Lima.",5.63E-23

However regarding air kerma at the patient entrance reference point (Ka,r), one of the DRL quantities for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), manufacturers use a variety of the International Electrotechnical Commission and their own specific definitions of the reference point. The research question for this study was whetherKa,ris appropriate as a DRL quantity for ERCP. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the difference betweenKa,rand air kerma incident on the patient's skin surface (Ka,e) at the different height of the patient couch for a C-arm system. Fluoroscopy and radiography were performed using a C-arm system (Ultimax-i, Canon Medical Systems, Japan) and a over-couch tube system (CUREVISTA Open, Fujifilm Healthcare, Japan).Ka,ewas measured by an ion chamber placed on the entrance surface of the phantom. Kerma-area product (PKA) andKa,rwere measured by a built-inPKAmeter and displayed on the fluoroscopy system.Ka,edecreased whileKa,rincreased as the patient couch moved away from the focal spot. The uncertainty of theKa,e/Ka,rratio due to the different height of the patient couch was estimated to be 75%-94%.Ka,rmay not accurately representKa,e.PKAwas a robust DRL quantity that was independent of the patient couch height. We cautioned against optimising patient doses in ERCP with DRLs set in terms ofKa,rwithout considering the patient couch height of the C-arm system. Therefore, we recommend thatKa,ris an inappropriate DRL quantity in ERCP using the C-arm system.© 2023 Society for Radiological Protection. Published on behalf of SRP by IOP Publishing Limited.

However, we found that there are no methylation motifs detection algorithms, which would be sensitive enough and return deterministic results. Thus, the MEME suit does not extract all Helicobacter pylori methylation sites de novo even using the iterative approach implemented in the most up-to-date methylation analysis tool Nanodisco.We present Snapper, a new highly sensitive approach, to extract methylation motif sequences based on a greedy motif selection algorithm. Snapper does not require manual control during the enrichment process and has enrichment sensitivity higher than MEME coupled with Tombo or Nanodisco instruments that was demonstrated on H.pylori strain J99 studied earlier by the PacBio technology and on four external datasets representing different bacterial species. We used Snapper to characterize the total methylome of a new H.pylori strain A45. At least four methylation sites that have not been described for H.pylori earlier were revealed. We experimentally confirmed the presence of a new CCAG-specific methyltransferase and inferred a gene encoding a new CCAAK-specific methyltransferase.Snapper is implemented using Python and is freely available as a pip package named ""snapper-ont."" Also, Snapper and the demo dataset are available in Zenodo (10.5281/zenodo.10117651).© The Author(s) 2023. Published by Oxford University Press.",4.38E-23

However, the machine learning performance regarding its actual predictive value for early detection in acute kidney injury (AKI) patients remains uncertain.This study represents the inaugural meta-analysis aiming to investigate the predictive value of machine learning for assessing the risk of AKI among ICU patients.PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were all thoroughly searched from inception to June 25, 2022. Eligible studies for inclusion were those concentrating on the predictive value and the development, validation, or enhancement of a prediction model for AKI patients in the ICU. Measures of effects, including c-index, sensitivity, specificity, and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs), were employed for analysis. The risk of bias in the included original studies was assessed using Probst. The meta-analysis in our study was carried out using R version 4.2.0.The systematic search yielded 29 articles describing 13 machine-learning models, including 86 models in the training set and 57 in the validation set. The overall c-index was 0.767 (95% CI [0.746, 0.788]) in the training set and 0.773 (95% CI [0.741, 0.804]) in the validation set. The sensitivity and specificity of included studies are as follows: sensitivity [train: 0.66 (95% CI [0.59, 0.73]), validation: 0.73 (95% CI [0.68, 0.77])]; and specificity [train: 0.83 (95% CI [0.78, 0.87])], validation: 0.75 (95% CI [0.71, 0.79])].The machine learning-based method for predicting the risk of AKI in hospital ICU patients has excellent predictive value and could potentially serve as a prospective application strategy for early identification.

We introduce a new method for local heritability estimation-Heritability Estimation with high Efficiency using LD and association Summary Statistics (HEELS)-that significantly improves the statistical efficiency of summary-statistics-based heritability estimator and attains comparable statistical efficiency as REML (with a relative statistical efficiency >92%). Moreover, we propose representing the empirical LD matrix as the sum of a low-rank matrix and a banded matrix. We show that this way of modeling the LD can not only reduce the storage and memory cost, but also improve the computational efficiency of heritability estimation. We demonstrate the statistical efficiency of HEELS and the advantages of our proposed LD approximation strategies both in simulations and through empirical analyses of the UK Biobank data.© 2023.

,38092737,Accurate integration of single-cell DNA and RNA for analyzing intratumor heterogeneity using MaCroDNA.,Nat Commun,"Cancers develop and progress as mutations accumulate, and with the advent of single-cell DNA and RNA sequencing, researchers can observe these mutations and their transcriptomic effects and predict proteomic changes with remarkable temporal and spatial precision. However, to connect genomic mutations with their transcriptomic and proteomic consequences, cells with either only DNA data or only RNA data must be mapped to a common domain. For this purpose, we present MaCroDNA, a method that uses maximum weighted bipartite matching of per-gene read counts from single-cell DNA and RNA-seq data. Using ground truth information from colorectal cancer data, we demonstrate the advantage of MaCroDNA over existing methods in accuracy and speed. Exemplifying the utility of single-cell data integration in cancer research, we suggest, based on results derived using MaCroDNA, that genomic mutations of large effect size increasingly contribute to differential expression between cells as Barrett's esophagus progresses to esophageal cancer, reaffirming the findings of the previous studies.© 2023.

Here, we used a combination of single-nucleus RNA-sequencing and single-cell whole-genome sequencing to identify transcriptomic and genomic changes in the prefrontal cortex of the human brain across life span, from infancy to centenarian. We identified infant-specific cell clusters enriched for the expression of neurodevelopmental genes, and a common down-regulation of cell-essential homeostatic genes that function in ribosomes, transport, and metabolism during aging across cell types. Conversely, expression of neuron-specific genes generally remains stable throughout life. We observed a decrease in specific DNA repair genes in aging, including genes implicated in generating brain somatic mutations as indicated by mutation signature analysis. Furthermore, we detected gene-length-specific somatic mutation rates that shape the transcriptomic landscape of the aged human brain. These findings elucidate critical aspects of human brain aging, shedding light on transcriptomic and genomics dynamics.",2.71E-23
,38106060,ISWI catalyzes nucleosome sliding in condensed nucleosome arrays.,bioRxiv,"How chromatin enzymes work in condensed chromatin and how they maintain diffusional mobility inside remains unexplored. We investigated these challenges using theDrosophilaISWI remodeling ATPase, which slides nucleosomes along DNA. Folding of chromatin fibers did not affect slidingin vitro. Catalytic rates were also comparable in- and outside of chromatin condensates. ISWI cross-links and thereby stiffens condensates, except when ATP hydrolysis is possible. Active hydrolysis is also required for ISWI's mobility in condensates. Energy from ATP hydrolysis therefore fuels ISWI's diffusion through chromatin and prevents ISWI from cross-linking chromatin. Molecular dynamics simulations of a 'monkey-bar' model in which ISWI grabs onto neighboring nucleosomes, then withdraws from one before rebinding another in an ATP hydrolysis-dependent manner qualitatively agree with our data. We speculate that 'monkey-bar' mechanisms could be shared with other chromatin factors and that changes in chromatin dynamics caused by mutations in remodelers could contribute to pathologies.",2.15E-23
,38054109,DNA Methylation Changes in Blood Cells of Fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Patients.,J Pain Res,"Fibromyalgia (FM) and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) affect 0.4% and 1% of society, respectively, and the prevalence of these pain syndromes is increasing. To date, no strong association between these syndromes and the genetic background of affected individuals has been shown. Therefore, it is plausible that epigenetic changes might play a role in the development of these syndromes.Three previous studies have attempted to elaborate the involvement of genome-wide methylation changes in blood cells in the development of fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome. These studies included 22 patients with fibromyalgia and 127 patients with CFS, and the results of the studies were largely discrepant. Contradicting results of those studies may be attributed to differences in the omics data analysis approaches used in each study. We reanalyzed the data collected in these studies using an updated and coherent data-analysis framework.Overall, the methylation changes that we observed overlapped with previous results only to some extent. However, the gene set enrichment analyses based on genes annotated to methylation changes identified in each of the analyzed datasets were surprisingly coherent and uniformly associated with the physiological processes that, when affected, may result in symptoms characteristic of fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome.Methylomes of the blood cells of patients with FM and CFS in three independent studies have shown methylation changes that appear to be implicated in the pathogenesis of these syndromes.© 2023 Przybylowicz et al.",2.11E-23

Here, we aimed to interrogate the role of nine epigenetic alterations as diagnostic and prognostic markers in BLCA.DNA methylation, gene expression, and clinicopathological information were retrieved from The Cancer Genome Atlas data portal. Methylation values and gene expression were assessed to determine their association with normal and malignant tissue. Additionally, we studied the association between methylation values and clinicopathological variables. For the prognostic model, Kaplan-Meier Survival curves were generated. Lastly, univariate and multivariate analysis were performed to evaluate the simultaneous impact of methylation and clinicopathological variables on the risk of tumor progression and survival.Nine CpG sites' methylation?$$ \beta $$-values involved in our study demonstrated different methylation signatures between normal and malignant urothelium.

While histone modifications such as methylation and acetylation have been studied in the ventral tegmental area and nucleus accumbens (NAc), the role of H2A monoubiquitination remains unknown. Our investigations, initially focused on the scaffold protein melanoma-associated antigen D1 (Maged1), reveal that H2A monoubiquitination in the paraventricular thalamus (PVT) significantly contributes to cocaine-adaptive behaviors and transcriptional repression induced by cocaine. Chronic cocaine use increases H2A monoubiquitination, regulated by Maged1 and its partner USP7. Accordingly, Maged1 specific inactivation in thalamic Vglut2 neurons, or USP7 inhibition, blocks cocaine-evoked H2A monoubiquitination and cocaine locomotor sensitization. Additionally, genetic variations in MAGED1 and USP7 are linked to altered susceptibility to cocaine addiction and cocaine-associated symptoms in humans. These findings unveil an epigenetic modification in a non-canonical reward pathway of the brain and a potent marker of epigenetic risk factors for drug addiction in humans.© 2023.

First, we present a spatial graph-based method, pseudo-time-space (PSTS), to model and uncover relationships between transcriptional states of cells across tissues undergoing dynamic change (e.g. neurodevelopment, brain injury and/or microglia activation, and cancer progression). We further developed a spatially-constrained two-level permutation (SCTP) test to study cell-cell interaction, finding highly interactive tissue regions across thousands of ligand-receptor pairs with markedly reduced false discovery rates. Finally, we present a spatial graph-based imputation method with neural network (stSME), to correct for technical noise/dropout and increase ST data coverage. Together, the algorithms that we developed, implemented in the comprehensive and fast stLearn software, allow for robust interrogation of biological processes within healthy and diseased tissues.© 2023.

Suicidal behavior involves a multi-factorial etiology, including psychological, social and biological factors. Since the molecular neural mechanisms of suicide remain vastly uncharacterized, we examined transcriptional- and methylation profiles of postmortem brain tissue from subjects who died from suicide as well as their neurotypical healthy controls. We analyzed temporal pole tissue from 61 subjects, largely free from antidepressant and antipsychotic medication, using RNA-sequencing and DNA-methylation profiling using an array that targets over 850,000 CpG sites. Expression of NPAS4, a key regulator of inflammation and neuroprotection, was significantly downregulated in the suicide decedent group. Moreover, we identified a total of 40 differentially methylated regions in the suicide decedent group, mapping to seven genes with inflammatory function. There was a significant association between NPAS4 DNA methylation and NPAS4 expression in the control group that was absent in the suicide decedent group, confirming its dysregulation. NPAS4 expression was significantly associated with the expression of multiple inflammatory factors in the brain tissue. Overall, gene sets and pathways closely linked to inflammation were significantly upregulated, while specific pathways linked to neuronal development were suppressed in the suicide decedent group. Excitotoxicity as well as suppressed oligodendrocyte function were also implicated in the suicide decedents. In summary, we have identified central nervous system inflammatory mechanisms that may be active during suicidal behavior, along with oligodendrocyte dysfunction and altered glutamate neurotransmission. In these processes, NPAS4 might be a master regulator, warranting further studies to validate its role as a potential biomarker or therapeutic target in suicidality.© 2023. The Author(s).",1.52E-23

Here we explore whether epigenetic alterations in human pancreatic islets impact insulin secretion and type 2 diabetes (T2D). In islets, 5,584 DNA methylation sites exhibit alterations in T2D cases versus controls and are associated with HbA1c in individuals not diagnosed with T2D. T2D-associated methylation changes are found in enhancers and regions bound by ?-cell-specific transcription factors and associated with reduced expression of e.g. CABLES1, FOXP1, GABRA2, GLR1A, RHOT1, and TBC1D4. We find RHOT1 (MIRO1) to be a key regulator of insulin secretion in human islets. Rhot1-deficiency in ?-cells leads to reduced insulin secretion, ATP/ADP ratio, mitochondrial mass, Ca2+, and respiration. Regulators of mitochondrial dynamics and metabolites, including L-proline, glycine, GABA, and carnitines, are altered in Rhot1-deficient ?-cells. Islets from diabetic GK rats present Rhot1-deficiency. Finally, RHOT1methylation in blood is associated with future T2D.

OneM. paharichromosome, however, houses a radically divergent centromere harboring ~6 mega-base pairs of a homogenized ?-sat-related repeat, ?-satB, that contains >20,000 functional CENP-B boxes. There, CENP-B abundance promotes accumulation of microtubule-binding components of the kinetochore and a microtubule-destabilizing kinesin of the inner centromere.

Several mechanisms have been proposed including genetic and epigenetic interrelationships also considering iron homeostasis genes, ferroptosis and cellular stressors such as iron excess and dysfunctional mitochondrial superoxide dismutase activity.We investigated 206 SSNHL patients and 420 healthy controls for the following genetic variants in the iron pathway: SLC40A1 -?8CG (ferroportin; FPN1), HAMP -?582AG (hepcidin; HEPC), HFE C282Y and H63D (homeostatic iron regulator), TF P570S (transferrin) and SOD2 A16V in the mitochondrial superoxide dismutase-2 gene.

Moreover, LINE-1 methylation was inversely related (r2?=?0.042; P?=?0.001) with hearing loss score assessed as pure tone average (PTA, dB HL), and the trend was maintained after SLC40A1 -?8CG and HAMP -?582AG genotype stratification (?SLC40A1?=?+?8.99 dB HL and ?HAMP?=?-?6.07 dB HL). In multivariate investigations, principal component analysis (PCA) yielded PC1 (PTA, age, LINE-1, HAMP, SLC40A1) and PC2 (sex, HFEC282Y, SOD2, HAMP) among the five generated PCs, and logistic regression analysis ascribed to PC1 an inverse association with moderate/severe/profound HL (OR?=?0.60; 0.42-0.86; P?=?0.0006) and with severe/profound HL (OR?=?0.52; 0.35-0.76; P?=?0.001).Recognizing genetic and epigenetic biomarkers and their mutual interactions in SSNHL is of great value and can help pharmacy science to design by pharmacogenomic data classical or advanced molecules, such as epidrugs, to target new pathways for a better prognosis and treatment of SSNHL.© 2023.

However, limited research has focused on the ground population, particularly among the elderly who are vulnerable to aging-related diseases.We evaluated the association between space weather alterations and biological aging using leukocyte telomere length as a biomarker in healthy elderly men.We used data from the Normative Aging Study, a longitudinal cohort of healthy elderly men in Massachusetts, USA. Leukocyte telomere length and health information were measured at in-person examinations approximately every three years, contributing to a total of 1,850 visits from 791 participants. Regional space weather information was collected daily, including cosmic ray-induced ionization, neutrons, sunspot number, interplanetary magnetic field, and Kp-index as our exposure of interest. We used mixed-effects models with a random intercept per individual to evaluate the associations between annual averages of space weather indicators and relative telomere length while accounting for participant demographics, environmental parameters, and secular trends.The mean age at baseline was 72.36 years. A one-year increment in age is associated with a 1.21% reduction in leukocyte telomere length. In the fully adjusted model accounting for individual and environmental factors, an interquartile range (IQR) increase of annual cosmic ray induced ionization (110.0 ion pairs cm-3sec-1) was associated with a 17.64% (95%CI: -27.73%, -7.55%) decrease in leukocyte telomere length, equivalent to 15-years age increment. Solar and geomagnetic activities were associated with increased leukocyte telomere length, but the association became absent after adjusting for cosmic ray indicators.Galactic cosmic rays may accelerate the aging process in populations on the Earth, despite the protection by the Earth's atmosphere and magnetic field. This research enhances our understanding of how changes in space weather can impact health, highlights potential risks from space to Earth's inhabitants, and helps inform health strategies for vulnerable populations.© 2023.

,38146031,Long-term health risk of offspring born from assisted reproductive technologies.,J Assist Reprod Genet,"Since the world's first in vitro fertilization baby was born in 1978, there have been more than 8 million children conceived through assisted reproductive technologies (ART) worldwide, and a significant proportion of them have reached puberty or young adulthood. Many studies have found that ART increases the risk of adverse perinatal outcomes, including preterm birth, low birth weight, small size for gestational age, perinatal mortality, and congenital anomalies. However, data regarding the long-term outcomes of ART offspring are limited. According to the developmental origins of health and disease theory, adverse environments during early life stages may induce adaptive changes and subsequently result in an increased risk of diseases in later life. Increasing evidence also suggests that ART offspring are predisposed to an increased risk of non-communicable diseases, such as malignancies, asthma, obesity, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. In this review, we summarize the risks for long-term health in ART offspring, discuss the underlying mechanisms, including underlying parental infertility, epigenetic alterations, non-physiological hormone levels, and placental dysfunction, and propose potential strategies to optimize the management of ART and health care of parents and children to eliminate the associated risks. Further ongoing follow-up and research are warranted to determine the effects of ART on the long-term health of ART offspring in later life.© 2023.

Proteome-wide Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was conducted to identify CAD-associated blood proteins, supplemented by colocalization analysis to minimize potential bias caused by linkage disequilibrium. Two-sample MR analyses were performed to assess the associations of genetically predicted four obesity measures and 13 lifestyle factors with CAD risk and CAD-associated proteins' levels. A two-step network MR analysis was conducted to explore the mediating effects of proteins in the associations between these modifiable factors and CAD.Genetically predicted levels of 41 circulating proteins were associated with CAD, and 17 of them were supported by medium to high colocalization evidence. PTK7 (protein tyrosine kinase-7), RGMB (repulsive guidance molecule BMP co-receptor B), TAGLN2 (transgelin-2), TIMP3 (tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 3), and VIM (vimentin) were identified as promising therapeutic targets. Several proteins were found to mediate the associations between some modifiable factors and CAD, with PCSK9, C1S, AGER (advanced glycosylation end product-specific receptor), and MST1 (mammalian Ste20-like kinase 1) exhibiting highest frequency among the mediating networks.This study suggests pathways explaining the associations of obesity and lifestyle factors with CAD from alterations in blood protein levels. These insights may be used to prioritize therapeutic intervention for further study.© 2023. The Author(s).",5.58E-24
,38098850,Comparison of MRI radiomics-based machine learning survival models in predicting prognosis of glioblastoma multiforme.,Front Med (Lausanne),"To compare the performance of radiomics-based machine learning survival models in predicting the prognosis of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients.131 GBM patients were included in our study. The traditional Cox proportional-hazards (CoxPH) model and four machine learning models (SurvivalTree, Random survival forest (RSF), DeepSurv, DeepHit) were constructed, and the performance of the five models was evaluated using the C-index.After the screening, 1792 radiomics features were obtained. Seven radiomics features with the strongest relationship with prognosis were obtained following the application of the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression. The CoxPH model demonstrated that age (HR?=?1.576,p?=?0.037), Karnofsky performance status (KPS) score (HR?=?1.890,p?=?0.006), radiomics risk score (HR?=?3.497,p?=?0.001), and radiomics risk level (HR?=?1.572,p?=?0.043) were associated with poorer prognosis. The DeepSurv model performed the best among the five models, obtaining C-index of 0.882 and 0.732 for the training and test set, respectively. The performances of the other four models were lower: CoxPH (0.663 training set / 0.635 test set), SurvivalTree (0.702/0.655), RSF (0.735/0.667), DeepHit (0.608/0.560).This study confirmed the superior performance of deep learning algorithms based on radiomics relative to the traditional method in predicting the overall survival of GBM patients; specifically, the DeepSurv model showed the best predictive ability.Copyright © 2023 Zhang, Luan, Liu, Yang, Lv, Hu, Han, Yu, Shmuel, Ma and Zhang.",5.03E-24

,38009119,Current status of DNA methylation profiling in neuro-oncology as a diagnostic support tool: A review.,Neurooncol Pract,"Over the last 2 decades, high throughput genome-wide molecular profiling has revealed characteristic genetic and epigenetic alterations associated with different types of central nervous system (CNS) tumors. DNA methylation profiling has emerged as an important molecular platform for CNS tumor classification with improved diagnostic accuracy and patient risk stratification in comparison to the standard of care histopathological analysis and any single molecular tests. The emergence of DNA methylation arrays have also played a crucial role in refining existing types and the discovery of new tumor types or subtypes. The adoption of methylation data into neuro-oncology has been greatly aided by the development of a freely accessible machine learning-based classifier. In this review, we discuss methylation workflow, address the utility of DNA methylation profiling in CNS tumors in a routine diagnostic setting, and provide an overview of the methylation-based tumor types and new types or subtypes identified with this platform.© The Author(s) 2023.

,38124900,Development of integrated smartphone/resistive biosensor for on-site rapid environmental monitoring of organophosphate pesticides in food and water.,Biosens Bioelectron X,"Organophosphate (OP) pesticides remain a worldwide health concern due to their acute or chronic poisoning and widespread use in agriculture around the world. There is a need for robust and field-deployable tools for onsite detection of OP pesticides in food and water. Herein, we present an integrated smartphone/resistive biosensor for simple, rapid, reagentless, and sensitive monitoring of OP pesticides in food and environmental water. The biosensor leverages the hydrolytic activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) to its substrate, acetylcholine (ACh), and unique transport properties of polyaniline nanofibers (PAnNFs) of chitosan/AChE/PAnNF/carbon nanotube (CNT) nanocomposite film on a gold interdigitated electrode. The principle of the sensor relies on OP inhibiting AChE, thus, reducing the rate of ACh hydrolysis and consequently decreasing the rate of protons doping the PAnNFs. Such resulted decrease in conductance of PAnNF can be used to quantify OP pesticides in a sample. A mobile app for the biosensor was developed for analyzing measurement data and displaying and sharing testing results. Under optimal conditions, the biosensor demonstrated a wide linear range (1 ppt-100 ppb) with a low detection limit (0.304 ppt) and high reproducibility (RSD <5%) for Paraoxon-Methyl (PM), a model analyte. Furthermore, the biosensor was successfully applied for analyzing PM spiked food/water samples with an average recovery rate of 98.3% and provided comparable results with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. As such, the nanosensing platform provides a promising tool for onsite rapid and sensitive detection of OP pesticides in food and environmental water.",4.47E-24
,38069051,Molecular Changes Associated with Suicide.,Int J Mol Sci,"Suicide is a serious global public health problem, with a worrying recent increase in suicide rates in both adolescent and adult populations. However, it is essential to recognize that suicide is preventable. A myriad of factors contributes to an individual's vulnerability to suicide. These factors include various potential causes, from psychiatric disorders to genetic and epigenetic alterations. These changes can induce dysfunctions in crucial systems such as the serotonergic, cannabinoid, and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axes. In addition, early life experiences of abuse can profoundly impact an individual's ability to cope with stress, ultimately leading to changes in the inflammatory system, which is a significant risk factor for suicidal behavior. Thus, it is clear that suicidal behavior may result from a confluence of multiple factors. This review examines the primary risk factors associated with suicidal behavior, including psychiatric disorders, early life adversities, and epigenetic modifications. Our goal is to elucidate the molecular changes at the genetic, epigenetic, and molecular levels in the brains of individuals who have taken their own lives and in the plasma and peripheral mononuclear cells of suicide attempters and how these changes may serve as predisposing factors for suicidal tendencies.",3.77E-24
,37923892,The inverse association between DNA gaps and HbA1c levels in type 2 diabetes mellitus.,Sci Rep,"Naturally occurring DNA gaps have been observed in eukaryotic DNA, including DNA in nondividing cells. These DNA gaps are found less frequently in chronologically aging yeast, chemically induced senescence cells, naturally aged rats, D-galactose-induced aging model rats, and older people. These gaps function to protect DNA from damage, so we named them youth-associated genomic stabilization DNA gaps (youth-DNA-gaps). Type 2 diabetes mellitus (type 2 DM) is characterized by an early aging phenotype. Here, we explored the correlation between youth-DNA-gaps and the severity of type 2 DM. Here, we investigated youth-DNA-gaps in white blood cells from normal controls, pre-DM, and type 2 DM patients. We found significantly decreased youth-DNA-gap numbers in the type 2 DM patients compared to normal controls (P?=?0.0377, P?=?0.0018 adjusted age). In the type 2 DM group, youth-DNA-gaps correlate directly with HbA1c levels. (r?=?- 0.3027, P?=?0.0023). Decreased youth-DNA-gap numbers were observed in patients with type 2 DM and associated with increased HbA1c levels. Therefore, the decrease in youth-DNA-gaps is associated with the molecular pathogenesis of high blood glucose levels. Furthermore, youth-DNA-gap number is another marker that could be used to determine the severity of type 2 DM.© 2023. The Author(s).",3.1E-24
,37959372,Updates on Pathophysiology of Discogenic Back Pain.,J Clin Med,"Discogenic back pain, a subset of chronic back pain, is caused by intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration, and imparts a notable socioeconomic health burden on the population. However, degeneration by itself does not necessarily imply discogenic pain. In this review, we highlight the existing literature on the pathophysiology of discogenic back pain, focusing on the biomechanical and biochemical steps that lead to pain in the setting of IVD degeneration. Though the pathophysiology is incompletely characterized, the current evidence favors a framework where degeneration leads to IVD inflammation, and subsequent immune milieu recruitment. Chronic inflammation serves as a basis of penetrating neovascularization and neoinnervation into the IVD. Hence, nociceptive sensitization emerges, which manifests as discogenic back pain. Recent studies also highlight the complimentary roles of low virulence infections and central nervous system (CNS) metabolic state alteration. Targeted therapies that seek to disrupt inflammation, angiogenesis, and neurogenic pathways are being investigated. Regenerative therapy in the form of gene therapy and cell-based therapy are also being explored.",2.59E-24
,38062059,Downregulated NPAS4 in multiple brain regions is associated with major depressive disorder.,Sci Rep,"Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a commonly observed psychiatric disorder that affects more than 2% of the world population with a rising trend. However, disease-associated pathways and biomarkers are yet to be fully comprehended. In this study, we analyzed previously generated RNA-seq data across seven different brain regions from three distinct studies to identify differentially and co-expressed genes for patients with MDD. Differential gene expression (DGE) analysis revealed that NPAS4 is the only gene downregulated in three different brain regions. Furthermore, co-expressing gene modules responsible for glutamatergic signaling are negatively enriched in these regions. We used the results of both DGE and co-expression analyses to construct a novel MDD-associated pathway. In our model, we propose that disruption in glutamatergic signaling-related pathways might be associated with the downregulation of NPAS4 and many other immediate-early genes (IEGs) that control synaptic plasticity. In addition to DGE analysis, we identified the relative importance of KEGG pathways in discriminating MDD phenotype using a machine learning-based approach. We anticipate that our study will open doors to developing better therapeutic approaches targeting glutamatergic receptors in the treatment of MDD.© 2023. The Author(s).",2.59E-24
,37948461,The limitations of phenotype prediction in metabolism.,PLoS Comput Biol,"Phenotype prediction is at the center of many questions in biology. Prediction is often achieved by determining statistical associations between genetic and phenotypic variation, ignoring the exact processes that cause the phenotype. Here, we present a framework based on genome-scale metabolic reconstructions to reveal the mechanisms behind the associations. We calculated a polygenic score (PGS) that identifies a set of enzymes as predictors of growth, the phenotype. This set arises from the synergy of the functional mode of metabolism in a particular setting and its evolutionary history, and is suitable to infer the phenotype across a variety of conditions. We also find that there is optimal genetic variation for predictability and demonstrate how the linear PGS can still explain phenotypes generated by the underlying nonlinear biochemistry. Therefore, the explicit model interprets the black box statistical associations of the genotype-to-phenotype map and helps to discover what limits the prediction in metabolism.Copyright: © 2023 Yubero et al.

,38149842,Efficient estimation for large-scale linkage disequilibrium patterns of the human genome.,Elife,"In this study, we proposed an efficient algorithm (X-LD) for estimating linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns for a genomic grid, which can be of inter-chromosomal scale or of small segments. Compared with conventional methods, the proposed method was significantly faster, dropped fromO(nm2)toO(n2m)-nthe sample size andmthe number of SNPs, and consequently we were permitted to explore in depth unknown or reveal long-anticipated LD features of the human genome. Having applied the algorithm for 1000 Genome Project (1KG), we found (1) the extended LD, driven by population structure, universally existed, and the strength of inter-chromosomal LD was about 10% of their respective intra-chromosomal LD in relatively homogeneous cohorts, such as FIN, and to nearly 56% in admixed cohort, such as ASW. (2) After splitting each chromosome into upmost of more than a half million grids, we elucidated the LD of the HLA region was nearly 42 folders higher than chromosome 6 in CEU and 11.58 in ASW; on chromosome 11, we observed that the LD of its centromere was nearly 94.05 folders higher than chromosome 11 in YRI and 42.73 in ASW. (3) We uncovered the long-anticipated inversely proportional linear relationship between the length of a chromosome and the strength of chromosomal LD, and their Pearson's correlation was on average over 0.80 for 26 1KG cohorts. However, this linear norm was so far perturbed by chromosome 11 given its more completely sequenced centromere region. Uniquely chromosome 8 of ASW was found most deviated from the linear norm than any other autosomes. The proposed algorithm has been realized in C++ (called X-LD) and is available at https://github.com/gc5k/gear2, and can be applied to explore LD features in any sequenced populations.© 2023, Huang et al.",2.39E-24
,38003233,Trisomies Reorganize Human 3D Genome.,Int J Mol Sci,"Trisomy is the presence of one extra copy of an entire chromosome or its part in a cell nucleus. In humans, autosomal trisomies are associated with severe developmental abnormalities leading to embryonic lethality, miscarriage or pronounced deviations of various organs and systems at birth. Trisomies are characterized by alterations in gene expression level, not exclusively on the trisomic chromosome, but throughout the genome. Here, we applied the high-throughput chromosome conformation capture technique (Hi-C) to study chromatin 3D structure in human chorion cells carrying either additional chromosome 13 (Patau syndrome) or chromosome 16 and in cultured fibroblasts with extra chromosome 18 (Edwards syndrome). The presence of extra chromosomes results in systematic changes of contact frequencies between small and large chromosomes. Analyzing the behavior of individual chromosomes, we found that a limited number of chromosomes change their contact patterns stochastically in trisomic cells and that it could be associated with lamina-associated domains (LAD) and gene content. For trisomy 13 and 18, but not for trisomy 16, the proportion of compacted loci on a chromosome is correlated with LAD content. We also found that regions of the genome that become more compact in trisomic cells are enriched in housekeeping genes, indicating a possible decrease in chromatin accessibility and transcription level of these genes. These results provide a framework for understanding the mechanisms of pan-genome transcription dysregulation in trisomies in the context of chromatin spatial organization.",2.2E-24

Methylated DNA markers (MDMs) detected primary CRC and metastatic recurrence with high sensitivity and specificity in cross-sectional studies. This study evaluated using serial MDMs to detect recurrence and monitor the treatment response to anti-cancer therapies.A nested case-control study was drawn from a prospective cohort of patients with CRC who completed curative-intent therapy for CRC of all stages. Plasma MDMs were assayed vis target enrichment long-probe quantitative-amplified signal assays, normalized toB3GALT6, and analyzed in combination with serum carcinoembryonic antigen to yield an MDM score. Clinical information, including treatment and radiographic measurements of the tumor burden, were longitudinally collected.Of the 35 patients, 18 had recurrence and 17 had no evidence of disease during the study period. The MDM score was positive in 16 out of 18 patients who recurred and only 2 of the 17 patients without recurrence. The MDM score detected recurrence in 12 patients preceding clinical or radiographic detection of recurrent CRC by a median of 106 days (range 90-232 days).Plasma MDMs can detect recurrent CRC prior to radiographic detection; this tumor-agnostic liquid biopsy approach may assist cancer surveillance and monitoring.",1.94E-24
,37988640,Comparing Active Surveillance and Watchful Waiting With Radical Treatment Using Machine Learning Models Among Patients With Prostate Cancer.,JCO Clin Cancer Inform,"In 2021, 59.6% of low-risk patients with prostate cancer were under active surveillance (AS) as their first course of treatment. However, few studies have investigated AS and watchful waiting (WW) separately. The objectives of this study were to develop and validate a population-level machine learning model for distinguishing AS and WW in the conservative treatment group, and to investigate initial cancer management trends from 2004 to 2017 and the risk of chronic diseases among patients with prostate cancer with different treatment modalities.In a cohort of 18,134 patients with prostate adenocarcinoma diagnosed between 2004 and 2017, 1,926 patients with available AS/WW information were analyzed using machine learning algorithms with 10-fold cross-validation. Models were evaluated using performance metrics and Brier score. Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate hazard ratios for chronic disease risk.Logistic regression models achieved a test area under the receiver operating curve of 0.73,F-score of 0.79, accuracy of 0.71, and Brier score of 0.29, demonstrating good calibration, precision, and recall values. We noted a sharp increase in AS use between 2004 and 2016 among patients with low-risk prostate cancer and a moderate increase among intermediate-risk patients between 2008 and 2017. Compared with the AS group, radical treatment was associated with a lower risk of prostate cancer-specific mortality but higher risks of Alzheimer disease, anemia, glaucoma, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension.A machine learning approach accurately distinguished AS and WW groups in conservative treatment in this decision analytical model study. Our results provide insight into the necessity to separate AS and WW in population-based studies.",1.57E-24

However, achieving a mechanistic understanding of how these molecules interact with chromatin to elicit a functional output is non-trivial, owing to the tremendous complexity of the biochemical networks involved. Advances in protein engineering have enabled the reconstitution of 'designer' chromatin containing customized post-translational modification patterns, which, when used in conjunction with sophisticated biochemical and biophysical methods, allow many mechanistic questions to be addressed. In this Review, we discuss how such tools complement established 'omics' techniques to answer fundamental questions on chromatin regulation, focusing on chromatin mark establishment and protein-chromatin interactions.© 2023.

,37936066,Hybrid deep learning approach to improve classification of low-volume high-dimensional data.,BMC Bioinformatics,"The performance of machine learning classification methods relies heavily on the choice of features. In many domains, feature generation can be labor-intensive and require domain knowledge, and feature selection methods do not scale well in high-dimensional datasets. Deep learning has shown success in feature generation but requires large datasets to achieve high classification accuracy. Biology domains typically exhibit these challenges with numerous handcrafted features (high-dimensional) and small amounts of training data (low volume).A hybrid learning approach is proposed that first trains a deep network on the training data, extracts features from the deep network, and then uses these features to re-express the data for input to a non-deep learning method, which is trained to perform the final classification.The approach is systematically evaluated to determine the best layer of the deep learning network from which to extract features and the threshold on training data volume that prefers this approach. Results from several domains show that this hybrid approach outperforms standalone deep and non-deep learning methods, especially on low-volume, high-dimensional datasets. The diverse collection of datasets further supports the robustness of the approach across different domains.The hybrid approach combines the strengths of deep and non-deep learning paradigms to achieve high performance on high-dimensional, low volume learning tasks that are typical in biology domains.© 2023.

Mechanistic insight into the genetic factors moderating the impact of stress can increase our understanding of disease processes. Here, we test 3,662 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from preselected expression quantitative trait loci in massively parallel reporter assays to identify genetic variants that modulate the activity of regulatory elements sensitive to glucocorticoids, important mediators of the stress response. Of the tested SNP sequences, 547 were located in glucocorticoid-responsive regulatory elements of which 233 showed allele-dependent activity. Transcripts regulated by these functional variants were enriched for those differentially expressed in psychiatric disorders in the postmortem brain. Phenome-wide Mendelian randomization analysis in 4,439 phenotypes revealed potentially causal associations specifically in neurobehavioral traits, including major depression and other psychiatric disorders. Finally, a functional gene score derived from these variants was significantly associated with differences in the physiological stress response, suggesting that these variants may alter disease risk by moderating the individual set point of the stress response.",1.28E-24

By simultaneously modeling signal variation across cells and conditions in both omics data types, MAGICAL achieved high accuracy on circuit inference. We applied MAGICAL to studyStaphylococcus aureussepsis from peripheral blood mononuclear single-cell data that we generated from subjects with bloodstream infection and uninfected controls. MAGICAL identified sepsis-associated regulatory circuits predominantly in CD14 monocytes, known to be activated by bacterial sepsis. We addressed the challenging problem of distinguishing host regulatory circuit responses to methicillin-resistant and methicillin-susceptibleS. aureusinfections. Although differential expression analysis failed to show predictive value, MAGICAL identified epigenetic circuit biomarkers that distinguished methicillin-resistant from methicillin-susceptibleS. aureusinfections.",1.15E-24

While folate plays a pivotal role in the one-carbon cycle, which is essential for DNA synthesis, repair, and methylation, concerns arise about its excessive intake. The literature underscores potential deleterious effects, such as an increased risk of carcinogenesis; disruption in DNA methylation; and impacts on embryogenesis, pregnancy outcomes, neurodevelopment, and disease risk. Notably, these consequences stretch beyond the immediate effects, potentially influencing future generations through epigenetic reprogramming. The molecular mechanisms underlying these effects were examined, including altered one-carbon metabolism, the accumulation of unmetabolized folic acid, vitamin-B12-dependent mechanisms, altered methylation patterns, and interactions with critical receptors and signaling pathways. Furthermore, differences in the effects and mechanisms mediated by folic acid compared with natural folate are highlighted. Given the widespread folic acid supplementation, it is imperative to further research its optimal intake levels and the molecular pathways impacted by its excessive intake, ensuring the health and well-being of the global population.",1.14E-24

An examination of GU and DU genetic architecture demonstrated that GUs shared the same risk loci as DUs, although with smaller genetic effect sizes and higher polygenicity than DUs, indicating higher heterogeneity of GUs. Helicobacter pylori (HP)-stratified analysis found an HP-related host genetic locus. Integrative analyses using bulk and single-cell transcriptome profiles highlighted the genetic factors of PUD being enriched in the highly expressed genes in stomach tissues, especially in somatostatin-producing D cells.

,37941029,Estimating genome-wide DNA methylation heterogeneity with methylation patterns.,Epigenetics Chromatin,"In a heterogeneous population of cells, individual cells can behave differently and respond variably to the environment. This cellular diversity can be assessed by measuring DNA methylation patterns. The loci with variable methylation patterns are informative of cellular heterogeneity and may serve as biomarkers of diseases and developmental progression. Cell-to-cell methylation heterogeneity can be evaluated through single-cell methylomes or computational techniques for pooled cells. However, the feasibility and performance of these approaches to precisely estimate methylation heterogeneity require further assessment.Here, we proposed model-based methods adopted from a mathematical framework originally from biodiversity, to estimate genome-wide DNA methylation heterogeneity. We evaluated the performance of our models and the existing methods with feature comparison, and tested on both synthetic datasets and real data. Overall, our methods have demonstrated advantages over others because of their better correlation with the actual heterogeneity. We also demonstrated that methylation heterogeneity offers an additional layer of biological information distinct from the conventional methylation level. In the case studies, we showed that distinct profiles of methylation heterogeneity in CG and non-CG methylation can predict the regulatory roles between genomic elements in Arabidopsis. This opens up a new direction for plant epigenomics. Finally, we demonstrated that our score might be able to identify loci in human cancer samples as putative biomarkers for early cancer detection.We adopted the mathematical framework from biodiversity into three model-based methods for analyzing genome-wide DNA methylation heterogeneity to monitor cellular heterogeneity.

Drugs inhibiting interleukin 1 cytokines are a promising new treatment option, but their use is based on scarce biological evidence and clinical trials of modest sizes, and the contributions of innate and adaptive immune processes to the pathophysiology are incompletely understood.To use human genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics to shed light on the pathogenesis of pericarditis.This was a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies of pericarditis from 5 countries. Associations were examined between the pericarditis-associated variants and pericarditis subtypes (including recurrent pericarditis) and secondary phenotypes. To explore mechanisms, associations with messenger RNA expression (cis-eQTL), plasma protein levels (pQTL), and CpG methylation of DNA (ASM-QTL) were assessed. Data from Iceland (deCODE genetics, 1983-2020), Denmark (Copenhagen Hospital Biobank/Danish Blood Donor Study, 1977-2022), the UK (UK Biobank, 1953-2021), the US (Intermountain, 1996-2022), and Finland (FinnGen, 1970-2022) were included.

Using axenic or conventional breeding conditions, we found traces of 6mA by LC-MS/MS and no significant increase in 6mA levels in the absence of TET, suggesting that this modification is present at very low levels in theDrosophilagenome but not regulated by TET. Consistent with this latter hypothesis, further molecular and genetic analyses showed that TET does not demethylate 6mA but acts essentially in an enzymatic-independent manner. Our results call for further caution concerning the role and regulation of 6mA DNA modification in metazoans and underline the importance of TET non-enzymatic activity for fly development.© 2023, Boulet et al.",5.87E-25

Approaches to measure telomere length (TL) differ on whether they estimate average, distribution, or chromosome-specific TL, and each presents their own advantages and limitations.The development of long-read sequencing and publication of the telomere-to-telomere human genome reference has allowed for scalable and high-resolution TL estimation in pre-existing sequencing datasets but is still impractical as a dedicated TL test. As sequencing costs continue to fall and strategies for selectively enriching telomere regions prior to sequencing improve, these approaches may become a promising alternative to classic methods. Measurement methods rely on probe hybridization, qPCR or more recently, computational methods using sequencing data. Refinements of existing techniques and new approaches have been recently developed but a test that is accurate, simple, and scalable is still lacking.© 2023. The Author(s).",5.55E-25

,38030968,Genetic insights into the dissolution of dioecy in diploid persimmon Diospyros oleifera Cheng.,BMC Plant Biol,"Dioecy, a sexual system of single-sexual (gynoecious/androecious) individuals, is rare in flowering plants. This rarity may be a result of the frequent transition from dioecy into systems with co-sexual individuals.In this study, co-sexual expression (monoecy and hermaphroditic development), previously thought to be polyploid-specific in Diospyros species, was identified in the diploid D. oleifeara historically. We characterized potential genetic mechanisms that underlie the dissolution of dioecy to monoecy and andro(gyno)monoecy, based on multiscale genome-wide investigations of 150 accessions of Diospyros oleifera. We found all co-sexual plants, including monoecious and andro(gyno)monoecious individuals, possessed the male determinant gene OGI, implying the presence of genetic factors controlling gynoecia development in genetically male D. oleifera. Importantly, discrepancies in the OGI/MeGI module were found in diploid monoecious D. oleifera compared with polyploid monoecious D. kaki, including no Kali insertion on the promoter of OGI, no different abundance of smRNAs targeting MeGI (a counterpart of OGI), and no different expression of MeGI between female and male floral buds. On the contrary, in both single- and co-sexual plants, female function was expressed in the presence of a genome-wide decrease in methylation levels, along with sexually distinct regulatory networks of smRNAs and their targets. Furthermore, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified a genomic region and a DUF247 gene cluster strongly associated with the monoecious phenotype and several regions that may contribute to andromonoecy.Collectively, our findings demonstrate stable breakdown of the dioecious system in D. oleifera, presumably also a result of genomic features of the Y-linked region.© 2023.

We employed transposon-mediated genome-wide mutagenesis, revealing that inactivating CTM1 blocks hyphal growth. CTM1 encodes a lysine (K) methyltransferase, which trimethylates cytochrome c (Cyc1) at K79. Mutants lacking CTM1 or expressing cyc1K79Agrow as yeast under hyphae-inducing conditions, indicating that unmethylated Cyc1 suppresses hyphal growth. Transcriptomic analyses detected increased levels of the hyphal repressor NRG1 and decreased levels of hyphae-specific genes in ctm1?/? and cyc1K79Amutants, suggesting cyclic AMP (cAMP)-protein kinase A (PKA) signaling suppression. Co-immunoprecipitation and in vitro kinase assays demonstrated that unmethylated Cyc1 inhibits PKA kinase activity. Surprisingly, hyphae-defective ctm1?/? and cyc1K79Amutants remain virulent in mice due to accelerated proliferation. Our results unveil a critical role for cytochrome c in maintaining the virulence of C. albicans by orchestrating proliferation, growth mode, and metabolism.

Men with mCRPC undergoing biopsies for progression were assessed for AVPCm using immunohistochemistry (IHC), next-generation sequencing (NGS) of solid tumor DNA (stDNA), and NGS of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) assays in CLIA-certified labs. Biopsy characteristics, turnaround times, inter-reader concordance, and inter-assay concordance were assessed. AVPCm was detected in 13 (27%) patients via IHC, two (6%) based on stDNA, and seven (39%) based on ctDNA. The concordance of the IHC reads between pathologists was variable. IHC had a higher detection rate of AVPCm+tumors with the shortest turnaround times. stDNA had challenges with copy number loss detection, limiting its detection rate. ctDNA detected the greatest proportion of AVPCm+tumors but had a low tumor content in two thirds of patients.

,37946010,Reduction in metabolic noise reveals rejuvenation following transient severe caloric restriction.,Geroscience,"Among land vertebrates, the laying hen stands out due to its great reproductive efficiency: producing an egg daily all year long. This production rate makes the laying hen a special model animal to study the general process of reproduction and aging. One unique aspect of hens is their ability to undergo reproductive plasticity and to rejuvenate their reproductive tract during molting, a standard industrial feed restriction protocol for transiently pausing reproduction, followed by improved laying efficiency almost to peak production. Here we use longitudinal metabolomics, immunology, and physiological assays to show that molting promotes reproduction, compresses morbidity, and restores youthfulness when applied to old hens. We identified circulating metabolic biomarkers that quantitatively predict the reproduction and age of individuals. Lastly, we introduce metabolic noise, a robust, unitless, and quantifiable measure for heterogeneity of the complete metabolome as a general marker that can indicate the rate of aging of a population. Indeed, metabolic noise increased with age in control hens, whereas molted hens exhibited reduced noise following molting, indicating systemic rejuvenation. Our results suggest that metabolic noise can be used as a quick and universal proxy for assessing successful aging treatments, accelerating the timeline for drug development.© 2023.

,38030616,Brain methylome remodeling selectively regulates neuronal activity genes linking to emotional behaviors in mice exposed to maternal immune activation.,Nat Commun,"How early life experience is translated into storable epigenetic information leading to behavioral changes remains poorly understood. Here we found that Zika virus (ZIKV) induced-maternal immune activation (MIA) imparts offspring with anxiety- and depression-like behavior. By integrating bulk and single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) with genome-wide 5hmC (5-hydroxymethylcytosine) profiling and 5mC (5-methylcytosine) profiling in prefrontal cortex (PFC) of ZIKV-affected male offspring mice, we revealed an overall loss of 5hmC and an increase of 5mC levels in intragenic regions, associated with transcriptional changes in neuropsychiatric disorder-related genes. In contrast to their rapid initiation and inactivation in normal conditions, immediate-early genes (IEGs) remain a sustained upregulation with enriched expression in excitatory neurons, which is coupled with increased 5hmC and decreased 5mC levels of IEGs in ZIKV-affected male offspring. Thus, MIA induces maladaptive methylome remodeling in brain and selectively regulates neuronal activity gene methylation linking to emotional behavioral abnormalities in offspring.© 2023.

Here, we derive cell-type-specific AD polygenic risk scores (ADPRS) from two extensively characterized datasets and uncover the impact of cell-type-specific genetic risk on AD endophenotypes. In an autopsy dataset spanning all stages of AD (n?=?1457), the astrocytic ADPRS affected diffuse and neuritic plaques (amyloid-?), while microglial ADPRS affected neuritic plaques, microglial activation, neurofibrillary tangles (tau), and cognitive decline. In an independent neuroimaging dataset of cognitively unimpaired elderly (n?=?2921), astrocytic ADPRS was associated with amyloid-?, and microglial ADPRS was associated with amyloid-? and tau, connecting cell-type-specific genetic risk with AD pathology even before symptom onset. Together, our study provides human genetic evidence implicating multiple glial cell types in AD pathophysiology, starting from the preclinical stage.© 2023. The Author(s).",1.7E-25

Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the genetic associations between different lipid-lowering therapeutic gene targets and human longevity.Two-sample Mendelian randomization analyses were conducted. The exposures comprised genetic variants that proxy nine drug target genes mimicking lipid-lowering effects (LDLR, HMGCR, PCKS9, NPC1L1, APOB, CETP, LPL, APOC3, and ANGPTL3). Two large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary datasets of human lifespan, including up to 500,193 European individuals, were used as outcomes. The inverse-variance weighting method was applied as the main approach. Sensitivity tests were conducted to evaluate the robustness, heterogeneity, and pleiotropy of the results. Causal effects were further validated using expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) data.Genetically proxied LDLR variants, which mimic the effects of lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), were associated with extended lifespan. This association was replicated in the validation set and was further confirmed in the eQTL summary data of blood and liver tissues. Mediation analysis revealed that the genetic mimicry of LDLR enhancement extended lifespan by reducing the risk of major coronary heart disease, accounting for 22.8% of the mediation effect. The genetically proxied CETP and APOC3 inhibitions also showed causal effects on increased life expectancy in both outcome datasets. The lipid-lowering variants of HMGCR, PCKS9, LPL, and APOB were associated with longer lifespans but did not causally increase extreme longevity. No statistical evidence was detected to support an association between NPC1L1 and lifespan.This study suggests that LDLR is a promising genetic target for human longevity. Lipid-related gene targets, such as PCSK9, CETP, and APOC3, might potentially regulate human lifespan, thus offering promising prospects for developing newer nonstatin therapies.© 2023.

,38093003,The landscape of genomic structural variation in Indigenous Australians.,Nature,"Indigenous Australians harbour rich and unique genomic diversity. However, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander ancestries are historically under-represented in genomics research and almost completely missing from reference datasets1-3. Addressing this representation gap is critical, both to advance our understanding of global human genomic diversity and as a prerequisite for ensuring equitable outcomes in genomic medicine. Here we apply population-scale whole-genome long-read sequencing4to profile genomic structural variation across four remote Indigenous communities. We uncover an abundance of large insertion-deletion variants (20-49?bp; n?=?136,797), structural variants (50??b-50 kb; n?=?159,912) and regions of variable copy number (>50?kb; n?=?156). The majority of variants are composed of tandem repeat or interspersed mobile element sequences (up to 90%) and have not been previously annotated (up to 62%). A large fraction of structural variants appear to be exclusive to Indigenous Australians (12% lower-bound estimate) and most of these are found in only a single community, underscoring the need for broad and deep sampling to achieve a comprehensive catalogue of genomic structural variation across the Australian continent. Finally, we explore short tandem repeats throughout the genome to characterize allelic diversity at 50 known disease loci5, uncover hundreds of novel repeat expansion sites within protein-coding genes, and identify unique patterns of diversity and constraint among short tandem repeat sequences. Our study sheds new light on the dimensions and dynamics of genomic structural variation within and beyond Australia.© 2023. The Author(s).",1.37E-25

It is not yet established whether the human fetal testis (HFT) is responsive to ACTH. To investigate this, we cultured HFT tissue with and without ACTH for up to 5 days, and quantified adrenal steroid hormones and expression of adrenal steroidogenic enzymes. Fetal testis and adrenal tissue produced high levels of testosterone and cortisol, respectively, indicating viability. In contrast to fetal adrenal tissues, the expression of ACTH receptor MC2R was either absent or expressed at extremely low levels in ex vivo HFT tissue and no clear response to ACTH in gene expression or steroid hormone production was observed. Altogether, this study suggests that the HFT is unresponsive to ACTH, which would indicate that a TART does not arise from fetal testicular cells chronically exposed to ACTH in utero.© The Author(s) 2023.

Representatively, there are disease diagnosis technologies that utilize deep learning techniques and digital holographic microscope (DHM) techniques. However, three-dimensional (3D) profile obtained by DHM has a problem of random noise caused by the overlapping DC spectrum and sideband in the Fourier domain, which has the probability of misjudging diseases in deep learning technology. To reduce random noise and obtain a more accurate 3D profile, in this paper, we propose a novel image processing method which randomly selects the center of the high-frequency sideband (RaCoHS) in the Fourier domain. This proposed algorithm has the advantage of filtering while using only recorded hologram information to maintain high-frequency information. We compared and analyzed the conventional filtering method and the general image processing method to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. In addition, the proposed image processing algorithm can be applied to all digital holography technologies including DHM, and in particular, it is expected to have a great effect on the accuracy of disease diagnosis technologies using DHM.",1.24E-25

However, recent human genetic studies demonstrate remarkable biological specificity and dosage sensitivity of the thirty-two adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent chromatin remodellers encoded in the human genome. Mutations in remodellers produce many human developmental disorders and cancers, motivating efforts to investigate their distinct functions in biologically relevant settings.

Critical interactions between remodelling complex subunits, the nucleosome and other transcriptional regulators are now being defined from structural and biochemical studies. In addition, in vivo analyses of remodellers at relevant genetic loci have provided minute-by-minute insights into their dynamics.

,38123678,Emergence of replication timing during early mammalian development.,Nature,"DNA replication enables genetic inheritance across the kingdoms of life. Replication occurs with a defined temporal order known as the replication timing (RT) programme, leading to organization of the genome into early- or late-replicating regions. RT is cell-type specific, is tightly linked to the three-dimensional nuclear organization of the genome1,2and is considered an epigenetic fingerprint3. In spite of its importance in maintaining the epigenome4, the developmental regulation of RT in mammals in vivo has not been explored. Here, using single-cell Repli-seq5, we generated genome-wide RT maps of mouse embryos from the zygote to the blastocyst stage. Our data show that RT is initially not well defined but becomes defined progressively from the 4-cell stage, coinciding with strengthening of the A and B compartments. We show that transcription contributes to the precision of the RT programme and that the difference in RT between the A and B compartments depends on RNA polymerase?II at zygotic genome activation. Our data indicate that the establishment of nuclear organization precedes the acquisition of defined RT features and primes the partitioning of the genome into early- and late-replicating domains. Our work sheds light on the establishment of the epigenome at the beginning of mammalian development and reveals the organizing principles of genome organization.© 2023. The Author(s).",8.86E-26

In this study, we aim to investigate the causal relationship between early adversity and changes in cerebral cortex structure using Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis.The GWAS summary statistics of 6 early adversity traits were obtained from individuals of European ancestry in the UK Biobank. The GWAS summary statistics of 34 known functional cortical regions were obtained from the ENIGMA Consortium. Causal relationships between the adversity factors and brain cortical structure were assessed using the inverse-variance weighted (IVW), MR-Egger, and weighted median methods, with IVW being the primary evaluation method. Cochran'sQ-test, MR-PRESSO, leave-one-out analysis, and funnel plot examination were employed to detect potential heterogeneity and pleiotropy, as well as to identify and exclude outliers.At a global level, no causal relationship was found between early adversity and cortical thickness (TH) or surface area (SA) of the brain. However, at the regional level, early adversity was found to potentially influence the TH of the caudal anterior cingulate, superior temporal, entorhinal, paracentral, lateral occipital, banks of the superior temporal sulcus, and supramarginal regions, as well as the SA of the pars triangularis, lateral occipital, parahippocampal, medial orbitofrontal, and isthmus cingulate regions. All findings were nominally significant and passed sensitivity analyses, with no significant heterogeneity or pleiotropy detected.Our study provides evidence for the association between early adversity and alterations in brain cortical structure, which may serve as a foundation for certain mental disorders.

,38092873,Sensitivity of Legionella pneumophila to phthalates and their substitutes.,Sci Rep,"Phthalates constitute a family of anthropogenic chemicals developed to be used in the manufacture of plastics, solvents, and personal care products. Their dispersion and accumulation in many environments can occur at all stages of their use (from synthesis to recycling). However, many phthalates together with other accumulated engineered chemicals have been shown to interfere with hormone activities. These compounds are also in close contact with microorganisms that are free-living, in biofilms or in microbiota, within multicellular organisms. Herein, the activity of several phthalates and their substitutes were investigated on the opportunistic pathogen Legionella pneumophila, an aquatic microbe that can infect humans. Beside showing the toxicity of some phthalates, data suggested that Acetyl tributyl citrate (ATBC) and DBP (Di-n-butyl phthalate) at environmental doses (i.e. 10-6 M and 10-8 M) can modulate Legionella behavior in terms of motility, biofilm formation and response to antibiotics. A dose of 10-6 M mostly induced adverse effects for the bacteria, in contrast to a dose of 10-8 M. No perturbation of virulence towards Acanthamoeba castellanii was recorded. These behavioral alterations suggest that L. pneumophila is able to sense ATBC and DBP, in a cross-talk that either mimics the response to a native ligand, or dysregulates its physiology.© 2023.

High NLR (>1.73) had association with mild cognitive impairment by MMSE (p=0.013). Likewise, high MLR (>0.24) were associated with language domain in MOCA (p=0.046). Low PLR (<103.9) was also related to delayed recall in MOCA (p=0.040). Regarding comorbidities, hypertension was associated with SII (p=0.007), overweight with PLR (p=0.047) and alcoholism was associated with MLR (p=0.043).

,38124114,"A comprehensive characterisation of phaeochromocytoma and paraganglioma tumours through histone protein profiling, DNA methylation and transcriptomic analysis genome wide.",Clin Epigenetics,"Phaeochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PPGLs) are rare neuroendocrine tumours. Pathogenic variants have been identified in more than 15 susceptibility genes; associated tumours are grouped into three Clusters, reinforced by their transcriptional profiles. Cluster 1A PPGLs have pathogenic variants affecting enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, including succinate dehydrogenase. Within inherited PPGLs, these are the most common. PPGL tumours are known to undergo epigenetic reprograming, and here, we report on global histone post-translational modifications and DNA methylation levels, alongside clinical phenotypes.Out of the 25 histone post-translational modifications examined, Cluster 1A PPGLs were distinguished from other tumours by a decrease in hyper-acetylated peptides and an increase in H3K4me2. DNA methylation was compared between tumours from individuals who developed metastatic disease versus those that did not. The majority of differentially methylated sites identified tended to be completely methylated or unmethylated in non-metastatic tumours, with low inter-sample variance. Metastatic tumours by contrast consistently had an intermediate DNA methylation state, including the ephrin receptor EPHA4 and its ligand EFNA3. Gene expression analyses performed to identify genes involved in metastatic tumour behaviour pin-pointed a number of genes previously described as mis-regulated in Cluster 1A tumours, as well as highlighting the tumour suppressor RGS22 and the pituitary tumour-transforming gene PTTG1.Combined transcriptomic and DNA methylation analyses revealed aberrant pathways, including ones that could be implicated in metastatic phenotypes and, for the first time, we report a decrease in hyper-acetylated histone marks in Cluster 1 PPGLs.© 2023.

This complication can impose severe psychological burdens and socio-economic impacts on patients. Although the definition of FRI has been proposed recently by an expert group, the diagnostic criteria for FRI are not yet standardized. A total of 4761 FRI patients and 4761 fracture patients (Non-FRI) were included in the study. The feature set of patients included imaging characteristics, demographic information, clinical symptoms, microbiological findings, and serum inflammatory markers, which were reduced by the Principal Component Analysis. To optimize the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model, the Traction Switching Delay Particle Swarm Optimization (TSDPSO) algorithm, a recognition method was proposed. Moreover, five machine learning models, including TSDPSO-SVM, were employed to distinguish FRI from Non-FRI. The Area under the Curve of TSDPSO-SVM was 0.91, at least 5% higher than that of other models. Compared with the Random Forest, Backpropagation Neural Network (BP), SVM and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), TSDPSO-SVM demonstrated remarkable accuracy in the test set ([Formula: see text]). The recall of TSDPSO-SVM was 98.32%, indicating a significant improvement ([Formula: see text]). Compared with BP and SVM, TSDPSO-SVM exhibited significantly superior specificity, false positive rate and precision ([Formula: see text]. The five models yielded consistent results in the training and testing of FRI patients across different age groups. TSDPSO-SVM is validated to have the maximum overall prediction ability and can effectively distinguish between FRI and Non-FRI. For the early diagnosis of FRI, TSDPSO-SVM may provide a reference basis for clinicians, especially those with insufficient experience. These results also lay a foundation for the intelligent diagnosis of FRI. Furthermore, these findings exhibit the application potential of this model in the diagnosis and classification of other diseases.© 2023. The Author(s).",5.12E-26
,38066424,Hierarchical classification-based pan-cancer methylation analysis to classify primary cancer.,BMC Bioinformatics,"Hierarchical classification offers a more specific categorization of data and breaks down large classification problems into subproblems, providing improved prediction accuracy and predictive power for undefined categories, while also mitigating the impact of poor-quality data. Despite these advantages, its application in predicting primary cancer is rare. To leverage the similarity of cancers and the specificity of methylation patterns among them, we developed the Cancer Hierarchy Classification Tool (CHCT) using the idea of hierarchical classification, with methylation data from 30 cancer types and 8239 methylome samples downloaded from publicly available databases (The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)). We used unsupervised clustering to divide the classification subproblems and screened differentially methylated sites using Analysis of variance (ANOVA) test, Tukey-kramer test, and Boruta algorithms to construct models for each classifier module. After validation, CHCT accurately classified 1568 out of 1660 cases in the test set, with an average accuracy of 94.46%. We further curated an independent validation cohort of 677 cancer samples from GEO and assigned a diagnosis using CHCT, which showed high diagnostic potential with generally high accuracies (an average accuracy of 91.40%). Moreover, CHCT demonstrates predictive capability for additional cancer types beyond its original classifier scope as demonstrated in the medulloblastoma and pituitary tumor datasets. In summary, CHCT can hierarchically classify primary cancer by methylation profile, by splitting a large-scale classification of 30 cancer types into ten smaller classification problems. These results indicate that cancer hierarchical classification has the potential to be an accurate and robust cancer classification method.© 2023. The Author(s).",4.58E-26

While assisted reproductive technologies (ART) have revolutionized the treatment landscape of infertility, a significant number of couples present with an idiopathic cause for their infertility, hindering effective management. Profiling the genome and transcriptome of infertile men and women has revealed abnormal gene expression. Epigenetic modifications, which comprise dynamic processes that can transduce environmental signals into gene expression changes, may explain these findings. Indeed, aberrant DNA methylation has been widely characterized as a cause of abnormal sperm and oocyte gene expression with potentially deleterious consequences on fertilization and pregnancy outcomes.

,38139155,VAMP7j: A Splice Variant of Human VAMP7 That Modulates Neurite Outgrowth by Regulating L1CAM Transport to the Plasma Membrane.,Int J Mol Sci,"The vesicle-associated membrane protein 7 (VAMP7) is a SNARE protein of the longin family involved in a wide range of subcellular trafficking events, including neurite sprouting and elongation. The expression of the human geneSYBL1, encoding VAMP7, is finely regulated by alternative splicing. Among the minor isoforms identified so far, VAMP7j is the one most expressed and modulated in the human brain. Therefore, we focused on gaining functional evidence on VAMP7j, which lacks a functional SNARE motif but retains both the longin and transmembrane domains. In human SH-SY5Y cells, we found VAMP7j to modulate neuritogenesis by mediating transport of L1CAM toward the plasma membrane, in a fashion regulated by phosphorylation of the longin domain. VAMP7-mediated regulation of L1CAM trafficking seems at least to differentiate humans from rats, with VAMP7j CNS expression being restricted to primates, including humans. Since L1CAM is a central player in neuritogenesis and axon guidance, these findings suggest the species-specific splicing ofSYBL1is among the fine tuners of human neurodevelopmental complexity.",3.79E-26

In this study, we assess melanoma immunotherapy response using a multi-scale network approach to identify gene modules with coordinated gene expression in response to treatment. Using gene expression data of melanoma before and after treatment with nivolumab, we modeled gene expression changes in a correlation network and measured a key network geometric property, dynamic Ollivier-Ricci curvature, to distinguish critical edges within the network and reveal multi-scale treatment-response gene communities. Analysis identified six distinct gene modules corresponding to sets of genes interacting in response to immunotherapy. One module alone, overlapping with the nuclear factor kappa-B pathway (NFKB), was associated with improved patient survival and a positive clinical response to immunotherapy. This analysis demonstrates the usefulness of dynamic Ollivier-Ricci curvature as a general method for identifying information-sharing gene modules in cancer.",3.76E-26

In this comprehensive review, we highlight recent advances in blood biomarker development for adult and pediatric brain tumors.We summarize recent blood biomarker development for CNS tumors across multiple key analytes, including peripheral blood mononuclear cells, cell-free DNA, cell-free RNA, proteomics, circulating tumor cells, and tumor-educated platelets. We also discuss methods for enhancing blood biomarker detection through transient opening of the blood-brain barrier. Although blood-based biomarkers are not yet used in routine neuro-oncology practice, this field is advancing rapidly and holds great promise for improved and non-invasive management of patients with brain tumors.

However, studies evaluating the reproductive and developmental toxicity of food-grade nanomaterials are limited. This study investigated the potential risks of prenatal dietary exposure to food-grade silica nanoparticles (E 551) on maternal health and fetal growth using conventional toxicological and epigenetic methods. The results showed that prenatal exposure to a high-dose of E 551 induces fetal resorption. Moreover, E 551 significantly accumulates in maternal and fetal livers, triggering a hepatic inflammatory response. At the epigenetic level, global DNA methylation is markedly altered in the maternal and fetal livers. Genome-wide DNA methylation sequencing revealed affected mCG, mCHG, and mCHH methylation landscapes. Subsequent bioinformatic analysis of the differentially methylated genes suggests that E 551 poses a risk of inducing metabolic disorders in maternal and fetal livers. This is further evidenced by impaired glucose tolerance in pregnant mice and altered expression of key metabolism-related genes and proteins in maternal and fetal livers. Collectively, the results of this study highlighted the importance of epigenetics in characterizing the potential toxicity of maternal exposure to food-grade nanomaterials during pregnancy.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

,38079057,Multi-proteomic Biomarker Risk Scores for Predicting Risk and Guiding Therapy in Patients with Coronary Artery Disease.,Curr Cardiol Rep,"Patients with established coronary artery disease (CAD) are at high residual risk for adverse events, despite guideline-based treatments. Herein, we aimed to determine whether risk scores based on multiple circulating biomarkers that represent activation of various pathophysiologically important pathways involved in atherosclerosis and myocardial dysfunction help identify those at greatest residual risk.Numerous circulating proteins, representing dysregulation of the pathways involved in the development and stability of coronary and myocardial diseases, have been identified. When aggregated together, biomarker risk scores (BRS) more accurately stratify patients with established CAD that may help target interventions in those individuals who are at elevated risk. Moreover, intensification of guideline-based therapies has been associated with parallel improvements in both BRS and outcomes, indicating that these risk scores may be employed clinically to target therapy. Multi-protein BRS are predictive of risk, independent of, and in addition to traditional risk factor assessments in patients with CAD. Those with elevated risk may benefit from optimization of therapies, and improvements in the BRS will identify those with improved outcomes.© 2023.

,38001924,Age-Dependent Alterations in Semen Parameters and Human Sperm MicroRNA Profile.,Biomedicines,"The trend to delay parenthood is increasing, impacting fertility and reproductive outcomes. Advanced paternal age (APA), defined as men's age above 40 years at conception, has been linked with testicular impairment, abnormal semen parameters, and poor reproductive and birth outcomes. Recently, the significance of sperm microRNA for fertilization and embryonic development has emerged. This work aimed to investigate the effects of men's age on semen parameters and sperm microRNA profiles. The ejaculates of 333 Portuguese men were collected between 2018 and 2022, analyzed according to WHO guidelines, and a density gradient sperm selection was performed. For microRNA expression analysis, 16 normozoospermic human sperm samples were selected and divided into four age groups: ?30, 31-35, 36-40, and >40 years. microRNA target genes were retrieved from the miRDB and TargetScan databases and Gene Ontology analysis was performed using the DAVID tool. No significant correlation was found between male age and conventional semen parameters, except for volume. Fifteen differentially expressed microRNAs (DEMs) between groups were identified. Enrichment analysis suggested the involvement of DEMs in the sperm of men with advanced age in critical biological processes like embryonic development, morphogenesis, and male gonad development. Targets of DEMs were involved in signaling pathways previously associated with the ageing process, including cellular senescence, autophagy, insulin, and mTOR pathways. These results suggest that although conventional semen parameters were not affected by men's age, alterations in microRNA regulation may occur and be responsible for poor fertility and reproductive outcomes associated with APA.",2.7E-26
,37944616,Systematic evaluation of multiple NGS platforms for structural variants detection.,J Biol Chem,"Structural variations (SV) are critical genome changes affecting human diseases. Although many hybridization-based methods exist, evaluating SVs through next-generation sequencing (NGS) data is still necessary for broader research exploration. Here, we comprehensively compared the performance of 16 SV callers and multiple NGS platforms using NA12878 whole genome sequencing (WGS) datasets. The results indicated that several SV callers performed well relatively, such as Manta, GRIDSS, LUMPY, TARDIS, FermiKit, and Wham. Meanwhile, all NGS platforms have a similar performance using a single software. Additionally, we found that the source of undetected SVs was mostly from long reads datasets, therefore, the more appropriate strategy for accurate SV detection will be an integration of long and shorter reads in the future. At present, in the period of NGS as a mainstream method in bioinformatics, our study would provide helpful and comprehensive guidelines for specific categories of SV research.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

,37961672,Integrating single-cell RNA-seq datasets with substantial batch effects.,bioRxiv,"Computational methods for integrating scRNA-seq datasets often struggle to harmonize datasets with substantial differences driven by technical or biological variation, such as between different species, organoids and primary tissue, or different scRNA-seq protocols, including single-cell and single-nuclei. Given that many widely adopted and scalable methods are based on conditional variational autoencoders (cVAE), we hypothesize that machine learning interventions to standard cVAEs can help improve batch effect removal while potentially preserving biological variation more effectively. To address this, we assess four strategies applied to commonly used cVAE models: the previously proposed Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL) regularization tuning and adversarial learning, as well as cycle-consistency loss (previously applied to multi-omic integration) and the multimodal variational mixture of posteriors prior (VampPrior) that has not yet been applied to integration. We evaluated performance in three data settings, namely cross-species, organoid-tissue, and cell-nuclei integration. Cycle-consistency and VampPrior improved batch correction while retaining high biological preservation, with their combination further increasing performance. While adversarial learning led to the strongest batch correction, its preservation of within-cell type variation did not match that of VampPrior or cycle-consistency models, and it was also prone to mixing unrelated cell types with different proportions across batches. KL regularization strength tuning had the least favorable performance, as it jointly removed biological and batch variation by reducing the number of effectively used embedding dimensions. Based on our findings, we recommend the adoption of the VampPrior in combination with the cycle-consistency loss for integrating datasets with substantial batch effects.",2.58E-26

The association between serum metabolites and GD remains partially understood.This study aimed to elucidate the causal connections between serum metabolites and predisposition to GD, examining potential genetic interplay.A 1-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study was conducted on the GD analysis that included 2836 cases and 374 441 controls. We utilized genome-wide association study summary data from the FinnGen project, analyzing the causal impact of 486 serum metabolites on GD. Approaches used were the inverse variance weighted methodology, Cochran's Q test, MR-Egger regression, MR-PRESSO, Steiger test, and linkage disequilibrium score regression analyses to assess genetic influence on metabolites and GD.19 metabolites were identified as having a pronounced association with GD risk, of which 10 maintained noteworthy correlations after stringent sensitivity assessments. Three metabolites exhibited significant heritability: kynurenine (OR 3.851,P= 6.09 × 10-4), a risk factor; glycerol 2-phosphate (OR 0.549,P= 3.58 × 10-2) and 4-androsten-3beta,17beta-diol disulfate 2 (OR 0.461,P= 1.34 × 10-2) were recognized as protective factors against GD. Crucially, all 3 exhibited no shared genetic interrelation with GD, further substantiating their potential causal significance in the disease.This study unveils pivotal insights into the intricate relationships between serum metabolites and GD risk. By identifying specific risk and protective factors, it opens avenues for more precise disease understanding and management.

,38076790,Deep generative modeling of the human proteome reveals over a hundred novel genes involved in rare genetic disorders.,medRxiv,"Identifying causal mutations accelerates genetic disease diagnosis, and therapeutic development. Missense variants present a bottleneck in genetic diagnoses as their effects are less straightforward than truncations or nonsense mutations. While computational prediction methods are increasingly successful at prediction for variants inknowndisease genes, they do not generalize well to other genes as the scores are not calibrated across the proteome. To address this, we developed a deep generative model, popEVE, that combines evolutionary information with population sequence data and achieves state-of-the-art performance at ranking variants by severity to distinguish patients with severe developmental disorders from potentially healthy individuals. popEVE identifies 442 genes in a cohort of developmental disorder cases, including evidence of 119 novel genetic disorders without the need for gene-level enrichment and without overestimating the prevalence of pathogenic variants in the population. By placing variants on a unified scale, our model offers a comprehensive perspective on the distribution of fitness effects across the entire proteome and the broader human population. popEVE provides compelling evidence for genetic diagnoses even in exceptionally rare single-patient disorders where conventional techniques relying on repeated observations may not be applicable.

Patients with CHD are, however, never cured and face unique challenges throughout their lives. In this review, we discuss the growing data suggesting accelerated aging in this population. Adults with CHD are more often and at a younger age confronted with age-related cardiovascular complications such as heart failure, arrhythmia, and coronary artery disease. These can be related to the original birth defect, complications of correction, or any residual defects. In addition, and less deductively, more systemic age-related complications are seen earlier, such as renal dysfunction, lung disease, dementia, stroke, and cancer. The occurrence of these complications at a younger age makes it imperative to further map out the aging process in patients across the spectrum of CHD. We review potential feasible markers to determine biological age and provide an overview of the current data. We provide evidence for an unmet need to further examine the aging paradigm as this stresses the higher need for care and follow-up in this unique, newly aging population.

Although physiological studies have revealed the neural circuits related to AD symptoms, how AD-associated genes are spatiotemporally expressed in the human brain still remains unclear. In this study, we integrated genome-wide association studies of four human AD subtypes-generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder-with spatial gene expression patterns. Our investigation uncovered a novel division among AD-associated genes, marked by significant and distinct expression enrichments in the cerebral nuclei, limbic, and midbrain regions. Each gene cluster was associated with specific anxiety-related behaviors, signaling pathways, region-specific gene networks, and cell types. Notably, we observed a significant negative correlation in the temporal expression patterns of these gene clusters during various developmental stages. Moreover, the specific brain regions enriched in each gene group aligned with neural circuits previously associated with negative decision-making and anxious temperament. These results suggest that the two distinct gene clusters may underlie separate neural systems involved in anxiety. As a result, our findings bridge the gap between genes and neural circuitry, shedding light on the mechanisms underlying AD-associated behaviors.© 2023. The Author(s).",1.88E-26

Unraveling the mechanisms behind NSV would broaden our understanding of HIV-1 persistence. Here we analyzed plasma virus sequences in eight ART-treated individuals with NSV (88% male) and show that they are composed of large clones without evidence of viral evolution over time in those with longitudinal samples. We defined proviruses that match plasma HIV-1 RNA sequences as 'producer proviruses', and those that did not as 'non-producer proviruses'. Non-suppressible viremia arose from expanded clones of producer proviruses that were significantly larger than the genome-intact proviral reservoir of ART-suppressed individuals. Integration sites of producer proviruses were enriched in proximity to the activating H3K36me3 epigenetic mark. CD4+T cells from participants with NSV demonstrated upregulation of anti-apoptotic genes and downregulation of pro-apoptotic and type I/II interferon-related pathways. Furthermore, participants with NSV showed significantly lower HIV-specific CD8+T cell responses compared with untreated viremic controllers with similar viral loads.

Here, we report peptide ligand-inserted eDHFR (PLIED) fusion protein as a universal adaptor for targeting proteins of interest (POI) with cell-permeable and stable synthetic functional small molecules (SFSM). PLIED binds to POI through the peptide moiety, properly orienting its eDHFR moiety, which then recruits trimethoprim (TMP)-conjugated SFSM to POI. Using a lysine-acylating BAHA catalyst as SFSM, we demonstrate that POI (MDM2 and chromatin histone) are post-translationally and synthetically acetylated at specific lysine residues. The residue-selectivity is predictable in an atomic resolution from molecular dynamics simulations of the POI/PLIED/TMP-BAHA (MTX was used as a TMP model) ternary complex.

While coding variation in HLA genes has been extensively documented, regulatory genetic variation modulating HLA expression levels has not been comprehensively investigated. Here we mapped expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) for classical HLA genes across 1,073 individuals and 1,131,414 single cells from three tissues. To mitigate technical confounding, we developed scHLApers, a pipeline to accurately quantify single-cell HLA expression using personalized reference genomes. We identified cell-type-specific cis-eQTLs for every classical HLA gene. Modeling eQTLs at single-cell resolution revealed that many eQTL effects are dynamic across cell states even within a cell type. HLA-DQ genes exhibit particularly cell-state-dependent effects within myeloid, B and T cells. For example, a T cell HLA-DQA1 eQTL ( rs3104371 ) is strongest in cytotoxic cells.

The purpose of this study is to provide fresh insights into extreme phenotypes, with a particular focus on immune-inflammatory parameters. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first phenotypic investigation of a semi-supercentenarian, illustrating both INFLA-score, a metric designed to assess the cumulative impact of inflammatory markers and indicators of age-related immune phenotype (ARIP), recognized as significant gauges of biological ageing. The aim of this study was, indeed, to advance our understanding of the role of immune-inflammatory responses in achieving extreme longevity. The results of laboratory tests, as well as clinical history and interview data, when compared to the results of our recent study on Sicilian centenarians, demonstrate an excellent state of health considering his age. Consistent with previous studies, we observed increased IL-6 inflammatory markers and INFLA score in A.T. More interestingly, the semi-supercentenarian showed values of ARIP indicators such as naïve CD4+ cells, CD4+/CD8+ ratio, and CD4+TN/TM ratio in the range of young adult individuals, suggesting that his immune system's biological age was younger than the chronological one.

The prevalence of these abnormalities and the allocation of (ab)normal cells in embryonic and placental lineages during intrauterine development remain elusive. In this study, we analyzed 1,745 spontaneous pregnancy losses and found that roughly half (50.4%) of the products of conception (POCs) were karyotypically abnormal, with maternal and paternal age independently contributing to the increased genomic aberration rate. We applied genome haplarithmisis to a subset of 94 pregnancy losses with normal parental and POC karyotypes. Genotyping of parental DNA as well as POC extra-embryonic mesoderm and chorionic villi DNA, representing embryonic and trophoblastic tissues, enabled characterization of the genomic landscape of both lineages. Of these pregnancy losses, 35.1% had chromosomal aberrations not previously detected by karyotyping, increasing the rate of aberrations of pregnancy losses to 67.8% by extrapolation. In contrast to viable pregnancies where mosaic chromosomal abnormalities are often restricted to chorionic villi, such as confined placental mosaicism, we found a higher degree of mosaic chromosomal imbalances in extra-embryonic mesoderm rather than chorionic villi. Our results stress the importance of scrutinizing the full allelic architecture of genomic abnormalities in pregnancy loss to improve clinical management and basic research of this devastating condition.© 2023.

Gaining a better understanding of how exposures at different stages in the lifecourse influence health outcomes is key to elucidating the potential benefits of disease prevention strategies. Mendelian randomisation (MR) is increasingly used to estimate causal effects of exposures across the lifecourse on later life outcomes. This systematic literature review explores MR methods used to perform lifecourse investigations and reviews previous work that has utilised MR to elucidate the effects of factors acting at different stages of the lifecourse. We conducted searches in PubMed, Embase, Medline and MedRXiv databases. Thirteen methodological studies were identified. Four studies focused on the impact of time-varying exposures in the interpretation of ""standard"" MR techniques, five presented methods for repeat measures of the same exposure, and four described methodological approaches to handling multigenerational exposures. A further 127 studies presented the results of an applied research question. Over half of these estimated effects in a single generation and were largely confined to the exploration of questions regarding body composition. The remaining mostly estimated maternal effects. There is a growing body of research focused on the development and application of MR methods to address lifecourse research questions. The underlying assumptions require careful consideration and the interpretation of results rely on select conditions. Whilst we do not advocate for a particular strategy, we encourage practitioners to make informed decisions on how to approach a research question in this field with a solid understanding of the limitations present and how these may be affected by the research question, modelling approach, instrument selection, and data availability.© 2023.

Uniquely, SpatialAnno estimates low-dimensional embeddings for a large number of non-marker genes via a factor model while promoting spatial smoothness among neighboring spots via a Potts model. Using both simulated and four real spatial transcriptomics datasets from the 10x Visium, ST, Slide-seqV1/2, and seqFISH platforms, we showcase the method's improved spatial annotation accuracy, including its robustness to the inclusion of marker genes for irrelevant cell/domain types and to various degrees of marker gene misspecification. SpatialAnno is computationally scalable and applicable to SRT datasets from different platforms. Furthermore, the estimated embeddings for cellular biological effects facilitate many downstream analyses.© The Author(s) 2023.

,38136241,"Traffic Density Exposure, Oxidative Stress Biomarkers and Plasma Metabolomics in a Population-Based Sample: The Hortega Study.",Antioxidants (Basel),"Exposure to traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) generates oxidative stress, with downstream effects at the metabolic level. Human studies of traffic density and metabolomic markers, however, are rare. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the cross-sectional association between traffic density in the street of residence with oxidative stress and metabolomic profiles measured in a population-based sample from Spain. We also explored in silico the potential biological implications of the findings. Secondarily, we assessed the contribution of oxidative stress to the association between exposure to traffic density and variation in plasma metabolite levels. Traffic density was defined as the average daily traffic volume over an entire year within a buffer of 50 m around the participants' residence. Plasma metabolomic profiles and urine oxidative stress biomarkers were measured in samples from 1181 Hortega Study participants by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and high-performance liquid chromatography, respectively. Traffic density was associated with 7 (out of 49) plasma metabolites, including amino acids, fatty acids, products of bacterial and energy metabolism and fluid balance metabolites. Regarding urine oxidative stress biomarkers, traffic associations were positive for GSSG/GSH% and negative for MDA. A total of 12 KEGG pathways were linked to traffic-related metabolites. In a protein network from genes included in over-represented pathways and 63 redox-related candidate genes, we observed relevant proteins from the glutathione cycle. GSSG/GSH% and MDA accounted for 14.6% and 12.2% of changes in isobutyrate and the CH2CH2CO fatty acid moiety, respectively, which is attributable to traffic exposure. At the population level, exposure to traffic density was associated with specific urine oxidative stress and plasma metabolites. Although our results support a role of oxidative stress as a biological intermediary of traffic-related metabolic alterations, with potential implications for the co-bacterial and lipid metabolism, additional mechanistic and prospective studies are needed to confirm our findings.",8.13E-27

We examined the capacity of a neonicotinoid, thiacloprid (thia), to induce transgenerational effects in male mice. Pregnant outbred Swiss female mice were exposed tothiaat embryonic days E6.5-E15.5 using different doses. Testis sections were used for morphology analysis, ELISAs for testosterone level analysis, RT-qPCR and RNA-seq for gene expression analysis, MEDIP-seq and MEDIP-qPCR techniques for DNA methylation analysis, and Western blot for a protein analysis. The number of meiotic double-strand breaks and the number of incomplete synapsed chromosomes were higher in thethia6-treated group of F3 males. Genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation in spermatozoa revealed that differentially methylated regions were found in all three generations at the promoters of germ cell reprogramming responsive genes and many superenhancers that are normally active in embryonic stem cells, testis, and brain. DNA methylation changes induced bythiaexposure during embryonic period are preserved through several generations at important master regulator regions.© 2023 Dali et al.",7.42E-27
,38113073,Explainable artificial intelligence for omics data: a systematic mapping study.,Brief Bioinform,"Researchers increasingly turn to explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to analyze omics data and gain insights into the underlying biological processes. Yet, given the interdisciplinary nature of the field, many findings have only been shared in their respective research community. An overview of XAI for omics data is needed to highlight promising approaches and help detect common issues. Toward this end, we conducted a systematic mapping study. To identify relevant literature, we queried Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, BioRxiv, MedRxiv and arXiv. Based on keywording, we developed a coding scheme with 10 facets regarding the studies' AI methods, explainability methods and omics data. Our mapping study resulted in 405 included papers published between 2010 and 2023. The inspected papers analyze DNA-based (mostly genomic), transcriptomic, proteomic or metabolomic data by means of neural networks, tree-based methods, statistical methods and further AI methods. The preferred post-hoc explainability methods are feature relevance (n =?166) and visual explanation (n =?52), while papers using interpretable approaches often resort to the use of transparent models (n =?83) or architecture modifications (n =?72). With many research gaps still apparent for XAI for omics data, we deduced eight research directions and discuss their potential for the field. We also provide exemplary research questions for each direction. Many problems with the adoption of XAI for omics data in clinical practice are yet to be resolved. This systematic mapping study outlines extant research on the topic and provides research directions for researchers and practitioners.© The Author(s) 2023.

Several biomarkers have been proposed but have yet to be implemented into clinical practice. Treatments, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, are efficacious in only a small number of patients, which underscores the need to develop novel, efficient treatments. Mitochondrial dysfunction resulting from chronic oxidative stress has been linked with both altered neurotransmitter signaling and the inflammatory response. Hereinafter, we discuss mechanisms by which mitochondrial dysfunction may contribute to the development of PTSD symptoms, and how these may even increase PTSD susceptibility. We also highlight possible therapeutic targets to reduce oxidative stress to prevent or treat PTSD symptoms.Copyright © 2023 Kmita, Pinna and Lushchak.",3.79E-27

By usingFoxn1-Cre-driven ablation ofKlf6gene in TEC, we identifiedKlf6as a critical factor in TEC development.Klf6deficiency resulted in a hypoplastic thymus-evident from fetal stages into adulthood-in which a dramatic increase in the frequency of apoptotic TEC was observed. Among cortical TEC (cTEC), a previously unreported cTEC population expressing the transcription factor Sox10 was relatively expanded. Within medullary TEC (mTEC), mTEC I and Tuft-like mTEC IV were disproportionately decreased.Klf6deficiency altered chromatin accessibility and affected TEC chromatin configuration. Consistent with these defects, naïve conventional T cells and invariant natural killer T cells were reduced in the spleen. Late stages of T cell receptor-dependent selection of thymocytes were affected, and mice exhibited autoimmunity. Thus, Klf6 has a prosurvival role and affects the development of specific TEC subsets contributing to thymic function.",3.79E-27

To date, neuroimaging or molecular information is not used. The aim of this study was to determine the utility of radiomic features to capture clinically relevant phenotypes, and to link those to molecular profiles for enhanced risk stratification.In this retrospective study, we investigated 133 patients across 9 sites in Austria (2005-2018) and an external validation site in South Korea (44 patients, 2013-2016). We used T1-weighted contrast-enhanced MRI and an L1-norm regularized Cox proportional hazard model to derive a radiomic risk score. We integrated radiomic features with DNA methylation profiles using machine learning-based prediction, and validated the most relevant biological associations in tissues and cell lines.The radiomic risk score, consisting of 20 mostly textural features, was a strong and independent predictor of survival (multivariate hazard ratio?=?6.56 [3.64-11.81]) that remained valid in the external validation cohort. Radiomic features captured gene regulatory differences such as in BCL6 binding activity, which was put forth as testable treatment target for a subset of patients.The radiomic risk score was a robust and complementary predictor of survival and reflected characteristics in underlying DNA methylation patterns. Leveraging imaging phenotypes to assess risk and inform epigenetic treatment targets provides a concept on which to advance prognostic modeling and precision therapy for this aggressive cancer.© The Author(s) 2023.

So far, they have not been comprehensively investigated in gastrointestinal cancers. Here, we profile 4 categories of cell-free omics data from patients with colorectal cancer and patients with stomach adenocarcinoma and then assay 15 types of genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic variations. We find that multi-omics data are more appropriate for detection of cancer genes compared with single-omics data. In particular, cfRNAs are more sensitive and informative than cfDNAs in terms of detection rate, enriched functional pathways, etc. Moreover, we identify several peripheral immune signatures that are suppressed in patients with cancer. Specifically, we establish a ??-T cell score and a cancer-associated-fibroblast (CAF) score, providing insights into clinical statuses like cancer stage and survival. Overall, we reveal a cell-free multi-molecular landscape that is useful for blood monitoring in personalized cancer treatment.Copyright © 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

,38098466,"Flattening the biological age curve by improving metabolic health: to taurine or not to taurine, that' s the question.",J Geriatr Cardiol,"The aging population is an important issue around the world especially in developed countries. Although medical advances have substantially extended life span, the same cannot be said for the duration of health span. We are seeing increasing numbers of elderly people who are frail and/or have multiple chronic conditions; all of these can affect the quality of life of the elderly population as well as increase the burden on the healthcare system. Aging is mechanistically related to common medical conditions such as diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease, cognitive decline, and frailty. A recently accepted concept termed 'Accelerated Biological Aging' can be diagnosed when a person's biological age-as measured by biomarkers of DNA methylation-is older than their corresponding chronological age. Taurine, a conditionally essential amino acid, has received much attention in the past few years. A substantial number of animal studies have provided a strong scientific foundation suggesting that this amino acid can improve cellular and metabolic health, including blood glucose control, so much that it has been labelled one of the 'longevity amino acids'. In this review article, we propose the rationale that an adequately powered randomized-controlled-trial (RCT) is needed to confirm whether taurine can meaningfully improve metabolic and microbiome health, and biological age. This trial should incorporate certain elements in order to provide the much-needed evidence to guide doctors, and also the community at large, to determine whether this promising and inexpensive amino acid is useful in improving human metabolic health.© 2023 JGC All rights reserved; www.jgc301.com.",3.64E-27
,38145985,Convergence of the dysregulated regulome in schizophrenia with polygenic risk and evolutionarily constrained enhancers.,Mol Psychiatry,"Enhancers play an essential role in the etiology of schizophrenia; however, the dysregulation of enhancer activity and its impact on the regulome in schizophrenia remains understudied. To address this gap in our knowledge, we assessed enhancer and gene expression in 1,382 brain samples comprising cases with schizophrenia and unaffected controls. Dysregulation of enhancer expression was concordant with changes in gene expression, and was more closely associated with schizophrenia polygenic risk, suggesting that enhancer dysregulation is proximal to the genetic etiology of the disease. Modeling the shared variance of cis-coordinated genes and enhancers revealed a gene regulatory program that was highly associated with genetic vulnerability to schizophrenia. By integrating coordinated factors with evolutionary constraints, we found that enhancers acquired during human evolution are more likely to regulate genes that are implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders and, thus, hold potential as therapeutic targets. Our analysis provides a systematic view of regulome dysregulation in schizophrenia and highlights its convergence with schizophrenia polygenic risk and human-gained enhancers.© 2023.

MR-Egger regression, simple mode, weighted mode, simple median, and weighted median, were utilized to determine the causal relationship between the exposure factor and the occurrence of lung cancer and its subtypes.NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) flavoprotein 2 and transmembrane protein 70 were found to have a causal relationship with lung adenocarcinoma, acting as protective factors. The causal relationship between mitochondrial import inner membrane translocase subunit and NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) iron-sulfur protein 4 and small-cell lung cancer was established as a risk factor. NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) 1 beta subcomplex subunit 8 exhibited a causal relationship with small-cell lung cancer, acting as a protective factor. Furthermore, NAD-dependent protein deacylase sirtuin-5 was causally linked to lung squamous cell carcinoma, serving as a protective factor. A funnel plot demonstrated the symmetrical distribution of the SNPs. Thew pleiotroy test (P > 0.05) and ""leave-one-out"" test validated the relative stability of the results.This study established a causal relationship between mitochondrial biological function and lung cancer, including its subtypes.Copyright © 2023.

A number of studies allowed to trace the usual stages leading from pregnancy to adult age, and relate them to functional and behavioral measurements. It was also possible to explore the effects of some interventions, behavioral or not, showing that the commonly followed pathway to adulthood may be steered by external interventions. These events may result in behavioral modifications but also in structural changes, in some cases limiting plasticity or extending/modifying critical periods. In this review, we outline the healthy human brain development in the absence of major issues or diseases. Then, the effects of negative (different stressors) and positive (music training) environmental stimuli on brain and behavioral development is depicted. Hence, it may be concluded that the typical development follows a course strictly dependent from environmental inputs, and that external intervention can be designed to positively counteract negative influences, particularly at young ages. We also focus on the social aspect of development, which startsin uteroand continues after birth by building social relationships. This poses a great responsibility in handling children education and healthcare politics, pointing to social accountability for the responsible development of each child.Copyright © 2023 Mucignat-Caretta and Soravia.",2.63E-27

Gastrointestinal diseases included gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), peptic ulcer disease (PUD), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), functional dyspepsia (FD), non-infectious gastroenteritis (NGE), and constipation (CP). Significant MR analysis results were replicated in the COPD validation cohort.Results:Bidirectional MR analysis supported a bidirectional causal relationship between GERD and COPD, and COPD was also found to increase the risk of IBS and CP. Our study also provided evidence for a bidirectional causal relationship between PUD and COPD, although the strength of evidence may be insufficient. Furthermore, we provided evidence that there is no causal association between CD, UC, FD, NGE, and COPD.Conclusion:This study offers some evidence to clarify the causal relationship between common gastrointestinal diseases and COPD.

Here we describe a novel approach, sciPlex-ATAC-seq, which uses unmodified DNA oligos as sample-specific nuclear labels, enabling the concurrent profiling of chromatin accessibility within single nuclei from virtually unlimited specimens or experimental conditions. We first demonstrate our method with a chemical epigenomics screen, in which we identify drug-altered distal regulatory sites predictive of compound- and dose-dependent effects on transcription. We then analyze cell type-specific chromatin changes in PBMCs from multiple donors responding to synthetic and allogeneic immune stimulation. We quantify stimulation-altered immune cell compositions and isolate the unique effects of allogeneic stimulation on chromatin accessibility specific to T-lymphocytes. Finally, we observe that impaired global chromatin decondensation often coincides with chemical inhibition of allogeneic T-cell activation.© 2023. The Author(s).",1.74E-27
,37968638,The role of admixture in the rare variant contribution to inflammatory bowel disease.,Genome Med,"Identification of rare variants involved in complex, polygenic diseases like Crohn's disease (CD) has accelerated with the introduction of whole exome/genome sequencing association studies. Rare variants can be used in both diagnostic and therapeutic assessments; however, since they are likely to be restricted to specific ancestry groups, their contributions to risk assessment need to be evaluated outside the discovery population. Prior studies implied that the three known rare variants in NOD2 are absent in West African and Asian populations and only contribute in African Americans via admixture.Whole genome sequencing (WGS) data from 3418 African American individuals, 1774 inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) cases, and 1644 controls were used to assess odds ratios and allele frequencies (AF), as well as haplotype-specific ancestral origins of European-derived CD variants discovered in a large exome-wide association study. Local and global ancestry was performed to assess the contribution of admixture to IBD contrasting European and African American cohorts.Twenty-five rare variants associated with CD in European discovery cohorts are typically five-fold lower frequency in African Americans. Correspondingly, where comparisons could be made, the rare variants were found to have a predicted four-fold reduced burden for IBD in African Americans, when compared to European individuals. Almost all of the rare CD European variants were found on European haplotypes in the African American cohort, implying that they contribute to disease risk in African Americans primarily due to recent admixture. In addition, proportion of European ancestry correlates the number of rare CD European variants each African American individual carry, as well as their polygenic risk of disease. Similar findings were observed for 23 mutations affecting 10 other common complex diseases for which the rare variants were discovered in European cohorts.European-derived Crohn's disease rare variants are even more rare in African Americans and contribute to disease risk mainly due to admixture, which needs to be accounted for when performing cross-ancestry genetic assessments.© 2023.

The arthropod-associated archaea known to date belong to the ordersMethanobacteriales, Methanomassiliicoccales, Methanomicrobiales, andMethanosarcinales, and in a few cases also to non-methanogenicNitrososphaeralesandBathyarchaeales. However, all major host groups are severely undersampled, and the taxonomy of existing lineages is not well developed. Full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences and genomes of arthropod-associated archaea are scarce, reference databases lack resolution, and the names of many taxa are either not validly published or under-classified and require revision. Here, we investigated the diversity of archaea in a wide range of methane-emitting arthropods, combining phylogenomic analysis of isolates and metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) with amplicon sequencing of full-length 16S rRNA genes. Our results allowed us to describe numerous new species in hitherto undescribed taxa among the ordersMethanobacteriales(Methanacia,Methanarmilla,Methanobaculum,Methanobinarius,Methanocatella,Methanoflexus,Methanorudis, andMethanovirga, all gen. nova),Methanomicrobiales(MethanofilumandMethanorbis, both gen. nova),Methanosarcinales(MethanofrustulumandMethanolapillus, both gen. nova),Methanomassiliicoccales(Methanomethylophilaceaefam. nov.,Methanarcanum,Methanogranum,Methanomethylophilus,Methanomicula,Methanoplasma,Methanoprimaticola, all gen. nova), and the new familyBathycorpusculaceae(Bathycorpusculumgen. nov.). Reclassification of amplicon libraries from this and previous studies using this new taxonomic framework revealed that arthropods harbor only CO2and methyl-reducing hydrogenotrophic methanogens. Numerous genus-level lineages appear to be present exclusively in arthropods, suggesting long evolutionary trajectories with their termite, cockroach, and millipede hosts, and a radiation into various microhabitats and ecological niches provided by their digestive tracts (e.g., hindgut compartments, gut wall, or anaerobic protists). The distribution patterns among the different host groups are often complex, indicating a mixed mode of transmission and a parallel evolution of invertebrate and vertebrate-associated lineages.Copyright © 2023 Protasov, Nonoh, Kästle Silva, Mies, Hervé, Dietrich, Lang, Mikulski, Platt, Poehlein, Köhler-Ramm, Miambi, Boga, Feldewert, Ngugi, Plarre, Sillam-Dussès, obotník, Daniel and Brune.",1.68E-27
,38082403,A score-based method of immune status evaluation for healthy individuals with complete blood cell counts.,BMC Bioinformatics,"With the COVID-19 outbreak, an increasing number of individuals are concerned about their health, particularly their immune status. However, as of now, there is no available algorithm that effectively assesses the immune status of normal, healthy individuals. In response to this, a new score-based method is proposed that utilizes complete blood cell counts (CBC) to provide early warning of disease risks, such as COVID-19.First, data on immune-related CBC measurements from 16,715 healthy individuals were collected. Then, a three-platform model was developed to normalize the data, and a Gaussian mixture model was optimized with expectation maximization (EM-GMM) to cluster the immune status of healthy individuals. Based on the results, Random Forest (RF), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) were used to determine the correlation of each CBC index with the immune status. Consequently, a weighted sum model was constructed to calculate a continuous immunity score, enabling the evaluation of immune status.The results demonstrated a significant negative correlation between the immunity score and the age of healthy individuals, thereby validating the effectiveness of the proposed method. In addition, a nonlinear polynomial regression model was developed to depict this trend. By comparing an individual's immune status with the reference value corresponding to their age, their immune status can be evaluated.In summary, this study has established a novel model for evaluating the immune status of healthy individuals, providing a good approach for early detection of abnormal immune status in healthy individuals. It is helpful in early warning of the risk of infectious diseases and of significant importance.© 2023. The Author(s).",1.66E-27

There is increasing evidence that sphingolipid metabolism is altered in childhood asthma and is linked to airway hyperreactivity. Dysregulated sphingolipid metabolism is also reported in obesity. However, the functional link between sphingolipid metabolism, asthma, and obesity is not completely understood. This paper describes the protocol of an ongoing study on sphingolipids that aims to examine the pathophysiology of sphingolipids in childhood asthma and obesity. In addition, this study aims to explore the novel biomarkers through a comprehensive multi-omics approach including genomics, genome-wide DNA methylation, RNA-Seq, microRNA (miRNA) profiling, lipidomics, metabolomics, and cytokine profiling. This is a cross-sectional study aiming to recruit 440 children from different groups: children with asthma and normal weight (n= 100), asthma with overweight or obesity (n= 100), overweight or obesity (n= 100), normal weight (n= 70), and siblings of asthmatic children with normal weight, overweight, or obesity (n= 70). These participants will be recruited from the pediatric pulmonology, pediatric endocrinology, and general pediatric outpatient clinics at Sidra Medicine, Doha, Qatar. Information will be obtained from self-reported questionnaires on asthma, quality of life, food frequency (FFQ), and a 3-day food diary that are completed by the children and their parents. Clinical measurements will include anthropometry, blood pressure, biochemistry, bioelectrical impedance, and pulmonary function tests. Blood samples will be obtained for sphingolipid analysis, serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) assay, whole-genome sequencing (WGS), genome-wide DNA methylation study, RNA-Seq, miRNA profiling, metabolomics, lipidomics, and cytokine analysis. Group comparisons of continuous outcome variables will be carried out by a one-way analysis of variance or the Kruskal-Wallis test using an appropriate pairwise multiple comparison test. The chi-squared test or a Fisher's exact test will be used to test the associations between categorical variables. Finally, multivariate analysis will be carried out to integrate the clinical data with multi-omics data. This study will help us to understand the role of dysregulated sphingolipid metabolism in obesity and asthma. In addition, the multi-omics data from the study will help to identify novel genetic and epigenetic signatures, inflammatory markers, and mechanistic pathways that link asthma and obesity in children. Furthermore, the integration of clinical and multi-omics data will help us to uncover the potential interactions between these diseases and to offer a new paradigm for the treatment of pediatric obesity-associated asthma.",1.58E-27
,38011555,The impact of COVID-19 on a college freshman sample reveals genetic and nongenetic forms of susceptibility and resilience to stress.,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,"Using a longitudinal approach, we sought to define the interplay between genetic and nongenetic factors in shaping vulnerability or resilience to COVID-19 pandemic stress, as indexed by the emergence of symptoms of depression and/or anxiety. University of Michigan freshmen were characterized at baseline using multiple psychological instruments. Subjects were genotyped, and a polygenic risk score for depression (MDD-PRS) was calculated. Daily physical activity and sleep were captured. Subjects were sampled at multiple time points throughout the freshman year on clinical rating scales, including GAD-7 and PHQ-9 for anxiety and depression, respectively. Two cohorts (2019 to 2021) were compared to a pre-COVID-19 cohort to assess the impact of the pandemic. Across cohorts, 26 to 40% of freshmen developed symptoms of anxiety or depression (N = 331). Depression symptoms significantly increased in the pandemic years and became more chronic, especially in females. Physical activity was reduced, and sleep was increased by the pandemic, and this correlated with the emergence of mood symptoms. While low MDD-PRS predicted lower risk for depression during a typical freshman year, this genetic advantage vanished during the pandemic. Indeed, females with lower genetic risk accounted for the majority of the pandemic-induced rise in depression. We developed a model that explained approximately half of the variance in follow-up depression scores based on psychological trait and state characteristics at baseline and contributed to resilience in genetically vulnerable subjects. We discuss the concept of multiple types of resilience, and the interplay between genetic, sex, and psychological factors in shaping the affective response to different types of stressors.",1.3E-27

Due to its highly polymorphic nature and complex linkage disequilibrium patterns, traditional genetic association studies of single nucleotide polymorphisms do not perform well in this region. Instead, the field has adopted the assessment of the association of HLA alleles (i.e., entire HLA gene haplotypes) with disease. Often based on genotyping arrays, these association studies impute HLA alleles, decreasing accuracy and thus statistical power for rare alleles and in non-European ancestries. Here, we use whole-exome sequencing (WES) from 454,824 UK Biobank (UKB) participants to directly call HLA alleles using the HLA-HD algorithm. We show this method is more accurate than imputing HLA alleles and harness the improved statistical power to identify 360 associations for 11 auto-immune phenotypes (at least 129 likely novel), leading to better insights into the specific coding polymorphisms that underlie these diseases. We show that HLA alleles with synonymous variants, often overlooked in HLA studies, can significantly influence these phenotypes. Lastly, we show that HLA sequencing may improve polygenic risk scores accuracy across ancestries. These findings allow better characterization of the role of the HLA region in human disease.© 2023.

While C9 NRE-containing RNAs can be translated into several toxic dipeptide repeat proteins, how an intronic NRE can assess the translation machinery in the cytoplasm remains unclear. By capturing and sequencing NRE-containing RNAs from patient-derived cells, we found that C9 NRE was exonized by the usage of downstream 5' splice sites and exported from the nucleus in a variety of spliced mRNA isoforms.C9ORF72aberrant splicing was substantially elevated in both C9 NRE+motor neurons and human brain tissues. Furthermore, NREs above the pathological threshold were sufficient to activate cryptic splice sites in reporter mRNAs. In summary, our results revealed a crucial and potentially widespread role of repeat-induced aberrant splicing in the biogenesis, localization, and translation of NRE-containing RNAs.",1.2E-27

DNA topoisomerases resolve DNA topological constraints and facilitate neuronal long gene expression. Conversely, the Rett syndrome protein, methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2), can transcriptionally repress long genes. How these factors regulate long genes is not well understood, and whether they interact is not known. Here, we identify and map a functional interaction between MeCP2 and topoisomerase II?

We show that loss and overexpression of MeCP2 alter TOP2? activity at MeCP2-regulated genes. These findings uncover a mechanism of TOP2? inhibition by MeCP2 in neurons and implicate TOP2? dysregulation in disorders caused by MeCP2 disruption.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

The local and systemic interactions between immune and cancer cells contribute to disease progression. Lymphocytes are activated in lymph nodes, traffic through the periphery, and impact cancer progression through their interactions with tumor cells. As a result, therapeutic response and resistance are mediated across tissues, and a comprehensive understanding of lymphocyte dynamics requires a systems-level approach. In this review, we highlight experimental and computational methods that can leverage the study of leukocyte trafficking through an immunomics lens and reveal how adaptive immunity shapes cancer.Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).

,37954573,Predictions of DNA mechanical properties at a genomic scale reveal potentially new functional roles of DNA flexibility.,NAR Genom Bioinform,"Mechanical properties of DNA have been implied to influence many of its biological functions. Recently, a new high-throughput method, called loop-seq, which allows measuring the intrinsic bendability of DNA fragments, has been developed. Using loop-seq data, we created a deep learning model to explore the biological significance of local DNA flexibility in a range of different species from different kingdoms. Consistently, we observed a characteristic and largely dinucleotide-composition-driven change of local flexibility near transcription start sites. In the presence of a TATA-box, a pronounced peak of high flexibility can be observed. Furthermore, depending on the transcription factor investigated, flanking-sequence-dependent DNA flexibility was identified as a potential factor influencing DNA binding. Compared to randomized genomic sequences, depending on species and taxa, actual genomic sequences were observed both with increased and lowered flexibility. Furthermore, inArabidopsis thaliana, mutation rates, bothde novoand fixed, were found to be associated with relatively rigid sequence regions. Our study presents a range of significant correlations between characteristic DNA mechanical properties and genomic features, the significance of which with regard to detailed molecular relevance awaits further theoretical and experimental exploration.© The Author(s) 2023.

However, there are many challenges to address before AI is ready for clinical practice. This review defines key AI concepts and discusses ethical considerations and implicit biases associated with AI. Next we will review literature examples of AI already being explored in neonatology research and we will suggest future potentials for AI work. Examples discussed in this article include predicting outcomes such as sepsis, optimizing oxygen therapy, and image analysis to detect brain injury and retinopathy of prematurity. Realizing AI's potential necessitates collaboration between diverse stakeholders across the entire process of incorporating AI tools in the NICU to address testability, usability, bias, and transparency.

We and others previously showed that paternal administration of dexamethasone in mice affects the phenotype of their offspring. The substrate of intergenerational transmission of environmentally induced effects often involves changes in sperm RNA, yet other epigenetic modifications in the germline can be affected and are also plausible candidates. First, we tested the involvement of altered sperm RNAs in the transmission of dexamethasone induced phenotypes across generations. We did this by injecting sperm RNA into naïve fertilized oocytes, before performing metabolic and behavioral phenotyping of the offspring. We observed phenotypic changes in discordance with those found in offspring generated by in vitro fertilization using sperm from dexamethasone exposed males. Second, we investigated the effect of dexamethasone on chromatin accessibility using ATAC sequencing and found significant changes at specific genomic features and gene regulatory loci. Employing q-RT-PCR, we show altered expression of a gene in the tissue of offspring affected by accessibility changes in sperm. Third, we establish a correlation between specific DNA modifications and stress hormone receptor activity as a likely contributing factor influencing sperm accessibility. Finally, we independently investigated this dependency by genetically reducing thymine-DNA glycosylase levels and observing concomitant changes at the level of chromatin accessibility and stress hormone receptor activity.© 2023.

Recent long-read human genome assemblies have allowed us to identify a function for one of these repetitive regions. We have uncovered a tandem array of conserved primate-specific retrogenes encoding the protein Elongin A3 (ELOA3), a homolog of the RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) elongation factor Elongin A (ELOA). Our genomic analysis shows that theELOA3gene cluster is conserved among primates and the number ofELOA3gene repeats is variable in the human population and across primate species. Moreover, the gene cluster has undergone concerted evolution and homogenization within primates. Our biochemical studies show that ELOA3 functions as a promoter-associated RNAPII pause-release elongation factor with distinct biochemical and functional features from its ancestral homolog, ELOA. We propose that theELOA3gene cluster has evolved to fulfil a transcriptional regulatory function unique to the primate lineage that can be targeted to regulate cellular hyperproliferation.",7.5E-28

Herein, we perform a bibliometric study to decipher how research topics in this field have evolved during the past 2 decades.Publications on epigenetics in CVD produced during the period 2000-2022 were retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC). We utilized Bibliometrix to build a science map of the publications and applied VOSviewer and CiteSpace to assess co-authorship, co-citation, co-occurrence, and bibliographic coupling. In total, 27,762 publications were included for bibliometric analysis. The yearly amount of publications experienced exponential growth. The top 3 most influential countries were China, the United States, and Germany, while the most cited institutions were Nanjing Medical University, Harbin Medical University, and Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Four major research trends were identified: (a) epigenetic mechanisms of CVD; (b) epigenetics-based therapies for CVD; (c) epigenetic profiles of specific CVDs; and (d) epigenetic biomarkers for CVD diagnosis/prediction. The latest and most important research topics, including ""nlrp3 inflammasome"", ""myocardial injury"", and ""reperfusion injury"", were determined by detecting citation bursts of co-occurring keywords. The most cited reference was a review of the current knowledge about how miRNAs recognize target genes and modulate their expression and function.The number and impact of global publications on epigenetics in CVD have expanded rapidly over time.

Understanding migraine chronification is vital for developing better treatment and prevention strategies. An important factor in the chronification of migraine is the overuse of acute headache medication. However, the mechanisms behind the transformation of episodic migraine to chronic migraine and vice versa have not yet been elucidated. We performed a longitudinal epigenome-wide association study to identify DNA methylation (DNAm) changes associated with treatment response in patients with chronic migraine and medication overuse as part of the Chronification and Reversibility of Migraine clinical trial. Blood was taken from patients with chronic migraine (n?=?98) at baseline and after a 12-week medication withdrawal period. Treatment responders, patients with???50% reduction in monthly headache days (MHD), were compared with non-responders to identify DNAm changes associated with treatment response. Similarly, patients with???50% versus?<?50% reduction in monthly migraine days (MMD) were compared.At the epigenome-wide significant level (p?<?9.42?×?10-8), a longitudinal reduction in DNAm at an intronic CpG site (cg14377273) within the HDAC4 gene was associated with MHD response following the withdrawal of acute medication. HDAC4 is highly expressed in the brain, plays a major role in synaptic plasticity, and modulates the expression and release of several neuroinflammation markers which have been implicated in migraine pathophysiology. Investigating whether baseline DNAm associated with treatment response, we identified lower baseline DNAm at a CpG site (cg15205829) within MARK3 that was significantly associated with MMD response at 12 weeks.Our findings of a longitudinal reduction in HDAC4 DNAm status associated with treatment response and baseline MARK3 DNAm status as an early biomarker for treatment response, provide support for a role of pathways related to chromatin structure and synaptic plasticity in headache chronification and introduce HDAC4 and MARK3 as novel therapeutic targets.© 2023.

,38003343,The AKI-to-CKD Transition: The Role of Uremic Toxins.,Int J Mol Sci,"After acute kidney injury (AKI), renal function continues to deteriorate in some patients. In a pro-inflammatory and profibrotic environment, the proximal tubules are subject to maladaptive repair. In the AKI-to-CKD transition, impaired recovery from AKI reduces tubular and glomerular filtration and leads to chronic kidney disease (CKD). Reduced kidney secretion capacity is characterized by the plasma accumulation of biologically active molecules, referred to as uremic toxins (UTs). These toxins have a role in the development of neurological, cardiovascular, bone, and renal complications of CKD. However, UTs might also cause CKD as well as be the consequence. Recent studies have shown that these molecules accumulate early in AKI and contribute to the establishment of this pro-inflammatory and profibrotic environment in the kidney. The objective of the present work was to review the mechanisms of UT toxicity that potentially contribute to the AKI-to-CKD transition in each renal compartment.",5.39E-28

While PGBs have a detrimental effect on cognition in diseases such as adult polyglucosan body disease and Lafora disease, the underlying mechanism and clinical relevance of age-related PGB accumulation remains unknown. Here, we have investigated the genetic basis and functional impact of age-related PGB accumulation in 32 fully sequenced BXD-type strains of mice which exhibit a 400-fold variation in PGB burden in 16-18 month old females. We mapped a major locus controlling PGB density in the hippocampus to chromosome 1 at 72-75 Mb (linkage of 4.9 -logP), which we defined as thePgb1locus. To identify potentially causal gene variants withinPgb1, we generated extensive hippocampal transcriptome datasets and identified two strong candidate genes for which mRNA correlates with PGB density-Smarcal1andUsp37. In addition, bothSmarcal1andUsp37contain non-synonymous allele variations likely to impact protein function. A phenome-wide association analysis highlighted a trans-regulatory effect of thePgb1locus on expression ofHp1bp3, a gene known to play a role in age-related changes in learning and memory. To investigate the potential impact of PGBs on cognition, we performed conditioned fear memory testing on strains displaying varying degrees of PGB burden, and a phenome-wide association scan of ~12,000 traits. Importantly, we did not find any evidence suggesting a negative impact of PGB burden on cognitive capacity. Taken together, we have identified a major modifier locus controlling PGB burden in the hippocampus and shed light on the genetic architecture and clinical relevance of this strikingly heterogeneous hippocampal phenotype.",4.68E-28

However, current multiomics methods are frequently limited to one or two modalities at a time, making it challenging to obtain a comprehensive gene regulatory signature. Here, we describe a method-3D genome, RNA, accessibility and methylation sequencing (3DRAM-seq)-that simultaneously interrogates spatial genome organization, chromatin accessibility and DNA methylation genome-wide and at high resolution. We combine 3DRAM-seq with immunoFACS and RNA sequencing in cortical organoids to map the cell-type-specific regulatory landscape of human neural development across multiple epigenetic layers. Finally, we apply a massively parallel reporter assay to profile cell-type-specific enhancer activity in organoids and to functionally assess the role of key transcription factors for human enhancer activation and function.

Many cell types mediate their functions through targeted long-distance projections allowing interactions between specific cell types. Here we used epi-retro-seq2to link single-cell epigenomes and cell types to long-distance projections for 33,034 neurons dissected from 32 different regions projecting to 24 different targets (225 source-to-target combinations) across the whole mouse brain. We highlight uses of these data for interrogating principles relating projection types to transcriptomics and epigenomics, and for addressing hypotheses about cell types and connections related to genetics. We provide an overall synthesis with 926 statistical comparisons of discriminability of neurons projecting to each target for every source. We integrate this dataset into the larger BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network atlas, composed of millions of neurons, to link projection cell types to consensus clusters. Integration with spatial transcriptomics further assigns projection-enriched clusters to smaller source regions than the original dissections. We exemplify this by presenting in-depth analyses of projection neurons from the hypothalamus, thalamus, hindbrain, amygdala and midbrain to provide insights into properties of those cell types, including differentially expressed genes, their associated cis-regulatory elements and transcription-factor-binding motifs, and neurotransmitter use.© 2023.

,38064531,"Three common assumptions about inflammation, aging, and health that are probably wrong.",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,"Chronic inflammation contributes to the onset and progression of cardiovascular disease and other degenerative diseases of aging. But does it have to? This article considers the associations among inflammation, aging, and health through the lens of human population biology and suggests that chronic inflammation is not a normal nor inevitable component of aging. It is commonly assumed that conclusions drawn from research in affluent, industrialized countries can be applied globally; that aging processes leading to morbidity and mortality begin in middle age; and that inflammation is pathological. These foundational assumptions have shifted focus away from inflammation as a beneficial response to infection or injury and toward an understanding of inflammation as chronic, dysregulated, and dangerous. Findings from community-based studies around the world-many conducted in areas with relatively high burdens of infectious disease-challenge these assumptions by documenting substantial variation in levels of inflammation and patterns of association with disease. They also indicate that nutritional, microbial, and psychosocial environments in infancy and childhood play important roles in shaping inflammatory phenotypes and their contributions to diseases of aging. A comparative, developmental, and ecological approach has the potential to generate novel insights into the regulation of inflammation and how it relates to human health over the life course.",3.83E-28

Current research focuses on identifying aging biomarkers to predict aging trajectories and developing interventions aimed at preventing and delaying the progression of multimorbidity with aging. Here, a transcriptomic changes analysis of whole blood genes with age was conducted. The age-related whole blood gene-expression profiling datasets were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. We screened the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between healthy young and old individuals and performed functional enrichment analysis. Cytoscape with Cytohubba and MCODE was used to perform an interaction network of DEGs and identify hub genes. In addition, ROC curves and correlation analysis were used to evaluate the accuracy of hub genes. In total, we identified 29 DEGs between young and old samples that were enriched mainly in immunoglobulin binding and complex, humoral immune response, and immune response-activating signaling pathways. In combination with the PPI network and topological analysis, 4 hub genes (IGLL5, Jchain, POU2AF1, and Bach2) were identified. Pearson analysis showed that the expression changes of these hub genes were highly correlated with age. Among them, 3 hub genes (IGLL5, POU2AF1, and Bach2) were identified with good accuracy (AUC score?>?0.7), indicating that these genes were the best indicators of age. Together, our results provided potential biomarkers IGLL5, POU2AF1, and Bach2 to identify individuals at high early risk of age-related disease to be targeted for early interventions and contribute to understanding the molecular mechanisms in the progression of aging.Copyright © 2023 the Author(s).

However, while cannabinoid receptors are expressed in the early embryo, the impact of phytocannabinoids exposure on early embryonic processes is lacking. Here, we leverage a stepwise in vitro differentiation system that captures the early embryonic developmental cascade to investigate the impact of exposure to the most abundant phytocannabinoid, ?9-tetrahydrocannabinol (?9-THC). We demonstrate that ?9-THC increases the proliferation of naive mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) but not of their primed counterpart. Surprisingly, this increased proliferation, dependent on the CB1 receptor binding, is only associated with moderate transcriptomic changes. Instead, ?9-THC capitalizes on ESCs' metabolic bivalence by increasing their glycolytic rates and anabolic capabilities. A memory of this metabolic rewiring is retained throughout differentiation to Primordial Germ Cell-Like Cells in the absence of direct exposure and is associated with an alteration of their transcriptional profile. These results represent the first in-depth molecular characterization of the impact of ?9-THC exposure on early stages of germline development.© 2023, Verdikt et al.",2.97E-28

However, whether T2DM is causally associated with PTB is unknown owing to limited evidence from prospective studies. Consequently, the present study aimed to clarify the genetic causality between T2DM and PTB on the basis of Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis.Genetic variants for T2DM and PTB were obtained from the IEU OpenGWAS project. The inverse variance weighted method was used as the main statistical analysis method and was supplemented with MR-Egger, weighted median, simple mode, and weighted mode methods. Heterogeneity was analyzed using Cochran's Q statistic. Horizontal pleiotropy was assessed using the MR-PRESSO global test and MR-Egger regression. Robustness of the results was verified using the leave-one-out method.A total of 152 independent single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected as instrumental variables (IVs) to assess the genetic causality between T2DM and PTB. Patients with T2DM had a higher risk of PTB at the genetic level (odds ratio (OR) for MR-Egger was 1.550, OR for weighted median was 1.540, OR for inverse variance weighted was 1.191, OR for simple mode was 1.629, OR for weighted mode was 1.529). There was no horizontal pleiotropy or heterogeneity among IVs. The results were stable when removing the SNPs one by one.This is the first comprehensive MR analysis that revealed the genetic causality between T2DM and PTB in the East Asian population.

Insulin resistance involves both short-term dynamics, such as altered meal responses, and long-term dynamics, such as the development of type 2 diabetes. Insulin resistance also occurs on different physiological levels, ranging from disease phenotypes to organ-organ communication and intracellular signaling. To better understand the progression of insulin resistance, an analysis method is needed that can combine different timescales and physiological levels. One such method is digital twins, consisting of combined mechanistic mathematical models. We have previously developed a model for short-term glucose homeostasis and intracellular insulin signaling, and there exist long-term weight regulation models. Herein, we combine these models into a first interconnected digital twin for the progression of insulin resistance in humans.The model is based on ordinary differential equations representing biochemical and physiological processes, in which unknown parameters were fitted to data using a MATLAB toolbox.The interconnected twin correctly predicts independent data from a weight increase study, both for weight-changes, fasting plasma insulin and glucose levels, and intracellular insulin signaling. Similarly, the model can predict independent weight-change data in a weight loss study with the weight loss drug topiramate. The model can also predict non-measured variables.The model presented herein constitutes the basis for a new digital twin technology, which in the future could be used to aid medical pedagogy and increase motivation and compliance and thus aid in the prevention and treatment of insulin resistance.© 2023.

For this reason, newer methods for GWAS have been developed, including the use of pan-genomes instead of a reference genome and the utilization of markers beyond single-nucleotide polymorphisms, such as structural variations and k-mers. The k-mers-based GWAS approach has especially gained attention from researchers in recent years. However, these new methodologies can be complicated and challenging to implement.

,38064506,Late-life shift in caloric intake affects fly metabolism and longevity.,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,"The prevalence of obesity is increasing in older adults and contributes to age-related decline. Caloric restriction (CR) alleviates obesity phenotypes and delays the onset of age-related changes. However, how late in life organisms benefit from switching from a high-(H) to a low-calorie (L) diet is unclear. We transferred male flies from a H to a L (HL) diet or vice versa (LH) at different times during life. Both shifts immediately change fly rate of aging even when applied late in life. HL shift rapidly reduces fly mortality rate to briefly lower rate than in flies on a constant L diet, and extends lifespan. Transcriptomic analysis uncovers that flies aged on H diet have acquired increased stress response, which may have temporal advantage over flies aged on L diet and leads to rapid decrease in mortality rate after HL switch. Conversely, a LH shift increases mortality rate, which is temporarily higher than in flies aged on a H diet, and shortens lifespan. Unexpectedly, more abundant transcriptomic changes accompanied LH shift, including increase in ribosome biogenesis, stress response and growth. These changes reflect protection from sudden release of ROS, energy storage, and use of energy to growth, which all likely contribute to higher mortality rate.

The parent GEO datasets were originally produced from the cerebellar and parietal lobe tissue of deceased bipolar patients and healthy controls, using Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST Array.Patients and controls were classified into two separate groups, with no close-to-the-boundary cases, and this classification was based on the cerebellar transcriptomic biosignature of 25 features (genes), with Area Under Curve 0.929 and Average Precision 0.955. The biosignature includes both genes connected before to bipolar disorder, depression, psychosis or epilepsy, as well as genes not linked before with any psychiatric disease. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis revealed participation of 4 identified features in 6 pathways which have also been associated with bipolar disorder.Automated machine learning (AutoML) managed to identify accurately 25 genes that can jointly - in a multivariate-fashion - separate bipolar patients from healthy controls with high predictive power. The discovered features lead to new biological insights. Machine Learning (ML) analysis considers the features in combination (in contrast to standard differential expression analysis), removing both irrelevant as well as redundant markers, and thus, focusing to biological interpretation.© 2023 The Authors.",1.45E-28
,37955230,Androgen signaling stabilizes genomes to counteract senescence by promoting XRCC4 transcription.,EMBO Rep,"Aging is accompanied by a decreased DNA repair capacity, which might contribute to age-associated functional decline in multiple tissues. Disruption in hormone signaling, associated with reproductive organ dysfunction, is an early event of age-related tissue degeneration, but whether it impacts DNA repair in nonreproductive organs remains elusive. Using skin fibroblasts derived from healthy donors with a broad age range, we show here that the downregulation of expression of XRCC4, a factor involved in nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) repair, which is the dominant pathway to repair somatic double-strand breaks, is mediated through transcriptional mechanisms. We show that the androgen receptor (AR), whose expression is also reduced during aging, directly binds to and enhances the activity of the XRCC4 promoter, facilitating XRCC4 transcription and thus stabilizing the genome. We also demonstrate that dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a powerful AR agonist, restores XRCC4 expression and stabilizes the genome in different models of cellular aging. Moreover, DHT treatment reverses senescence-associated phenotypes, opening a potential avenue to aging interventions in the future.© 2023 The Authors.",1.41E-28
,38053207,Role of the CASZ1 transcription factor in tissue development and disease.,Eur J Med Res,"The zinc finger transcription factor gene, CASZ1/Castor (Castor zinc finger 1), initially identified in Drosophila, plays a critical role in neural, cardiac, and cardiovascular development, exerting a complex, multifaceted influence on cell fate and tissue morphogenesis. During neurogenesis, CASZ1 exhibits dynamic expression from early embryonic development to the perinatal period, constituting a key regulator in this process. Additionally, CASZ1 controls the transition between neurogenesis and gliomagenesis. During human cardiovascular system development, CASZ1 is essential for cardiomyocyte differentiation, cardiac morphogenesis, and vascular morphology homeostasis and formation. The deletion or inactivation of CASZ1 mutations can lead to human developmental diseases or tumors, including congenital heart disease, cardiovascular disease, and neuroblastoma. CASZ1 can be used as a biomarker for disease prevention and diagnosis as well as a prognostic indicator for cancer. This review explores the unique functions of CASZ1 in tissue morphogenesis and associated diseases, offering new insights for elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying diseases and identifying potential therapeutic targets for disease prevention and treatment.© 2023.

The objectives of this study were to use preselected variants from a large GWAS meta-analysis to assess the impact of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) preselection strategies on genome prediction of growth and carcass traits in pigs. We genotyped 1018 Large White pigs using medium (50k) SNP arrays and then imputed SNPs to sequence level by utilizing a reference panel of 1602 whole-genome sequencing samples. We tested the effects of different proportions of selected top SNPs across different SNP preselection strategies on genomic prediction. Finally, we compared the prediction accuracies by employing genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP), genomic feature BLUP and three weighted GBLUP models. SNP preselection strategies showed an average improvement in accuracy ranging from 0.3 to 2% in comparison to the SNP chip data. The accuracy of genomic prediction exhibited a pattern of initial increase followed by decrease, or continuous decrease across various SNP preselection strategies, as the proportion of selected top SNPs increased. The highest level of prediction accuracy was observed when utilizing 1 or 5% of top SNPs. Compared with the GBLUP model, the utilization of estimated marker effects from a GWAS meta-analysis as SNP weights in the BLUP|GA model improved the accuracy of genomic prediction in different SNP preselection strategies. The new SNP preselection strategies gained from this study bring opportunities for genomic prediction in limited-size populations in pigs.",1.3E-28

However, such published data are underutilized for knowledge discovery. To make bioinformatics tools and published omics datasets from the diabetes field more accessible to biomedical researchers, we developed the Diabetes Data and Hypothesis Hub (D2H2).D2H2 contains hundreds of high-quality curated transcriptomics datasets relevant to diabetes, accessible via a user-friendly web-based portal. The collected and processed datasets are curated from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Each curated study has a dedicated page that provides data visualization, differential gene expression analysis, and single-gene queries. To enable the investigation of these curated datasets and to provide easy access to bioinformatics tools that serve gene and gene set-related knowledge, we developed the D2H2 chatbot. Utilizing GPT, we prompt users to enter free text about their data analysis needs. Parsing the user prompt, together with specifying information about all D2H2 available tools and workflows, we answer user queries by invoking the most relevant tools via the tools' API. D2H2 also has a hypotheses generation module where gene sets are randomly selected from the bulk RNA-seq precomputed signatures. We then find highly overlapping gene sets extracted from publications listed in PubMed Central with abstract dissimilarity. With the help of GPT, we speculate about a possible explanation of the high overlap between the gene sets. Overall, D2H2 is a platform that provides a suite of bioinformatics tools and curated transcriptomics datasets for hypothesis generation.D2H2 is available at: https://d2h2.maayanlab.cloud/ and the source code is available from GitHub at https://github.com/MaayanLab/D2H2-site under the CC BY-NC 4.0 license.© The Author(s) 2023.

This study aims to characterize eventual causal relationships between ADAM17 and COVID-19. Using Mendelian randomization analyses, we examined the causal effects of circulating ADAM17 on COVID-19 outcomes using summary statistics from large, genome-wide association studies of ADAM17 (up to 35,559 individuals) from the Icelandic Cancer Project and deCODE genetics, as well as critically ill COVID-19 patients (cases: 13,769; controls: 1,072,442), hospitalized COVID-19 patients (cases: 32,519; controls: 2,062,805) and reported SARS-CoV-2 infections (cases: 122,616; controls: 2,475,240) from the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative. The Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses demonstrated that a 1 standard deviation increase in genetically determined circulating ADAM17 (extracellular domain) was associated with an increased risk of developing critical ill COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR] = 1.26, 95% confidence interval [CI]:1.03-1.55). The multivariable MR analysis suggested a direct causal role of circulating ADAM17 (extracellular domain) in the risk of developing critical COVID-19 (OR = 1.09; 95% CI:1.01-1.17) when accounting for body mass index. No causal effect for the cytoplasmic domain of ADAM17 on COVID-19 was observed. Our results suggest that an increased genetic susceptibility to elevated levels of circulating ADAM17 (extracellular domain) is associated with a higher risk of suffering from severe COVID-19, strengthening the idea that the timely selective inhibition of ADAM17 could be a potential therapeutic target worthy of investigation.",1.15E-28
,37965894,Excessive apoptosis of Rip1-deficient T cells leads to premature aging.,EMBO Rep,"In mammals, the most remarkable T cell variations with aging are the shrinking of the naïve T cell pool and the enlargement of the memory T cell pool, which are partially caused by thymic involution. However, the mechanism underlying the relationship between T-cell changes and aging remains unclear. In this study, we find that T-cell-specific Rip1 KO mice show similar age-related T cell changes and exhibit signs of accelerated aging-like phenotypes, including inflammation, multiple age-related diseases, and a shorter lifespan. Mechanistically, Rip1-deficient T cells undergo excessive apoptosis and promote chronic inflammation. Consistent with this, blocking apoptosis by co-deletion of Fadd in Rip1-deficient T cells significantly rescues lymphopenia, the imbalance between naïve and memory T cells, and aging-like phenotypes, and prolongs life span in T-cell-specific Rip1 KO mice. These results suggest that the reduction and hyperactivation of T cells can have a significant impact on organismal health and lifespan, underscoring the importance of maintaining T cell homeostasis for healthy aging and prevention or treatment of age-related diseases.© 2023 The Authors.",1.01E-28

This approach involves using latency-reversing agents (LRAs) to activate human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) transcription in latent cells, followed by treatment with antiviral drugs to kill these cells. Although LRAs have shown promise in HIV-1 patient research, their widespread clinical use is hindered by side effects and limitations.

A salient concern in the western dietary context is the high consumption of methionine-rich foods such as red meat. The present review delves into the impact of this methionine-heavy diet and the resultant hyperhomocysteinemia on accelerated cerebrovascular and brain aging, emphasizing their potential roles in cognitive impairment. Through a comprehensive exploration of existing evidence, a link between high methionine intake and hyperhomocysteinemia and oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, and accelerated epigenetic aging is drawn. Moreover, the microvascular determinants of cognitive deterioration, including endothelial dysfunction, reduced cerebral blood flow, microvascular rarefaction, impaired neurovascular coupling, and blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, are explored. The mechanisms by which excessive methionine consumption and hyperhomocysteinemia might drive cerebromicrovascular and brain aging processes are elucidated. By presenting an intricate understanding of the relationships among methionine-rich diets, hyperhomocysteinemia, cerebrovascular and brain aging, and cognitive impairment, avenues for future research and potential therapeutic interventions are suggested.",9.46E-29
,38010480,Role of Flow-Sensitive Endothelial Genes in Atherosclerosis and Antiatherogenic Therapeutics Development.,J Cardiovasc Transl Res,"Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease that is the underlying cause of cardiovascular disease which initiates from endothelial dysfunction from genetic and environmental risk factors, including biomechanical forces: blood flow. Endothelial cells (ECs) lining the inner arterial wall regions exposed to disturbed flow are prone to atherosclerosis development, whereas the straight regions exposed to stable flow are spared from the disease. These flow patterns induce genome- and epigenome-wide changes in gene expression in ECs. Through the sweeping changes in gene expression, disturbed flow reprograms ECs from athero-protected cell types under the stable flow condition to pro-atherogenic cell conditions. The pro-atherogenic changes induced by disturbed flow, in combination with additional risk factors such as hypercholesterolemia, lead to the progression of atherosclerosis. The flow-sensitive genes and proteins are critical in understanding the mechanisms and serve as novel targets for antiatherogenic therapeutics.© 2023.

Here, we report whole-genome long and short read sequencing analysis of 76 lung cancers, focusing on very early-stage lung adenocarcinomas such as adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) and minimally invasive adenocarcinoma. The obtained data is further integrated with bulk and spatial transcriptomic data and epigenomic data. These analyses reveal key events in lung carcinogenesis. Minimal somatic mutations in pivotal driver mutations and essential proliferative factors are the only detectable somatic mutations in the very early-stage of AIS. These initial events are followed by copy number changes and global DNA hypomethylation. Particularly, drastic changes are initiated at the later AIS stage, i.e., in Noguchi type B tumors, wherein cancer cells are exposed to the surrounding microenvironment.

However, previous genomic approaches, unable to span long telomeric repeat arrays, could not characterize the nature of these alterations. Here, we applied both long-read and short-read genome sequencing to assess telomere repeat-containing structures in cancers and cancer cell lines. Using long-read genome sequences that span telomeric repeat arrays, we defined four types of telomere repeat variations in cancer cells: neotelomeres where telomere addition heals chromosome breaks, chromosomal arm fusions spanning telomere repeats, fusions of neotelomeres, and peri-centromeric fusions with adjoined telomere and centromere repeats. Analysis of lung adenocarcinoma genome sequences identified somatic neotelomere and telomere-spanning fusion alterations. These results provide a framework for systematic study of telomeric repeat arrays in cancer genomes, that could serve as a model for understanding the somatic evolution of other repetitive genomic elements.",7.46E-29
,37942285,Evaluation of input data modality choices on functional gene embeddings.,NAR Genom Bioinform,"Functional gene embeddings, numerical vectors capturing gene function, provide a promising way to integrate functional gene information into machine learning models. These embeddings are learnt by applying self-supervised machine-learning algorithms on various data types including quantitative omics measurements, protein-protein interaction networks and literature. However, downstream evaluations comparing alternative data modalities used to construct functional gene embeddings have been lacking. Here we benchmarked functional gene embeddings obtained from various data modalities for predicting disease-gene lists, cancer drivers, phenotype-gene associations and scores from genome-wide association studies. Off-the-shelf predictors trained on precomputed embeddings matched or outperformed dedicated state-of-the-art predictors, demonstrating their high utility. Embeddings based on literature and protein-protein interactions inferred from low-throughput experiments outperformed embeddings derived from genome-wide experimental data (transcriptomics, deletion screens and protein sequence) when predicting curated gene lists. In contrast, they did not perform better when predicting genome-wide association signals and were biased towards highly-studied genes. These results indicate that embeddings derived from literature and low-throughput experiments appear favourable in many existing benchmarks because they are biased towards well-studied genes and should therefore be considered with caution. Altogether, our study and precomputed embeddings will facilitate the development of machine-learning models in genetics and related fields.© The Author(s) 2023.

The pinewood nematode (PWN;Bursaphelenchus xylophilus), the causative agent of pine wilt disease, survives at low temperatures through third-stage dispersal juvenile, making it a major pathogen for pines in Asia. To comprehend the impact of DNA methylation on the formation and environmental adaptation of third-stage dispersal juvenile, we conducted whole-genome bisulfite sequencing and transcriptional sequencing on both the third-stage dispersal juvenile and three other propagative juvenile stages of PWN. Our findings revealed that the average methylation rate of cytosine in the samples ranged from 0.89% to 0.99%. Moreover, we observed significant DNA methylation changes in the third-stage dispersal juvenile and the second-stage propagative juvenile of PWN, including differentially methylated cytosine (DMCs,n= 435) and regions (DMRs,n= 72). In the joint analysis of methylation-associated transcription, we observed that 23 genes exhibited overlap between differentially methylated regions and differential gene expression during the formation of the third-stage dispersal juvenile of PWN. Further functional analysis of these genes revealed enrichment in processes related to lipid metabolism and fatty acid synthesis. These findings emphasize the significance of DNA methylation in the development of third-stage dispersal juvenile of PWN, as it regulates transcription to enhance the probability of rapid expansion in PWN.",7.03E-29

This classifier has at least 97% sensitivity and 99% specificity to detect variants pathogenic for NDD, substantially out-performing in silico predictors, and resolving up to 93% of variants of uncertain significance. Moreover, functionally-abnormal variants can account for almost all of the excess nonsynonymous DDX3X somatic mutations seen in DDX3X-driven cancers.

First, we describe the general neurobiology of the stress response to define neurocognitive stress reactivity. Second, we review aspects of epigenetic regulation, synaptic transmission, sex hormones, photoperiodic plasticity, and psychoneuroimmunological processes that can contribute to cognitive decline and neuropsychiatric conditions. Third, we explain mechanistic processes linking the stress response and neuropathology. Fourth, we discuss molecular nuances such as an interplay between kinases and proteins, as well as differential role of sex hormones, that can increase vulnerability to cognitive and emotional dysregulation following stress. Finally, we explicate several testable hypotheses for stress, neurocognitive, and neuropsychiatric research. Together, this work highlights how stress processes alter neurophysiology on multiple levels to increase individuals' risk for neurocognitive and psychiatric disorders, and points toward novel therapeutic targets for mitigating these effects.

The biological mechanisms promoting APNS are currently unknown, but the microbiota-gut-brain axis offers an avenue to understanding mechanisms as well as possibilities for intervention. Microbiome composition after trauma exposure has been poorly examined regarding neuropsychiatric outcomes. We aimed to determine whether the gut microbiomes of trauma-exposed emergency department patients who develop APNS have dysfunctional gut microbiome profiles and discover potential associated mechanisms. We performed metagenomic analysis on stool samples (n?=?51) from a subset of adults enrolled in the Advancing Understanding of RecOvery afteR traumA (AURORA) study. Two-, eight- and twelve-week post-trauma outcomes for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (PTSD checklist for DSM-5), normalized depression scores (PROMIS Depression Short Form 8b) and somatic symptom counts were collected. Generalized linear models were created for each outcome using microbial abundances and relevant demographics. Mixed-effect random forest machine learning models were used to identify associations between APNS outcomes and microbial features and encoded metabolic pathways from stool metagenomics. Microbial species, including Flavonifractor plautii, Ruminococcus gnavus and, Bifidobacterium species, which are prevalent commensal gut microbes, were found to be important in predicting worse APNS outcomes from microbial abundance data. Notably, through APNS outcome modeling using microbial metabolic pathways, worse APNS outcomes were highly predicted by decreased L-arginine related pathway genes and increased citrulline and ornithine pathways. Common commensal microbial species are enriched in individuals who develop APNS. More notably, we identified a biological mechanism through which the gut microbiome reduces global arginine bioavailability, a metabolic change that has also been demonstrated in the plasma of patients with PTSD.© 2023.

Novel drug targets for MI prevention are urgently needed. In this study, we used Mendelian randomization to identify potential therapeutic targets for MI using plasma protein quantitative trait loci as exposure variables and MI as the outcome variable. We further validated our findings using reverse causation analysis, Bayesian co-localization analysis, and external datasets. We also constructed a protein-protein interaction network to explore the relationships between the identified proteins and known MI targets. Our analysis revealed 2 proteins, LPA and APOA5, as potential drug targets for MI, with causal effects on MI risk confirmed by multiple lines of evidence. LPA and APOA5 are involved in lipid metabolism and interact with target proteins of current MI medications. We also found 4 other proteins, IL1RN, FN1, NT5C, and SEMA3C, that may have potential as drug targets but require further confirmation.

This commentary describes the utility of a computationally designed protein, EED Binder (EB), when fused to dCas9 (EBdCas9) for identifying critical sites of PRC2 dependent histone H3K27me3 marks in the chromatin. By using EBdCas9 and gRNA, PRC2 function can be inhibited at specific loci, resulting in precise reduction of EZH2 and H3K27me3 marks, and in some (but not all) locations, activation of the gene and functional outcomes (such as regulation of cell cycle or trophoblast transdifferentiation). Interestingly, a functional TATA box located more than 500bp upstream of a TBX18 TSS was found to be repressed by PRC2, supporting the theory that epigenetic regulators control the repression of transcriptional elements on the promoter region. The EBdCas9 technology may provide a useful tool for controlling gene regulation through epigenomic control.",3.18E-29
,38062235,Investigating the impact of paternal aging on murine sperm miRNA profiles and their potential link to autism spectrum disorder.,Sci Rep,"Paternal aging has consistently been linked to an increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), in offspring. Recent evidence has highlighted the involvement of epigenetic factors. In this study, we aimed to investigate age-related alterations in microRNA (miRNA) profiles of mouse sperm and analyze target genes regulated by differentially expressed miRNAs (DEmiRNAs). Microarray analyses were conducted on sperm samples from mice at different ages: 3 months (3 M), over 12 M, and beyond 20 M. We identified 26 miRNAs with differential expression between the 3 and 20 M mice, 34 miRNAs between the 12 and 20 M mice, and 2 miRNAs between the 3 and 12 M mice. The target genes regulated by these miRNAs were significantly associated with apoptosis/ferroptosis pathways and the nervous system. We revealed alterations in sperm miRNA profiles due to aging and suggest that the target genes regulated by these DEmiRNAs are associated with apoptosis and the nervous system, implying a potential link between paternal aging and an increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders such as ASD. The observed age-related changes in sperm miRNA profiles have the potential to impact sperm quality and subsequently affect offspring development.© 2023. The Author(s).",2.53E-29

In this context, we induced the T2DM mice model with a high-fat diet (HFD) combined with streptozotocin (STZ), followed by treatment with a quinoa diet. To explore the impact of quinoa on the intestinal flora, we predicted and validated its potential mechanism of hypoglycemic effect through network pharmacology, molecular docking, western blot, and immunohistochemistry (IHC). We found that quinoa could significantly improve abnormal glucolipid metabolism in T2DM mice. Further analysis showed that quinoa contributed to the improvement of gut microbiota composition positively. Moreover, it could downregulate the expression of TAS1R3 and TRPM5 in the colon. A total of 72 active components were identified by network pharmacology. Among them, TAS1R3 and TRPM5 were successfully docked with the core components of quinoa. These findings confirm that quinoa may exert hypoglycemic effects through gut microbiota and the TAS1R3/TRPM5 taste signaling pathway.© 2023 The Authors.

Advances in the past decade and a half have considerably increased the understanding of Eph receptor-ephrin signalling mechanisms in cancer and have uncovered intriguing new roles in cancer progression and drug resistance. This Review focuses mainly on these more recent developments. I provide an update on the different mechanisms of Eph receptor-ephrin-mediated cell-cell communication and cell autonomous signalling, as well as on the interplay of the Eph system with other signalling systems. I further discuss recent advances in elucidating how the Eph system controls tumour expansion, invasiveness and metastasis, supports cancer stem cells, and drives therapy resistance. In addition to functioning within cancer cells, the Eph system also mediates the reciprocal communication between cancer cells and cells of the tumour microenvironment. The involvement of the Eph system in tumour angiogenesis is well established, but recent findings also demonstrate roles in immune cells, cancer-associated fibroblasts and the extracellular matrix. Lastly, I discuss strategies under evaluation for therapeutic targeting of Eph receptors-ephrins in cancer and conclude with an outlook on promising future research directions.© 2023.

In addition, NLR is significantly higher in pediatric patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) than those without. Nevertheless, its role in pediatric patients with concomitant asthmatic exacerbation and CAP remains unknown.In this retrospective study including 1032 pediatric patients aged 5 to 14 years old, the diagnostic and prognostic value of NLR in children with concomitant asthmatic exacerbation and non-severe CAP were investigated.The sensitivity and specificity of NLR for a diagnosis of CAP in patients with asthmatic exacerbation were 56.9% and 90.1%, respectively. The cutoff value of NLR for a diagnosis of CAP in patients with asthmatic exacerbation was 4.15 (P?<?0.001). The cumulative asthmatic exacerbation during 3-month followup of patients with high NLR were 23 (21.3%) and 58 (42.0%) in the asthma and asthmatic CAP groups, respectively (P?<?0.001). The patients with high NLR who had unimproved CAP were 15 (8.3%) and 23 (12.2%) in the CAP and asthmatic CAP groups, respectively (P?=?0.006).

Here, we perform single-cell RNA-sequencing and ATAC-sequencing on 42 and 39 human cell lines, respectively, to illustrate both transcriptomic and epigenetic heterogeneity within individual cell lines. Our data reveal that transcriptomic heterogeneity is frequently observed in cancer cell lines of different tissue origins, often driven by multiple common transcriptional programs. Copy number variation, as well as epigenetic variation and extrachromosomal DNA distribution all contribute to the detected intra-cell-line heterogeneity. Using hypoxia treatment as an example, we demonstrate that transcriptomic heterogeneity could be reshaped by environmental stress. Overall, our study performs single-cell multi-omics of commonly used human cancer cell lines and offers mechanistic insights into the intra-cell-line heterogeneity and its dynamics, which would serve as an important resource for future cancer cell line-based studies.© 2023.

According to the most recent trials, DC seems to increase survival in case of refractory intracranial pressure. On the other hand, the risk of postsurgical poor outcomes remain high. The present study aimed to evaluate a series of preoperative factors potentially impacting on long-term follow-up of traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients treated with DC.We analyzed the first follow-up year of a series of 75 TBI patients treated with DC at our department in five years (2015-2019). Demographic, clinical, and radiological parameters were retrospectively collected from clinical records. Blood examinations were analyzed to calculate the preoperative neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR). Disability rating scale (DRS) was used to classify patients' outcomes (good outcome [G.O.] if DRS ?11 and poor outcome [P.O.] if DRS ?12) at 6 and 12 months.At six months follow-up, 25 out of 75 patients had DRS ?11, while at 12 months, 30 out of 75 patients were included in the G.O. group . Admission Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) >8 was significantly associated with six months G.O. Increased NLR values and the interval between DC and cranioplasty >3 months were significantly correlated to a P.O. at 6- and 12-month follow-up.Since DC still represents a controversial therapeutic strategy, selecting parameters to help stratify TBI patients' potential outcomes is paramount. GCS at admission, the interval between DC and cranioplasty, and preoperative NLR values seem to correlate with the long-term outcome.Copyright: © 2023 Surgical Neurology International.",1.14E-29

To characterize missing SVs in short-read whole genomes, we analyzed 'loose ends'-local violations of mass balance between adjacent DNA segments. In the landscape of loose ends across 1,330 high-purity cancer whole genomes, most large (>10-kb) clonal SVs were fully resolved by short reads in the 87% of the human genome where copy number could be reliably measured. Some loose ends represent neotelomeres, which we propose as a hallmark of the alternative lengthening of telomeres phenotype. These pan-cancer findings were confirmed by long-molecule profiles of 38 breast cancer and melanoma cases. Our results indicate that aberrant homologous recombination is unlikely to drive the majority of large cancer SVs. Furthermore, analysis of mass balance in short-read whole genome data provides a surprisingly complete picture of cancer chromosomal structure.© 2023. The Author(s).",1.01E-29

,38102551,A novel and innovative cancer classification framework through a consecutive utilization of hybrid feature selection.,BMC Bioinformatics,"Cancer prediction in the early stage is a topic of major interest in medicine since it allows accurate and efficient actions for successful medical treatments of cancer. Mostly cancer datasets contain various gene expression levels as features with less samples, so firstly there is a need to eliminate similar features to permit faster convergence rate of classification algorithms. These features (genes) enable us to identify cancer disease, choose the best prescription to prevent cancer and discover deviations amid different techniques. To resolve this problem, we proposed a hybrid novel technique CSSMO-based gene selection for cancer classification. First, we made alteration of the fitness of spider monkey optimization (SMO) with cuckoo search algorithm (CSA) algorithm viz., CSSMO for feature selection, which helps to combine the benefit of both metaheuristic algorithms to discover a subset of genes which helps to predict a cancer disease in early stage. Further, to enhance the accuracy of the CSSMO algorithm, we choose a cleaning process, minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) to lessen the gene expression of cancer datasets. Next, these subsets of genes are classified using deep learning (DL) to identify different groups or classes related to a particular cancer disease. Eight different benchmark microarray gene expression datasets of cancer have been utilized to analyze the performance of the proposed approach with different evaluation matrix such as recall, precision, F1-score, and confusion matrix. The proposed gene selection method with DL achieves much better classification accuracy than other existing DL and machine learning classification models with all large gene expression dataset of cancer.© 2023.

In this study, we used a retrospective sample of 231 dyads involving children with ASD and their mothers. Among ASD patients, 12% had a history of MIA.

We previously identified the deubiquitinaseUSP9Xas a RIT1 dependency inRIT1-mutant cells. Here, we demonstrate that both wild-type and mutant forms of RIT1 are substrates of USP9X.

InHomo sapiensthis process of lifetime reduction has been shown to correspond with aspects of organismal aging and exposure to stress or other insults. The early impetus to characterize telomere dynamics in livestock related to the concern that aged donor DNA would result in earlier cell senescence and overall aging in cloned animals. Telomere length investigations in dairy cows included breed effects, estimates of additive genetic control (heritability 0.12 to 0.46), and effects of external stressors on telomere degradation across animal life. Evaluation of telomeres with respect to aging has also been conducted in pigs and horses, and there are fewer reports of telomere biology in beef cattle, sheep, and goats. There were minimal associations of telomere length with animal productivity measures. Most, but not all, work in livestock has documented an inverse relationship between peripheral blood cell telomere length and age; that is, a longer telomere length was associated with younger age. Because livestock longevity affects productivity and profitability, the role of tissue-specific telomere attrition in aging may present alternative improvement strategies for genetic improvement while also providing translational biomedical knowledge.",3.79E-30
,37935439,The conservation of allelic DNA methylation and its relationship with imprinting in maize.,J Exp Bot,"Genomic imprinting refers to allele-specific expression of genes depending on parental origin, which is regulated by epigenetic modifications. Intraspecific allelic variation for imprinting has been detected. However, the intraspecific genome-wide allelic epigenetic variation of maize and its correlation with imprinting variants remain elusive. Here, three reciprocal hybrids were generated by crossing inbred lines CAU5, B73 and Mo17 to analyze the intraspecific conservation of the imprinted genes in maize kernel. In our study, majority of imprinted genes exhibited intraspecific conservation, and these genes also exhibited interspecific conservation (rice, sorghum and Arabidopsis) and enriched in some specific pathways. By comparing intraspecific allelic DNA methylation in the endosperm, we found that nearly 15% of DNA methylation exists as allelic variants. The intraspecific whole-genome correlation between DNA methylation and imprinted genes indicated that DNA methylation variants play an important role in imprinting variants. Disruption of two conserved imprinted genes by CRISPR/Cas9 method resulted in a smaller kernel phenotype.

However, the extent to which corals develop similar adaptive mechanisms and their specific adaptation processes remain unclear. Here, to reveal the regulatory mechanism by which DNA methylation improves thermal tolerance in Pocillopora damicornis under fluctuating environments, we analyzed genome-wide DNA methylation signatures in P. damicornis and compared the differences in the methylation and transcriptional responses of P. damicornis from fluctuating and stable environments using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing and nanopore-based RNA sequencingtranscriptome sequencing. We discovered low methylation levels in P. damicornis (average methylation 4.14%), with CpG accounting for 74.88%, CHH for 13.27%, and CHG for 11.85% of this methylation. However, methylation levels did not change between coral samples from the fluctuating and stable environments. The varied methylation levels in different regions of the gene revealed that the overall methylation level of the gene body was relatively high and showed a bimodal methylation pattern. Methylation occurs primarily in exons rather than introns within the gene body In P. damicornis, there was only a weak correlation between methylation and transcriptional changes at the individual gene level, and the methylation and gene expression levels generally exhibited a bell-shaped relationship, which we speculate may be due to the specificity of cnidarian species. Correlation analysis between methylation levels and the transcriptome revealed that the highest proportion of the top 20 enriched KEGG pathways was related to immunity. Additionally, P. damicornis collected from a high-temperature pool had a lower metabolic rate than those collected from a low-temperature pool. We hypothesize that the dynamic balance of energy-expenditure costs between immunity and metabolism is an important strategy for increasing P. damicornis tolerance. The fluctuating environment of high-temperature pools may increase the heat tolerance in corals by increasing their immunity and thus lowering their metabolism.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

However, our understanding of this role is presently limited by our poor understanding of the structure and composition of this unique chromatin. The nucleosomal variant, CENP-A, localizes to narrow regions within the centromere, where it plays a major role in centromeric function, effectively serving as a platform on which the kinetochore is assembled. Previous work found that, within a given cell, the number of microtubules within kinetochores is essentially unchanged between CENP-A-localized regions of different physical sizes. However, it is unknown if the amount of CENP-A is also unchanged between these regions of different sizes, which would reflect a strict structural correspondence between these two key characteristics of the centromere/kinetochore assembly. Here, we used super-resolution optical microscopy to image and quantify the amount of CENP-A and DNA within human centromere chromatin. We found that the amount of CENP-A within CENP-A domains of different physical sizes is indeed the same. Further, our measurements suggest that the ratio of CENP-A- to H3-containing nucleosomes within these domains is between 8:1 and 11:1. Thus, our results not only identify an unexpectedly strict relationship between CENP-A and microtubules stoichiometries but also that the CENP-A centromeric domain is almost exclusively composed of CENP-A nucleosomes.",2.47E-30

In this study, we employed sample-level clustering using cell-cell interaction scores to investigate patient heterogeneity and uncover novel subtypes. The clustering results were validated using external datasets, demonstrating superior reproducibility and purity compared to gene expression- or gene set enrichment-based clustering. Furthermore, the cell-cell interaction score-based clusters exhibited a strong correlation with the WHO ordinal severity score based on clinical characteristics. By characterizing the identified subtypes through known COVID-19 severity-associated biomarkers, we discovered a ""Severe-like moderate"" subtype. This subtype displayed clinical features akin to moderate cases; however, molecular features, such as gene expression and cell-cell interactions, resembled those of severe cases. Notably, all patients who progressed from moderate to severe belonged to this subtype, underscoring the significance of cell-cell interactions in COVID-19 patient heterogeneity and severity.© 2023.

,38116118,Epigenomic mapping reveals distinct B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia chromatin architectures and regulators.,Cell Genom,"B cell lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) is composed of diverse molecular subtypes, and while transcriptional and DNA methylation profiling has been extensively examined, the chromatin landscape is not well characterized for many subtypes. We therefore mapped chromatin accessibility using ATAC-seq in primary B-ALL cells from 156 patients spanning ten molecular subtypes and present this dataset as a resource. Differential chromatin accessibility and transcription factor (TF) footprint profiling were employed and identified B-ALL cell of origin, TF-target gene interactions enriched in B-ALL, and key TFs associated with accessible chromatin sites preferentially active in B-ALL. We further identified over 20% of accessible chromatin sites exhibiting strong subtype enrichment and candidate TFs that maintain subtype-specific chromatin architectures. Over 9,000 genetic variants were uncovered, contributing to variability in chromatin accessibility among patient samples. Our data suggest that distinct chromatin architectures are driven by diverse TFs and inherited genetic variants that promote unique gene-regulatory networks.© 2023 The Author(s).",2.32E-30

Also, as a life-long infection, HCMV has been associated with several diseases in the adult brain. HCMV is known to infect early neural progenitor cells, but whether it also infects terminally differentiated neurons is still debated. Here, we differentiated human-induced pluripotent stem cells into neurons for 84-120 days to test the ability of HCMV to infect terminally differentiated neurons and assess the downstream functional consequences. We discovered that mature human neurons are highly permissive to HCMV infection, exhibited late replication hallmarks, and produced infectious virus. Moreover, infection in terminally differentiated neurons essentially eliminated neuron function. These results demonstrate that terminally differentiated human neurons are permissive to HCMV infection, which can significantly alter both structural and functional features of this mature neuron population.",1.95E-30

While hepatoblastomas are predominantly sporadic, around 15% of cases develop as part of predisposition syndromes such as Beckwith-Wiedemann (11p15.5 locus altered). Here, we identify mosaic genetic alterations of 11p15.5 locus in the liver of hepatoblastoma patients without a clinical diagnosis of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. We do not retrieve these alterations in children with other types of pediatric liver tumors. We show that mosaic 11p15.5 alterations in liver FFPE sections of hepatoblastoma patients display IGF2 overexpression and H19 downregulation together with an alteration of the liver zonation. Moreover, mosaic livers' microenvironment is enriched in extracellular matrix and angiogenesis. Spatial transcriptomics and single-nucleus RNAseq analyses identify a 60-gene signature in 11p15.5 altered hepatocytes. These data provide insights for 11p15.5 mosaicism detection and its functional consequences during the early steps of carcinogenesis.© 2023. The Author(s).",1.87E-30

We investigate how aging rewires transcriptomic and epigenomic programs of mouse mammary glands at single cell resolution, yielding a comprehensive resource for aging and cancer biology. Aged epithelial cells exhibit epigenetic and transcriptional changes in metabolic, pro-inflammatory, or cancer-associated genes. Aged stromal cells downregulate fibroblast marker genes and upregulate markers of senescence and cancer-associated fibroblasts. Among immune cells, distinct T cell subsets (Gzmk+, memory CD4+, ??) and M2-like macrophages expand with age. Spatial transcriptomics reveal co-localization of aged immune and epithelial cellsin situ. Lastly, transcriptional signatures of aging mammary cells are found in human breast tumors, suggesting mechanistic links between aging and cancer.

However, methods performed to date have only considered regulatory effects of risk associated SNPs thought to act incison a nearby target gene. With growing evidence for distal (trans) regulatory effects of variants on gene expression, we performed TWAS of breast and ovarian cancer using a Bayesian genome-wide TWAS method (BGW-TWAS) that considers effects of bothcis- andtrans-expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). We applied BGW-TWAS to whole genome and RNA sequencing data in breast and ovarian tissues from the Genotype-Tissue Expression project to train expression imputation models. We applied these models to large-scale GWAS summary statistic data from the Breast Cancer and Ovarian Cancer Association Consortia to identify genes associated with risk of overall breast cancer, non-mucinous epithelial ovarian cancer, and 10 cancer subtypes. We identified 101 genes significantly associated with risk with breast cancer phenotypes and 8 with ovarian phenotypes. These loci include established risk genes and several novel candidate risk loci, such asACAP3, whose associations are predominantly driven bytrans-eQTLs. We replicated several associations using summary statistics from an independent GWAS of these cancer phenotypes. We further used genotype and expression data in normal and tumor breast tissue from the Cancer Genome Atlas to examine the performance of our trained expression imputation models.

,38117484,The epigenetic evolution of glioma is determined by the IDH1 mutation status and treatment regimen.,Cancer Res,"Tumor adaptation or selection is thought to underlie therapy resistance in glioma. To investigate longitudinal epigenetic evolution of gliomas in response to therapeutic pressure, we performed an epigenomic analysis of 132 matched initial and recurrent tumors from patients with IDH-wildtype (IDHwt) and IDH-mutant (IDHmut) glioma. IDHwt gliomas showed a stable epigenome over time with relatively low levels of global methylation. The epigenome of IDHmut gliomas showed initial high levels of genome-wide DNA methylation that was progressively reduced to levels similar to those of IDHwt tumors. Integration of epigenomics, gene expression, and functional genomics identified HOXD13 as a master regulator of IDHmut astrocytoma evolution. Furthermore, relapse of IDHmut tumors was accompanied by histological progression that was associated with survival, as validated in an independent cohort. Finally, the initial cell composition of the tumor microenvironment varied between IDHwt and IDHmut tumors and changed differentially following treatment, suggesting increased neo-angiogenesis and T-cell infiltration upon treatment of IDHmut gliomas. This study provides one of the largest cohorts of paired longitudinal glioma samples with epigenomic, transcriptomic, and genomic profiling and suggests that treatment of IDHmut glioma is associated with epigenomic evolution towards an IDHwt-like phenotype.",1.56E-30

Aberrant histone methylation has been involved in neural stem cell (NSC) quiescence, microglial deficits, inflammatory processes, memory impairment, cognitive decline, neurodegenerative diseases, and schizophrenia. Herein, we provide an overview of recent studies on epigenetic regulation of brain tissue aging, mainly focusing on the role of histone methylation in different cellular and functional aspects of the aging process.

We found that L3MBTL2 acts as a tumor suppressor by transcriptionally repressingIFIT2in osteosarcoma. L3MBTL2 recruits the components of Polycomb repressive complex 1.6 to form condensates via both Pho-binding pockets and polybasic regions within carboxyl-terminal intrinsically disordered regions; the L3MBTL2-induced condensates are required for its tumor suppression. Multi-monoubiquitination of L3MBTL2 by UBE2O results in its proteasomal degradation, and the UBE2O/L3MBTL2 axis was crucial for osteosarcoma growth. There is a reverse correlation between L3MBTL2 and UBE2O in osteosarcoma tissues, and higher UBE2O and lower L3MBTL2 are associated with poorer prognosis in osteosarcoma. Pharmacological blockage of UBE2O by arsenic trioxide can enhance L3MBTL2-induced condensates and consequently suppress osteosarcoma growth. Our findings unveil a crucial biological function of L3MBTL2-induced condensates in mediating tumor suppression, proposing the UBE2O-L3MBTL2 axis as a potential cancer therapeutic target in osteosarcoma.",1.35E-30

Neuroinflammation is the abnormal immune response in the brain, and its correlation with MDD is receiving increasing attention. Neuroinflammation has been reported to be involved in MDD through distinct neurobiological mechanisms, among which the dysregulation of neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus (HPC) is receiving increasing attention. The DG of the hippocampus is one of two niches for neurogenesis in the adult mammalian brain, and neurotrophic factors are fundamental regulators of this neurogenesis process. The reported cell types involved in mediating neuroinflammation include microglia, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, meningeal leukocytes, and peripheral immune cells which selectively penetrate the blood-brain barrier and infiltrate into inflammatory regions. This review summarizes the functions of the hippocampus affected by neuroinflammation during MDD progression and the corresponding influences on the memory of MDD patients and model animals.© 2023.

Schlemm's canal (SC) is a hybrid vascular and lymphatic vessel that mediates aqueous humour drainage from the anterior ocular chamber. Animal studies support the importance of SC endothelial angiopoietin-TEK signalling, and more recently TIE1 signalling, in maintaining normal IOP. However, human genetic support for a causal role of TIE1 and TEK signalling in lowering IOP is currently lacking.GWAS summary statistics were obtained for plasma soluble TIE1 (sTIE1) protein levels (N?=?35,559), soluble TEK (sTEK) protein levels (N?=?35,559), IOP (N?=?139,555) and POAG (Ncases?=?16,677, Ncontrols?=?199,580). Mendelian randomization (MR) was performed to estimate the association of genetically proxied TIE1 and TEK protein levels with IOP and POAG liability. Where significant MR estimates were obtained, genetic colocalization was performed to assess the probability of a shared causal variant (PPshared) versus distinct (PPdistinct) causal variants underlying TIE1/TEK signalling and the outcome. Publicly available single-nucleus RNA-sequencing data were leveraged to investigate differential expression of TIE1 and TEK in the human ocular anterior segment.Increased genetically proxied TIE1 signalling and TEK signalling associated with a reduction in IOP (-?0.21 mmHg per SD increase in sTIE1, 95% CI?=?-?0.09 to -?0.33 mmHg, P?=?6.57?×?10-4, and -?0.14 mmHg per SD decrease in sTEK, 95% CI?=?-?0.03 to -?0.25 mmHg, P?=?0.011), but not with POAG liability. Colocalization analysis found that the probability of a shared causal variant was greater for TIE1 and IOP than for TEK and IOP (PPshared/(PPdistinct?+?PPshared)?=?0.98 for TIE1 and 0.30 for TEK). In the anterior segment, TIE1 and TEK were preferentially expressed in SC, lymphatic, and vascular endothelium.This study provides novel human genetic support for a causal role of both TIE1 and TEK signalling in regulating IOP. Here, combined evidence from cis-MR and colocalization analyses provide stronger support for TIE1 than TEK as a potential IOP-lowering therapeutic target.© 2023. Crown.",1.21E-30

Here we used genome-scale DNA and RNA imaging to investigate 3D-genome organization in transcriptionally distinct cell types in the primary motor cortex of the mouse brain. We uncovered a wide spectrum of differences in the nuclear architecture and 3D-genome organization among different cell types, ranging from the physical size of the cell nucleus to the active-inactive chromatin compartmentalization and radial positioning of chromatin loci within the nucleus. These cell-type-dependent variations in nuclear architecture and chromatin organization exhibited strong correlation with both total transcriptional activity of the cell and transcriptional regulation of cell-type-specific marker genes.

Existing automated annotation methods have a number of limitations, including requiring large reference datasets, high computation time, shallow annotation resolution, and difficulty in identifying cancer cells or their most likely cell of origin.We developed Census, a biologically intuitive and fully automated cell-type identification method for single-cell RNA-seq data that can deeply annotate normal cells in mammalian tissues and identify malignant cells and their likely cell of origin. Motivated by the inherently stratified developmental programs of cellular differentiation, Census infers hierarchical cell-type relationships and uses gradient-boosted \decision trees that capitalize on nodal cell-type relationships to achieve high prediction speed and accuracy.

We first create a systematic benchmarking pipeline to compare predictive models, assembling a dataset of 10,411 elementgene pairs measured in CRISPR perturbation experiments, >30,000 fine-mapped eQTLs, and 569 fine-mapped GWAS variants linked to a likely causal gene. Using this framework, we develop a new predictive model, ENCODE-rE2G, that achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple prediction tasks, demonstrating a strategy involving iterative perturbations and supervised machine learning to build increasingly accurate predictive models of enhancer regulation. Using the ENCODE-rE2G model, we build an encyclopedia of enhancer-gene regulatory interactions in the human genome, which reveals global properties of enhancer networks, identifies differences in the functions of genes that have more or less complex regulatory landscapes, and improves analyses to link noncoding variants to target genes and cell types for common, complex diseases. By interpreting the model, we find evidence that, beyond enhancer activity and 3D enhancer-promoter contacts, additional features guide enhancerpromoter communication including promoter class and enhancer-enhancer synergy. Altogether, these genome-wide maps of enhancer-gene regulatory interactions, benchmarking software, predictive models, and insights about enhancer function provide a valuable resource for future studies of gene regulation and human genetics.",1.08E-30

The incidence of overweight and obesity has doubled worldwide since 1980, and nearly one-third of the world population is now classified as overweight or obese. Obesity rates are increasing in all age groups and for both sexes, regardless of geographic region, race, or socioeconomic status, although they are generally higher in older adults and women. Although the absolute prevalence of overweight and obesity varies widely, this trend is similar across different regions and countries. In some developed countries, the prevalence of obesity has levelled off over the past few years. However, obesity has become a health problem that cannot be ignored in low- and middle-income countries. Although the drug treatment model of modern medicine has a significant therapeutic effect in the treatment of obesity, its adverse effects are also obvious. Acupuncture combined with Chinese medicine treatment of obesity has prominent advantages in terms of clinical efficacy, and its clinical safety is higher, with fewer adverse reactions.

At present, lung transplant physicians only have limited and rather blunt tools available to assist them with this task. Although therapeutic drug monitoring provides clinically useful information about single time point and longitudinal exposure of LTRs to immunosuppressants, it lacks precision in determining the functional level of immunosuppression that an individual is experiencing. There is a significant gap in our ability to monitor lung allograft health and therefore tailor optimal personalised immunosuppression regimens. Molecular diagnostics performed on blood, bronchoalveolar lavage or lung tissue that can detect early signs of subclinical allograft injury, differentiate rejection from infection or distinguish cellular from humoral rejection could offer clinicians powerful tools in protecting lung allograft health. In this review, we look at the current evidence behind molecular monitoring in lung transplantation and ask if it is ready for routine clinical use. Although donor-derived cell-free DNA and tissue transcriptomics appear to be the techniques with the most immediate clinical potential, more robust data are required on their performance and additional clinical value beyond standard of care.Copyright ©The authors 2023.",1.06E-30

Here, we analyzed publicly available data and found that B-cell neoplasm cell lines with different levels of EFNB1 had distinctive drug response patterns of inhibitors targeting SRC/PI3K/AKT. Overexpression of EFNB1 promoted phosphorylation of key proteins in drug response, such as SRC and STMN1, conferring sensitivity to SRC inhibitor and cytotoxic drugs. EFNB1 phosphorylation signaling network was significantly associated with the prognosis of GCB-DLBCL patients. Moreover, EFNB1 levels were correlated with cell of origin (COO) scores, suggesting that EFNB1 is a quantitative indicator of cell differentiation. Ultimately, we proposed a model for the stratification of human B-cell malignancies and the implementation of targeted therapies based on EFNB1 levels.

We found that the CpG methylation state was similar between cells forming ISC organoids and iISC organoids, while they differed widely from those in MEFs. Moreover, genomic regions that were differentially methylated between ISC organoid- and iISC organoid-forming cells did not significantly affect gene expression.

We found that DNA hypomethylation at promoter regions is globally associated with liver-dominant or skeletal muscle-dominant functional protein production within each tissue, as well as with genes encoding proteins involved in ubiquitous functions in both tissues. Thus, genes encoding liver-dominant proteins, such as those involved in glycolysis or gluconeogenesis, the urea cycle, complement and coagulation systems, enzymes of tryptophan metabolism, and cytochrome P450-related metabolism, were hypomethylated in the liver, whereas those encoding-skeletal muscle-dominant proteins, such as those involved in sarcomere organization, were hypomethylated in the skeletal muscle.

DMF from henceforth) is a gram-negative heterotroph known to tolerate and utilize high concentrations of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF). The work presented here elaborates on the metabolic pathways involved in the degradation of C1 compounds, many of which are well-known pollutants and toxic to the environment. Investigations on microbial growth and detection of metabolic intermediates corroborate the outcome of the functional genome analysis. Several classes of C1 compounds, such as methanol, methylated amines, aliphatic amides, and naturally occurring quaternary amines like glycine betaine, were tested as growth substrates. The detailed growth and kinetic parameter analyses reveal that P. DMF can efficiently aerobically degrade trimethylamine (TMA) and grow on quaternary amines such as glycine betaine. The results show that the mechanism for halotolerant adaptation in the presence of glycine betaine is dissimilar from those observed for conventional trehalose-mediated halotolerance in heterotrophic bacteria. In addition, a close genomic survey revealed the presence of a Co(I)-based substrate-specific corrinoid methyltransferase operon, referred to as mtgBC. This demethylation system has been associated with glycine betaine catabolism in anaerobic methanogens and is unknown in denitrifying aerobic heterotrophs. This report on an anoxic-specific demethylation system in an aerobic heterotroph is unique. Our finding exposes the metabolic potential for the degradation of a variety of C1 compounds by P. DMF, making it a novel organism of choice for remediating a wide range of possible environmental contaminants.© 2023.

,38068847,Observational Cross-Sectional Study on Mediterranean Diet and Sperm Parameters.,Nutrients,"Infertility, affecting 15 to 25% of couples in the most developed countries, is recognized by the World Health Organization as a public health issue at a global level. Different causes are acknowledged to reduce fertility in both sexes. In particular, about 40-50% of cases recognize a male factor. Dietary habits and lifestyle are acknowledged to influence sperm quality and are therefore important modifiable factors in male reproductive health. Conditions such as overweight/obesity, impaired glucose metabolism and determinants of metabolic syndrome, together with unhealthy lifestyle behavior, i.e., smoking cigarettes and physical inactivity, are suggested to have a negative impact on male fertility. While individual elements and characteristics of the Western diet and habits are considered risk factors for male infertility, the Mediterranean diet (MD) seems to promote reproductive potential for improving sperm quality. It is also interesting to note that previous observational studies reported a positive correlation between the consumption of the single food classes of the MD pattern (i.e., vegetables and fruits, poultry, fish and seafood, whole grains, low-fat dairy products) and the quality of several sperm parameters. To evaluate the relationship between sperm parameters and MD adherence, we performed a cross-sectional study on the seminal data of 300 males (mean age 34.6 ± 9.1 years) who spontaneously referred to our center of reproductive medicine. The evaluation of adherence to MD was performed with a validated 14-point Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) questionnaire. Our findings showed that sperm parameters such as sperm count, motility, viability and normal morphology are significantly and positively correlated with MEDAS, independently of BMI and age. In addition, the application of an ROC curve on MEDAS value vs. seminal alterations identified 6.25 as the score threshold value below which altered sperm parameters were more likely to occur [AUC = 0.096 (CI: 0.059-0.133;p< 0.00)]. Therefore, adhering to the MD with at least a MEDAS score of 6.26 increases the probability of normozoospermia. Moreover, subjects who had a MEDAS value lower than 6.25 had an Odds Ratio of 6.28 (CI = 3.967-9.945) for having at least one altered sperm parameter compared to those who were more adherent to the MD.

However, analyzing scRNA-seq data is a challenge due to sparsity and the large number of genes involved. Therefore, dimensionality reduction and feature selection are important for removing spurious signals and enhancing downstream analysis. Traditional PCA, a main workhorse in dimensionality reduction, lacks the ability to capture geometrical structure information embedded in the data, and previous graph Laplacian regularizations are limited by the analysis of only a single scale. We propose a topological Principal Components Analysis (tPCA) method by the combination of persistent Laplacian (PL) technique and L2,1norm regularization to address multiscale and multiclass heterogeneity issues in data. We further introduce a k-Nearest-Neighbor (kNN) persistent Laplacian technique to improve the robustness of our persistent Laplacian method. The proposed kNN-PL is a new algebraic topology technique which addresses the many limitations of the traditional persistent homology. Rather than inducing filtration via the varying of a distance threshold, we introduced kNN-tPCA, where filtrations are achieved by varying the number of neighbors in a kNN network at each step, and find that this framework has significant implications for hyper-parameter tuning. We validate the efficacy of our proposed tPCA and kNN-tPCA methods on 11 diverse benchmark scRNA-seq datasets, and showcase that our methods outperform other unsupervised PCA enhancements from the literature, as well as popular Uniform Manifold Approximation (UMAP), t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (tSNE), and Projection Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) by significant margins. For example, tPCA provides up to 628%, 78%, and 149% improvements to UMAP, tSNE, and NMF, respectively on classification in the F1 metric, and kNN-tPCA offers 53%, 63%, and 32% improvements to UMAP, tSNE, and NMF, respectively on clustering in the ARI metric.",7.26E-31

However, the precise mechanisms mediating this risk remain largely unknown as does the full spectrum of phenotypes associated with genetic variation inHTRA1in the general population. Using a family-history informed approach, we first show that rare variants inHTRA1are linked to ischemic stroke in 425,338 European individuals from the UK Biobank with replication in 143,149 individuals from the Biobank Japan. Integrating data from biochemical experiments on 76 mutations occurring in the UK Biobank, we next show that rare variants causing loss of protease functionin vitroassociate with ischemic stroke, coronary artery disease, and skeletal traits. In addition, a common causal variant (rs2672592) modulating circulating HTRA1 mRNA and protein levels enhances the risk of ischemic stroke, small vessel stroke, and coronary artery disease while lowering the risk of migraine and age-related macular dystrophy in GWAS and UK Biobank data from > 2,000,000 individuals. There was no evidence of an interaction between genetically proxied HTRA1 activity and levels. Our findings demonstrate a central role of HTRA1 for human disease including stroke and coronary artery disease and identify two independent mechanisms that might qualify as targets for future therapeutic interventions.",7.21E-31

While the roles of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) in neuronal function have been extensively studied, little is known about 5-formylcytosine (5fC) in neurons. Therefore, this study was to investigate the genome-wide distribution and potential functions of 5fC in neurons. In an in vitro culture model of mouse primary cortical neurons, we observed a dynamic increase in the total 5fC level in the neuronal genome after potassium chloride (KCl) stimulation. Subsequently, we employed chemical-labeling-enabled C-to-T conversion sequencing (CLEVER-seq) to examine the 5fC distribution at a single-base resolution. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that 5fC was enriched in promoter regions, and gene ontology (GO) analysis indicated that the differential formylation positions (DFP) were correlated with neuronal activities. Additionally, integration with previously published nascent RNA-seq data revealed a positive correlation between gene formylation and mRNA expression levels. As well, 6 neuro-activity-related genes with a positive correlation were validated. Furthermore, we observed higher chromatin accessibility and RNA pol II binding signals near the 5fC sites through multiomics analysis. Motif analysis identified potential reader proteins for 5fC. In conclusion, our work provides a valuable resource for studying the dynamic changes and functional roles of 5fC in activated mammalian neurons.",6E-31

As dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) have been previously identified as key neurotransmitters for some of these phenotypes, we explored the genetic contribution of these pathways to SUD and these comorbid phenotypes in order to better understand the genetic relationship between them.We tested the association of 275 dopaminergic genes and 176 serotonergic genes with these phenotypes by performing gene-based, gene-set and transcriptome-wide association studies in 11 genome-wide association studies (GWAS) datasets on SUD and related behaviors.At the gene-wide level, 68 DA and 27 5-HT genes were found to be associated with at least one GWAS on SUD or related behavior. Among them, six genes had a pleiotropic effect, being associated with at least three phenotypes:ADH1C,ARNTL,CHRNA3, HPRT1,HTR1BandDRD2. Additionally, we found nominal associations between the DA gene sets and SUD, opioid use disorder, antisocial behavior, irritability and neuroticism, and between the 5-HT-core gene set and neuroticism. Predicted gene expression correlates in brain were also found for 19 DA or 5-HT genes.Our study shows a pleiotropic contribution of dopaminergic and serotonergic genes to addiction and related behaviors such as anxiety, irritability, neuroticism and risk-taking behavior, highlighting a role for DA genes, which could explain, in part, the co-occurrence of these phenotypes.Copyright © 2023 Antón-Galindo, Cabana-Domínguez, Torrico, Corominas, Cormand and Fernàndez-Castillo.",5.32E-31

Here, we report the identification of homozygous loss-of-function variants in the primate-specific gene ZNF808 as a cause of pancreatic agenesis. ZNF808 is a member of the KRAB zinc finger protein family, a large and rapidly evolving group of epigenetic silencers which target transposable elements. We show that loss of ZNF808 in vitro results in aberrant activation of regulatory potential contained in the primate-specific transposable elements it represses during early pancreas development. This leads to inappropriate specification of cell fate with induction of genes associated with liver identity. Our results highlight the essential role of ZNF808 in pancreatic development in humans and the contribution of primate-specific regions of the human genome to congenital developmental disease.© 2023.

The PD-associated immune response encompasses both brain and peripheral immune cells, although little is known about the immune proteins relevant for such a response. We propose that the upregulation of CD163 observed in blood monocytes and in the responsive microglia in PD patients is a protective mechanism in the disease. To investigate this, we used the PD model based on intrastriatal injections of murine ?-syn pre-formed fibrils in CD163 knockout (KO) mice and wild-type littermates. CD163KO females revealed an impaired and differential early immune response to ?-syn pathology as revealed by immunohistochemical and transcriptomic analysis. After 6 months, CD163KO females showed an exacerbated immune response and ?-syn pathology, which ultimately led to dopaminergic neurodegeneration of greater magnitude. These findings support a sex-dimorphic neuroprotective role for CD163 during ?-syn-induced neurodegeneration.© 2023. The Author(s).",5.26E-31

In fact, although a growing number of studies show crosstalk between these two processes, there remain numerous gaps in our knowledge of the mechanisms involved, which requires further clarification. On the one hand, mitochondrial dysfunction may lead to the release of mitochondrial damage-associated molecular patterns (mtDAMPs) which are recognized by microglial immune receptors and contribute to neuroinflammation progression. On the other hand, inflammatory molecules released by glial cells can influence and regulate mitochondrial function. A deeper understanding of these mechanisms may help identify biomarkers and molecular targets useful for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.

,38065072,Tree-based QTL mapping with expected local genetic relatedness matrices.,Am J Hum Genet,"Understanding the genetic basis of complex phenotypes is a central pursuit of genetics. Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) are a powerful way to find genetic loci associated with phenotypes. GWASs are widely and successfully used, but they face challenges related to the fact that variants are tested for association with a phenotype independently, whereas in reality variants at different sites are correlated because of their shared evolutionary history. One way to model this shared history is through the ancestral recombination graph (ARG), which encodes a series of local coalescent trees. Recent computational and methodological breakthroughs have made it feasible to estimate approximate ARGs from large-scale samples. Here, we explore the potential of an ARG-based approach to quantitative-trait locus (QTL) mapping, echoing existing variance-components approaches. We propose a framework that relies on the conditional expectation of a local genetic relatedness matrix (local eGRM) given the ARG. Simulations show that our method is especially beneficial for finding QTLs in the presence of allelic heterogeneity. By framing QTL mapping in terms of the estimated ARG, we can also facilitate the detection of QTLs in understudied populations. We use local eGRM to analyze two chromosomes containing known body size loci in a sample of Native Hawaiians. Our investigations can provide intuition about the benefits of using estimated ARGs in population- and statistical-genetic methods in general.Copyright © 2023 American Society of Human Genetics.

The disadvantage of previous observational studies is that they are susceptible to confounding factors and bias, that makes it difficult to infer a causal link between those two diseases. Abnormal epigenetic modifications, represented by DNA methylation, are important causes of many diseases. However, there are no studies showing a bridging role for methylation modifications in blood lipid metabolism and osteoporosis.SNPs for lipid profile (Blood VLDL cholesterol (VLDL-C), blood LDL cholesterol (LDL-C), blood HDL cholesterol (HDL-C), blood triglycerides (TG), diagnosed pure hypercholesterolaemia, blood apolipoprotein B (Apo B), blood apolipoprotein A1(Apo A1)), and bone mineral density (BMD) in different body parts (Heel BMD, lumbar BMD, whole-body BMD, femoral neck BMD) were obtained from large meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies as instrumental variables for two-sample Mendelian randomization. Assessment of the genetic effects of lipid profile-associated methylation sites and bone mineral density was carried out using the summary-data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR) method.Two-sample Mendelian randomization showed that there was a negative causal association between hypercholesterolaemia and heel BMD (p?=?0.0103, OR?=?0.4590), and total body BMD (p?=?0.0002, OR?=?0.2826). LDL-C had a negative causal association with heel BMD (p?=?8.68E-05, OR?=?0.9586). VLDL-C had a negative causal association with heel BMD (p?=?0.035, OR?=?0.9484), lumbar BMD (p?=?0.0316, OR?=?0.9356), and total body BMD (p?=?0.0035, OR?=?0.9484). HDL-C had a negative causal association with heel BMD (p?=?1.25E-05, OR?=?0.9548), lumbar BMD (p?=?0.0129, OR?=?0.9358), and total body BMD (p?=?0.0399, OR?=?0.9644). Apo B had a negative causal association with heel BMD (p?=?0.0001, OR?=?0.9647). Apo A1 had a negative causal association with heel BMD (p?=?0.0132, OR?=?0.9746) and lumbar BMD (p?=?0.0058, OR?=?0.9261). The p-values of all positive results corrected by the FDR method remained significant and sensitivity analysis showed that there was no horizontal pleiotropy in the results despite the heterogeneity in some results. SMR identified 3 methylation sites associated with lipid profiles in the presence of genetic effects on BMD: cg15707428(GREB1), cg16000331(SREBF2), cg14364472(NOTCH1).Our study provides insights into the potential causal links and co-pathogenesis between dyslipidemia and osteoporosis.

,38045261,The quantitative genetics of gene expression in Mimulus guttatus.,bioRxiv,"Gene expression can be influenced by genetic variants that are closely linked to the expressed gene (cis eQTLs) and variants in other parts of the genome (trans eQTLs). We created a multiparental mapping population by sampling genotypes from a single natural population ofMimulus guttatusand scored gene expression in the leaves of 1,588 plants. We find that nearly every measured gene exhibits cis regulatory variation (91% have FDR < 0.05) and that cis eQTLs are usually allelic series with three or more functionally distinct alleles. The cis locus explains about two thirds of the standing genetic variance (on average) but varies among genes and tends to be greatest when there is high indel variation in the upstream regulatory region and high nucleotide diversity in the coding sequence. Despite mapping over 10,000 trans eQTL / affected gene pairs, most of the genetic variance generated by trans acting loci remains unexplained. This implies a large reservoir of trans acting genes with subtle or diffuse effects. Mapped trans eQTLs show lower allelic diversity but much higher genetic dominance than cis eQTLs. Several analyses also indicate that trans eQTL make a substantial contribution to the genetic correlations in expression among different genes. They may thus be essential determinants of ""gene expression modules"", which has important implications for the evolution of gene expression and also how it is studied by geneticists.",3.74E-31

The levels of inter-leukin-6 (IL-6), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), S100 protein, neuron-specific enolase (NSE), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in serum samples were measured using electrochemiluminescence (ECL), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or rate method and the correlations between these serum biomarkers and the degree of neonatal asphyxia and brain damage were statistically analyzed using Spearman test.The levels of serum IL-6, LDH, S100, NSE, and GFAP in the neonatal asphyxia with brain damage group within 12 hours after birth were significantly higher than those in the neonatal asphyxia without brain damage group (all P<0.05). Additionally, these levels were positively correlated with the degree of asphyxia.

This hepatic lipotoxicity is associated with a dysregulation of the first step in lipid catabolism, known as beta oxidation, which occurs in the mitochondrial matrix. Eventually, this dysregulation will lead to mitochondrial dysfunction. To evaluate the possible involvement of mitochondrial DNA methylation in this lipid metabolic dysfunction, we investigated the functional metabolic effects of mitochondrial overexpression of CpG (MSssI) and GpC (MCviPI) DNA methyltransferases in relation to gene expression and (mito)epigenetic signatures. Overall, the results show that mitochondrial GpC and, to a lesser extent, CpG methylation increase bile acid metabolic gene expression, inducing the onset of cholestasis through mito-nuclear epigenetic reprogramming. Moreover, both increase the expression of metabolic nuclear receptors and thereby induce basal overactivation of mitochondrial respiration. The latter promotes mitochondrial swelling, favoring lipid accumulation and metabolic-stress-induced mitophagy and autophagy stress responses. In conclusion, both mitochondrial GpC and CpG methylation create a metabolically challenging environment that induces mitochondrial dysfunction, which may contribute to the progression of MASLD.",3.48E-31

Multidisciplinary clinics (MDCs) may improve surgical management for these patients.This is a retrospective cohort study (2010-2018) of all pancreatic cancer patients within a large, regional hospital system with a high-volume pancreatic cancer MDC. The primary outcome was receipt of treatment (surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, clinical trial participation, and palliative care); the secondary outcomes were overall survival and MDC management. Multiple logistic regressions were used for binary outcomes. Survival was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, Cox proportional hazards, and inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW).Of the 4141 patients studied, 1420 (34.3%) were managed by the MDC. MDC management was more likely for patients who were younger age, married, and privately insured, while less likely for low SES patients (all p <?0.05). MDC patients were more likely to receive all treatments, including neoadjuvant chemotherapy (OR 3.33, 95% CI 2.82-3.93), surgery (OR 1.39, 95% CI 1.15-1.68), palliative care (OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.05-1.38), and clinical trial participation (OR 3.76, 95% CI 2.86-4.93).

,37956271,Single molecule MATAC-seq reveals key determinants of DNA replication origin efficiency.,Nucleic Acids Res,"Stochastic origin activation gives rise to significant cell-to-cell variability in the pattern of genome replication. The molecular basis for heterogeneity in efficiency and timing of individual origins is a long-standing question. Here, we developed Methylation Accessibility of TArgeted Chromatin domain Sequencing (MATAC-Seq) to determine single-molecule chromatin accessibility of four specific genomic loci. MATAC-Seq relies on preferential modification of accessible DNA by methyltransferases combined with Nanopore-Sequencing for direct readout of methylated DNA-bases. Applying MATAC-Seq to selected early-efficient and late-inefficient yeast replication origins revealed large heterogeneity of chromatin states. Disruption of INO80 or ISW2 chromatin remodeling complexes leads to changes at individual nucleosomal positions that correlate with changes in their replication efficiency. We found a chromatin state with an accessible nucleosome-free region in combination with well-positioned +1 and +2 nucleosomes as a strong predictor for efficient origin activation. Thus, MATAC-Seq identifies the large spectrum of alternative chromatin states that co-exist on a given locus previously masked in population-based experiments and provides a mechanistic basis for origin activation heterogeneity during eukaryotic DNA replication. Consequently, our single-molecule chromatin accessibility assay will be ideal to define single-molecule heterogeneity across many fundamental biological processes such as transcription, replication, or DNA repair in vitro and ex vivo.© The Author(s) 2023.

,38113074,Model-based evaluation of spatiotemporal data reduction methods with unknown ground truth through optimal visualization and interpretability metrics.,Brief Bioinform,"Optimizing and benchmarking data reduction methods for dynamic or spatial visualization and interpretation (DSVI) face challenges due to many factors, including data complexity, lack of ground truth, time-dependent metrics, dimensionality bias and different visual mappings of the same data. Current studies often focus on independent static visualization or interpretability metrics that require ground truth. To overcome this limitation, we propose the MIBCOVIS framework, a comprehensive and interpretable benchmarking and computational approach. MIBCOVIS enhances the visualization and interpretability of high-dimensional data without relying on ground truth by integrating five robust metrics, including a novel time-ordered Markov-based structural metric, into a semi-supervised hierarchical Bayesian model. The framework assesses method accuracy and considers interaction effects among metric features. We apply MIBCOVIS using linear and nonlinear dimensionality reduction methods to evaluate optimal DSVI for four distinct dynamic and spatial biological processes captured by three single-cell data modalities: CyTOF, scRNA-seq and CODEX. These data vary in complexity based on feature dimensionality, unknown cell types and dynamic or spatial differences. Unlike traditional single-summary score approaches, MIBCOVIS compares accuracy distributions across methods. Our findings underscore the joint evaluation of visualization and interpretability, rather than relying on separate metrics. We reveal that prioritizing average performance can obscure method feature performance. Additionally, we explore the impact of data complexity on visualization and interpretability. Specifically, we provide optimal parameters and features and recommend methods, like the optimized variational contractive autoencoder, for targeted DSVI for various data complexities. MIBCOVIS shows promise for evaluating dynamic single-cell atlases and spatiotemporal data reduction models.Published by Oxford University Press 2023.",3.19E-31

Here we construct a whole-genome alignment of 239 species, representing nearly half of all extant species in the primate order. Using this resource, we identified human regulatory elements that are under selective constraint across primates and other mammals at a 5% false discovery rate. We detected 111,318 DNase I hypersensitivity sites and 267,410 transcription factor binding sites that are constrained specifically in primates but not across other placental mammals and validate their cis-regulatory effects on gene expression. These regulatory elements are enriched for human genetic variants that affect gene expression and complex traits and diseases.

Commonalities in the diagnostic and research process of Undiagnosed Diseases Programs are explored through an appraisal of available literature. This exploration allowed for an assessment of the strengths and limitations of each of the six common steps, namely enrollment, comprehensive clinical phenotyping, research diagnostics, data sharing and matchmaking, results, and follow-up. Current literature highlights the potential utility of Undiagnosed Diseases Programs in research diagnostics. Since participants have often had extensive previous genetic studies, research pipelines allow for diagnostic approaches beyond exome or whole genome sequencing, through reanalysis using research-grade bioinformatics tools and multi-omics technologies. The overall diagnostic yield is presented by study, since different selection criteria at enrollment and reporting processes make comparisons challenging and not particularly informative. Nonetheless, diagnostic yield in an undiagnosed cohort reflects the potential of an Undiagnosed Diseases Program.

,37990681,Why does type 2 diabetes mellitus impair weight reduction in patients with obesity? A review.,Obes Pillars,"A common adiposopathic complication of obesity is type 2 diabetes mellitus. Healthful weight reduction in patients with obesity can improve glucose metabolism and potentially promote remission of type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, weight-reduction in patients with increased adiposity is impaired among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus compared to patients without diabetes mellitus.Data for this review were derived from PubMed and applicable websites.Among patients with increased body fat, the mechanisms underlying impaired weight reduction for those with type 2 diabetes mellitus are multifactorial, and include energy conservation (i.e., improved glucose control and reduced glucosuria), hyperinsulinemia (commonly found in many patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus), potential use of obesogenic anti-diabetes medications, and contributions from multiple body systems. Other factors include increased age, sex, genetic/epigenetic predisposition, and obesogenic environments.Even though type 2 diabetes mellitus impairs weight reduction among patients with increased adiposity, clinically meaningful weight reduction improves glucose metabolism and can sometimes promote diabetes remission. An illustrative approach to mitigate impaired weight reduction due to type 2 diabetes mellitus is choosing anti-diabetes medications that increase insulin sensitivity and promote weight loss and deprioritize use of anti-diabetes medications that increase insulin exposure and promote weight gain.© 2023 The Author.",2.89E-31

,38069253,Circulating Proteins as Diagnostic Markers in Gastric Cancer.,Int J Mol Sci,"Gastric cancer (GC) is a highly malignant disease affecting humans worldwide and has a poor prognosis. Most GC cases are detected at advanced stages due to the cancer lacking early detectable symptoms. Therefore, there is great interest in improving early diagnosis by implementing targeted prevention strategies. Markers are necessary for early detection and to guide clinicians to the best personalized treatment. The current semi-invasive endoscopic methods to detect GC are invasive, costly, and time-consuming. Recent advances in proteomics technologies have enabled the screening of many samples and the detection of novel biomarkers and disease-related signature signaling networks. These biomarkers include circulating proteins from different fluids (e.g., plasma, serum, urine, and saliva) and extracellular vesicles. We review relevant published studies on circulating protein biomarkers in GC and detail their application as potential biomarkers for GC diagnosis. Identifying highly sensitive and highly specific diagnostic markers for GC may improve patient survival rates and contribute to advancing precision/personalized medicine.",2.76E-31
,38011563,Transcriptional signatures of early-life stress and antidepressant treatment efficacy.,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,"Individuals with a history of early-life stress (ELS) tend to have an altered course of depression and lower treatment response rates. Research suggests that ELS alters brain development, but the molecular changes in the brain following ELS that may mediate altered antidepressant response have not been systematically studied. Sex and gender also impact the risk of depression and treatment response. Here, we leveraged existing RNA sequencing datasets from 1) blood samples from depressed female- and male-identifying patients treated with escitalopram or desvenlafaxine and assessed for treatment response or failure; 2) the nucleus accumbens (NAc) of female and male mice exposed to ELS and/or adult stress; and 3) the NAc of mice after adult stress, antidepressant treatment with imipramine or ketamine, and assessed for treatment response or failure. We find that transcriptomic signatures of adult stress after a history of ELS correspond with transcriptomic signatures of treatment nonresponse, across species and multiple classes of antidepressants. Transcriptomic correspondence with treatment outcome was stronger among females and weaker among males. We next pharmacologically tested these predictions in our mouse model of early-life and adult social defeat stress and treatment with either chronic escitalopram or acute ketamine. Among female mice, the strongest predictor of behavior was an interaction between ELS and ketamine treatment. Among males, however, early experience and treatment were poor predictors of behavior, mirroring our bioinformatic predictions. These studies provide neurobiological evidence for molecular adaptations in the brain related to sex and ELS that contribute to antidepressant treatment response.",2.56E-31
,38031118,DNA methylation and histone post-translational modifications in atherosclerosis and a novel perspective for epigenetic therapy.,Cell Commun Signal,"Atherosclerosis, which is a vascular pathology characterized by inflammation and plaque build-up within arterial vessel walls, acts as the important cause of most cardiovascular diseases. Except for a lipid-depository and chronic inflammatory, increasing evidences propose that epigenetic modifications are increasingly associated with atherosclerosis and are of interest from both therapeutic and biomarker perspectives. The chronic progressive nature of atherosclerosis has highlighted atherosclerosis heterogeneity and the fact that specific cell types in the complex milieu of the plaque are, by far, not the only initiators and drivers of atherosclerosis. Instead, the ubiquitous effects of cell type are tightly controlled and directed by the epigenetic signature, which, in turn, is affected by many proatherogenic stimuli, including low-density lipoprotein, proinflammatory, and physical forces of blood circulation. In this review, we summarize the role of DNA methylation and histone post-translational modifications in atherosclerosis. The future research directions and potential therapy for the management of atherosclerosis are also discussed. Video Abstract.© 2023. The Author(s).",2.4E-31
,38015286,Epigenetic Regulation in Response to CO(2) Fluctuation in Marine Microalga Nannochloropsis oceanica.,Microb Ecol,"Microalgae often undergo different CO2experiment in their habitat. To adapt to low CO2, carbon concentrating mechanism (CCM) could be launched in majority of microalgae and CCM are regulated at RNA level are well known. However, epigenetic modifications and their potential regulation of the transcription of masked genes at the genome level in response to CO2fluctuation remain unclear. Here epigenetic regulation in response to CO2fluctuation and epigenome-association with phenotypic plasticity of CCM are firstly uncovered in marine microalga Nannochloropsis oceanica IMET1. The result showed that lysine butyrylation (Kbu) and histone H3K9m2 modifications were present in N. oceanica IMET1. Moreover, Kbu modification positively regulated gene expression. In response to CO2fluctuation, there were 5,438 and 1,106 genes regulated by Kbu and H3K9m2 in Nannochloropsis, respectively. Gained or lost histone methylations were closely associated with activating or repressing gene expressions. Differential modifications were mainly enriched in carbon fixation, photorespiration, photosynthesis, and lipid metabolism etc. Massive genome-wide epigenetic reprogramming was observed after N. oceanica cells shifted from high CO2to low CO2. Particularly, we firstly noted that the transcription of the key low CO2responsive carbonic anhydrase (CA5), a key component involved in CCM stress signaling, was potentially regulated by bivalent Kbu-H3K9m2 modifications in microalgae. This study provides novel insights into the relationship between gene transcription and epigenetic modification in Nannochloropsis, which will lay foundation on genetic improvement of CCM at epigenetic level.© 2023.

,37925571,Altered Gut Microbiota and Short-chain Fatty Acids in Chinese Children with Constipated Autism Spectrum Disorder.,Sci Rep,"Gastrointestinal symptoms are more prevalent in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) than in typically developing (TD) children. Constipation is a significant gastrointestinal comorbidity of ASD, but the associations among constipated autism spectrum disorder (C-ASD), microbiota and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are still debated. We enrolled 80 children, divided into the C-ASD group (n?=?40) and the TD group (n?=?40). In this study, an integrated 16S rRNA gene sequencing and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-based metabolomics approach was applied to explore the association of the gut microbiota and SCFAs in C-ASD children in China. The community diversity estimated by the Observe, Chao1, and ACE indices was significantly lower in the C-ASD group than in the TD group. We observed that Ruminococcaceae_UCG_002, Erysipelotrichaceae_UCG_003, Phascolarctobacterium, Megamonas, Ruminiclostridium_5, Parabacteroides, Prevotella_2, Fusobacterium, and Prevotella_9 were enriched in the C-ASD group, and Anaerostipes, Lactobacillus, Ruminococcus_gnavus_group, Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group, Ralstonia, Eubacterium_eligens_group, and Ruminococcus_1 were enriched in the TD group. The propionate levels, which were higher in the C-ASD group, were negatively correlated with the abundance of Lactobacillus taxa, but were positively correlated with the severity of ASD symptoms. The random forest model, based on the 16 representative discriminant genera, achieved a high accuracy (AUC?=?0.924). In conclusion, we found that C-ASD is related to altered gut microbiota and SCFAs, especially decreased abundance of Lactobacillus and excessive propionate in faeces, which provide new clues to understand C-ASD and biomarkers for the diagnosis and potential strategies for treatment of the disorder.

,38104156,LinRace: cell division history reconstruction of single cells using paired lineage barcode and gene expression data.,Nat Commun,"Lineage tracing technology using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing has enabled simultaneous readouts of gene expressions and lineage barcodes in single cells, which allows for inference of cell lineage and cell types at the whole organism level. While most state-of-the-art methods for lineage reconstruction utilize only the lineage barcode data, methods that incorporate gene expressions are emerging. Effectively incorporating the gene expression data requires a reasonable model of how gene expression data changes along generations of divisions. Here, we present LinRace (Lineage Reconstruction with asymmetric cell division model), which integrates lineage barcode and gene expression data using asymmetric cell division model and infers cell lineages and ancestral cell states using Neighbor-Joining and maximum-likelihood heuristics. On both simulated and real data, LinRace outputs more accurate cell division trees than existing methods. With inferred ancestral states, LinRace can also show how a progenitor cell generates a large population of cells with various functionalities.© 2023. The Author(s).",2.23E-31

Despite this awareness, sperm DNA and nuclear integrity tests are still not part of routine examinations for either infertile men or fertile men wishing to assess their reproductive capacity. This is not due to the unavailability of DNA and sperm nuclear integrity tests. On the contrary, several relevant but distinct tests are available and have been used in many clinical trials, which has led to conflicting results and confusion. The reasons for this are mainly the lack of standardization between different clinics and between the tests themselves. In addition, the small number of samples analyzed in these trials has often weakened the value of the analyses performed. In the present work, we used a large cohort of semen samples, covering a wide age range, which were simultaneously evaluated for sperm DNA fragmentation (SDF) using two of the most frequently used SDF assays, namely the TUNEL assay and the sperm chromatin structure assay (SCSA®). At the same time, as standard seminal parameters (sperm motility, sperm morphology, sperm count) were available for these samples, correlations between age, SDF and conventional seminal parameters were analyzed.We show that the SCSA® and TUNEL assessments of SDF produce concordant data. However, the SDF assessed by TUNEL is systematically lower than that assessed by SCSA®. Regardless of the test used, the SDF increases steadily during aging, while the HDS parameter (High DNA stainability assessed via SCSA®) remains unchanged. In the cohort analyzed, conventional sperm parameters do not seem to discriminate with aging. Only sperm volume and motility were significantly lower in the oldest age group analyzed [50-59 years of age].In the large cohort analyzed, SDF is an age-dependent parameter, increasing linearly with aging. The SCSA® assessment of SDF and the flow cytometry-assisted TUNEL assessment are well correlated, although TUNEL is less sensitive than SCSA®. This difference in sensitivity should be taken into account in the final assessment of the true level of fragmentation of the sperm nucleus of a given sample. The classical sperm parameters (motility, morphology, sperm count) do not change dramatically with age, making them inadequate to assess the fertility potential of an individual.© 2023.

Paneth cells (PCs) play a central role in IBD pathogenesis, especially in Crohn's disease development, and their morphology, number and function are regulated by susceptibility genes. In the intestine, PCs participate in the formation of the stem cell microenvironment by secreting antibacterial particles and play a role in helping maintain the intestinal microecology and intestinal mucosal homeostasis. Moreover, PC proliferation and maturation depend on symbiotic flora in the intestine.

However, the precise mechanisms remain elusive. Using a well-defined drug-gene pair, we identified an enhancer region for dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD,DPYDgene) expression that is relevant to the metabolism of the anti-cancer drug 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Using reporter systems, CRISPR genome edited cell models, and human liver specimens, we demonstratedin vitroandvivothat genotype status for the common germline variant (rs4294451; 27% global minor allele frequency) located within this novel enhancer controlsDPYDtranscription and alters resistance to 5-FU. The variant genotype increases recruitment of the transcription factor CEBPB to the enhancer and alters the level of direct interactions between the enhancer andDPYDpromoter.

,37995181,Histone methylation mediated by NSD1 is required for the establishment and maintenance of neuronal identities.,Cell Rep,"Appropriate histone modifications emerge as essential cell fate regulators of neuronal identities across neocortical areas and layers. Here we showed that NSD1, the methyltransferase for di-methylated lysine 36 of histone H3 (H3K36me2), controls both area and layer identities of the neocortex. Nsd1-ablated neocortex showed an area shift of all four primary functional regions and aberrant wiring of cortico-thalamic-cortical projections. Nsd1 conditional knockout mice displayed defects in spatial memory, motor learning, and coordination, resembling patients with the Sotos syndrome carrying NSD1 mutations. On Nsd1 loss, superficial-layer pyramidal neurons (PNs) progressively mis-expressed markers for deep-layer PNs, and PNs remained immature both morphologically and electrophysiologically. Loss of Nsd1 in postmitotic PNs causes genome-wide loss of H3K36me2 and re-distribution of DNA methylation, which accounts for diminished expression of neocortical layer specifiers but ectopic expression of non-neural genes. Together, H3K36me2 mediated by NSD1 is required for the establishment and maintenance of region- and layer-specific neocortical identities.Copyright © 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

This study aimed to identify crosstalk genes between IBD and osteoporosis (OP) and potential relationships between crosstalk and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs)-related genes. Three common hub genes from different compared groups are actually the same, namely HDAC6, IL-8, and PPIF. ROC showed that the combined diagnostic value of HDAC6, IL-8, and PPIF was higher than each of the three key hub genes. Immune infiltration results showed that HDAC6 and IL-8 key genes negatively correlated with CD65 bright natural killer cells. USF1 was the common upstream TFs between HDAC6 and PPIF, and MYC was the common upstream TFs between IL-8 and PPIF in RegNetwork. Taken together, this study shows a linked mechanism between IBD and OP via NETs and crosstalk genes. These findings may show light on better diagnosis and treatment of IBD complicated with OP.© 2024.

We hypothesized that the chromatin organization of PBMCs obtained from liquid biopsies, which integrates secretome signals with gene expression programs, provides efficient biomarkers to characterize tumor signals and the efficacy of proton therapy in tumor patients. Here, we show that chromatin imaging of PBMCs combined with machine learning methods provides such robust and predictive chromatin biomarkers. We show that such chromatin biomarkers enable the classification of 10 healthy and 10 pan-tumor patients. Furthermore, we extended our pipeline to assess the tumor types and states of 30 tumor patients undergoing (proton) radiation therapy. We show that our pipeline can thereby accurately distinguish between three tumor groups with up to 89% accuracy and enables the monitoring of the treatment effects.

Although JMJ-C family genes have an essential role in regulating plant growth and development, the characterization of the JMJ-C family genes in melon has not been uncovered.In this study, a total of 17 JMJ-C proteins were identified in melon (Cucumis melo L.). CmJMJs were categorized into five subfamilies based on the specific conserved domain: KDM4/JHDM3, KDM5/JARID1, JMJD6, KDM3/JHDM2, and JMJ-C domain-only. The chromosome localization analyses showed that 17 CmJMJs were distributed on nine chromosomes. Cis-acting element analyses of the 17 CmJMJ genes showed numerous hormone, light, and stress response elements distributed in the promoter region. Covariance analysis revealed one pair of replicated fragments (CmJMJ3a and CmJMJ3b) in 17 CmJMJ genes. We investigated the expression profile of 17 CmJMJ genes in different lateral organs and four developmental stages of fruit by RNA-seq transcriptome analysis and RT-qPCR. The results revealed that most CmJMJ genes were prominently expressed in female flowers, ovaries, and developing fruits, suggesting their active role in melon fruit development. Subcellular localization showed that the fruit-related CmJMJ5a protein is specifically localized in the cell nucleus.This study provides a comprehensive understanding of the gene structure, classification, and evolution of JMJ-C in melon and supports the clarification of the JMJ-C functions in further research.© 2023.

,38132139,Age-Related Alternative Splicing: Driver or Passenger in the Aging Process?,Cells,"Alternative splicing changes are closely linked to aging, though it remains unclear if they are drivers or effects. As organisms age, splicing patterns change, varying gene isoform levels and functions. These changes may contribute to aging alterations rather than just reflect declining RNA quality control. Three main splicing types-intron retention, cassette exons, and cryptic exons-play key roles in age-related complexity. These events modify protein domains and increase nonsense-mediated decay, shifting protein isoform levels and functions. This may potentially drive aging or serve as a biomarker. Fluctuations in splicing factor expression also occur with aging. Somatic mutations in splicing genes can also promote aging and age-related disease. The interplay between splicing and aging has major implications for aging biology, though differentiating correlation and causation remains challenging. Declaring a splicing factor or event as a driver requires comprehensive evaluation of the associated molecular and physiological changes. A greater understanding of how RNA splicing machinery and downstream targets are impacted by aging is essential to conclusively establish the role of splicing in driving aging, representing a promising area with key implications for understanding aging, developing novel therapeutical options, and ultimately leading to an increase in the healthy human lifespan.",1.57E-31
,37986720,Inferring stochastic rates from heterogeneous snapshots of particle positions.,ArXiv,"Many imaging techniques for biological systems - like fixation of cells coupled with fluorescence microscopy - provide sharp spatial resolution in reporting locations of individuals at a single moment in time but also destroy the dynamics they intend to capture. Thesesnapshot observationscontain no information about individual trajectories, but still encode information about movement and demographic dynamics, especially when combined with a well-motivated biophysical model. The relationship between spatially evolving populations and single-moment representations of their collective locations is well-established with partial differential equations (PDEs) and their inverse problems. However, experimental data is commonly a set of locations whose number is insufficient to approximate a continuous-in-space PDE solution. Here, motivated by popular subcellular imaging data of gene expression, we embrace the stochastic nature of the data and investigate the mathematical foundations of parametrically inferring demographic rates from snapshots of particles undergoing birth, diffusion, and death in a nuclear or cellular domain. Toward inference, we rigorously derive a connection between individual particle paths and their presentation as a Poisson spatial process. Using this framework, we investigate the properties of the resulting inverse problem and study factors that affect quality of inference. One pervasive feature of this experimental regime is the presence of cell-to-cell heterogeneity. Rather than being a hindrance, we show that cell-to-cell geometric heterogeneity canincreasethe quality of inference on dynamics for certain parameter regimes. Altogether, the results serve as a basis for more detailed investigations of subcellular spatial patterns of RNA molecules and other stochastically evolving populations that can only be observed for single instants in their time evolution.",1.53E-31

MRI is able to detect a wide range of diseases and conditions, including nervous system disorders and cancer, and uses the principles of NMR relaxation to generate detailed internal images of the body. For such investigation, different metal complexes have been studied as potential MRI contrast agents. With this in mind, this work aims to investigate two systems containing the vanadium complexes [VO(metf)2]·H2O (VC1) and [VO(bpy)2Cl]+(VC2), being metformin and bipyridine ligands of the respective complexes, with the biological targets AMPK and ULK1. These biomolecules are involved in the progression of Alzheimer's disease and triple-negative breast cancer, respectively, and may act as promising spectroscopic probes for detection of these diseases. To initially evaluate the behavior of the studied ligands within the aforementioned protein active sites and aqueous environment, four classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations including VC1 + H2O (1), VC2 + H2O (2), VC1 + AMPK + H2O (3), and VC2 + ULK1 + H2O (4) were performed. From this, it was obtained that for both systems containing VCs and water only, the theoretical calculations implied a higher efficiency when compared withDOTAREM, a famous commercially available contrast agent for MRI. This result is maintained when evaluating the system containing VC1 + AMPK + H2O. Nevertheless, for the system VC2 + ULK1 + H2O, there was observed a decrease in the vanadium complex efficiency due to the presence of a relevant steric hindrance. Despite that, due to the nature of the interaction between VC2 and ULK1, and the nature of its ligands, the study gives an insight that some modifications on VC2 structure might improve its efficiency as an MRI probe.",1.12E-31

Female plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) exert an elevated capacity to produce IFN-I upon toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) activation compared to male pDCs, and both sex hormones and X-encoded genes have been implicated in these sex-specific differences. Using longitudinal samples from a trans men cohort receiving gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT), the impact of testosterone injections on TLR7-mediated IFN-I production by pDCs was assessed. Single-cell RNA analyses of pDCs showed downregulation of IFN-I-related gene expression signatures but also revealed transcriptional inter-donor heterogeneity. Longitudinal quantification showed continuous reduction of IFN-I protein production by pDCs and reduced expression of IFN-I-stimulated genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).

The colocalization analysis was performed to detect causal variants shared by proteins and PSC. The identified proteins were further enriched in pathways and diseases. A phenome-wide association screening was performed and potential drugs were assessed as well.The results indicated that genetically predicted plasma levels of 14 proteins were positively associated with an increased risk of PSC and 8 proteins were inversely associated with PSC risk in both PSC GWAS data sets, and they all survived in sensitivity analyses. The colocalization indicated that AIF1 (allograft inflammatory factor 1) and HLA-DQA2 (major histocompatibility complex, class II, DQ alpha 2) were shared proteins with PSC, and they should be direct targets for PSC. The phenome-wide screening suggested that variants located at AIF1 or HLA-DQA2 region were closely associated with several autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, implicating the shared pathogenesis among them.Our study highly pinpointed two candidate targets (AIF1 and HLA-DQA2) for PSC.© 2023.

,37942152,Evaluating the hepatotoxic versus the nephrotoxic role of iron oxide nanoparticles: One step forward into the dose-dependent oxidative effects.,Heliyon,"The present study has been designed to detect the dose-dependent effect of iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) on the liver and kidney of rats by evaluating three different doses 30, 300, 1000 mg/kg/day IONPs for 28 days. Forty rats were divided into four groups; I (control), II (low dose), III (medium dose) and IV (high dose). There also was a statistically-significant elevation in the serum levels of hepatic enzymes; AST and ALT in medium & high dose. The elevation of serum ALP, on the other hand, was significant in all IONPs doses. There was significant elevation in the levels of urea creatinine, and MDA in the medium and high doses of IONPs. The activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) showed significant decrease in the high dose only compared to the control group. The serum iron levels increased in a dose-dependent manner in the IONPs-treated groups with highly significant increase in the moderate and high dose groups. On comparing the effect of different doses of IONPs between the liver and kidney, the high dose revealed statistically significant difference (p < 0.05) in the area percent of collagen deposition (54.4 ± 3.9 versus 6.1 ± 2.6) and alpha smooth muscle actin (?-SMA) reaction (7.7 ± 1.5 versus 17.8 ± 4.3) in the liver relative to the kidney. The medium and high doses revealed statistically significant difference in optical density of Periodic acid Schiff (PAS) reaction (45 ± 3.4 versus 50.3 ± 1.8 in the medium dose, and 38.9 ± 6 versus 63 ± 3 in the high dose) and area percent of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) reaction (12.98 ± 2.7 versus 3.5 ± 0.5 in the medium dose, and 27.91 ± 1.5 versus 7.7 ± 0.6 in the high dose) in the liver relative to the kidney.© 2023 The Authors.",6.21E-32
,38018033,The outpost against cancer: universal cancer only markers.,Cancer Biol Med,"Cancer is the leading cause of death worldwide. Early detection of cancer can lower the mortality of all types of cancer; however, effective early-detection biomarkers are lacking for most types of cancers. DNA methylation has always been a major target of interest because DNA methylation usually occurs before other detectable genetic changes. While investigating the common features of cancer using a novel guide positioning sequencing for DNA methylation, a series of universal cancer only markers (UCOMs) have emerged as strong candidates for effective and accurate early detection of cancer. While the clinical value of current cancer biomarkers is diminished by low sensitivity and/or low specificity, the unique characteristics of UCOMs ensure clinically meaningful results. Validation of the clinical potential of UCOMs in lung, cervical, endometrial, and urothelial cancers further supports the application of UCOMs in multiple cancer types and various clinical scenarios. In fact, the applications of UCOMs are currently under active investigation with further evaluation in the early detection of cancer, auxiliary diagnosis, treatment efficacy, and recurrence monitoring. The molecular mechanisms by which UCOMs detect cancers are the next important topics to be investigated. The application of UCOMs in real-world scenarios also requires implementation and refinement.Copyright © 2023 Cancer Biology & Medicine.",5.82E-32
,38156388,Association between COVID-19 and sensorineural hearing loss: Evidence from a Mendelian randomization study in European and East Asian population.,Immun Inflamm Dis,"Long coronavirus disease (COVID), characterized by persistent and sometimes debilitating symptoms following a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, has garnered increasing attention as a potential public health crisis. Emerging evidence indicates a higher incidence of hearing loss in individuals who have had COVID 2019 (COVID-19) compared to the general population. However, the conclusions were inconsistent, and the causal relationship between COVID-19 and sensorineural hearing loss remains unknown.To addresses this outstanding issue, we performed Mendelian randomization analysis to detect the causal association between COVID-19 and hearing loss using the largest genome-wide association study data to date in the European population and confirmed the results in the East Asian population. Comprehensively sensitive analyses were followed, including Cochran's Q test, Mendelian randomization (MR)-Egger intercept test, MR-pleiotropy residual sum and outlier, and leave-one-out analysis, to validate the robustness of our results.Our results suggested that there is no causal association between COVID-19 and the risk of hearing loss in the European population. Neither the susceptibility, hospitalization, and severity of COVID-19 on hearing loss (inverse variance weighted method: odds ratio (OR)?=?1.046, 95% confidence interval (CI)?=?0.907-1.205, p?=?.537; OR?=?0.995, 95% CI?=?0.956-1.036, p?=?.823; OR?=?0.995, 95% CI?=?0.967-1.025, p?=?.76). Replicated analyses in the East Asian population yielded consistent results. No pleiotropy and heterogeneity were found in our results.In conclusion, our MR results do not support a genetically predicted causal relationship between COVID-19 and sensorineural hearing loss. Thus, the associations observed in prior observational studies may have been influenced by confounding factors rather than a direct cause-and-effect relationship. More clinical and mechanism research are needed to further understand this association in the future.© 2023 The Authors.

,38101163,Characterization of Limnospira platensis PCC 9108 R-M and CRISPR-Cas systems.,Microbiol Res,"The filamentous cyanobacterium Limnospira platensis, formerly known as Arthrospira platensis or spirulina, is one of the most commercially important species of microalgae. Due to its high nutritional value, pharmacological and industrial applications it is extensively cultivated on a large commercial scale. Despite its widespread use, its precise manipulation is still under development due to the lack of effective genetic protocols. Genetic transformation of Limnospira has been attempted but the methods reported have not been generally reproducible in other laboratories. Knowledge of the transformation defense mechanisms is essential for understanding its physiology and for broadening their applications. With the aim to understand more about the genetic defenses of L. platensis, in this work we have identified the restriction-modification and CRISPR-Cas systems and we have cloned and characterized thirteen methylases. In parallel, we have also characterized the methylome and orphan methyltransferases using genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation patterns and RNA-seq. The identification and characterization of these enzymes will be a valuable resource to know how this strain avoids being genetically manipulated and for further genomics studies.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

,38077089,The Complete Sequence and Comparative Analysis of Ape Sex Chromosomes.,bioRxiv,"Apes possess two sex chromosomes-the male-specific Y and the X shared by males and females. The Y chromosome is crucial for male reproduction, with deletions linked to infertility. The X chromosome carries genes vital for reproduction and cognition. Variation in mating patterns and brain function among great apes suggests corresponding differences in their sex chromosome structure and evolution. However, due to their highly repetitive nature and incomplete reference assemblies, ape sex chromosomes have been challenging to study. Here, using the state-of-the-art experimental and computational methods developed for the telomere-to-telomere (T2T) human genome, we produced gapless, complete assemblies of the X and Y chromosomes for five great apes (chimpanzee, bonobo, gorilla, Bornean and Sumatran orangutans) and a lesser ape, the siamang gibbon. These assemblies completely resolved ampliconic, palindromic, and satellite sequences, including the entire centromeres, allowing us to untangle the intricacies of ape sex chromosome evolution. We found that, compared to the X, ape Y chromosomes vary greatly in size and have low alignability and high levels of structural rearrangements. This divergence on the Y arises from the accumulation of lineage-specific ampliconic regions and palindromes (which are shared more broadly among species on the X) and from the abundance of transposable elements and satellites (which have a lower representation on the X). Our analysis of Y chromosome genes revealed lineage-specific expansions of multi-copy gene families and signatures of purifying selection. In summary, the Y exhibits dynamic evolution, while the X is more stable. Finally, mapping short-read sequencing data from >100 great ape individuals revealed the patterns of diversity and selection on their sex chromosomes, demonstrating the utility of these reference assemblies for studies of great ape evolution. These complete sex chromosome assemblies are expected to further inform conservation genetics of nonhuman apes, all of which are endangered species.",5.1E-32
,37923858,"Sex differences in energy metabolism: natural selection, mechanisms and consequences.",Nat Rev Nephrol,"Metabolic homeostasis operates differently in men and women. This sex asymmetry is the result of evolutionary adaptations that enable women to resist loss of energy stores and protein mass while remaining fertile in times of energy deficit. During starvation or prolonged exercise, women rely on oxidation of lipids, which are a more efficient energy source than carbohydrates, to preserve glucose for neuronal and placental function and spare proteins necessary for organ function. Carbohydrate reliance in men could be an evolutionary adaptation related to defence and hunting, as glucose, unlike lipids, can be used as a fuel for anaerobic high-exertion muscle activity. The larger subcutaneous adipose tissue depots in healthy women than in healthy men provide a mechanism for lipid storage. As female mitochondria have higher functional capacity and greater resistance to oxidative damage than male mitochondria, uniparental inheritance of female mitochondria may reduce the transmission of metabolic disorders. However, in women, starvation resistance and propensity to obesity have evolved in tandem, and the current prevalence of obesity is greater in women than in men. The combination of genetic sex, programming by developmental testosterone in males, and pubertal sex hormones defines sex-specific biological systems in adults that produce phenotypic sex differences in energy homeostasis, metabolic disease and drug responses.© 2023.

,38017371,A machine learning one-class logistic regression model to predict stemness for single cell transcriptomics and spatial omics.,BMC Genomics,"Cell annotation is a crucial methodological component to interpreting single cell and spatial omics data. These approaches were developed for single cell analysis but are often biased, manually curated and yet unproven in spatial omics. Here we apply a stemness model for assessing oncogenic states to single cell and spatial omic cancer datasets. This one-class logistic regression machine learning algorithm is used to extract transcriptomic features from non-transformed stem cells to identify dedifferentiated cell states in tumors. We found this method identifies single cell states in metastatic tumor cell populations without the requirement of cell annotation. This machine learning model identified stem-like cell populations not identified in single cell or spatial transcriptomic analysis using existing methods. For the first time, we demonstrate the application of a ML tool across five emerging spatial transcriptomic and proteomic technologies to identify oncogenic stem-like cell types in the tumor microenvironment.© 2023.

Temperature variations can affect the growth and overall health of vine.We used Self Organizing Maps machine learning method to analyze gene expression data from leaves of fiveVitis viniferacultivars each treated by four different temperature conditions. The algorithm generated sample-specific ""portraits"" of the normalized gene expression data, revealing distinct patterns related to the temperature conditions applied.Our analysis unveiled a connection with vitamin B1 (thiamine) biosynthesis, suggesting a link between temperature regulation and thiamine metabolism, in agreement with thiamine related stress response established in Arabidopsis before. Furthermore, we found that epigenetic mechanisms play a crucial role in regulating the expression of stress-responsive genes at low temperatures in grapevines.Application of Self Organizing Maps portrayal to vine transcriptomics identified modules of coregulated genes triggered under cold stress.

,38106023,Pervasive correlations between causal disease effects of proximal SNPs vary with functional annotations and implicate stabilizing selection.,medRxiv,"The genetic architecture of human diseases and complex traits has been extensively studied, but little is known about the relationship of causal disease effect sizes between proximal SNPs, which have largely been assumed to be independent. We introduce a new method, LD SNP-pair effect correlation regression (LDSPEC), to estimate the correlation of causal disease effect sizes of derived alleles between proximal SNPs, depending on their allele frequencies, LD, and functional annotations; LDSPEC produced robust estimates in simulations across various genetic architectures. We applied LDSPEC to 70 diseases and complex traits from the UK Biobank (averageN=306K), meta-analyzing results across diseases/traits. We detected significantly nonzero effect correlations for proximal SNP pairs (e.g., -0.37±0.09 for low-frequency positive-LD 0-100bp SNP pairs) that decayed with distance (e.g., -0.07±0.01 for low-frequency positive-LD 1-10kb), varied with allele frequency (e.g., -0.15±0.04 for common positive-LD 0-100bp), and varied with LD between SNPs (e.g., +0.12±0.05 for common negative-LD 0-100bp) (because we consider derived alleles, positive-LD and negative-LD SNP pairs may yield very different results). We further determined that SNP pairs with shared functions had stronger effect correlations that spanned longer genomic distances, e.g., -0.37±0.08 for low-frequency positive-LD same-gene promoter SNP pairs (average genomic distance of 47kb (due to alternative splicing)) and -0.32±0.04 for low-frequency positive-LD H3K27ac 0-1kb SNP pairs. Consequently, SNP-heritability estimates were substantially smaller than estimates of the sum of causal effect size variances across all SNPs (ratio of 0.87±0.02 across diseases/traits), particularly for certain functional annotations (e.g., 0.78±0.01 for common Super enhancer SNPs)-even though these quantities are widely assumed to be equal. We recapitulated our findings via forward simulations with an evolutionary model involving stabilizing selection, implicating the action of linkage masking, whereby haplotypes containing linked SNPs with opposite effects on disease have reduced effects on fitness and escape negative selection.",3.76E-32
,37973897,Vitamin B(12) is a limiting factor for induced cellular plasticity and tissue repair.,Nat Metab,"Transient reprogramming by the expression of OCT4, SOX2, KLF4 and MYC (OSKM) is a therapeutic strategy for tissue regeneration and rejuvenation, but little is known about its metabolic requirements. Here we show that OSKM reprogramming in mice causes a global depletion of vitamin B12and molecular hallmarks of methionine starvation. Supplementation with vitamin B12increases the efficiency of reprogramming both in mice and in cultured cells, the latter indicating a cell-intrinsic effect. We show that the epigenetic mark H3K36me3, which prevents illegitimate initiation of transcription outside promoters (cryptic transcription), is sensitive to vitamin B12levels, providing evidence for a link between B12levels, H3K36 methylation, transcriptional fidelity and efficient reprogramming. Vitamin B12supplementation also accelerates tissue repair in a model of ulcerative colitis. We conclude that vitamin B12, through its key role in one-carbon metabolism and epigenetic dynamics, improves the efficiency of in vivo reprogramming and tissue repair.© 2023.

,37981859,Functional genomics in Spiralia.,Brief Funct Genomics,"Our understanding of the mechanisms that modulate gene expression in animals is strongly biased by studying a handful of model species that mainly belong to three groups: Insecta, Nematoda and Vertebrata. However, over half of the animal phyla belong to Spiralia, a morphologically and ecologically diverse animal clade with many species of economic and biomedical importance. Therefore, investigating genome regulation in this group is central to uncovering ancestral and derived features in genome functioning in animals, which can also be of significant societal impact. Here, we focus on five aspects of gene expression regulation to review our current knowledge of functional genomics in Spiralia. Although some fields, such as single-cell transcriptomics, are becoming more common, the study of chromatin accessibility, DNA methylation, histone post-translational modifications and genome architecture are still in their infancy.

,38092918,Conserved and divergent gene regulatory programs of the mammalian neocortex.,Nature,"Divergence of cis-regulatory elements drives species-specific traits1, but how this manifests in the evolution of the neocortex at the molecular and cellular level remains unclear. Here we investigated the gene regulatory programs in the primary motor cortex of human, macaque, marmoset and mouse using single-cell multiomics assays, generating gene expression, chromatin accessibility, DNA methylome and chromosomal conformation profiles from a total of over 200,000 cells. From these data, we show evidence that divergence of transcription factor expression corresponds to species-specific epigenome landscapes. We find that conserved and divergent gene regulatory features are reflected in the evolution of the three-dimensional genome. Transposable elements contribute to nearly 80% of the human-specific candidate cis-regulatory elements in cortical cells. Through machine learning, we develop sequence-based predictors of candidate cis-regulatory elements in different species and demonstrate that the genomic regulatory syntax is highly preserved from rodents to primates. Finally, we show that epigenetic conservation combined with sequence similarity helps to uncover functional cis-regulatory elements and enhances our ability to interpret genetic variants contributing to neurological disease and traits.© 2023.

The invasion of pine wood nematode has undergone various rapid adaptations to a wide range of temperatures and to new hosts and vector insects. DNA methylation may play crucial roles in the rapid adaptation of PWN during invasion. However, whether the PWN genome contins functional DNA modifications remains elusive.Here, we detected the extensive presence of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and N6-methyladenine (6mA) in the B. xylophilus genome, with low methylation levels at most positions. Cytosines were methylated in the CpG, CHG. and CHH sequence contexts, with the lowest methylation levels at CpG sites. The methylation levels of CpG and 6mA in gene regions showed opposite trends. The changes in the abundance of 5mC and 6mA showed the same trends in response to temperature change, but opposite trends during development. Sequence and phylogenetic analyses showed that the proteins BxDAMT and BxNMAD have typical characteristics of a methylase and demethylase, respectively, and are conserved among species.These findings shed light on the epigenetic modifications present in the genome of PWN, and will improve our understanding of its invasiveness and evolution.© 2023.

The neurobiology of Internet addiction (IA) has attracted much attention in scientific research, which is now focusing on identifying measurable biological markers. Aim of this study was to investigate epigenetic and genetic regulation of oxytocin receptor (OXTR), dopamine transporter (DAT1) and serotonin transporter (SERT) genes using DNA obtained from saliva samples of young university students: the Internet Addiction Test (IAT) was administered to evaluate the potential existence and intensity of IA. Significant changes in DNA methylation levels at OXTR, DAT1 and SERT genes were observed in the 30?<?IAT?<?49 group (mild-risk internet users) compared to the IAT?<?29 subjects (complete control of internet use) and IAT?>?50 subjects (considered as moderately addicted). Moreover, epigenetic markers were significantly correlated, either directly (for OXTR and DAT1) or inversely (OXTR and DAT1 versus SERT), to the psychometric properties. Our data confirmed the association of OXTR, DAT1 and SERT genes in processes related to behavioural addictions and might be of relevance to suggest possible biological predictors of altered behaviours and the eventual vulnerability to develop an IA. Different other genetic pathways have been suggested to play a role in IA and research is ongoing to better define them, in order to help in the early diagnosis as well as in the development of new potential treatments.© 2023.

,37925372,The AIRN lncRNA is imprinted and paternally expressed in pigs.,J Anim Sci,"Genomic imprinting plays critical roles during the development of mammalian species and underlying epigenetic mechanisms frequently involve long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). The paternal transcription of the antisense Igf2r RNA noncoding (Airn) is responsible for paternal silencing of the mouse insulin-like growth factor 2 receptor (Igf2r) gene and maternal Igf2r expression. Although the corresponding maternal DNA methylation imprint is conserved in humans and pigs, the orthologous AIRN lncRNA has been identified in humans but not in pigs. Here, we aimed to examine imprinted allelic expression of the porcine AIRN lncRNA along with a corresponding differentially methylated region (DMR) and to analyze allelic expression of AIRN and IGF2R in pigs. By comparing parthenogenetic and control porcine embryos, we identified a maternally methylated DMR and a significantly higher expression of AIRN lncRNA in control embryos (P < 0.05) indicating its paternal expression. Further analyses revealed that the expression of AIRN lncRNA was enriched in the pig brain and its subregions, and it was monoallelically expressed; whereas, IGF2R was expressed biallelically suggesting an absence of allele-specific transcriptional regulation. Our findings will lead to further investigations into the role of the imprinted porcine AIRN lncRNA during pig development.© The Author(s) 2023.

PENGUIN integrates H3K27ac-HiChIP data with tissue-specific PPIs to define enhancer-promoter PPI networks (EPINs). We validated PENGUIN using cancer (LNCaP) and benign (LHSAR) prostate cell lines. Our analysis detected EPIN clusters enriched with the architectural protein CTCF, a regulator of enhancer-promoter interactions. CTCF presence was coupled with the prevalence of prostate cancer (PrCa) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the same EPIN clusters, suggesting functional implications in PrCa. Within the EPINs displaying enrichments in both CTCF and PrCa SNPs, we also show enrichment in oncogenes. We substantiated our identified SNPs through CRISPR/Cas9 knockout and RNAi screens experiments. Here we show that PENGUIN provides insights into the intricate interplay between enhancer-promoter interactions and PPI networks, which are crucial for identifying key genes and potential intervention targets.

,38136630,Environmental and Genetic Traffic in the Journey from Sperm to Offspring.,Biomolecules,"Recent advancements in the understanding of how sperm develop into offspring have shown complex interactions between environmental influences and genetic factors. The past decade, marked by a research surge, has not only highlighted the profound impact of paternal contributions on fertility and reproductive outcomes but also revolutionized our comprehension by unveiling how parental factors sculpt traits in successive generations through mechanisms that extend beyond traditional inheritance patterns. Studies have shown that offspring are more susceptible to environmental factors, especially during critical phases of growth. While these factors are broadly detrimental to health, their effects are especially acute during these periods. Moving beyond the immutable nature of the genome, the epigenetic profile of cells emerges as a dynamic architecture. This flexibility renders it susceptible to environmental disruptions. The primary objective of this review is to shed light on the diverse processes through which environmental agents affect male reproductive capacity. Additionally, it explores the consequences of paternal environmental interactions, demonstrating how interactions can reverberate in the offspring. It encompasses direct genetic changes as well as a broad spectrum of epigenetic adaptations. By consolidating current empirically supported research, it offers an exhaustive perspective on the interwoven trajectories of the environment, genetics, and epigenetics in the elaborate transition from sperm to offspring.",2.18E-32
,38102503,Genetic basis and repeatability for desiccation resistance in Drosophila melanogaster (Diptera: Drosophilidae).,Genetica,"Dehydration is a stress factor for organisms inhabiting natural habitats where water is scarce. Thus, it may be expected that species facing arid environments will develop mechanisms that maximize resistance to desiccation. Insects are excellent models for studying the effects of dehydration as well as the mechanisms and processes that prevent water loss since the effect of desiccation is greater due to the higher area/volume ratio than larger animals. Even though physiological and behavioral mechanisms to cope with desiccation are being understood, the genetic basis underlying the mechanisms related to variation in desiccation resistance and the context-dependent effect remain unsolved. Here we analyze the genetic bases of desiccation resistance in Drosophila melanogaster and identify candidate genes that underlie trait variation. Our quantitative genetic analysis of desiccation resistance revealed sexual dimorphism and extensive genetic variation. The phenotype-genotype association analyses (GWAS) identified 71 candidate genes responsible for total phenotypic variation in desiccation resistance. Half of these candidate genes were sex-specific suggesting that the genetic architecture underlying this adaptive trait differs between males and females. Moreover, the public availability of desiccation data analyzed on the same lines but in a different lab allows us to investigate the reliability and repeatability of results obtained in independent screens. Our survey indicates a pervasive micro-environment lab-dependent effect since we did not detect overlap in the sets of genes affecting desiccation resistance identified between labs.© 2023.

Epigenetically, a significant reduction in the global H3K4me3 content was observed only in h-PDLCs. Immunoblotting data reveal a significant reduction in the global H3K4me3 content, at 3?days of induction only in h-PDLCs, while an increase in the global H3K4me3 content was observed at 10?days for both PDLCs. Additionally, positive correlations were found between global H3K4me3 levels and JARID1B gene expression.Altogether, our results show the crucial role of JARID1B in repressing PDLCs osteogenic phenotype and this claims to pre-clinical protocols proposing JARID1B as a potential therapeutic target.© 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",2.15E-32
,38148940,Aberrant expression of multiple glycolytic enzyme genes is significantly associated with disease progression and survival outcomes in prostate cancers.,Am J Clin Exp Urol,"Prostate cancer is the leading cause of cancer death after lung cancer in men. Recent studies showed that aberrant metabolic pathways are involved in prostate cancer development and progression. In this study, we performed a systemic analysis of glycolytic enzyme gene expression using the TCGA-PRAD RNAseq dataset. Our analysis revealed that among 25 genes, only four genes (HK2/GPI/PFKL/PGAM5) were significantly upregulated while nine genes (HK1/GCK/PFKM/PFKP/ALDOC/PGK1/PGAM1/ENO2/PKM) were downregulated in primary prostate cancer tissues compared to benign compartments. Among these 13 altered genes, four genes (ENO2/ALDOC/GPI/GCK) exhibited strong diagnostic potential in distinguishing malignant and benign tissues. Meanwhile, GPI expression exerted as a prognostic factor of progression-free and disease-specific survival. PFKL and PGAM5 gene expressions were associated with AR signaling scores in castration-resistant patients, and AR-targeted therapy suppressed their expression. In LuCap35 xenograft tumors, PFKL and PGAM5 expression was significantly reduced after animal castration, confirming the AR dependency. Conversely, GCK/PKLR genes were significantly associated with neuroendocrinal progression, representing two novel neuroendocrinal biomarkers for prostate cancer. In conclusion, our results suggest that GPI expression is a strong prognostic factor for prostate cancer progression and survival while GCK/PKLR are two novel biomarkers of prostate cancer progression to neuroendocrinal status.AJCEU Copyright © 2023.",2.07E-32
,38156078,Heritable responses to stress in plants.,Quant Plant Biol,"Most plants are adapted to their environments through generations of exposure to all elements. The adaptation process involves the best possible response to fluctuations in the environment based on the genetic and epigenetic make-up of the organism. Many plant species have the capacity to acclimate or adapt to certain stresses, allowing them to respond more efficiently, with fewer resources diverted from growth and development. However, plants can also acquire protection against stress across generations. Such a response is known as an intergenerational response to stress; typically, plants lose most of the tolerance in the subsequent generation when propagated without stress. Occasionally, the protection lasts for more than one generation after stress exposure and such a response is called transgenerational. In this review, we will summarize what is known about inter- and transgenerational responses to stress, focus on phenotypic and epigenetic events, their mechanisms and ecological and evolutionary meaning.© The Author(s) 2023.",2.03E-32
,38096409,Master regulators of biological systems in higher dimensions.,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,"A longstanding goal of biology is to identify the key genes and species that critically impact evolution, ecology, and health. Network analysis has revealed keystone species that regulate ecosystems and master regulators that regulate cellular genetic networks. Yet these studies have focused on pairwise biological interactions, which can be affected by the context of genetic background and other species present, generating higher-order interactions. The important regulators of higher-order interactions are unstudied. To address this, we applied a high-dimensional geometry approach that quantifies epistasis in a fitness landscape to ask how individual genes and species influence the interactions in the rest of the biological network. We then generated and also reanalyzed 5-dimensional datasets (two genetic, two microbiome). We identified key genes (e.g., therbslocus andpykF) and species (e.g.,Lactobacilli) that control the interactions of many other genes and species. These higher-order master regulators can induce or suppress evolutionary and ecological diversification by controlling the topography of the fitness landscape.

,38003008,Workability of mRNA Sequencing for Predicting Protein Abundance.,Genes (Basel),"Transcriptomics methods (RNA-Seq, PCR) today are more routine and reproducible than proteomics methods, i.e., both mass spectrometry and immunochemical analysis. For this reason, most scientific studies are limited to assessing the level of mRNA content. At the same time, protein content (and its post-translational status) largely determines the cell's state and behavior. Such a forced extrapolation of conclusions from the transcriptome to the proteome often seems unjustified. The ratios of ""transcript-protein"" pairs can vary by several orders of magnitude for different genes. As a rule, the correlation coefficient between transcriptome-proteome levels for different tissues does not exceed 0.3-0.5. Several characteristics determine the ratio between the content of mRNA and protein: among them, the rate of movement of the ribosome along the mRNA and the number of free ribosomes in the cell, the availability of tRNA, the secondary structure, and the localization of the transcript. The technical features of the experimental methods also significantly influence the levels of the transcript and protein of the corresponding gene on the outcome of the comparison.

,38029064,The genomic response to urbanization in the damselfly Ischnura elegans.,Evol Appl,"The complex and rapid environmental changes brought about by urbanization pose significant challenges to organisms. The multifaceted effects of urbanization often make it difficult to define and pinpoint the very nature of adaptive urban phenotypes. In such situations, scanning genomes for regions differentiated between urban and non-urban populations may be an attractive approach. Here, we investigated the genomic signatures of adaptation to urbanization in the damselflyIschnura eleganssampled from 31 rural and urban localities in three geographic regions: southern and northern Poland, and southern Sweden. Genome-wide variation was assessed using more than 370,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) genotyped by ddRADseq. Associations between SNPs and the level of urbanization were tested using two genetic environment association methods: Latent Factors Mixed Models and BayPass. While we found numerous candidate SNPs and a highly significant overlap between candidates identified by the two methods within the geographic regions, there was a distinctive lack of repeatability between the geographic regions both at the level of individual SNPs and of genomic regions. However, we found ""synapse organization"" at the top of the functional categories enriched among the genes located in the proximity of the candidate urbanization SNPs. Interestingly, the overall significance of ""synapse organization"" was built up by the accretion of different genes associated with candidate SNPs in different geographic regions. This finding is consistent with the highly polygenic nature of adaptation, where the response may be achieved through a subtle adjustment of allele frequencies in different genes that contribute to adaptive phenotypes. Taken together, our results point to a polygenic adaptive response in the nervous system, specifically implicating genes involved in synapse organization, which mirrors the findings from several genomic and behavioral studies of adaptation to urbanization in other taxa.© 2023 The Authors.

However, as individuals age, the hematopoietic system undergoes significant functional decline, rendering them more susceptible to age-related diseases. Growing research evidence has highlighted the critical role of epigenetic regulation in this age-associated decline. This review aims to provide an overview of the diverse epigenetic mechanisms involved in the regulation of normal HSCs during the aging process and their implications in aging-related diseases. Understanding the intricate interplay of epigenetic mechanisms that contribute to aging-related changes in the hematopoietic system holds great potential for the development of innovative strategies to delay the aging process. In fact, interventions targeting epigenetic modifications have shown promising outcomes in alleviating aging-related phenotypes and extending lifespan in various animal models. Small molecule-based therapies and reprogramming strategies enabling epigenetic rejuvenation have emerged as effective approaches for ameliorating or even reversing aging-related conditions. By acquiring a deeper understanding of these epigenetic mechanisms, it is anticipated that interventions can be devised to prevent or mitigate the rates of hematologic aging and associated diseases later in life. Ultimately, these advancements have the potential to improve overall health and enhance the quality of life in aging individuals.",1.46E-32

Although genetic variation can clearly interact non-additively, methods to uncover epistatic relationships remain in their infancy. We develop low-signal signed iterative random forests to elucidate the complex genetic architecture of cardiac hypertrophy. We derive deep learning-based estimates of left ventricular mass from the cardiac MRI scans of 29,661 individuals enrolled in the UK Biobank. We report epistatic genetic variation including variants close toCCDC141,IGF1R,TTN, andTNKS.Several loci not prioritized by univariate genome-wide association analysis are identified. Functional genomic and integrative enrichment analyses reveal a complex gene regulatory network in which genes mapped from these loci share biological processes and myogenic regulatory factors. Through a network analysis of transcriptomic data from 313 explanted human hearts, we show that these interactions are preserved at the level of the cardiac transcriptome. We assess causality of epistatic effects via RNA silencing of gene-gene interactions in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes. Finally, single-cell morphology analysis using a novel high-throughput microfluidic system shows that cardiomyocyte hypertrophy is non-additively modifiable by specific pairwise interactions betweenCCDC141and bothTTNandIGF1R. Our results expand the scope of genetic regulation of cardiac structure to epistasis.",1.43E-32

The previous challenge of tissue heterogeneity has been met with the application of techniques that can profile individual cells at scale. Moreover, the ability to perturb genes, gene regulatory elements and neuronal activity in a cell-type-specific manner has been integrated with gene expression studies to uncover the functional underpinnings of the genome at a systems level. Although these insights have necessarily been grounded in model systems, we now have the opportunity to apply these approaches in humans and in human tissue, thanks to advances in human genetics, brain imaging and tissue collection. We acknowledge that there will probably always be limits to the extent to which we can apply the genomic tools developed in model systems to human neuroscience; however, as we describe in this Perspective, the neuroscience field is now primed with an optimal foundation for tackling this ambitious challenge. The application of systems-level network analyses to these datasets will facilitate a deeper appreciation of human neurogenomics that cannot otherwise be achieved from directly observable phenomena.© 2023.

During prolonged space missions, astronauts have to stay in such extreme environments for long periods, which could induce adverse effects on both their physical and mental health. In some circumstances, this kind of long-term spaceflight composite stress (LSCS) could also induce depression and cognitive impairment in various ways, including dysregulating the neuroplasticity of the brains of astronauts, which should be attached to great importance. Here, we have comprehensively reviewed the impact of individual and combined stressors on depression and cognitive function during long-term spaceflight, explained the underlying mechanisms of those effects from the perspective of neuroplasticity, and current countermeasures for mitigating these challenges. This review provides insights into LSCS and potential neuroplasticity mechanisms, current with potentially great impact for understanding and mitigating the mental health risks and traumas of career astronauts and space tourists.© 2023.

,37986616,Hallmarks of ageing in human skeletal muscle and implications for understanding the pathophysiology of sarcopenia in women and men.,Clin Sci (Lond),"Ageing is a complex biological process associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Nine classic, interdependent hallmarks of ageing have been proposed involving genetic and biochemical pathways that collectively influence ageing trajectories and susceptibility to pathology in humans. Ageing skeletal muscle undergoes profound morphological and physiological changes associated with loss of strength, mass, and function, a condition known as sarcopenia. The aetiology of sarcopenia is complex and whilst research in this area is growing rapidly, there is a relative paucity of human studies, particularly in older women. Here, we evaluate how the nine classic hallmarks of ageing: genomic instability, telomere attrition, epigenetic alterations, loss of proteostasis, deregulated nutrient sensing, mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular senescence, stem cell exhaustion, and altered intercellular communication contribute to skeletal muscle ageing and the pathophysiology of sarcopenia. We also highlight five novel hallmarks of particular significance to skeletal muscle ageing: inflammation, neural dysfunction, extracellular matrix dysfunction, reduced vascular perfusion, and ionic dyshomeostasis, and discuss how the classic and novel hallmarks are interconnected. Their clinical relevance and translational potential are also considered.© 2023 The Author(s).",1.26E-32

However, the identification of gene-level associations in distinct cell types faces several challenges, including the limited reference resource from population scale studies, data sparsity in single-cell RNA sequencing, and the complex cell-state pattern of expression within individual cell types. Here we develop genetic models of cell type specific and cell state adjusted gene expression in mid-brain neurons in the process of specializing from induced pluripotent stem cells. The resulting framework quantifies the dynamics of the genetic regulation of gene expression and estimates its cell type specificity. As an application, we show that the approach detects known and new genes associated with schizophrenia and enables insights into context-dependent disease mechanisms. We provide a genomic resource from a phenome-wide application of our models to more than 1500 phenotypes from the UK Biobank. Using longitudinal genetically determined expression, we implement a predictive causality framework, evaluating the prediction of future values of a target gene expression using prior values of a putative regulatory gene. Collectively, this work demonstrates the insights that can be gained into the molecular underpinnings of diseases by quantifying the genetic control of gene expression at single-cell resolution.",1.25E-32
,37993469,A comprehensive analysis of genetic risk for metabolic syndrome in the Egyptian population via allele frequency investigation and Missense3D predictions.,Sci Rep,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) represents a major health problem in Egypt and worldwide, with increasing numbers of patients with prediabetes every year. Numerous factors, such as obesity, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension, which have recently become serious concerns, affect the complex pathophysiology of diabetes. These metabolic syndrome diseases are highly linked to genetic variability that drives certain populations, such as Egypt, to be more susceptible to developing DM. Here we conduct a comprehensive analysis to pinpoint the similarities and uniqueness among the Egyptian genome reference and the 1000-genome subpopulations (Europeans, Ad-Mixed Americans, South Asians, East Asians, and Africans), aiming at defining the potential genetic risk of metabolic syndromes. Selected approaches incorporated the analysis of the allele frequency of the different populations' variations, supported by genotypes' principal component analysis. Results show that the Egyptian's reference metabolic genes were clustered together with the Europeans', Ad-Mixed Americans', and South-Asians'. Additionally, 8563 variants were uniquely identified in the Egyptian cohort, from those, two were predicted to cause structural damage, namely, CDKAL1: 6_21065070 (A?>?T) and PPARG: 3_12351660 (C?>?T) utilizing the Missense3D database. The former is a protein coding gene associated with Type 2 DM while the latter is a key regulator of adipocyte differentiation and glucose homeostasis. Both variants were detected heterozygous in two different Egyptian individuals from overall 110 sample. This analysis sheds light on the unique genetic traits of the Egyptian population that play a role in the DM high prevalence in Egypt. The proposed analysis pipeline -available through GitHub- could be used to conduct similar analysis for other diseases across populations.© 2023. The Author(s).",1.25E-32
,37963869,Functional annotation of enzyme-encoding genes using deep learning with transformer layers.,Nat Commun,"Functional annotation of open reading frames in microbial genomes remains substantially incomplete. Enzymes constitute the most prevalent functional gene class in microbial genomes and can be described by their specific catalytic functions using the Enzyme Commission (EC) number. Consequently, the ability to predict EC numbers could substantially reduce the number of un-annotated genes. Here we present a deep learning model, DeepECtransformer, which utilizes transformer layers as a neural network architecture to predict EC numbers. Using the extensively studied Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 genome, DeepECtransformer predicted EC numbers for 464 un-annotated genes. We experimentally validated the enzymatic activities predicted for three proteins (YgfF, YciO, and YjdM). Further examination of the neural network's reasoning process revealed that the trained neural network relies on functional motifs of enzymes to predict EC numbers. Thus, DeepECtransformer is a method that facilitates the functional annotation of uncharacterized genes.© 2023. The Author(s).",1.22E-32
,37957724,CHOP upregulation and dysregulation of the mature form of the SNAT2 amino acid transporter in the placentas from small for gestational age newborns.,Cell Commun Signal,"The placentas from newborns that are small for gestational age (SGA; birth weight?<?-2 SD for gestational age) may display multiple pathological characteristics. A key determinant of fetal growth and, therefore, birth weight is placental amino acid transport, which is under the control of the serine/threonine kinase mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR). The effects of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress on the mTOR pathway and the levels of amino acid transporters are not well established.Placentas from SGA and appropriate for gestational age (AGA) newborns and the human placental BeWo cell line exposed to the ER stressor tunicamycin were used.We detected a significant increase in the levels of C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) in the placentas from SGA newborns compared with those from AGA newborns, while the levels of other ER stress markers were barely affected. In addition, placental mTOR Complex 1 (mTORC1) activity and the levels of the mature form of the amino acid transporter sodium-coupled neutral amino acid transporter 2 (SNAT2) were also reduced in the SGA group. Interestingly, CHOP has been reported to upregulate growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible protein 34 (GADD34), which in turn suppresses mTORC1 activity. The GADD34 inhibitor guanabenz attenuated the increase in CHOP protein levels and the reduction in mTORC1 activity caused by the ER stressor tunicamycin in the human placental cell line BeWo, but it did not recover mature SNAT2 protein levels, which might be reduced as a result of defective glycosylation.Collectively, these data reveal that GADD34A activity and glycosylation are key factors controlling mTORC1 signaling and mature SNAT2 levels in trophoblasts, respectively, and might contribute to the SGA condition.

Using Immunochip data from 3,939 patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and 14,412 control individuals, we identified 132 plausible common non-coding variants, reduced serially by single-nucleotide polymorphism sequencing (SNP-seq), electrophoretic mobility shift, and luciferase studies to the single variant rs7034653 in the third intron ofTRAF1. Genetically manipulated experimental cells and primary monocytes from genotyped donors establish that the risk G allele reduces binding of Fos-related antigen 2 (FRA2), encoded byFOSL2, resulting in reduced TRAF1 expression and enhanced tumor necrosis factor (TNF) production. Conditioning on this JIA variant eliminated attributable risk for rheumatoid arthritis, implicating a mechanism shared across the arthritis spectrum. These findings reveal that rs7034653, FRA2, and TRAF1 mediate a pathway through which a non-coding functional variant drives risk of inflammatory arthritis in children and adults.© 2023 The Authors.",9.06E-33

However, the roles of enhancer regulatory circuit abnormalities driven by epigenetic alterations in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are unclear.In this study, a multiomic integrative analysis was performed to map enhancer and chromatin accessibility landscapes and identify regulatory network abnormalities in AD. We identified differentially methylated enhancers and constructed regulatory networks across brain regions using AD brain tissue samples. Through the integration of snATAC-seq and snRNA-seq datasets, we mapped enhancers with DNA methylation alterations (DMA) and chromatin accessibility landscapes. Core regulatory triplets that contributed to AD neuropathology in specific cell types were further prioritized.We revealed widespread DNA methylation alterations (DMA) in the enhancers of AD patients across different brain regions. In addition, the genome-wide transcription factor (TF) binding profiles showed that enhancers with DMA are pervasively regulated by TFs. The TF-enhancer-gene regulatory network analysis identified core regulatory triplets that are associated with brain and immune cell proportions and play important roles in AD pathogenesis. Enhancer regulatory circuits with DMA exhibited distinct chromatin accessibility patterns, which were further characterized at single-cell resolutions.Our study comprehensively investigated DNA methylation-mediated regulatory circuit abnormalities and provided novel insights into the potential pathogenesis of AD.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

Unfortunately, biomarkers for this deadly disease remain under investigation, and underpinning mechanisms are ill-understood. Here, we applied deep sequencing to ?100 mCRPC patients prior to the initiation of first-line AR-targeted therapy, which detectedAR/enhancer alterations in over a third of patients, which correlated with lethality. To delve into the mechanism underlying why these patients with cell-freeAR/enhancer alterations developed more lethal prostate cancer, we next performed genome-wide cell-free DNA epigenomics. Strikingly, we found that binding sites for transcription factors associated with developmental stemness were nucleosomally more accessible. These results were corroborated using cell-free DNA methylation data, as well as tumor RNA sequencing from a held-out cohort of mCRPC patients. Thus, we validated the importance ofAR/enhancer alterations as a prognostic biomarker in lethal mCRPC, and showed that the underlying mechanism for lethality involves reprogramming developmental states toward increased stemness.",7.22E-33
,37958445,DNA Methylation Aberrations in Dimethylarsinic Acid-Induced Bladder Carcinogenesis.,Cancers (Basel),"Arsenic is a known human urinary bladder carcinogen. While arsenic is known to cause aberrant DNA methylation, the mechanism of arsenic-triggered bladder carcinogenesis is not fully understood. The goal of this study was to identify aberrant DNA methylation in rat bladder urothelial carcinoma (UC) induced by dimethylarsinic acid (DMAV), a major organic metabolite of arsenic. We performed genome-wide DNA methylation and microarray gene expression analyses of DMAV-induced rat UCs and the urothelium of rats treated for 4 weeks with DMAV. We identified 40 genes that were both hypermethylated and downregulated in DMAV-induced rat UCs. Notably, four genes (CPXM1, OPCML, TBX20, and KCND3) also showed reduced expression in the bladder urothelium after 4 weeks of exposure to DMAV. We also found that CPXM1 is aberrantly methylated and downregulated in human bladder cancers and human bladder cancer cells. Genes with aberrant DNA methylation and downregulated expression in DMAV-exposed bladder urothelium and in DMAV-induced UCs in rats, suggest that these alterations occurred in the early stages of arsenic-induced bladder carcinogenesis. Further study to evaluate the functions of these genes will advance our understanding of the role of aberrant DNA methylation in arsenic bladder carcinogenesis, and will also facilitate the identification of new therapeutic targets for arsenic-related bladder cancers.",7.13E-33

However, the vast majority have not been functionally characterized. Thus, it remains unclear how variant-associated enhancers contribute to cancer. Here, we perform single-cell CRISPRi screens of 3,512 regulatory elements associated with breast cancer to measure the impact of these regions on transcriptional phenotypes. Analysis of >500,000 single-cell transcriptomes in two breast cancer cell lines shows that perturbation of variant-associated enhancers disrupts breast cancer gene programs. We observe variant-associated enhancers that directly or indirectly regulate the expression of cancer genes. We also find one-to-multiple and multiple-to-one network motifs where enhancers indirectly regulate cancer genes. Notably, multiple variant-associated enhancers indirectly regulate TP53. Comparative studies illustrate sub-type specific functions between enhancers in ER+ and ER- cells. Finally, we developed the pySpade package to facilitate analysis of single-cell enhancer screens. Overall, we demonstrate that enhancers form regulatory networks that link cancer genes in the genome, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the contribution of enhancers to breast cancer development.",6.77E-33

This study aimed to examine the causal associations between IL-18 and IMIDs.We performed a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. Genetic variants were selected from genome-wide association study datasets following stringent assessments. We then used these variants as instrumental variables to estimate the causal effects of IL-18 levels on the risk of developing five common IMIDs: rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), and psoriasis. We used the inverse variance-weighted (IVW) method as the primary analysis, with sensitivity analyses performed to avoid potential bias. Reverse-direction MR analyses were performed to rule out the possibility of reverse associations.We found that genetically determined higher circulating IL-18 levels were causally associated with a higher risk for SLE (PIVW?=?0.009; OR, 1.214; 95% CI, 1.049?-?1.404) and IBD (PIVW?<?0.001; OR, 1.142; 95% CI, 1.062?-?1.228), but found no significant associations of IL-18 with RA (PIVW?=?0.496; OR, 1.044; 95% CI, 0.923?-?1.180), AS (PIVW?=?0.021; OR, 1.181; 95% CI, 1.025?-?1.361), or psoriasis (PIVW?=?0.232; OR, 1.198; 95% CI, 0.891?-?1.611). In the reverse direction, no causal relationship existed between SLE or IBD and IL-18 levels. Globally, sensitivity studies using alternative MR methods supported the results that were robust and reliable. The Cochran's Q test, MR-Egger intercept, and MR-Pleiotropy RESidual Sum and Outlier excluded the influence of heterogeneity, horizontal pleiotropy, and outliers.We have demonstrated that elevated IL-18 levels increase the risk of SLE and IBD but not RA, AS, or psoriasis.

Although medical therapeutics are employed, they often fall short of being optimal, leaving patients struggling with treatment non-responsiveness and many related complications.The study utilized gene microarray data and clinical information from GEO. Gene enrichment and differential expression analyses were conducted using Metascape and Limma, respectively. Lasso Regression Algorithm was constructed using glmnet and heat maps were generated using pheatmap. ROC curves were used to assess diagnostic parameter capability, while XSum was employed to screen for small-molecule drugs exacerbating UC. Molecular docking was carried out using Autodock Vina.

However, the prevalence of highly palatable and highly processed food in our modern diet has exacerbated obesity rates and contributed to a global health crisis. While accumulating evidence suggests that chronic consumption of such foods is detrimental to sensory and neural physiology, it is unclear whether its short-term intake has adverse effects. Here, we assessed how short-term consumption (<2 months) of three diets varying in composition and macronutrient content influence olfaction and brain metabolism in mice.The diets tested included a grain-based standard chow diet (CHOW; 54% carbohydrate, 32% protein, 14% fat; #8604 Teklad Rodent diet , Envigo Inc.), a highly processed control diet (hpCTR; 70% carbohydrate, 20% protein, 10% fat; #D12450B, Research Diets Inc.), and a highly processed high-fat diet (hpHFD; 20% carbohydrate, 20% protein, 60% fat; #D12492, Research Diets Inc.).

We also performed RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) in the nose and across several brain regions, and conducted differential expression analysis, gene ontology, and network analysis.We show that short-term consumption of the two highly processed diets, but not the grain-based diet, regardless of macronutrient content, adversely affects odor-guided behaviors, physiological responses to odorants, transcriptional profiles in the olfactory mucosa and brain regions, and brain glucose metabolism and mitochondrial respiration.Even short periods of highly processed food consumption are sufficient to cause early olfactory and brain abnormalities, which has the potential to alter food choices and influence the risk of developing metabolic disease.Copyright © 2023.

x,38093018,Hold out the genome: a roadmap to solving the cis-regulatory code.,Nature,"Gene expression is regulated by transcription factors that work together to read cis-regulatory DNA sequences. The 'cis-regulatory code' - how cells interpret DNA sequences to determine when, where and how much genes should be expressed - has proven to be exceedingly complex. Recently, advances in the scale and resolution of functional genomics assays and machine learning have enabled substantial progress towards deciphering this code. However, the cis-regulatory code will probably never be solved if models are trained only on genomic sequences; regions of homology can easily lead to overestimation of predictive performance, and our genome is too short and has insufficient sequence diversity to learn all relevant parameters. Fortunately, randomly synthesized DNA sequences enable testing a far larger sequence space than exists in our genomes, and designed DNA sequences enable targeted queries to maximally improve the models. As the same biochemical principles are used to interpret DNA regardless of its source, models trained on these synthetic data can predict genomic activity, often better than genome-trained models. Here we provide an outlook on the field, and propose a roadmap towards solving the cis-regulatory code by a combination of machine learning and massively parallel assays using synthetic DNA.© 2023.

SUMO-targeted ubiquitin E3 ligases (STUbLs) emerge as specialized enzymes that recognize SUMO-modified substrates through SUMO-interaction motifs and subsequently ubiquitinate them via the RING domain, thereby bridging the SUMO and ubiquitin signaling pathways. STUbLs participate in a wide array of molecular processes, including cell cycle regulation, DNA repair, replication, and mitosis, operating under both normal conditions and in response to challenges such as genotoxic stress. Their ability to catalyze various types of ubiquitin chains results in diverse proteolytic and non-proteolytic outcomes for target substrates. Importantly, STUbLs are strategically positioned in close proximity to SUMO proteases and deubiquitinases (DUBs), ensuring precise and dynamic control over their target proteins. In this review, we provide insights into the unique properties and indispensable roles of STUbLs, with a particular emphasis on their significance in preserving genome integrity in humans.© 2023 The Authors.",2.35E-33
,38107159,The Good and the Bad of SHROOM3 in Kidney Development and Disease: A Narrative Review.,Can J Kidney Health Dis,"Multiple large-scale genome-wide association meta-analyses studies have reliably identified an association between genetic variants within theSHROOM3gene and chronic kidney disease. This association extends to alterations in known markers of kidney disease including baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate, urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio, and blood urea nitrogen. Yet, an understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind the association of SHROOM3 and kidney disease remains poorly communicated. We conducted a narrative review to summarize the current state of literature regarding the genetic and molecular relationships between SHROOM3 and kidney development and disease.PubMed, PubMed Central, SCOPUS, and Web of Science databases, as well as review of references from relevant studies and independent Google Scholar searches to fill gaps in knowledge.A comprehensive narrative review was conducted to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying SHROOM3 and kidney development, function, and disease.SHROOM3 is a unique protein, as it is the only member of the SHROOM group of proteins that regulates actin dynamics through apical constriction and apicobasal cell elongation. It holds a dichotomous role in the kidney, as subtle alterations in SHROOM3 expression and function can be both pathological and protective toward kidney disease. Genome-wide association studies have identified genetic variants near the transcription start site of theSHROOM3gene associated with chronic kidney disease. SHROOM3 also appears to protect the glomerular structure and function in conditions such as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. However, little is known about the exact mechanisms by which this protection occurs, which is why SHROOM3 binding partners remain an opportunity for further investigation.Our search was limited to English articles. No structured assessment of study quality was performed, and selection bias of included articles may have occurred. As we discuss future directions and opportunities, this narrative review reflects the academic views of the authors.© The Author(s) 2023.",2.28E-33
,37934154,Automated exploitation of deep learning for cancer patient stratification across multiple types.,Bioinformatics,"Recent frameworks based on deep learning have been developed to identify cancer subtypes from high-throughput gene expression profiles. Unfortunately, the performance of deep learning is highly dependent on its neural network architectures which are often hand-crafted with expertise in deep neural networks, meanwhile, the optimization and adjustment of the network are usually costly and time consuming.To address such limitations, we proposed a fully automated deep neural architecture search model for diagnosing consensus molecular subtypes from gene expression data (DNAS). The proposed model uses ant colony algorithm, one of the heuristic swarm intelligence algorithms, to search and optimize neural network architecture, and it can automatically find the optimal deep learning model architecture for cancer diagnosis in its search space. We validated DNAS on eight colorectal cancer datasets, achieving the average accuracy of 95.48%, the average specificity of 98.07%, and the average sensitivity of 96.24%, respectively. Without the loss of generality, we investigated the general applicability of DNAS further on other cancer types from different platforms including lung cancer and breast cancer, and DNAS achieved an area under the curve of 95% and 96%, respectively. In addition, we conducted gene ontology enrichment and pathological analysis to reveal interesting insights into cancer subtype identification and characterization across multiple cancer types.The source code and data can be downloaded from https://github.com/userd113/DNAS-main.

Maternal diet contributes to determining the health status of offspring and maternally linked mechanisms and is a global health challenge that requires attention. The impact of gut microbiota on host metabolism and offspring health is still not established.In this review, we intend to discuss the evidence on the impact of maternal diet and the health of offspring gut microbiota. The paper focuses on the gut microbiome of animal models. It captures the maternal diet and its influence on the offspring's gut microbiota, behavior that is supported by cell experimental results. Both inflammation and immune status of offspring induced by maternal diet are discussed. Finally, this review used predicted biological pathways involved in maternal diet and offspring health, and the influence of maternal diet on gut microbiota and offspring behavior. Obesity, diabetes, asthma and allergies, and neurodegenerative disorders and prospects for maternal diet, and microbiota and offspring health were discussed.The review was able to gather that a high-fat diet during pregnancy created a long-lasting metabolic signature on the infant's innate immune system, altering inflammation in the offspring microbiota, which predisposed offspring to obesity and metabolic diseases in adulthood.© 2023.

Additionally, we have elucidated its function through a series of in vitro experiments.Here we show that the protein MBD4 is required for DNA methylation maintenance and G/T mismatch repair. Transcriptome and methylome analyses reveal a genome-wide hypomethylation of promoters, gene bodies and repetitive elements in the absence of MBD4 in vivo. Methylation mark loss is accompanied by a broad transcriptional derepression phenotype affecting promoters and retroelements with low methylated CpG density. MBD4 in vivo forms a complex with the mismatch repair proteins (MMR), which exhibits high bi-functional glycosylase/AP-lyase endonuclease specific activity towards methylated DNA substrates containing a G/T mismatch. Experiments using recombinant proteins reveal that the association of MBD4 with the MMR protein MLH1 is required for this activity.Our data identify MBD4 as an enzyme specifically designed to repair deaminated 5-methylcytosines and underscores its critical role in safeguarding against methylation damage. Furthermore, it illustrates how MBD4 functions in normal and pathological conditions.© 2023. The Author(s).",2.17E-33

Treatment options are limited due to incomplete understanding of how the disease emerges from dysregulated cell states across the immune system. We therefore investigated the blood of JDM patients at different stages of disease activity using single-cell transcriptomics paired with surface protein expression. By immunophenotyping peripheral blood mononuclear cells, we observed skewing of the B cell compartment towards an immature naive state as a hallmark of JDM. Furthermore, we find that these changes in B cells are paralleled by signatures of Th2-mediated inflammation. Additionally, our work identified SIGLEC-1 expression in monocytes as a composite measure of heterogeneous type I interferon activity in disease. We applied network analysis to reveal that hyperactivation of the type I interferon response in all immune populations is coordinated with dysfunctional protein processing and regulation of cell death programming. This analysis separated the ubiquitously expressed type I interferon response into a central hub and revealed previously masked cell states. Together, these findings reveal the coordinated immune dysregulation underpinning JDM and provide novel insight into strategies for restoring balance in immune function.",1.75E-33
,37978143,WRN Is a Promising Synthetic Lethal Target for Cancers with Microsatellite Instability (MSI).,Cancer Treat Res,"Microsatellite instability (MSI), a type of genetic hypermutability arising from impaired DNA mismatch repair (MMR), is observed in approximately 3% of all cancers. Preclinical work has identified the RecQ helicase WRN as a promising synthetic lethal target for patients with MSI cancers. WRN depletion substantially impairs the viability of MSI, but not microsatellite stable (MSS), cells. Experimental evidence suggests that this synthetic lethal phenotype is driven by numerous TA dinucleotide repeats that undergo expansion mutations in the setting of long-standing MMR deficiency. The lengthening of TA repeats increases their propensity to form secondary DNA structures that require WRN to resolve. In the absence of WRN helicase activity, these unresolved DNA secondary structures stall DNA replication forks and induce catastrophic DNA damage.© 2023.

Accumulating evidence shows that the development of different immune cells from hematopoietic stem cells are highly fine-tuned by different epigenetic mechanisms including DNA methylation, histone modifications, chromatin remodeling and RNA-related regulations. Understanding how epigenetic regulators modulate normal development of immune cells contributes to the identification of new strategies for various diseases. Here, we review recent advances suggesting that epigenetic modulations can orchestrate immune cell development and functions through their impact on critical gene expression. We also discuss the aberrations of epigenetic modulations in immune cells that influence tumor progression, and the fact that underlying mechanisms affect how epigenetic drugs interfere with tumor progression in the clinic.© The author(s).",1.36E-33

However, the fraction of TNBCs that may have BRCA1 epimutations as their underlying cause is unknown. Neither are the time of occurrence and the potential inheritance patterns of BRCA1 epimutations established.To address these questions, we analyzed BRCA1 methylation status in breast cancer tissue and matched white blood cells (WBC) from 408 patients with 411 primary breast cancers, including 66 TNBCs, applying a highly sensitive sequencing assay, allowing allele-resolved methylation assessment. Furthermore, to assess the time of origin and the characteristics of normal cell BRCA1 methylation, we analyzed umbilical cord blood of 1260 newborn girls and 200 newborn boys. Finally, we assessed BRCA1 methylation status among 575 mothers and 531 fathers of girls with (n?=?102) and without (n?=?473) BRCA1 methylation.We found concordant tumor and mosaic WBC BRCA1 epimutations in 10 out of 66 patients with TNBC and in four out of six patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-low expression (<?10%) tumors (combined: 14 out of 72; 19.4%; 95% CI 11.1-30.5). In contrast, we found concordant WBC and tumor methylation in only three out of 220 patients with 221 ER???10% tumors and zero out of 114 patients with 116 HER2-positive tumors. Intraindividually, BRCA1 epimutations affected the same allele in normal and tumor cells. Assessing BRCA1 methylation in umbilical WBCs from girls, we found mosaic, predominantly monoallelic BRCA1 epimutations, with qualitative features similar to those in adults, in 113/1260 (9.0%) of individuals, but no correlation to BRCA1 methylation status either in mothers or fathers. A significantly lower fraction of newborn boys carried BRCA1 methylation (9/200; 4.5%) as compared to girls (p?=?0.038). Similarly, WBC BRCA1 methylation was found less common among fathers (16/531; 3.0%), as compared to mothers (46/575; 8.0%; p?=?0.0003).Our findings suggest prenatal BRCA1 epimutations might be the underlying cause of around 20% of TNBC and low-ER expression breast cancers. Such constitutional mosaic BRCA1 methylation likely arise through gender-related mechanisms in utero, independent of Mendelian inheritance.© 2023. The Author(s).",8.23E-34
,38068882,Imprinting and Reproductive Health: A Toxicological Perspective.,Int J Mol Sci,"This overview discusses the role of imprinting in the development of an organism, and how exposure to environmental chemicals during fetal development leads to the physiological and biochemical changes that can have adverse lifelong effects on the health of the offspring. There has been a recent upsurge in the use of chemical products in everyday life. These chemicals include industrial byproducts, pesticides, dietary supplements, and pharmaceutical products. They mimic the natural estrogens and bind to estradiol receptors. Consequently, they reduce the number of receptors available for ligand binding. This leads to a faulty signaling in the neuroendocrine system during the critical developmental process of 'imprinting'. Imprinting causes structural and organizational differentiation in male and female reproductive organs, sexual behavior, bone mineral density, and the metabolism of exogenous and endogenous chemical substances. Several studies conducted on animal models and epidemiological studies provide profound evidence that altered imprinting causes various developmental and reproductive abnormalities and other diseases in humans. Altered metabolism can be measured by various endpoints such as the profile of cytochrome P-450 enzymes (CYP450's), xenobiotic metabolite levels, and DNA adducts. The importance of imprinting in the potentiation or attenuation of toxic chemicals is discussed.",7.39E-34
,38023591,The neural basis underlying female vulnerability to depressive disorders.,Anim Cells Syst (Seoul),"Depressive disorders are more prevalent and severe in women; however, our knowledge of the underlying factors contributing to female vulnerability to depression remains limited. Additionally, females are notably underrepresented in studies seeking to understand the mechanisms of depression. Various animal models of depression have been devised, but only recently have females been included in research. In this comprehensive review, we aim to describe the sex differences in the prevalence, pathophysiology, and responses to drug treatment in patients with depression. Subsequently, we highlight animal models of depression in which both sexes have been studied, in the pursuit of identifying models that accurately reflect female vulnerability to depression. We also introduce explanations for the neural basis of sex differences in depression. Notably, the medial prefrontal cortex and the nucleus accumbens have exhibited sex differences in previous studies. Furthermore, other brain circuits involving the dopaminergic center (ventral tegmental area) and the serotonergic center (dorsal raphe nucleus), along with their respective projections, have shown sex differences in relation to depression. In conclusion, our review covers the critical aspects of sex differences in depression, with a specific focus on female vulnerability in humans and its representation in animal models, including the potential underlying mechanisms. Employing suitable animal models that effectively represent female vulnerability would benefit our understanding of the sex-dependent pathophysiology of depression.© 2023 The Author(s).

The average number of patients per year, the cost of treatment, and the prescription patterns (monotherapy vs. combination therapy) were analyzed, and subgroup analyses were conducted depending on age, sex, and drug class.The study included 674,099 patients from 136 hospitals located in nine major areas of China. Of all patients, the proportion of adolescents increased from 1.63% in 2017 to 6.75% in 2021. Visits by adolescent depression patients increased from 1,973 in 2017 to 9,751 in 2021, and the corresponding cost increased from 607,598 Chinese Yuan in 2017 to 2,228,884 Chinese Yuan in 2021. The incidence of adolescent depression among female individuals was far beyond that among male individuals. Combination therapy was more frequent than monotherapy, and the most commonly prescribed drugs were antidepressants, antipsychotics, antiepileptics, and antianxietics. Despite the use of sertraline decreasing from 47.90 to 43.39%, it was the most frequently used drug.In summary, the prescriptions and cost of treatment for adolescent depression patients both increased rapidly. The widespread use of those drugs with weak clinical evidence reflects the current state of China, which should arouse our attention. The study can provide references for clinical treatment decisions and a basis for more efficient allocation of healthcare resources by the government.Copyright © 2023 Wang, Zhou, Zhu, Yan, Bu, Fei and Wu.",5.93E-34
,38020478,Genetic relationship between the immune system and autism.,Brain Behav Immun Health,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a common and complex neurodevelopmental condition. The pathophysiology of ASD is poorly defined; however, it includes a strong genetic component and there is increasing evidence to support a role of immune dysregulation. Nonetheless, it is unclear which immune phenotypes link to ASD through genetics. Hence, we investigated the genetic correlation between ASD and diverse classes of immune conditions and markers; and if these immune-related genetic factors link to specific autistic-like traits in the population. We estimated global and local genetic correlations between ASD (n = 55,420) and 11 immune phenotypes (n = 14,256-755,406) using genome-wide association study summary statistics. Subsequently, polygenic scores (PGS) for these immune phenotypes were calculated in a population-based sample (n = 2487) and associated to five autistic-like traits (i.e., attention to detail, childhood behaviour, imagination, rigidity, social skills), and a total autistic-like traits score. Sex-stratified PGS analyses were also performed. At the genome-wide level, ASD was positively correlated with allergic diseases (ALG), and negatively correlated with lymphocyte count, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (FDR-p = 0.01-0.02). At the local genetic level, ASD was correlated with RA, C-reactive protein, and granulocytes and lymphocyte counts (p = 5.8 × 10-6-0.002). In the general population sample, increased genetic liability for SLE, RA, ALG, and lymphocyte levels, captured by PGS, was associated with the total autistic score and with rigidity and childhood behaviour (FDR-p = 0.03). In conclusion, we demonstrated a genetic relationship between ASD and immunity that depends on the type of immune phenotype considered; some increase likelihood whereas others may potentially help build resilience. Also, this relationship may be restricted to specific genetic loci and link to specific autistic dimensions (e.g., rigidity).Crown Copyright © 2023 Published by Elsevier Inc.",5.9E-34

The pathogenesis of DKD is intricate, originating with hyperglycemia, which triggers various mechanisms and pathways: metabolic, hemodynamic, inflammatory, and fibrotic which ultimately lead to renal damage. Within each pathway, several mediators contribute to the development of renal structural and functional changes. Some of these mediators, such as inflammatory cytokines, reactive oxygen species, and transforming growth factor ? are shared among the different pathways, leading to significant overlap and interaction between them. While current treatment options for DKD have shown advancement over previous strategies, their effectiveness remains somewhat constrained as patients still experience residual risk of disease progression.

,38002298,"Effects of Prenatal Exposure to Bisphenol A Substitutes, Bisphenol S and Bisphenol F, on Offspring's Health: Evidence from Epidemiological and Experimental Studies.",Biomolecules,"Pregnancy and lactation are critical periods for human well-being and are sensitive windows for pollutant exposure. Bisphenol A (BPA) is well demonstrated as a toxicant and has been replaced in the plastic industry with other bisphenol analogs that share similarities in structure and characteristics, most commonly Bisphenol S (BPS) and Bisphenol F (BPF). Maternal exposure to BPS or BPF can result in their accumulation in the fetal compartment, leading to chronic exposure and potentially limiting normal fetal growth and development. This review summarizes considerable findings of epidemiological or experimental studies reporting associations between BPS or BPF and impaired fetal growth and development. Briefly, the available findings indicate that exposure to the two bisphenol analogs during pregnancy and lactation can result in multiple disturbances in the offspring, including fetal growth restrictions, neurological dysfunctions, and metabolic disorders with the potential to persist throughout childhood. The occurrence of premature births may also be attributed to exposure to the two bisphenols. The possible mechanisms of actions by which the two bisphenols can induce such effects can be attributed to a complex of interactions between the physiological mechanisms, including impaired placental functioning and development, dysregulation of gene expression, altered hormonal balance, and disturbances in immune responses as well as induced inflammations and oxidative stress. In conclusion, the available evidence suggests that BPS and BPF have a toxic potential in a compartment level to BPA. Future research is needed to provide more intensive information; long-term studies and epidemiological research, including a wide scale of populations with different settings, are recommended. Public awareness regarding the safety of BPA-free products should also be enhanced, with particular emphasis on educating individuals responsible for the well-being of children.",4.73E-34
,37922884,Factorizing polygenic epistasis improves prediction and uncovers biological pathways in complex traits.,Am J Hum Genet,"Epistasis is central in many domains of biology, but it has not yet been proven useful for understanding the etiology of complex traits. This is partly because complex-trait epistasis involves polygenic interactions that are poorly captured in current models. To address this gap, we developed a model called Epistasis Factor Analysis (EFA). EFA assumes that polygenic epistasis can be factorized into interactions between a few epistasis factors (EFs), which represent latent polygenic components of the observed complex trait. The statistical goals of EFA are to improve polygenic prediction and to increase power to detect epistasis, while the biological goal is to unravel genetic effects into more-homogeneous units. We mathematically characterize EFA and use simulations to show that EFA outperforms current epistasis models when its assumptions approximately hold. Applied to predicting yeast growth rates, EFA outperforms the additive model for several traits with large epistasis heritability and uniformly outperforms the standard epistasis model. We replicate these prediction improvements in a second dataset. We then apply EFA to four previously characterized traits in the UK Biobank and find statistically significant epistasis in all four, including two that are robust to scale transformation. Moreover, we find that the inferred EFs partly recover pre-defined biological pathways for two of the traits. Our results demonstrate that more realistic models can identify biologically and statistically meaningful epistasis in complex traits, indicating that epistasis has potential for precision medicine and characterizing the biology underlying GWAS results.Copyright © 2023 American Society of Human Genetics.

However, its utility in autosomal recessive Mendelian diseases is largely unknown.In a cohort of 34 families in which the suspected autosomal recessive diseases remained undiagnosed by exome sequencing, lrWGS was performed on the Pacific Bioscience Sequel IIe platform.Likely causal variants were identified in 13 (38%) of the cohort. These include (1) a homozygous splicing SV in TYMS as a novel candidate gene for lethal neonatal lactic acidosis, (2) a homozygous non-coding SV that we propose impacts STK25 expression and causes a novel neurodevelopmental disorder, (3) a compound heterozygous SV in RP1L1 with complex inheritance pattern in a family with inherited retinal disease, (4) homozygous deep intronic variants in LEMD2 and SNAP91 as novel candidate genes for neurodevelopmental disorders in two families, and (5) a promoter SNV in SLC4A4 causing non-syndromic band keratopathy. Surprisingly, we also encountered causal variants that could have been identified by short-read exome sequencing in 7 families. The latter highlight scenarios that are especially challenging at the interpretation level.Our data highlight the continued need to address the interpretation challenges in parallel with efforts to improve the sequencing technology itself.

,37953286,A systematic scientometric review of paternal inheritance of acquired metabolic traits.,BMC Biol,"The concept of the inheritance of acquired traits, a foundational principle of Lamarck's evolutionary theory, has garnered renewed attention in recent years. Evidence for this phenomenon remained limited for decades but gained prominence with the Överkalix cohort study in 2002. This study revealed a link between cardiovascular disease incidence and the food availability experienced by individuals' grandparents during their slow growth periods, reigniting interest in the inheritance of acquired traits, particularly in the context of non-communicable diseases. This scientometric analysis and systematic review comprehensively explores the current landscape of paternally transmitted acquired metabolic traits.Utilizing Scopus Advanced search and meticulous screening, we included mammalian studies that document the inheritance or modification of metabolic traits in subsequent generations of unexposed descendants. Our inclusive criteria encompass intergenerational and transgenerational studies, as well as multigenerational exposures. Predominantly, this field has been driven by a select group of researchers, potentially shaping the design and focus of existing studies. Consequently, the literature primarily comprises transgenerational rodent investigations into the effects of ancestral exposure to environmental pollutants on sperm DNA methylation. The complexity and volume of data often lead to multiple or redundant publications. This practice, while understandable, may obscure the true extent of the impact of ancestral exposures on the health of non-exposed descendants. In addition to DNA methylation, studies have illuminated the role of sperm RNAs and histone marks in paternally acquired metabolic disorders, expanding our understanding of the mechanisms underlying epigenetic inheritance.This review serves as a comprehensive resource, shedding light on the current state of research in this critical area of science, and underscores the need for continued exploration to uncover the full spectrum of paternally mediated metabolic inheritance.© 2023.

Mutations affecting the histone 3 (H3) family, H3.1 (encoded byHIST1H3BandHIST1H3C) and H3.3 (encoded byH3F3A), are mainly associated with pediatric brain cancers. While considered poor prognostic brain cancer biomarkers in children, more recent studies have reported H3 alterations in adult brain cancer as well. Here, we established reliable droplet digital PCR based assays to detect three histone mutations (H3.3-K27M, H3.3-G34R, and H3.1-K27M) primarily linked to childhood brain cancer. We demonstrate the utility of our assays for sensitively detecting these mutations in cell-free DNA released from cultured diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) cells and in the cerebral spinal fluid of a pediatric patient with DIPG. We further screened tumor tissue DNA from 89 adult patients with glioma and 1 with diffuse hemispheric glioma from Southwestern Sydney, Australia, an ethnically diverse region, for these three mutations. No histone mutations were detected in adult glioma tissue, while H3.3-G34R presence was confirmed in the diffuse hemispheric glioma patient.",3.56E-34
,37998365,SIRT1 Prevents R-Loops during Chronological Aging by Modulating DNA Replication at rDNA Loci.,Cells,"In metazoans, the largest sirtuin, SIRT1, is a nuclear protein implicated in epigenetic modifications, circadian signaling, DNA recombination, replication, and repair. Our previous studies have demonstrated that SIRT1 binds replication origins and inhibits replication initiation from a group of potential initiation sites (dormant origins). We studied the effects of aging and SIRT1 activity on replication origin usage and the incidence of transcription-replication collisions (creating R-loop structures) in adult human cells obtained at different time points during chronological aging and in cancer cells. In primary, untransformed cells, SIRT1 activity declined and the prevalence of R-loops rose with chronological aging. Both the reduction in SIRT1 activity and the increased abundance of R-loops were also observed during the passage of primary cells in culture. All cells, regardless of donor age or transformation status, reacted to the short-term, acute chemical inhibition of SIRT1 with the activation of excessive replication initiation events coincident with an increased prevalence of R-loops. However, cancer cells activated dormant replication origins, genome-wide, during long-term proliferation with mutated or depleted SIRT1, whereas, in primary cells, the aging-associated SIRT1-mediated activation of dormant origins was restricted to rDNA loci. These observations suggest that chronological aging and the associated decline in SIRT1 activity relax the regulatory networks that protect cells against excess replication and that the mechanisms protecting from replication-transcription collisions at the rDNA loci manifest as differentially enhanced sensitivities to SIRT1 decline and chronological aging.",3.35E-34
,38044445,Targeting the epigenome to reinvigorate T cells for cancer immunotherapy.,Mil Med Res,"Cancer immunotherapy using immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has revolutionized the field of cancer treatment; however, ICI efficacy is constrained by progressive dysfunction of CD8+tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), which is termed T cell exhaustion. This process is driven by diverse extrinsic factors across heterogeneous tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). Simultaneously, tumorigenesis entails robust reshaping of the epigenetic landscape, potentially instigating T cell exhaustion. In this review, we summarize the epigenetic mechanisms governing tumor microenvironmental cues leading to T cell exhaustion, and discuss therapeutic potential of targeting epigenetic regulators for immunotherapies. Finally, we outline conceptual and technical advances in developing potential treatment paradigms involving immunostimulatory agents and epigenetic therapies.© 2023. The Author(s).",3.16E-34
,37993439,Multifaceted immune dysregulation characterizes individuals at-risk for rheumatoid arthritis.,Nat Commun,"Molecular markers of autoimmunity, such as antibodies to citrullinated protein antigens (ACPA), are detectable prior to inflammatory arthritis (IA) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and may define a state that is 'at-risk' for future RA. Here we present a cross-sectional comparative analysis among three groups that include ACPA positive individuals without IA (At-Risk), ACPA negative individuals and individuals with early, ACPA positive clinical RA (Early RA). Differential methylation analysis among the groups identifies non-specific dysregulation in peripheral B, memory and naïve T cells in At-Risk participants, with more specific immunological pathway abnormalities in Early RA. Tetramer studies show increased abundance of T cells recognizing citrullinated (cit) epitopes in At-Risk participants, including expansion of T cells reactive to citrullinated cartilage intermediate layer protein I (cit-CILP); these T cells have Th1, Th17, and T stem cell memory-like phenotypes. Antibody-antigen array analyses show that antibodies targeting cit-clusterin, cit-fibrinogen and cit-histone H4 are elevated in At-Risk and Early RA participants, with the highest levels of antibodies detected in those with Early RA. These findings indicate that an ACPA positive at-risk state is associated with multifaceted immune dysregulation that may represent a potential opportunity for targeted intervention.© 2023.

,38020869,From maternal glucocorticoid and thyroid hormones to epigenetic regulation of offspring gene expression: An experimental study in a wild bird species.,Evol Appl,"Offspring phenotype at birth is determined by its genotype and the prenatal environment including exposure to maternal hormones. Variation in both maternal glucocorticoids and thyroid hormones can affect offspring phenotype, but the underlying molecular mechanisms, especially those contributing to long-lasting effects, remain unclear. Epigenetic changes (such as DNA methylation) have been postulated as mediators of long-lasting effects of early-life environment. In this study, we determined the effects of elevated prenatal glucocorticoid and thyroid hormones on handling stress response (breath rate) as well as DNA methylation and gene expression of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and thyroid hormone receptor (THR) in great tits (Parus major). Eggs were injected before incubation onset with corticosterone (the main avian glucocorticoid) and/or thyroid hormones (thyroxine and triiodothyronine) to simulate variation in maternal hormone deposition. Breath rate during handling and gene expression of GR and THR were evaluated 14?days after hatching. Methylation status of GR and THR genes was analyzed from the longitudinal blood cells sampled 7 and 14?days after hatching, as well as the following autumn. Elevated prenatal corticosterone level significantly increased the breath rate during handling, indicating an enhanced metabolic stress response. Prenatal corticosterone manipulation had CpG-site-specific effects on DNA methylation at the GR putative promoter region, while it did not significantly affect GR gene expression. GR expression was negatively associated with earlier hatching date and chick size. THR methylation or expression did not exhibit any significant relationship with the hormonal treatments or the examined covariates, suggesting that TH signaling may be more robust due to its crucial role in development. This study provides some support to the hypothesis suggesting that maternal corticosterone may influence offspring metabolic stress response via epigenetic alterations, yet their possible adaptive role in optimizing offspring phenotype to the prevailing conditions, context-dependency, and the underlying molecular interplay needs further research.© 2023 The Authors.

,37936230,Early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma via no end-repair enzymatic methylation sequencing of cell-free DNA and pre-trained neural network.,Genome Med,"Early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is important in order to improve patient prognosis and survival rate. Methylation sequencing combined with neural networks to identify cell-free DNA (cfDNA) carrying aberrant methylation offers an appealing and non-invasive approach for HCC detection. However, some limitations exist in traditional methylation detection technologies and models, which may impede their performance in the read-level detection of HCC.We developed a low DNA damage and high-fidelity methylation detection method called No End-repair Enzymatic Methyl-seq (NEEM-seq). We further developed a read-level neural detection model called DeepTrace that can better identify HCC-derived sequencing reads through a pre-trained and fine-tuned neural network. After pre-training on 11 million reads from NEEM-seq, DeepTrace was fine-tuned using 1.2 million HCC-derived reads from tumor tissue DNA after noise reduction, and 2.7 million non-tumor reads from non-tumor cfDNA. We validated the model using data from 130 individuals with cfDNA whole-genome NEEM-seq at around 1.6X depth.NEEM-seq overcomes the drawbacks of traditional enzymatic methylation sequencing methods by avoiding the introduction of unmethylation errors in cfDNA. DeepTrace outperformed other models in identifying HCC-derived reads and detecting HCC individuals. Based on the whole-genome NEEM-seq data of cfDNA, our model showed high accuracy of 96.2%, sensitivity of 93.6%, and specificity of 98.5% in the validation cohort consisting of 62 HCC patients, 48 liver disease patients, and 20 healthy individuals. In the early stage of HCC (BCLC 0/A and TNM I), the sensitivity of DeepTrace was 89.6 and 89.5% respectively, outperforming Alpha Fetoprotein (AFP) which showed much lower sensitivity in both BCLC 0/A (50.5%) and TNM I (44.7%).By combining high-fidelity methylation data from NEEM-seq with the DeepTrace model, our method has great potential for HCC early detection with high sensitivity and specificity, making it potentially suitable for clinical applications.

Biological changes that occur with aging lead to enhanced atherosclerosis, yet the role of aging on CD8+T cells during atherogenesis is unclear. In this study, using femle mice, we found that depletion of CD8+T cells attenuated atherogenesis in aged, but not young, animals. Furthermore, adoptive transfer of splenic CD8+T cells from aged wild-type, but not young wild-type, donor mice significantly enhanced atherosclerosis in recipient mice lacking CD8+T cells. We also characterized T cells in healthy and atherosclerotic young and aged mice by single-cell RNA sequencing. We found specific subsets of age-associated CD8+T cells, including a Granzyme K+effector memory subset, that accumulated and was clonally expanded within atherosclerotic plaques. These had transcriptomic signatures of T cell activation, migration, cytotoxicity and exhaustion. Overall, our study identified memory CD8+T cells as therapeutic targets for atherosclerosis in aging.© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.",2.09E-34

However, our understanding of mutational effects remains limited to the resolution attainable within immunophenotypically and clinically accessible bulk cell populations. To decipher heterogeneous cellular fitness to preleukemic mutational perturbations, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of eight different mouse models with driver mutations of myeloid malignancies, generating 269,048 single-cell profiles. Our analysis infers mutation-driven perturbations in cell abundance, cellular lineage fate, cellular metabolism, and gene expression at the continuous resolution, pinpointing cell populations with transcriptional alterations associated with differentiation bias. We further develop an 11-gene scoring system (Stem11) on the basis of preleukemic transcriptional signatures that predicts AML patient outcomes. Our results demonstrate that a single-cell-resolution deep characterization of preleukemic biology has the potential to enhance our understanding of AML heterogeneity and inform more effective risk stratification strategies.© 2023 The Author(s).",1.99E-34

We describe how mRNA quality control contributes to longevity conferred by various regimens, including inhibition of insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) signaling, dietary restriction, and reduced mechanistic target of rapamycin signaling.

,38017547,A phenome-wide scan reveals convergence of common and rare variant associations.,Genome Med,"Common and rare variants contribute to the etiology of complex traits. However, the extent to which the phenotypic effects of common and rare variants involve shared molecular mediators remains poorly understood. The question is essential to the basic and translational goals of the science of genomics, with critical basic-science, methodological, and clinical consequences.Leveraging the latest release of whole-exome sequencing (WES, for rare variants) and genome-wide association study (GWAS, for common variants) data from the UK Biobank, we developed a metric, the COmmon variant and RAre variant Convergence (CORAC) signature, to quantify the convergence for a broad range of complex traits. We characterized the relationship between CORAC and effective sample size across phenome-wide association studies.We found that the signature is positively correlated with effective sample size (Spearman ??=?0.594, P?<?2.2e?-?16), indicating increased functional convergence of trait-associated genetic variation, across the allele frequency spectrum, with increased power. Sensitivity analyses, including accounting for heteroskedasticity and varying the number of detected association signals, further strengthened the validity of the finding. In addition, consistent with empirical data, extensive simulations showed that negative selection, in line with enhancing polygenicity, has a dampening effect on the convergence signature. Methodologically, leveraging the convergence leads to enhanced association analysis.The presented framework for the convergence signature has important implications for fine-mapping strategies and drug discovery efforts. In addition, our study provides a blueprint for the expectation from future large-scale whole-genome sequencing (WGS)/WES and sheds methodological light on post-GWAS studies.© 2023.

,38046046,Mucosal DNA methylome alteration in Crohn's disease: surgical and non-surgical groups.,Front Genet,"Crohn's disease (CD) is characterized as a chronic, relapsing, and progressive disorder with a complex etiology involving interactions between host, microbiome, and the external environment. Genome wide association studies (GWAS) suggest several genetic variations in the diseased individuals but that explains only a small proportion of susceptibility to disease conditions. This indicates the possible role of epigenome which links environmental factors to the genetic variation in the disease etiology. The current study is focused on the DNA methylome evolution with disease progression. We performed Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (RRBS) to analyze differential DNA methylation in the diseased and healthy mucosal tissues of 2 different groups of CD patients: non-surgical and surgical, categorized based on the severity of disease and standard of care needed. Patients in both groups have unique DNA methylation signature compared to the healthy tissue. After removing single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 1,671 differentially methylated loci were found in the non-surgical and 3,334 in the surgical group of which only 206 were found overlapping in both groups. Furthermore, differential DNA methylation was noted in some of the GWAS associated genes implicated in CD. Also, functional enrichment analysis showed high representation of several key pathways where differential methylations were observed, and these can be implicated in CD pathogenesis. We identified specific DNA methylation patterns in the mucosal DNA of surgical and non-surgical CD patients which indicates evolution of the methylome as the disease progresses from initial to the advance stage. These unique patterns can be used as DNA methylation signatures to identify different stages of the disease.Copyright © 2023 Ahmad, Sands, Greenberg, Tangen, Huang and Irudayaraj.",1.29E-34
,38011612,The Expanding Dissemination and Distribution Patterns of Diverse CRISPR Plasmids by Addgene.,CRISPR J,"CRISPR-based technologies have rapidly enabled the democratization of genome editing in academic institutions through distribution by Addgene over the past decade. Recently, several distribution milestones have been reached, with a collection of >15,000 plasmids deposited by >1,000 laboratories spanning ?40 countries now shipped 300,000 times to ?5,000 organizations traversing ?100 countries. Yet, both deposits of and requests for CRISPR plasmids continue to rise for this disruptive technology. Distribution patterns revealed robust demand for three distinct classes of CRISPR effectors, namely nucleases (e.g., Cas9 and Cas12), modulators (deactivated CRISPR nucleases fused to transcriptional regulators and epigenome modifiers), and chimeric effectors (Cas proteins fused to enzymes carrying out other activities such as deamination, reverse transcription, transposition, and integration). Yearly deposits over the past decade are requested in near-even proportions, reflecting continuous technological development and requests for novel constructs. Though it is unclear whether the slowing rate of requests is inherent to a pandemic operational lag or a transition from emerging to mature technology, it is noteworthy that the relative proportion of requests from plasmids deposited in the previous year remains stable, suggesting robust development of novel tools concurrent with continued adoption of editing, base editing, prime editing, and more. Predictably, most requested plasmids are designed for mammalian genome manipulation, presumably for medical research and human health pursuits, reflecting investments in therapeutic applications. Concurrently, requests for plant and microbial constructs are on the rise, especially in regions of the world more reliant on local agricultural inputs and focused on food and feed applications, illustrating continued diversification of genome editing applications.",1.1E-34

There is also a lack of large-scale randomized controlled trials to verify. Therefore, this Mendelian randomization (MR) study aimed to investigate the causal association between T1D and SLE.We aggregated data using publicly available genome-wide association studies (GWAS), all from European populations. Select independent (R2?<?0.001) and closely related to exposure (P?<?5?×?10-8) as instrumental variables (IVs). The inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method was used as the primary method. We also used MR-Egger, the weighted median method, MR-Robust, MR-Lasso, and other methods leveraged as supplements.T1D had a positive causal association with SLE (IVW, odds ratio [OR]?=?1.358, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.205?-?1.530; P?<?0.001). The causal association was verified in an independent validation set (IVW, OR?=?1.137, 95% CI, 1.033?-?1.251; P?=?0.001). SLE had a positive causal association with T1D (IVW, OR?=?1.108, 95% CI, 1.074?-?1.144; P?<?0.001). The causal association was verified in an independent validation set (IVW, OR?=?1.085, 95% CI, 1.046?-?1.127; P?<?0.001).

Here we introduce dual-enSERT, a robust Cas9-based two-color fluorescent reporter system which enables rapid, quantitative comparison of enhancer allele activities in live mice of any genetic background. We use this new technology to examine and measure the gain- and loss-of-function effects of enhancer variants linked to limb polydactyly, autism, and craniofacial malformation. By combining dual-enSERT with single-cell transcriptomics, we characterize variant enhancer alleles at cellular resolution, thereby implicating candidate molecular pathways in pathogenic enhancer misregulation. We further show that independent, polydactyly-linked enhancer variants lead to ectopic expression in the same cell populations, indicating shared genetic mechanisms underlying non-coding variant pathogenesis. Finally, we streamline dual-enSERT for analysis in F0 animals by placing both reporters on the same transgene separated by a synthetic insulator. Dual-enSERT allows researchers to go from identifying candidate enhancer variants to analysis of comparative enhancer activity in live embryos in under two weeks.",7.51E-35

Here we transcriptionally profiled a total of 65,002 SPNs, identified 76 region-specific SPN types, and mapped these types into a companion atlas of the whole mouse brain1. This taxonomy reveals a three-component organization of SPNs: (1) molecularly homogeneous excitatory SPNs from the cortex, red nucleus and cerebellum with somatotopic spinal terminations suitable for point-to-point communication; (2) heterogeneous populations in the reticular formation with broad spinal termination patterns, suitable for relaying commands related to the activities of the entire spinal cord; and (3) modulatory neurons expressing slow-acting neurotransmitters and/or neuropeptides in the hypothalamus, midbrain and reticular formation for 'gain setting' of brain-spinal signals. In addition, this atlas revealed a LIM homeobox transcription factor code that parcellates the reticulospinal neurons into five molecularly distinct and spatially segregated populations. Finally, we found transcriptional signatures of a subset of SPNs with large soma size and correlated these with fast-firing electrophysiological properties. Together, this study establishes a comprehensive taxonomy of brain-wide SPNs and provides insight into the functional organization of SPNs in mediating brain control of bodily functions.© 2023.

,38082253,Time series-based hybrid ensemble learning model with multivariate multidimensional feature coding for DNA methylation prediction.,BMC Genomics,"DNA methylation is a form of epigenetic modification that impacts gene expression without modifying the DNA sequence, thereby exerting control over gene function and cellular development. The prediction of DNA methylation is vital for understanding and exploring gene regulatory mechanisms. Currently, machine learning algorithms are primarily used for model construction. However, several challenges remain to be addressed, including limited prediction accuracy, constrained generalization capability, and insufficient learning capacity.In response to the aforementioned challenges, this paper leverages the similarities between DNA sequences and time series to introduce a time series-based hybrid ensemble learning model, called Multi2-Con-CAPSO-LSTM. The model utilizes multivariate and multidimensional encoding approach, combining three types of time series encodings with three kinds of genetic feature encodings, resulting in a total of nine types of feature encoding matrices. Convolutional Neural Networks are utilized to extract features from DNA sequences, including temporal, positional, physicochemical, and genetic information, thereby creating a comprehensive feature matrix. The Long Short-Term Memory model is then optimized using the Chaotic Accelerated Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm for predicting DNA methylation.Through cross-validation experiments conducted on 17 species involving three types of DNA methylation (6 mA, 5hmC, and 4mC), the results demonstrate the robust predictive capabilities of the Multi2-Con-CAPSO-LSTM model in DNA methylation prediction across various types and species. Compared with other benchmark models, the Multi2-Con-CAPSO-LSTM model demonstrates significant advantages in sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and correlation.

Clinical trials are currently underway to evaluate the effectiveness of senotherapies for these diseases. However, the impact of senescence on brain aging and cognitive decline in the absence of neurodegeneration remains uncertain. Moreover, patient populations like cancer survivors, traumatic brain injury survivors, obese individuals, obstructive sleep apnea patients, and chronic kidney disease patients can suffer age-related brain changes like cognitive decline prematurely, suggesting that they may suffer accelerated senescence in the brain. Understanding the role of senescence in neurocognitive deficits linked to these conditions is crucial, especially considering the rapidly evolving field of senotherapeutics. Such treatments could help alleviate early brain aging in these patients, significantly reducing patient morbidity and healthcare costs. This review provides a translational perspective on how cellular senescence plays a role in brain aging and age-related cognitive decline.

However, there is still a lack of information about the evolution and biological function analysis of theGRFgene family amongDendrobiumspecies.Growth-regulating factors fromDendrobium officinaleKimura et Migo andDendrobium chrysotoxumLindl. were identified by HMMER and BLAST. Detailed bioinformatics analysis was conducted to explore the evolution and function ofGRFgene family inD. officinaleandD. chrysotoxumusing genomic data, transcriptome data and qRT-PCR technology.Here, we evaluated the evolution of theGRFgene family based on the genome sequences ofD. officinaleandD. chrysotoxum. Inferred from phylogenetic trees, theGRFgenes were classified into two clades, and each clade contains three subclades. Sequence comparison analysis revealed relatively conserved gene structures and motifs among members of the same subfamily, indicating a conserved evolution ofGRFgenes withinDendrobiumspecies. However, considering the distribution of orthologousDoGRFs andDcGRFs, and the differences in the number ofGRFs among species, we suggest that theGRFgene family has undergone different evolutionary processes.

TheDNA methyltransferase 3B(DNMT3B) gene is highly expressed in human iPSCs; however, whether the hypermethylation of imprinted loci depends on DNMT3B activity has been poorly investigated. To explore the role of DNMT3B in mediating de novo DNA methylation at imprinted DMRs, we utilized iPSCs generated from patients with immunodeficiency, centromeric instability, facial anomalies type I (ICF1) syndrome that harbor biallelic hypomorphicDNMT3Bmutations. Using a whole-genome array-based approach, we observed a gain of methylation at several imprinted loci in control iPSCs but not in ICF1 iPSCs compared to their parental fibroblasts. Moreover, in corrected ICF1 iPSCs, which restore DNMT3B enzymatic activity, imprinted DMRs did not acquire control DNA methylation levels, in contrast to the majority of the hypomethylated CpGs in the genome that were rescued in the corrected iPSC clones. Overall, our study indicates that DNMT3B is responsible for de novo methylation of a subset of imprinted DMRs during iPSC reprogramming and suggests that imprinting is unstable during a specific time window of this process, after which the epigenetic state at these regions becomes resistant to perturbation.",4.04E-35

Additionally, the study seeks to determine the predictive value of preoperative NLR in determining the severity of the condition in this population.This study is a retrospective cohort study, including 160 elderly patients with cholecystolithiasis with cholecystitis (45 cases of simple cholecystitis, 58 cases of suppurative cholecystitis, 57 cases of gangrenous cholecystitis) and 60 cases of normal gallbladder histology. The study collected clinical data of the patients detected the preoperative CRP content, neutrophil, and lymphocyte levels through blood routine tests, and calculated the NLR value. The diagnostic value of NLR and CRP was determined by using the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC), and the optimal value of preoperative NLR related to the severity of elderly patients with cholecystolithiasis with cholecystitis was identified.This study found that for elderly patients with cholecystolithiasis with cholecystitis, preoperative NLR and CRP levels can be used to distinguish the condition. The critical value for NLR was found to be 2.995 (95% CI, 0.9465-0.9853; P?<?0.001) with an area under the ROC curve of 0.9659, while the critical value for CRP was 13.05 (95% CI, 0.9284-0.9830; P?<?0.001) with an area under the ROC curve of 0.9557. Both NLR and CRP were found to have equivalent diagnostic abilities. Additionally, the study found that there were significant differences in neutrophil and lymphocyte levels in elderly patients with different severity levels, with NLR increasing as severity increased (P?<?0.001). The study identified cut-off values for preoperative NLR that could distinguish Simple cholecystitis and Purulent cholecystitis, as well as Purulent cholecystitis and Gangrenous cholecystitis in elderly patients with cholecystolithiasis, with respective AUCs of 0.8441 (95% CI: 0.7642-0.9239; P?<?0.001) and 0.7886(95% CI: 0.7050-0.8721, P?<?0.001), sensitivities of 91.38% and 87.72%, and specificities of 73.33% and 63.79%.Preoperative NLR and CRP values can serve as indicators to detect cholecystolithiasis with cholecystitis in elderly patients. Additionally, NLR has been recognized as a potential tool to differentiate the severity of cholecystolithiasis with cholecystitis in the elderly population.© 2023. The Author(s).",3.66E-35

Although common mutations are well-studied, little research has characterized how the sequence of mutations relates to clinical features. Using published, single-cell DNA sequencing data from three institutions, we compared clonal evolution patterns in AML to patient characteristics, disease phenotype, and outcomes. Mutation trees, which represent the order of select mutations, were created for 207 patients from targeted panel sequencing data using 1 639 162 cells, 823 mutations, and 275 samples. In 224 distinct orderings of mutated genes, mutations related to DNA methylation typically preceded those related to cell signaling, but signaling-first cases did occur, and had higher peripheral cell counts, increased signaling mutation homozygosity, and younger patient age. Serial sample analysis suggested thatNPM1and DNA methylation mutations provide an advantage to signaling mutations in AML. Interestingly,WT1mutation evolution shared features with signaling mutations, such asWT1-early being proliferative and occurring in younger individuals, trends that remained in multivariable regression. Some mutation orderings had a worse prognosis, but this was mediated by unfavorable mutations, not mutation order. These findings add a dimension to the mutation landscape of AML, identifying uncommon patterns of leukemogenesis and shedding light on heterogenous phenotypes.",2.85E-35

Its experimental accessibility makes it especially tractable for studying molecular mechanisms that drive neural regeneration after injury-induced cell death. In this study, we used single cell sequencing to identify major regulatory players in determining olfactory epithelial stem cell fate after acute injury. We combined gene expression and accessible chromatin profiles of individual lineage traced olfactory stem cells to predict transcription factor activity specific to different lineages and stages of recovery. We further identified a discrete stem cell state that appears poised for activation, characterized by accessible chromatin around wound response and lineage specific genes prior to their later expression in response to injury. Together these results provide evidence that a subset of quiescent olfactory epithelial stem cells are epigenetically primed to support injury-induced regeneration.",2.21E-35
,38016949,PhenoSV: interpretable phenotype-aware model for the prioritization of genes affected by structural variants.,Nat Commun,"Structural variants (SVs) represent a major source of genetic variation associated with phenotypic diversity and disease susceptibility. While long-read sequencing can discover over 20,000 SVs per human genome, interpreting their functional consequences remains challenging. Existing methods for identifying disease-related SVs focus on deletion/duplication only and cannot prioritize individual genes affected by SVs, especially for noncoding SVs. Here, we introduce PhenoSV, a phenotype-aware machine-learning model that interprets all major types of SVs and genes affected. PhenoSV segments and annotates SVs with diverse genomic features and employs a transformer-based architecture to predict their impacts under a multiple-instance learning framework. With phenotype information, PhenoSV further utilizes gene-phenotype associations to prioritize phenotype-related SVs. Evaluation on extensive human SV datasets covering all SV types demonstrates PhenoSV's superior performance over competing methods. Applications in diseases suggest that PhenoSV can determine disease-related genes from SVs. A web server and a command-line tool for PhenoSV are available at https://phenosv.wglab.org .© 2023.

,38012713,Methylation-directed regulatory networks determine enhancing and silencing of mutation disease driver genes and explain inter-patient expression variation.,Genome Biol,"Common diseases manifest differentially between patients, but the genetic origin of this variation remains unclear. To explore possible involvement of gene transcriptional-variation, we produce a DNA methylation-oriented, driver-gene-wide dataset of regulatory elements in human glioblastomas and study their effect on inter-patient gene expression variation.In 175 of 177 analyzed gene regulatory domains, transcriptional enhancers and silencers are intermixed. Under experimental conditions, DNA methylation induces enhancers to alter their enhancing effects or convert into silencers, while silencers are affected inversely. High-resolution mapping of the association between DNA methylation and gene expression in intact genomes reveals methylation-related regulatory units (average size?=?915.1 base-pairs). Upon increased methylation of these units, their target-genes either increased or decreased in expression. Gene-enhancing and silencing units constitute cis-regulatory networks of genes. Mathematical modeling of the networks highlights indicative methylation sites, which signified the effect of key regulatory units, and add up to make the overall transcriptional effect of the network. Methylation variation in these sites effectively describe inter-patient expression variation and, compared with DNA sequence-alterations, appears as a major contributor of gene-expression variation among glioblastoma patients.We describe complex cis-regulatory networks, which determine gene expression by summing the effects of positive and negative transcriptional inputs. In these networks, DNA methylation induces both enhancing and silencing effects, depending on the context. The revealed mechanism sheds light on the regulatory role of DNA methylation, explains inter-individual gene-expression variation, and opens the way for monitoring the driving forces behind deferential courses of cancer and other diseases.© 2023.

However, how the N-terminal PWWP and ADD domains interplay with the C-terminal methyltransferase (MTase) domain in regulating the dynamic assembly of DNMT3B remains unclear. Here, we report the cryo-EM structure of DNMT3B under various oligomerization states. The ADD domain of DNMT3B interacts with the MTase domain to form an autoinhibitory conformation, resembling the previously observed DNMT3A autoinhibition. Our combined structural and biochemical study further identifies a role for the PWWP domain and its associated ICF mutation in the allosteric regulation of DNMT3B tetramer, and a differential functional impact on DNMT3B by potential ADD-H3K4me0 and PWWP-H3K36me3 bindings. In addition, our comparative structural analysis reveals a coupling between DNMT3B oligomerization and folding of its substrate-binding sites. Together, this study provides mechanistic insights into the allosteric regulation and dynamic assembly of DNMT3B.© The Author(s) 2023.

Here we examine the metabolic adaptations of metastasis-initiating cells (MICs) in female breast cancer and how those shape their metastatic phenotype. We find that endogenous MICs depend on the oxidative tricarboxylic acid cycle and fatty acid usage. Sorting tumor cells based upon solely mitochondrial membrane potential or lipid storage is sufficient at identifying MICs. We further identify that mitochondrially-generated citrate is exported to the cytoplasm to yield acetyl-CoA, and this is crucial to maintaining heightened levels of H3K27ac in MICs. Blocking acetyl-CoA generating pathways or H3K27ac-specific epigenetic writers and readers reduces expression of epithelial-to-mesenchymal related genes, MIC frequency, and metastatic potential. Exogenous supplementation of a short chain carboxylic acid, acetate, increases MIC frequency and metastasis. In patient cohorts, we observe that higher expression of oxidative phosphorylation related genes is associated with reduced distant relapse-free survival. These data demonstrate that MICs specifically and precisely alter their metabolism to efficiently colonize distant organs.© 2023. The Author(s).",1.23E-35

The use of mass spectrometry (MS)-proteomics has led to the discovery of numerous novel types of protein PTMs, such as acetylation, crotonylation, 2-hydroxyisobutyrylation, ?-hydroxybutyrylation, protein propionylation and butyrylation, succinylation, malonylation, lactylation, and histone methylation. In this review, we specifically highlight the molecular mechanisms and roles of various histone and some non-histone PTMs in renal diseases, including diabetic kidney disease. PTMs exhibit diverse effects on renal diseases, which can be either protective or detrimental, depending on the specific type of protein PTMs and their respective targets. Different PTMs activate various signaling pathways in diverse renal pathological conditions, which could provide novel insights for studying epigenetic mechanisms and developing potential therapeutic strategies for renal diseases.Copyright © 2023 Liu, Yang, Du and Xin.",1.15E-35
,38026703,Inflammation and emotion regulation: a narrative review of evidence and mechanisms in emotion dysregulation disorders.,Neuronal Signal,"Emotion dysregulation (ED) describes a difficulty with the modulation of which emotions are felt, as well as when and how these emotions are experienced or expressed. It is a focal overarching symptom in many severe and prevalent neuropsychiatric diseases, including bipolar disorders (BD), attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and borderline personality disorder (BPD). In all these disorders, ED can manifest through symptoms of depression, anxiety, or affective lability. Considering the many symptomatic similarities between BD, ADHD, and BPD, a transdiagnostic approach is a promising lens of investigation. Mounting evidence supports the role of peripheral inflammatory markers and stress in the multifactorial aetiology and physiopathology of BD, ADHD, and BPD. Of note, neural circuits that regulate emotions appear particularly vulnerable to inflammatory insults and peripheral inflammation, which can impact the neuroimmune milieu of the central nervous system. Thus far, few studies have examined the link between ED and inflammation in BD, ADHD, and BPD. To our knowledge, no specific work has provided a critical comparison of the results from these disorders. To fill this gap in the literature, we review the known associations and mechanisms linking ED and inflammation in general, and clinically, in BD, ADHD, and BD. Our narrative review begins with an examination of the routes linking ED and inflammation, followed by a discussion of disorder-specific results accounting for methodological limitations and relevant confounding factors. Finally, we critically discuss both correspondences and discrepancies in the results and comment on potential vulnerability markers and promising therapeutic interventions.© 2023 The Author(s).",1.13E-35

Increased collagen deposition is also accompanied by altered collagen organization. Collagen type XIV, a fibril-associated collagen, supports collagen fibril organization. Its status in IPF has not been described at the protein level yet. In this study, we utilized publicly available datasets for single-cell RNA-sequencing for characterizing collagen type XIV expression at the gene level. For protein level comparison, we applied immunohistochemical staining for collagen type XIV on lung tissue sections from IPF patients and compared it to lung tissue sections from never smoking and ex-smoking donors. Analyzing the relative amounts of collagen type XIV at the whole tissue level, as well as in parenchyma, airway wall and bronchial epithelium, we found consistently lower proportions of collagen type XIV in all lung tissue compartments across IPF samples. Our study suggests proportionally lower collagen type XIV in IPF lung tissues may have implications for the assembly of the ECM fibers potentially contributing to progression of fibrosis.© 2023.

,38025810,Biomarkers of lung cancer for screening and in never-smokers-a narrative review.,Transl Lung Cancer Res,"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, partially attributed to late-stage diagnoses. In order to mitigate this, lung cancer screening (LCS) of high-risk patients is performed using low dose computed tomography (CT) scans, however this method is burdened by high false-positive rates and radiation exposure for patients. Further, screening programs focus on individuals with heavy smoking histories, and as such, never-smokers who may otherwise be at risk of lung cancer are often overlooked. To resolve these limitations, biomarkers have been posited as potential supplements or replacements to low-dose CT, and as such, a large body of research in this area has been produced. However, comparatively little information exists on their clinical efficacy and how this compares to current LCS strategies.Here we conduct a search and narrative review of current literature surrounding biomarkers of lung cancer to supplement LCS, and biomarkers of lung cancer in never-smokers (LCINS).Many potential biomarkers of lung cancer have been identified with varying levels of sensitivity, specificity, clinical efficacy, and supporting evidence. Of the markers identified, multi-target panels of circulating microRNAs, lipids, and metabolites are likely the most clinically efficacious markers to aid current screening programs, as these provide the highest sensitivity and specificity for lung cancer detection. However, circulating lipid and metabolite levels are known to vary in numerous systemic pathologies, highlighting the need for further validation in large cohort randomised studies.Lung cancer biomarkers is a fast-expanding area of research and numerous biomarkers with potential clinical applications have been identified. However, in all cases the level of evidence supporting clinical efficacy is not yet at a level at which it can be translated to clinical practice. The priority now should be to validate existing candidate markers in appropriate clinical contexts and work to integrating these into clinical practice.2023 Translational Lung Cancer Research.

Historically, research into their role in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has been relatively neglected, but recent work continues to highlight a potential contribution to RA pathophysiology.We emphasise the importance of disease stage when examining IFN-I in RA and provide an overview on how IFN-I may have a direct role on a variety of relevant cellular functions. We explore how clinical trajectory may be influenced by increased IFN-I signalling, and also, the limitations of scores composed of interferon response genes. Relevant environmental triggers and inheritable RA genetic risk relating to IFN-I signalling are explored with emphasis on intriguing data potentially linking IFN-I exposure, epigenetic changes, and disease relevant processes. Whilst these data cumulatively illustrate a likely role for IFN-I in RA, they also highlight the knowledge gaps, particularly in populations at risk for RA, and suggest directions for future research to both better understand IFN-I biology and inform targeted therapeutic strategies.© 2023.

A univariable and multivariable Mendelian randomization study that investigates 45 dietary habits and osteoarthritis.,Front Nutr,"Diet is a safe intervention for many chronic diseases as a modifiable lifestyle. However, the potential causal effect of many dietary intake habits on the risk of osteoarthritis has not been fully understood. The purpose of this study was to reveal the potential causal relationship of 45 genetically predicted dietary intakes with osteoarthritis and its subtypes.Data on 45 dietary intakes were obtained from the UK Biobank study of approximately 500,000 participants, and data on six osteoarthritis-related phenotypes were obtained from the Genetics of Osteoarthritis Consortium study of 826,690 participants. We performed univariable Mendelian randomization (MR), multivariable MR and linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC) analyses.In univariate analyses, 59 potential associations between diet and osteoarthritis were found. After false discovery rate (FDR) correction and sensitivity analyses, 23 reliable causal evidence were identified. In multivariate analyses, controlling separately for the effects of body mass index, total body bone mineral density, and smoking status, eight robust causal relationships remained: Muesli intake was negatively associated with knee osteoarthritis, spine osteoarthritis and total knee replacement. Dried fruit intake had a negative association with osteoarthritis of knee and total knee replacement. Eating cheese may reduce the risk of osteoarthritis in the knee and spine. And alcohol usually taken with meals was associated with a reduced risk of total knee replacement. LDSC analyses showed significant genetic correlations between all exposures and their corresponding outcomes, respectively, in these eight causal relationships.Evidence of dietary effects on osteoarthritis is provided in our study, which has important implications for the prevention, management, and intervention of osteoarthritis in common sites through rational dietary modification.Copyright © 2023 Xie and Qin.",6.91E-36

Although the exact mechanisms underlying AD pathogenesis remain unclear, it is commonly accepted that the aggregation of misfolded proteins, such as amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tau tangles, plays a critical role. Additionally, AD is a multifactorial condition influenced by various genetic factors and can manifest as either early-onset AD (EOAD) or late-onset AD (LOAD), each associated with specific gene variants. One gene of particular interest in both EOAD and LOAD is RIN3, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor. This gene plays a multifaceted role in AD pathogenesis. Firstly, upregulation of RIN3 can result in endosomal enlargement and dysfunction, thereby facilitating the accumulation of beta-amyloid (A?) peptides in the brain. Secondly, RIN3 has been shown to impact the PICLAM pathway, affecting transcytosis across the blood-brain barrier. Lastly, RIN3 has implications for immune-mediated responses, notably through its influence on the PTK2B gene. This review aims to provide a concise overview of AD and delve into the role of the RIN3 gene in its pathogenesis.© 2023. The Author(s).",6.77E-36

Despite their importance, the extent of their evolutionary conservation and its functional implications remain largely unknown. In this study, we generate Hi-C and ChIP-seq data and compare TAD organization across four primate and four rodent species and characterize the genetic and epigenetic properties of TAD boundaries in correspondence to their evolutionary conservation. We find 14% of all human TAD boundaries to be shared among all eight species (ultraconserved), while 15% are human-specific. Ultraconserved TAD boundaries have stronger insulation strength, CTCF binding, and enrichment of older retrotransposons compared to species-specific boundaries. CRISPR-Cas9 knockouts of an ultraconserved boundary in a mouse model lead to tissue-specific gene expression changes and morphological phenotypes. Deletion of a human-specific boundary near the autism-related AUTS2 gene results in the upregulation of this gene in neurons.

,38010534,Possible roles of deep cortical neurons and oligodendrocytes in the neural basis of human sociality.,Anat Sci Int,"Sociality is an instinctive property of organisms that live in relation to others and is a complex characteristic of higher order brain functions. However, the evolution of the human brain to acquire higher order brain functions, such as sociality, and the neural basis for executing these functions and their control mechanisms are largely unknown. Several studies have attempted to evaluate how human sociality was acquired during the course of evolution and the mechanisms controlling sociality from a neurodevelopment viewpoint. This review discusses these findings in the context of human brain evolution and the pathophysiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Comparative genomic studies of postmortem primate brains have demonstrated human-specific regulatory mechanisms underlying higher order brain functions, providing evidence for the contribution of oligodendrocytes to human brain function. Functional analyses of the causative genes of ASD in animal models have demonstrated that the neural basis of social behavior is associated with layer 6 (L6) of the neocortex and oligodendrocytes. These findings demonstrate that both neurons and oligodendrocytes contribute to the neural basis and molecular mechanisms underlying human brain evolution and social functioning.

This differentiation process is driven by Notch signaling, which is recognized for generating salt-and-pepper (fine-grained) patterns, in contrast to one- or two-cell layer (spatially confined) patterning in cholangiocyte differentiation. It is unclear how Notch signaling acts and localizes only in cholangiocytes. A computer simulation study suggested that low production rates of the ligands or receptors of Notch signaling are crucial for the spatially confined patterning, although biochemical examination is lacking. Here, we analyzed a publicly available single-cell ATAC-sequencing dataset from human fetal liver samples. We showed high chromatin accessibility for the ligands only in vascular cells, while that for the receptor is limited to a small population of hepatoblasts. This finding strengthens the previously proposed idea that low production rates of the ligands or receptors of Notch signaling enable vascular induction of cholangiocytes.© 2023.

However, a well-developed computational pipeline for circRNA QTL (circQTL) discovery is still lacking.We introduce an integrative method for circQTL mapping and implement it as an automated pipeline based on Nextflow, named cscQTL. The proposed method has two main advantages. Firstly, cscQTL improves the specificity by systematically combining outputs of multiple circRNA calling algorithms to obtain highly confident circRNA annotations. Secondly, cscQTL improves the sensitivity by accurately quantifying circRNA expression with the help of pseudo references. Compared to the single method approach, cscQTL effectively identifies circQTLs with an increase of 20%-100% circQTLs detected and recovered all circQTLs that are highly supported by the single method approach.

ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling enzymes (re)arrange nucleosomes at the first level of chromatin organization. Their Snf2-type motor ATPases alter histone-DNA interactions through a common DNA translocation mechanism. Whether remodeller activities mainly catalyse nucleosome dynamics or accurately co-determine nucleosome organization remained unclear. In this Review, we discuss the emerging mechanisms of chromatin remodelling: dynamic remodeller architectures and their interactions, the inner workings of the ATPase cycle, allosteric regulation and pathological dysregulation. Recent mechanistic insights argue for a decisive role of remodellers in the energy-driven self-organization of chromatin, which enables both stability and plasticity of genome regulation - for example, during development and stress. Different remodellers, such as members of the SWI/SNF, ISWI, CHD and INO80 families, process (epi)genetic information through specific mechanisms into distinct functional outputs. Combinatorial assembly of remodellers and their interplay with histone modifications, histone variants, DNA sequence or DNA-bound transcription factors regulate nucleosome mobilization or eviction or histone exchange. Such input-output relationships determine specific nucleosome positions and compositions with distinct DNA accessibilities and mediate differential genome regulation. Finally, remodeller genes are often mutated in diseases characterized by genome dysregulation, notably in cancer, and we discuss their physiological relevance.© 2023.

Then, basal and 70 mM KCl stimulus-evoked glutamate release was measured in the dentate gyrus (DG), CA3, and CA1 regions of the hippocampus using a glutamate-selective microelectrode in anesthetized mice. Glutamate recordings support elevated stimulus-evoked glutamate release in the DG and CA3 of young APPNL-F/NL-Fmale mice that declined with age compared to age-matched control mice. Young female APPNL-F/NL-F mice exhibited increased glutamate clearance in the CA1 that slowed with age compared to age-matched control mice. Male and female APPNL-F/NL-Fmice exhibited decreased CA1 basal glutamate levels, while males also showed depletion in the CA3. Cognitive assessment demonstrated impaired spatial cognition in aged male and female APPNL-F/NL-Fmice, but only aged females displayed recognition memory deficits compared to age-matched control mice. These findings confirm a sex-dependent hyper-to-hypoactivation glutamatergic paradigm in APPNL-F/NL-Fmice. Further, data illustrate a sexually dimorphic biological aging process resulting in a more severe cognitive phenotype for female APPNL-F/NL-Fmice than their male counterparts. Research outcomes mirror that of human AD pathology and provide further evidence of divergent AD pathogenesis between sexes.",4.25E-36
,37996703,Human neuronal maturation comes of age: cellular mechanisms and species differences.,Nat Rev Neurosci,"The delayed and prolonged postmitotic maturation of human neurons, compared with neurons from other species, may contribute to human-specific cognitive abilities and neurological disorders. Here we review the mechanisms of neuronal maturation, applying lessons from model systems to understand the specific features of protracted human cortical maturation and species differences. We cover cell-intrinsic features of neuronal maturation, including transcriptional, epigenetic and metabolic mechanisms, as well as cell-extrinsic features, including the roles of activity and synapses, the actions of glial cells and the contribution of the extracellular matrix. We discuss evidence for species differences in biochemical reaction rates, the proposed existence of an epigenetic maturation clock and the contributions of both general and modular mechanisms to species-specific maturation timing. Finally, we suggest approaches to measure, improve and accelerate the maturation of human neurons in culture, examine crosstalk and interactions among these different aspects of maturation and propose conceptual models to guide future studies.© 2023.

,37932343,Evaluation of optimal methods and ancestries for calculating polygenic risk scores in East Asian population.,Sci Rep,"Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) have been studied for predicting human diseases, and various methods for PRS calculation have been developed. Most PRS studies to date have focused on European ancestry, and the performance of PRS has not been sufficiently assessed in East Asia. Herein, we evaluated the predictive performance of PRSs for East Asian populations under various conditions. Simulation studies using data from the Korean cohort, Health Examinees (HEXA), demonstrated that SBayesRC and PRS-CS outperformed other PRS methods (lassosum, LDpred-funct, and PRSice) in high fixed heritability (0.3 and 0.7). In addition, we generated PRSs using real-world data from HEXA for ten diseases: asthma, breast cancer, cataract, coronary artery disease, gastric cancer, glaucoma, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, osteoporosis, and type 2 diabetes (T2D). We utilized the five previous PRS methods and genome-wide association study (GWAS) data from two biobank-scale datasets [European (UK Biobank) and East Asian (BioBank Japan) ancestry]. Additionally, we employed PRS-CSx, a PRS method that combines GWAS data from both ancestries, to generate a total of 110 PRS for ten diseases. Similar to the simulation results, SBayesRC showed better predictive performance for disease risk than the other methods. Furthermore, the East Asian GWAS data outperformed those from European ancestry for breast cancer, cataract, gastric cancer, and T2D, but neither of the two GWAS ancestries showed a significant advantage on PRS performance for the remaining six diseases. Based on simulation data and real data studies, it is expected that SBayesRC will offer superior performance for East Asian populations, and PRS generated using GWAS from non-East Asian may also yield good results.© 2023.

In this study, we analyzed several features of germline and somatic SVs from a cohort of 974 patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We identified a total of 21 features that differed significantly between germline and somatic SVs. Several of the germline SV features were associated with each other, as were several of the somatic SV features. We also found that these associations differed between the germline and somatic classes, for example, we found that somatic inversions were more likely to be longer events than their germline counterparts. Using these features we trained a support vector machine (SVM) classifier on 555,849 TCGA SVs to computationally distinguish germline from somatic SVs in the absence of a matched normal. This classifier had an ROC curve AUC of 0.984 when tested on an independent test set of 277,925 TCGA SVs. In this dataset, we achieved a positive predictive value (PPV) of 0.81 for an SV called somatic by the classifier being truly somatic. We further tested the classifier on a separate set of 7,623 SVs from pediatric high-grade gliomas (pHGG). In this non-TCGA cohort, our classifier achieved a PPV of 0.828, showing robust performance across datasets.",3.4E-36
,38028966,Epigenetic Regulation of Angiogenesis in Peripheral Artery Disease.,Methodist Debakey Cardiovasc J,"Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) represents a global health concern with a rising prevalence attributed to factors such as obesity, diabetes, aging, and smoking. Among patients with PAD, chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) is the most severe manifestation, associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. While revascularization remains the primary therapy for CLTI, not all patients are candidates for such interventions, highlighting the need for alternative approaches. Impaired angiogenesis, the growth of new blood vessels, is a central feature of PAD, and despite decades of research, effective clinical treatments remain elusive. Epigenetics, the study of heritable changes in gene expression, has gained prominence in understanding PAD pathogenesis. Here, we explore the role of epigenetic regulation in angiogenesis within the context of PAD, with a focus on long non-coding RNAs and fibroblast-endothelial cell transdifferentiation. Additionally, we discuss the interplay between metabolic control and epigenetic regulation, providing insights into potential novel therapeutic avenues for improving PAD treatments. This review aims to offer a concise update on the application of epigenetics in angiogenesis and PAD research, inspiring further investigations in this promising field.Copyright: © 2023 The Author(s).",2.52E-36

However, drug resistance is still the biggest hurdle to be overcome. To address this, we developed a deep learning model called AnoDAN (anomalous gene detection using generative adversarial networks and graph neural networks for overcoming drug resistance) that unravels the hidden resistance mechanisms and identifies a combinatorial target to overcome the resistance. Our findings reveal that the TGF-? signaling pathway, alongside the p53 signaling pathway, mediates the resistance, with THBS1 serving as a core regulatory target in both pathways. Experimental validation in lung cancer cells confirms the effects of THBS1 on responsiveness to a p53 reactivator. We further discovered the positive feedback loop between THBS1 and the TGF-? pathway as the main source of resistance. This study enhances our understanding of p53 regulation and offers insights into overcoming drug resistance.© 2023 The Authors.",2.42E-36

The COSMIC and CLINVAR databases were used to detect SNVs present in G4s to identify sequence level changes and their effect on the alteration of the G4 secondary structure. A total of 37,515 G4 SNVs in the COSMIC database and 2378 in CLINVAR were identified. Of those, 7236 COSMIC (19.3%) and 457 (19%) of the CLINVAR variants result in G4 loss, while 2728 (COSMIC) and 129 (CLINVAR) SNVs gain a G4 structure. The remaining variants potentially affect the folding energy without affecting the presence of a G4. Analysis of mutational patterns in the G4 structure shows a higher selective pressure (3-fold) in the coding region on the template strand compared to the reverse strand. At the same time, an equal proportion of SNVs were observed among intronic, promoter, and enhancer regions across strands.",2.39E-36

The aim of this study was to identify novel biomarkers and immune-related mechanisms in the progression of MN through an integrated bioinformatics approach.The microarray data were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between MN and normal samples were identified and analyzed by the Gene Ontology analysis, the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis and the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) enrichment. Hub The hub genes were screened and identified by the weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves evaluated the diagnostic value of hub genes. The single-sample GSEA analyzed the infiltration degree of several immune cells and their correlation with the hub genes.We identified a total of 574 DEGs. The enrichment analysis showed that metabolic and immune-related functions and pathways were significantly enriched. Four co-expression modules were obtained using WGCNA. The candidate signature genes were intersected with DEGs and then subjected to the LASSO analysis, obtaining a total of 6 hub genes. The ROC curves indicated that the hub genes were associated with a high diagnostic value. The CD4+T cells, CD8+T cells and B cells significantly infiltrated in MN samples and correlated with the hub genes.We identified six hub genes (ZYX, CD151, N4BP2L2-IT2, TAPBP, FRAS1 and SCARNA9) as novel biomarkers for MN, providing potential targets for the diagnosis and treatment.© 2023.

,38017136,CONIPHER: a computational framework for scalable phylogenetic reconstruction with error correction.,Nat Protoc,"Intratumor heterogeneity provides the fuel for the evolution and selection of subclonal tumor cell populations. However, accurate inference of tumor subclonal architecture and reconstruction of tumor evolutionary histories from bulk DNA sequencing data remains challenging. Frequently, sequencing and alignment artifacts are not fully filtered out from cancer somatic mutations, and errors in the identification of copy number alterations or complex evolutionary events (e.g., mutation losses) affect the estimated cellular prevalence of mutations. Together, such errors propagate into the analysis of mutation clustering and phylogenetic reconstruction. In this Protocol, we present a new computational framework, CONIPHER (COrrecting Noise In PHylogenetic Evaluation and Reconstruction), that accurately infers subclonal structure and phylogenetic relationships from multisample tumor sequencing, accounting for both copy number alterations and mutation errors. CONIPHER has been used to reconstruct subclonal architecture and tumor phylogeny from multisample tumors with high-depth whole-exome sequencing from the TRACERx421 dataset, as well as matched primary-metastatic cases. CONIPHER outperforms similar methods on simulated datasets, and in particular scales to a large number of tumor samples and clones, while completing in under 1.5 h on average. CONIPHER enables automated phylogenetic analysis that can be effectively applied to large sequencing datasets generated with different technologies. CONIPHER can be run with a basic knowledge of bioinformatics and R and bash scripting languages.© 2023. Springer Nature Limited.",1.52E-36

,38048082,Integrative approaches based on genomic techniques in the functional studies on enhancers.,Brief Bioinform,"With the development of sequencing technology and the dramatic drop in sequencing cost, the functions of noncoding genes are being characterized in a wide variety of fields (e.g. biomedicine). Enhancers are noncoding DNA elements with vital transcription regulation functions. Tens of thousands of enhancers have been identified in the human genome; however, the location, function, target genes and regulatory mechanisms of most enhancers have not been elucidated thus far. As high-throughput sequencing techniques have leapt forwards, omics approaches have been extensively employed in enhancer research. Multidimensional genomic data integration enables the full exploration of the data and provides novel perspectives for screening, identification and characterization of the function and regulatory mechanisms of unknown enhancers. However, multidimensional genomic data are still difficult to integrate genome wide due to complex varieties, massive amounts, high rarity, etc. To facilitate the appropriate methods for studying enhancers with high efficacy, we delineate the principles, data processing modes and progress of various omics approaches to study enhancers and summarize the applications of traditional machine learning and deep learning in multi-omics integration in the enhancer field. In addition, the challenges encountered during the integration of multiple omics data are addressed. Overall, this review provides a comprehensive foundation for enhancer analysis.© The Author(s) 2023. Published by Oxford University Press.",1.35E-36
,38020656,Detection of neuron-derived cfDNA in blood plasma: a new diagnostic approach for neurodegenerative conditions.,Front Neurol,"Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), pose significant challenges in early diagnosis, leading to irreversible brain damage and cognitive decline. In this study, we present a novel diagnostic approach that utilizes whole molecule analysis of neuron-derived cell-free DNA (cfDNA) as a biomarker for early detection of neurodegenerative diseases. By analyzing Differential Methylation Regions (DMRs) between purified cortical neurons and blood plasma samples, we identified robust biomarkers that accurately distinguish between neuronal and non-neuronal cfDNA. The use of cfDNA offers the advantage of convenient and minimally invasive sample collection compared to traditional cerebrospinal fluid or tissue biopsies, making this approach more accessible and patient friendly. Targeted sequencing at the identified DMR locus demonstrated that a conservative cutoff of 5% of neuron-derived cfDNA in blood plasma accurately identifies 100% of patients diagnosed with AD, showing promising potential for early disease detection. Additionally, this method effectively differentiated between patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who later progressed to AD and those who did not, highlighting its prognostic capabilities. Importantly, the differentiation between patients with neurodegenerative diseases and healthy controls demonstrated the specificity of our approach. Furthermore, this cfDNA-based diagnostic strategy outperforms recently developed protein-based assays, which often lack accuracy and convenience. While our current approach focused on a limited set of loci, future research should explore the development of a more comprehensive model incorporating multiple loci to increase diagnostic accuracy further. Although certain limitations, such as technical variance associated with PCR amplification and bisulfite conversion, need to be addressed, this study emphasizes the potential of cfDNA analysis as a valuable tool for pre-symptomatic detection and monitoring of neurodegenerative diseases. With further development and validation, this innovative diagnostic strategy has the potential to significantly impact the field of neurodegenerative disease research and patient care, offering a promising avenue for early intervention and personalized therapeutic approaches.Copyright © 2023 Pollard, Aston, Emery, Hill and Jenkins.",1.21E-36
,38007516,Acetyl-CoA is a key molecule for nephron progenitor cell pool maintenance.,Nat Commun,"Nephron endowment at birth impacts long-term renal and cardiovascular health, and it is contingent on the nephron progenitor cell (NPC) pool. Glycolysis modulation is essential for determining NPC fate, but the underlying mechanism is unclear. Combining RNA sequencing and quantitative proteomics we identify 267 genes commonly targeted by Wnt activation or glycolysis inhibition in NPCs. Several of the impacted pathways converge at Acetyl-CoA, a co-product of glucose metabolism. Notably, glycolysis inhibition downregulates key genes of the Mevalonate/cholesterol pathway and stimulates NPC differentiation. Sodium acetate supplementation rescues glycolysis inhibition effects and favors NPC maintenance without hindering nephrogenesis. Six2Cre-mediated removal of ATP-citrate lyase (Acly), an enzyme that converts citrate to acetyl-CoA, leads to NPC pool depletion, glomeruli count reduction, and increases Wnt4 expression at birth. Sodium acetate supplementation counters the effects of Acly deletion on cap-mesenchyme. Our findings show a pivotal role of acetyl-CoA metabolism in kidney development and uncover new avenues for manipulating nephrogenesis and preventing adult kidney disease.© 2023.

Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the mutual influences between COVID-19 outcomes and childhood mental disorders.We examined genetic correlations and potential causalities between three childhood mental disorders and three COVID-19 phenotypes by genetically proxied analyses. The three mental disorders included attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD, N?=?292,548), Tourette's syndrome (TS, N?=?14,307), and autism spectrum disorder (ASD, N?=?46,350). The three COVID-19 traits included SARS-CoV-2 infection (N?=?2,597,856), hospitalized COVID-19 (N?=?2,095,324), and critical COVID-19 (N?=?1,086,211). Literature-based analysis was used to build gene-based pathways connecting ADHD and COVID-19.ADHD was positively correlated with the three COVID-19 outcomes (Rg: 0.22?~?0.30). Our Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses found that ADHD confers a causal effect on hospitalized COVID-19 (odds ratio (OR): 1.36, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.10-1.69). TS confers a causal effect on critical COVID-19 (OR: 1.14, 95% CI: 1.04-1.25). Genetic liability to the COVID-19 outcomes may not increase the risk for the childhood mental disorders. Pathway analysis identified several immunity-related genes that may link ADHD to COVID-19, including CRP, OXT, IL6, PON1, AR, TNFSF12, and IL10.Our study suggests that both ADHD and TS may augment the severity of COVID-19 through immunity-related pathways.

Metastasis is a multi-step process and only a small percentage of cancer cells, metastasis-initiating cells (MICs), have the capacity to finally establish metastatic lesions. These MICs maintain a certain level of stemness that allows them to differentiate into other cell types with distinct transcriptomic profiles and swiftly adapt to external stresses. Furthermore, they can coordinate with the microenvironment, through reciprocal interactions, to invade and establish metastases.

Developing a precise understanding of the cell states where noncoding autoimmune risk variants impart causal mechanisms is critical to developing curative therapies. Here, to identify noncoding regions with accessible chromatin that associate with cell-state-defining gene expression patterns, we leveraged multimodal single-nucleus RNA and assay for transposase-accessible chromatin (ATAC) sequencing data across 28,674 cells from the inflamed synovial tissue of 12 donors. Specifically, we used a multivariate Poisson model to predict peak accessibility from single-nucleus RNA sequencing principal components. For 14 autoimmune diseases, we discovered that cell-state-dependent ('dynamic') chromatin accessibility peaks in immune cell types were enriched for heritability, compared with cell-state-invariant ('cs-invariant') peaks. These dynamic peaks marked regulatory elements associated with T peripheral helper, regulatory T, dendritic and STAT1+CXCL10+myeloid cell states. We argue that dynamic regulatory elements can help identify precise cell states enriched for disease-critical genetic variation.© 2023.

One of these RNA modifications is m5c which participates in various cellular functions like RNA structural stability and translation efficiency, got popularity among biologists. By applying biological experiments to detect RNA m5c methylation sites would require much more efforts, time and money. Most of the researchers are using pre-processed RNA sequences of 41 nucleotides where the methylated cytosine is in the center. Therefore, it is possible that some of the information around these motif may have lost. The conventional methods are unable to process the RNA sequence directly due to high dimensionality and thus need optimized techniques for better features extraction. To handle the above challenges the goal of this study is to employ an end-to-end, 1D CNN based model to classify and interpret m5c methylated data sites.

Then unsupervised k-means clustering was applied to cluster the tumors, whose result was verified by t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE). The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was used for feature selection, and the clusters were visually analyzed by radiologists. The correlations between the clusters, clinical and pathological parameters, and qualitative radiological features were analyzed.Hepatoblastoma was clustered into three phenotypes (homogenous type, heterogenous type, and nodulated type) based on radiomics features. The clustering results had a high correlation with response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (P=0.02). The epithelial ratio and cystic components in radiological features were also associated with the clusters (P=0.029 and 0.008, respectively).This radiomics-based cluster system may have the potential to facilitate the precise treatment of hepatoblastoma.

,37963248,Histone deacetylation and cytosine methylation compartmentalize heterochromatic regions in the genome organization of Neurospora crassa.,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,"Chromosomes must correctly fold in eukaryotic nuclei for proper genome function. Eukaryotic organisms hierarchically organize their genomes, including in the fungusNeurospora crassa, where chromatin fiber loops compact into Topologically Associated Domain-like structures formed by heterochromatic region aggregation. However, insufficient data exist on how histone posttranslational modifications (PTMs), including acetylation, affect genome organization. In Neurospora, the HCHC complex [composed of the proteins HDA-1, CDP-2 (Chromodomain Protein-2), Heterochromatin Protein-1, and CHAP (CDP-2 and HDA-1 Associated Protein)] deacetylates heterochromatic nucleosomes, as loss of individual HCHC members increases centromeric acetylation, and alters the methylation of cytosines in DNA. Here, we assess whether the HCHC complex affects genome organization by performing Hi-C in strains deleted of thecdp-2orchapgenes. CDP-2 loss increases intra- and interchromosomal heterochromatic region interactions, while loss of CHAP decreases heterochromatic region compaction. Individual HCHC mutants exhibit different patterns of histone PTMs genome-wide, as CDP-2 deletion increases heterochromatic H4K16 acetylation, yet smaller heterochromatic regions lose H3K9 trimethylation and gain interheterochromatic region interactions; CHAP loss produces minimal acetylation changes but increases heterochromatic H3K9me3 enrichment. Loss of both CDP-2 and the DIM-2 DNA methyltransferase causes extensive genome disorder as heterochromatic-euchromatic contacts increase despite additional H3K9me3 enrichment. Our results highlight how the increased cytosine methylation in HCHC mutants ensures genome compartmentalization when heterochromatic regions become hyperacetylated without HDAC activity.",5.31E-37

Exosomes can act as messengers to mediate signaling transductions between metabolic cells in the organism and play a bidirectional regulatory role in the MS process. This paper mainly reviews the components, biogenesis, biological functions and potential applications of exosomes, and exosomes involved in the pathogenesis of MS as well as their clinical significance in MS diagnosis.",4.88E-37
,38136943,Unraveling the Genetic Basis of Feed Efficiency in Cattle through Integrated DNA Methylation and CattleGTEx Analysis.,Genes (Basel),"Feed costs can amount to 75 percent of the total overhead cost of raising cows for milk production. Meanwhile, the livestock industry is considered a significant contributor to global climate change due to the production of greenhouse gas emissions, such as methane. Indeed, the genetic basis of feed efficiency (FE) is of great interest to the animal research community. Here, we explore the epigenetic basis of FE to provide base knowledge for the development of genomic tools to improve FE in cattle. The methylation level of 37,554 CpG sites was quantified using a mammalian methylation array (HorvathMammalMethylChip40) for 48 Holstein cows with extreme residual feed intake (RFI). We identified 421 CpG sites related to 287 genes that were associated with RFI, several of which were previously associated with feeding or digestion issues. Activator of transcription and developmental regulation (AUTS2) is associated with digestive disorders in humans, while glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 2 (GPD2) encodes a protein on the inner mitochondrial membrane, which can regulate glucose utilization and fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis. The extensive expression and co-expression of these genes across diverse tissues indicate the complex regulation of FE in cattle. Our study provides insight into the epigenetic basis of RFI and gene targets to improve FE in dairy cattle.",4.72E-37
,38001722,The Diversity of Liquid Biopsies and Their Potential in Breast Cancer Management.,Cancers (Basel),"Analyzing blood as a so-called liquid biopsy in breast cancer (BC) patients has the potential to adapt therapy management. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs), extracellular vesicles (EVs), cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and other blood components mirror the tumoral heterogeneity and could support a range of clinical decisions. Multi-cancer early detection tests utilizing blood are advancing but are not part of any clinical routine yet. Liquid biopsy analysis in the course of neoadjuvant therapy has potential for therapy (de)escalation.Minimal residual disease detection via serial cfDNA analysis is currently on its way. The prognostic value of blood analytes in early and metastatic BC is undisputable, but the value of these prognostic biomarkers for clinical management is controversial. An interventional trial confirmed a significant outcome benefit when therapy was changed in case of newly emerging cfDNA mutations under treatment and thus showed the clinical utility of cfDNA analysis for therapy monitoring. The analysis of PIK3CA or ESR1 variants in plasma of metastatic BC patients to prescribe targeted therapy with alpesilib or elacestrant has already arrived in clinical practice with FDA-approved tests available and is recommended by ASCO. The translation of more liquid biopsy applications into clinical practice is still pending due to a lack of knowledge of the analytes' biology, lack of standards and difficulties in proving clinical utility.",3.82E-37

Such technologies provide an increasingly large amount of information content at multiple spatial scales. However, representing and harmonizing diverse spatial datasets efficiently, including combining multiple modalities or spatial scales in a scalable and flexible manner, remains a substantial challenge. Here, we present Giotto Suite, a suite of open-source software packages that underlies a fully modular and integrated spatial data analysis toolbox. At its core, Giotto Suite is centered around an innovative and technology-agnostic data framework embedded in the R software environment, which allows the representation and integration of virtually any type of spatial omics data at any spatial resolution. In addition, Giotto Suite provides both scalable and extensible end-to-end solutions for data analysis, integration, and visualization. Giotto Suite integrates molecular, morphology, spatial, and annotated feature information to create a responsive and flexible workflow for multi-scale, multi-omic data analyses, as demonstrated here by applications to several state-of-the-art spatial technologies. Furthermore, Giotto Suite builds upon interoperable interfaces and data structures that bridge the established fields of genomics and spatial data science, thereby enabling independent developers to create custom-engineered pipelines. As such, Giotto Suite creates an immersive ecosystem for spatial multi-omic data analysis.",3.63E-37
,38093010,Slide-tags enables single-nucleus barcoding for multimodal spatial genomics.,Nature,"Recent technological innovations have enabled the high-throughput quantification of gene expression and epigenetic regulation within individual cells, transforming our understanding of how complex tissues are constructed1-6. However, missing from these measurements is the ability to routinely and easily spatially localize these profiled cells. We developed a strategy, Slide-tags, in which single nuclei within an intact tissue section are tagged with spatial barcode oligonucleotides derived from DNA-barcoded beads with known positions. These tagged nuclei can then be used as an input into a wide variety of single-nucleus profiling assays. Application of Slide-tags to the mouse hippocampus positioned nuclei at less than 10??m spatial resolution and delivered whole-transcriptome data that are indistinguishable in quality from ordinary single-nucleus RNA-sequencing data. To demonstrate that Slide-tags can be applied to a wide variety of human tissues, we performed the assay on brain, tonsil and melanoma. We revealed cell-type-specific spatially varying gene expression across cortical layers and spatially contextualized receptor-ligand interactions driving B cell maturation in lymphoid tissue. A major benefit of Slide-tags is that it is easily adaptable to almost any single-cell measurement technology. As a proof of principle, we performed multiomic measurements of open chromatin, RNA and T cell receptor (TCR) sequences in the same cells from metastatic melanoma, identifying transcription factor motifs driving cancer cell state transitions in spatially distinct microenvironments. Slide-tags offers a universal platform for importing the compendium of established single-cell measurements into the spatial genomics repertoire.© 2023. The Author(s).",3.38E-37
,37995323,IPOP: An Integrative Plant Multi-omics Platform for Cross-species Comparison and Evolutionary Study.,Mol Biol Evol,"The advent of high-throughput sequencing technologies has led to the production of a significant amount of omics data in plants, which serves as valuable assets for conducting cross-species multi-omics comparative analysis. Nevertheless, the current dearth of comprehensive platforms providing evolutionary annotation information and multi-species multi-omics data impedes users from systematically and efficiently performing evolutionary and functional analysis on specific genes. In order to establish an advanced plant multi-omics platform that provides timely, accurate, and high-caliber omics information, we collected 7 distinct types of omics data from 6 monocots, 6 dicots, and 1 moss, and reanalyzed these data using standardized pipelines. Additionally, we furnished homology information, duplication events, and phylostratigraphic stages of 13 species to facilitate evolutionary examination. Furthermore, the integrative plant omics platform (IPOP) is bundled with a variety of online analysis tools that aid users in conducting evolutionary and functional analysis. Specifically, the Multi-omics Integration Analysis tool is available to consolidate information from diverse omics sources, while the Transcriptome-wide Association Analysis tool facilitates the linkage of functional analysis with phenotype. To illustrate the application of IPOP, we conducted a case study on the YTH domain gene family, wherein we observed shared functionalities within orthologous groups and discerned variations in evolutionary patterns across these groups. To summarize, the IPOP platform offers valuable evolutionary insights and multi-omics data to the plant sciences community, effectively addressing the need for cross-species comparison and evolutionary research platforms.

,38114920,Pair bonding and disruption impact lung transcriptome in monogamous Peromyscus californicus.,BMC Genomics,"Social interactions affect physiological and pathological processes, yet their direct impact in peripheral tissues remains elusive. Recently we showed that disruption of pair bonds in monogamous Peromyscus californicus promotes lung tumorigenesis, pointing to a direct effect of bonding status in the periphery (Naderi et al., 2021). Here we show that lung transcriptomes of tumor-free Peromyscus are altered in a manner that depends on pair bonding and superseding the impact of genetic relevance between siblings. Pathways affected involve response to hypoxia and heart development. These effects are consistent with the profile of the serum proteome of bonded and bond-disrupted Peromyscus and were extended to lung cancer cells cultured in vitro, with sera from animals that differ in bonding experiences. In this setting, the species' origin of serum (deer mouse vs FBS) is the most potent discriminator of RNA expression profiles, followed by bonding status. By analyzing the transcriptomes of lung cancer cells exposed to deer mouse sera, an expression signature was developed that discriminates cells according to the history of social interactions and possesses prognostic significance when applied to primary human lung cancers. The results suggest that present and past social experiences modulate the expression profile of peripheral tissues such as the lungs, in a manner that impacts physiological processes and may affect disease outcomes. Furthermore, they show that besides the direct effects of the hormones that regulate bonding behavior, physiological changes influencing oxygen metabolism may contribute to the adverse effects of bond disruption.© 2023.

,38019365,The Unseen Hand: AI-Based Prescribing Decision Support Tools and the Evaluation of Drug Safety and Effectiveness.,Drug Saf,"The use of artificial intelligence (AI)-based tools to guide prescribing decisions is full of promise and may enhance patient outcomes. These tools can perform actions such as choosing the 'safest' medication, choosing between competing medications, promoting de-prescribing or even predicting non-adherence. These tools can exist in a variety of formats; for example, they may be directly integrated into electronic medical records or they may exist in a stand-alone website accessible by a web browser. One potential impact of these tools is that they could manipulate our understanding of the benefit-risk of medicines in the real world. Currently, the benefit risk of approved medications is assessed according to carefully planned agreements covering spontaneous reporting systems and planned surveillance studies. But AI-based tools may limit or even block prescription to high-risk patients or prevent off-label use. The uptake and temporal availability of these tools may be uneven across healthcare systems and geographies, creating artefacts in data that are difficult to account for. It is also hard to estimate the 'true impact' that a tool had on a prescribing decision. International borders may also be highly porous to these tools, especially in cases where tools are available over the web. These tools already exist, and their use is likely to increase in the coming years. How they can be accounted for in benefit-risk decisions is yet to be seen.© 2023.

While many studies have described the landscapes of clonal genome evolution in cancer, few determine the underlying evolutionary parameters from molecular data, and even fewer integrate theory with data. We derived theoretical results linking mutation rate, time, expansion dynamics, and biological/clinical parameters. Subsequently, we inferred time-resolved estimates of evolutionary parameters from mutation accumulation, mutational signatures and selection. We then applied this framework to predict the time of speciation of the marbled crayfish, an enigmatic, globally invasive parthenogenetic freshwater crayfish. The results predict that speciation occurred between 1986 and 1990, which is consistent with biological records. We also used our framework to analyze whole-genome sequencing datasets from primary and relapsed glioblastoma, an aggressive brain tumor. The results identified evolutionary subgroups and showed that tumor cell survival could be inferred from genomic data that was generated during the resection of the primary tumor. In conclusion, our framework allowed a time-resolved, integrated analysis of key parameters in clonally evolving genomes, and provided novel insights into the evolutionary age of marbled crayfish and the progression of glioblastoma.Copyright: © 2023 Legrand et al.

Hi-C, a high-throughput, sequencing-based technique, has drastically expanded our comprehension of 3D chromosome structures. The first step of Hi-C analysis pipeline involves mapping sequencing reads from Hi-C to linear reference genomes. However, the linear reference genome does not incorporate genetic variation information, which can lead to incorrect read alignments, especially when analyzing samples with substantial genomic differences from the reference such as cancer samples. Using genome graphs as the reference facilitates more accurate mapping of reads, however, new algorithms are required for inferring linear genomes from Hi-C reads mapped on genome graphs and constructing corresponding Hi-C contact matrices, which is a prerequisite for the subsequent steps of the Hi-C analysis such as identifying topologically associated domains and calling chromatin loops. We introduce the problem of genome sequence inference from Hi-C data mediated by genome graphs. We formalize this problem, show the hardness of solving this problem, and introduce a novel heuristic algorithm specifically tailored to this problem. We provide a theoretical analysis to evaluate the efficacy of our algorithm. Finally, our empirical experiments indicate that the linear genomes inferred from our method lead to the creation of improved Hi-C contact matrices. These enhanced matrices show a reduction in erroneous patterns caused by structural variations and are more effective in accurately capturing the structures of topologically associated domains.",2.16E-37
x,38082312,Transition of allele-specific DNA hydroxymethylation at regulatory loci is associated with phenotypic variation in monozygotic twins discordant for psychiatric disorders.,BMC Med,"Major psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia (SCZ) and bipolar disorder (BPD) are complex genetic mental illnesses. Their non-Mendelian features, such as those observed in monozygotic twins discordant for SCZ or BPD, are likely complicated by environmental modifiers of genetic effects. 5-Hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) is an important epigenetic mark in gene regulation, and whether it is linked to genetic variants that contribute to non-Mendelian features remains largely unexplored.We combined the 5hmC-selective chemical labeling method (5hmC-seq) and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) analysis of peripheral blood DNA obtained from monozygotic (MZ) twins discordant for SCZ or BPD to identify allelic imbalances in hydroxymethylome maps, and examined association of allele-specific hydroxymethylation (AShM) transition with disease susceptibility based on Bayes factors (BF) derived from the Bayesian generalized additive linear mixed model. We then performed multi-omics integrative analysis to determine the molecular pathogenic basis of those AShM sites. We finally employed luciferase reporter, CRISPR/Cas9 technology, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), PCR, FM4-64 imaging analysis, and RNA sequencing to validate the function of interested AShM sites in the human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells and human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells.We identified thousands of genetic variants associated with AShM imbalances that exhibited phenotypic variation-associated AShM changes at regulatory loci. These AShM marks showed plausible associations with SCZ or BPD based on their effects on interactions among transcription factors (TFs), DNA methylation levels, or other epigenomic marks and thus contributed to dysregulated gene expression, which ultimately increased disease susceptibility. We then validated that competitive binding of POU3F2 on the alternative allele at the AShM site rs4558409 (G/T) in PLLP-enhanced PLLP expression, while the hydroxymethylated alternative allele, which alleviated the POU3F2 binding activity at the rs4558409 site, might be associated with the downregulated PLLP expression observed in BPD or SCZ. Moreover, disruption of rs4558409 promoted neural development and vesicle trafficking.Our study provides a powerful strategy for prioritizing regulatory risk variants and contributes to our understanding of the interplay between genetic and epigenetic factors in mediating SCZ or BPD susceptibility.© 2023.

,37928898,Differential responses to maternal diabetes in embryo and visceral yolk sac.,Front Cell Dev Biol,"Introduction:Maternal diabetes during pregnancy is well known to be associated with a higher risk for structural birth defects in the offspring. Recent searches for underlying mechanisms have largely focused on aberrant processes in the embryo itself, although prior research in rodent models implicated dysfunction also of the visceral yolk sac. The objective of our research was to investigate both tissues within the conceptus simultaneously.Methods:We conducted unbiased transcriptome profiling by RNA sequencing on pairs of individual yolk sacs and their cognate embryos, using the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse model. The analysis was performed at gestational day 8.5 on morphologically normal specimen to circumvent confounding by defective development.Results:Even with large sample numbers (n= 33 in each group), we observed considerable variability of gene expression, primarily driven by exposure to maternal diabetes, and secondarily by developmental stage of the embryo. Only a moderate number of genes changed expression in the yolk sac, while in the embryo, the exposure distinctly influenced the relationship of gene expression levels to developmental progression, revealing a possible role for altered cell cycle regulation in the response. Also affected in embryos under diabetic conditions were genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis and NAD metabolism pathways.Discussion:Exposure to maternal diabetes during gastrulation changes transcriptomic profiles in embryos to a substantially greater effect than in the corresponding yolk sacs, indicating that despite yolk sac being of embryonic origin, different mechanisms control transcriptional activity in these tissues. The effects of maternal diabetes on expression of many genes that are correlated with developmental progression (i.e. somite stage) highlight the importance of considering developmental maturity in the interpretation of transcriptomic data. Our analyses identified cholesterol biosynthesis and NAD metabolism as novel pathways not previously implicated in diabetic pregnancies. Both NAD and cholesterol availability affect a wide variety of cellular signaling processes, and can be modulated by diet, implying that prevention of adverse outcomes from diabetic pregnancies may require broad interventions, particularly in the early stages of pregnancy.Copyright © 2023 Salbaum, Stone, Kruger and Kappen.",1.82E-37

Due to multiple, potential underlying molecular tumor aberrations, clinical treatment protocols are not well-defined. This study presents multisite molecular heterogeneity profiles of human BCC based on RNA and proteome profiling. Three areas from lesions excised from 9 patients were analyzed. The focus was gene expression profiles based on proteome and RNA measurements of intra-tumor heterogeneity from the same patient and inter-tumor heterogeneity in nodular, infiltrative, and superficial BCC tumor subtypes from different patients. We observed significant overlap in intra- and inter-tumor variability of proteome and RNA expression profiles, showing significant multisite heterogeneity of protein expression in the BCC tumors. Inter-subtype analysis has also identified unique proteins for each BCC subtype. This profiling leads to a deeper understanding of BCC molecular heterogeneity and potentially contributes to developing new sampling tools for personalized diagnostics therapeutic approaches to BCC.Copyright: © 2023 Berl et al.

However, whether mouse and human share similar genetic factors and pathogenic mechanisms of atherosclerosis has not been thoroughly investigated in a data-driven manner. We conducted a cross-species comparison study to better understand atherosclerosis pathogenesis between species by leveraging multiomics data. Specifically, we compared genetically driven and thus CAD-causal gene networks and pathways, by using human GWAS of CAD from the CARDIoGRAMplusC4D consortium and mouse GWAS of atherosclerosis from the Hybrid Mouse Diversity Panel (HMDP) followed by integration with functional multiomics human (STARNET and GTEx) and mouse (HMDP) databases. We found that mouse and human shared >75% of CAD causal pathways. Based on network topology, we then predicted key regulatory genes for both the shared pathways and species-specific pathways, which were further validated through the use of single cell data and the latest CAD GWAS. In sum, our results should serve as a much-needed guidance for which human CAD-causal pathways can or cannot be further evaluated for novel CAD therapies using mouse models.© 2023, Kurt, Cheng et al.",1.58E-37

However, the shared genetic characteristics of lung function with gastrointestinal tract (GIT) diseases remain to be investigated.We first investigated the genetic correlations between three lung function traits and four GIT diseases. Second, we illustrated the genetic overlap by genome-wide pleiotropic analysis (PLACO) and further pinpointed the relevant tissue and cell types by partitioning heritability. Furthermore, we proposed pleiotropic genes as potential drug targets by drug database mining. Finally, we evaluated the causal relationships by epidemiologic observational study and Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis.We found lung function and GIT diseases were genetically correlated. We identified 258 pleiotropic loci, which were enriched in gut- and lung-specific regions marked by H3K4me1. Among these, 16 pleiotropic genes were targets of drugs, such as tofacitinib and baricitinib targeting TYK2 for the treatment of ulcer colitis and COVID-19, respectively. We identified a missense variant in TYK2, exhibiting a shared causal effect on FEV1/FVC and inflammatory bowel disease (rs12720356, PPLACO=1.38?×?10-?8). These findings suggested TYK2 as a promising drug target. Although the epidemiologic observational study suggested the protective role of lung function in the development of GIT diseases, no causalities were found by MR analysis.Our study suggested the shared genetic characteristics between lung function and GIT diseases.

However, transforming raw reads into a complete genome model is a significant computational challenge due to the varying quality and quantity of data obtained from different sequencing instruments, as well as intrinsic characteristics of the genome and desired analyses. To address this issue, we have developed a set of container-based pipelines using Nextflow, offering both common workflows for inexperienced users and high levels of customization for experienced ones. Their processing strategies are adaptable based on the sequencing data type, and their modularity enables the incorporation of new components to address the community's evolving needs.Methods:These pipelines consist of three parts: quality control, de novo genome assembly, and bacterial genome annotation. In particular, the genome annotation pipeline provides a comprehensive overview of the genome, including standard gene prediction and functional inference, as well as predictions relevant to clinical applications such as virulence and resistance gene annotation, secondary metabolite detection, prophage and plasmid prediction, and more.Results:The annotation results are presented in reports, genome browsers, and a web-based application that enables users to explore and interact with the genome annotation results.Conclusions:Overall, our user-friendly pipelines offer a seamless integration of computational tools to facilitate routine bacterial genomics research.

We developed a machine learning (ML) model based on platelet-related genes to predict poor prognosis in sepsis. The model underwent rigorous evaluation on six diverse platforms, ensuring reliable and versatile findings.A retrospective analysis of platelet data from 365 sepsis patients confirmed the predictive role of platelet count in prognosis. We employed COX analysis, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) techniques to identify platelet-related genes from the GSE65682 dataset. Subsequently, these genes were trained and validated on six distinct platforms comprising 719 patients, and compared against the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) and Sequential Organ-Failure Assessment (SOFA) score.A PLT count <100×109/L independently increased the risk of death in sepsis patients (OR = 2.523; 95% CI: 1.084-5.872). The ML model, based on five platelet-related genes, demonstrated impressive area under the curve (AUC) values ranging from 0.5 to 0.795 across various validation platforms. On the GPL6947 platform, our ML model outperformed the APACHE II score with an AUC of 0.795 compared to 0.761. Additionally, by incorporating age, the model's performance was further improved to an AUC of 0.812. On the GPL4133 platform, the initial AUC of the machine learning model based on five platelet-related genes was 0.5. However, after including age, the AUC increased to 0.583. In comparison, the AUC of the APACHE II score was 0.604, and the AUC of the SOFA score was 0.542.Our findings highlight the broad applicability of this ML model, based on platelet-related genes, in facilitating early treatment decisions for sepsis patients with poor outcomes.

The effects of eQTLs can differ among tissues, cell types, and cellular states, but these differences are obscured by gene expression measurements in bulk populations. We developed a one-pot approach to map eQTLs inSaccharomyces cerevisiaeby single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and applied it to over 100,000 single cells from three crosses. We used scRNA-seq data to genotype each cell, measure gene expression, and classify the cells by cell-cycle stage. We mapped thousands of local and distant eQTLs and identified interactions between eQTL effects and cell-cycle stages. We took advantage of single-cell expression information to identify hundreds of genes with allele-specific effects on expression noise. We used cell-cycle stage classification to map 20 loci that influence cell-cycle progression. One of these loci influenced the expression of genes involved in the mating response. We showed that the effects of this locus arise from a common variant (W82R) in the geneGPA1, which encodes a signaling protein that negatively regulates the mating pathway. The 82R allele increases mating efficiency at the cost of slower cell-cycle progression and is associated with a higher rate of outcrossing in nature.

In this retrospective multicenter case-control study, the clinical data of 240 patients with CD admitted for surgical treatment between September 2019 and September 2021 at 3 centers were collected. Patients were randomly divided into a training set (168 patients) and a validation set (72 patients). Univariate analysis was performed for relevant factors, and statistically significant factors were then analyzed using multivariate logistic regression to determine the independent influencing factors. A nomogram model for predicting postoperative intestinal fistula in patients with CD was constructed and the accuracy of the model was evaluated using calibration curves. Univariate analysis showed that disease behavior, abdominal abscess, intestinal perforation, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, systemic immunoinflammatory index, and prognostic nutrition index were factors affecting postoperative intestinal fistula in patients with CD. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, prognostic nutrition index, disease behavior, and Crohn disease activity index score were independent influencing factors. After assessing the validation set, the area under the curve was 0.899, indicating good predictive accuracy of the nomogram model. The prediction model developed in this study can effectively predict the risk of postoperative intestinal fistula.Copyright © 2023 the Author(s). Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.",8E-38
,38097570,ERK2-topoisomerase II regulatory axis is important for gene activation in immediate early genes.,Nat Commun,"The function of the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway is required for the activation of immediate early genes (IEGs), including EGR1 and FOS, for cell growth and proliferation. Recent studies have identified topoisomerase II (TOP2) as one of the important regulators of the transcriptional activation of IEGs. However, the mechanism underlying transcriptional regulation involving TOP2 in IEG activation has remained unknown. Here, we demonstrate that ERK2, but not ERK1, is important for IEG transcriptional activation and report a critical ELK1 binding sequence for ERK2 function at the EGR1 gene. Our data indicate that both ERK1 and ERK2 extensively phosphorylate the C-terminal domain of TOP2B at mutual and distinctive residues. Although both ERK1 and ERK2 enhance the catalytic rate of TOP2B required to relax positive DNA supercoiling, ERK2 delays TOP2B catalysis of negative DNA supercoiling. In addition, ERK1 may relax DNA supercoiling by itself. ERK2 catalytic inhibition or knock-down interferes with transcription and deregulates TOP2B in IEGs. Furthermore, we present the first cryo-EM structure of the human cell-purified TOP2B and etoposide together with the EGR1 transcriptional start site (-30 to +20) that has the strongest affinity to TOP2B within -423 to +332. The structure shows TOP2B-mediated breakage and dramatic bending of the DNA. Transcription is activated by etoposide, while it is inhibited by ICRF193 at EGR1 and FOS, suggesting that TOP2B-mediated DNA break to favor transcriptional activation. Taken together, this study suggests that activated ERK2 phosphorylates TOP2B to regulate TOP2-DNA interactions and favor transcriptional activation in IEGs.

,38102483,Curation of causal interactions mediated by genes associated with autism accelerates the understanding of gene-phenotype relationships underlying neurodevelopmental disorders.,Mol Psychiatry,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) comprises a large group of neurodevelopmental conditions featuring, over a wide range of severity and combinations, a core set of manifestations (restricted sociality, stereotyped behavior and language impairment) alongside various comorbidities. Common and rare variants in several hundreds of genes and regulatory regions have been implicated in the molecular pathogenesis of ASD along a range of causation evidence strength. Despite significant progress in elucidating the impact of few paradigmatic individual loci, such sheer complexity in the genetic architecture underlying ASD as a whole has hampered the identification of convergent actionable hubs hypothesized to relay between the vastness of risk alleles and the core phenotypes. In turn this has limited the development of strategies that can revert or ameliorate this condition, calling for a systems-level approach to probe the cross-talk of cooperating genes in terms of causal interaction networks in order to make convergences experimentally tractable and reveal their clinical actionability. As a first step in this direction, we have captured from the scientific literature information on the causal links between the genes whose variants have been associated with ASD and the whole human proteome. This information has been annotated in a computer readable format in the SIGNOR database and is made freely available in the resource website. To link this information to cell functions and phenotypes, we have developed graph algorithms that estimate the functional distance of any protein in the SIGNOR causal interactome to phenotypes and pathways. The main novelty of our approach resides in the possibility to explore the mechanistic links connecting the suggested gene-phenotype relations.© 2023. The Author(s).",5.45E-38
,38011998,2-Hydroxyglutarate modulates histone methylation at specific loci and alters gene expression via Rph1 inhibition.,Life Sci Alliance,"2-Hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) is an oncometabolite that accumulates in certain cancers. Gain-of-function mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase lead to 2-HG accumulation at the expense of alpha-ketoglutarate. Elevated 2-HG levels inhibit histone and DNA demethylases, causing chromatin structure and gene regulation changes with tumorigenic consequences. We investigated the effects of elevated 2-HG levels inSaccharomyces cerevisiae, a yeast devoid of DNA methylation and heterochromatin-associated histone methylation. Our results demonstrate genetic background-dependent gene expression changes and altered H3K4 and H3K36 methylation at specific loci. Analysis of histone demethylase deletion strains indicated that 2-HG inhibits Rph1 sufficiently to induce extensive gene expression changes. Rph1 is the yeast homolog of human KDM4 demethylases and, among the yeast histone demethylases, was the most sensitive to the inhibitory effect of 2-HG in vitro. Interestingly, Rph1 deficiency favors gene repression and leads to further down-regulation of already silenced genes marked by low H3K4 and H3K36 trimethylation, but abundant in H3K36 dimethylation. Our results provide novel insights into the genome-wide effects of 2-HG and highlight Rph1 as its preferential demethylase target.© 2023 Gavriil et al.",4.99E-38

Previous powerful genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified multiple single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) near EN1 at 2q14.2 locus for osteoporosis, but the causal SNPs and functional mechanisms underlying these associations are poorly understood. The target genes regulated by the transcription factor EN1 are also unclear. In this study, we identified rs188303909, a functional CpG-SNP, as a causal SNP for osteoporosis at 2q14.2 through the integration of functional and epigenomic analyses. Functional experiments demonstrated that unmethylated rs188303909 acted as a strong allele-specific distal enhancer to regulate EN1 expression by modifying the binding of transcription factor E2F6, but rs188303909 methylation attenuated the active effect of E2F6 on EN1 expression. Importantly, transcription factor EN1 could differentially bind osteoporosis GWAS lead SNPs rs4869739-T and rs4355801-G to upregulate CCDC170 and COLEC10 expression, thus promoting bone formation. Our study provided a mechanistic insight into expression regulation of the osteoporosis susceptibility gene EN1, which could be a potential therapeutic target for osteoporosis precision medicine. KEY MESSAGES: CpG-SNP rs188303909 is a causal SNP at the osteoporosis susceptibility locus 2q14.2. Rs188303909 distally regulates EN1 expression by modulating DNA methylation and E2F6 binding.

,38007614,Genome-wide adenine N6-methylation map reveals epigenomic regulation of lipid accumulation in Nannochloropsis.,Plant Commun,"Epigenetic marks on histones and DNA, such as DNA methylation at N6-adenine (6mA), play crucial roles in gene expression and genome maintenance, but their deposition and function in microalgae remain largely uncharacterized. Here, we report a genome-wide 6mA map for the model industrial oleaginous microalga Nannochloropsis oceanica produced by single-molecule real-time sequencing. Found in 0.1% of adenines, 6mA sites are mostly enriched at the AGGYV motif, more abundant in transposons and 3' untranslated regions, and associated with active transcription. Moreover, 6mA gradually increases in abundance along the direction of gene transcription and shows special positional enrichment near splicing donor and transcription termination sites. Highly expressed genes tend to show greater 6mA abundance in the gene body than do poorly expressed genes, indicating a positive interaction between 6mA and general transcription factors. Furthermore, knockout of the putative 6mA methylase NO08G00280 by genome editing leads to changes in methylation patterns that are correlated with changes in the expression of molybdenum cofactor, sulfate transporter, glycosyl transferase, and lipase genes that underlie reductions in biomass and oil productivity. By contrast, knockout of the candidate demethylase NO06G02500 results in increased 6mA levels and reduced growth. Unraveling the epigenomic players and their roles in biomass productivity and lipid metabolism lays a foundation for epigenetic engineering of industrial microalgae.Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).

,38095828,Adaptive and Maladaptive Clonal Hematopoiesis in Telomere Biology Disorders.,Curr Hematol Malig Rep,"Telomere biology disorders (TBDs) are germline-inherited conditions characterized by reduction in telomerase function, accelerated shortening of telomeres, predisposition to organ-failure syndromes, and increased risk of neoplasms, especially myeloid malignancies. In normal cells, critically short telomeres trigger apoptosis and/or cellular senescence. However, the evolutionary mechanism by which TBD-related telomerase-deficient cells can overcome this fitness constraint remains elusive.Preliminary data suggests the existence of adaptive somatic mosaic states characterized by variants in TBD-related genes and maladaptive somatic mosaic states that attempt to overcome hematopoietic fitness constraints by alternative methods leading to clonal hematopoiesis. TBDs are both rare and highly heterogeneous in presentation, and the association of TBD with malignant transformation is unclear. Understanding the clonal complexity and mechanisms behind TBD-associated molecular signatures that lead to somatic adaptation in the setting of defective hematopoiesis will help inform therapy and treatment for this set of diseases.© 2023.

,38068774,The Potential Role of Nutrition in Overtraining Syndrome: A Narrative Review.,Nutrients,"Competition between athletes and an increase in sporting knowledge have greatly influenced training methods while increasing the number of them more and more. As a result, the number of athletes who have increased the number and intensity of their workouts while decreasing recovery times is rising. Positive overtraining could be considered a natural and fundamental process when the result is adaptation and improved performance; however, in the absence of adequate recovery, negative overtraining could occur, causing fatigue, maladaptation, and inertia. One of the earliest forms of fatigue is overreaching. It is considered to be an accumulation of training that leads to reduced sports performance, requiring days or weeks to recover. Overreaching, if followed by adequate recovery, can lead to an increase in athletic performance. Nonetheless, if overreaching becomes extreme, combined with additional stressors, it could lead to overtraining syndrome (OTS). OTS, caused by systemic inflammation, leads to central nervous system (CNS) effects, including depressed mood, further inflammation, central fatigue, and ultimately neurohormonal changes. There are therefore not only physiological, biochemical, and immunological but also psychological symptoms or markers that must be considered, independently or together, being intrinsically linked with overtraining, to fully understand OTS. However, to date, there are very few published studies that have analyzed how nutrition in its specific food aspects, if compromised during OTS, can be both etiology and consequence of the syndrome. To date, OTS has not yet been fully studied, and the topic needs further research. The purpose of this narrative review is therefore to study how a correct diet and nutrition can influence OTS in all its aspects, from prevention to treatment.",3.14E-38
,38012287,In vivo reprogramming leads to premature death linked to hepatic and intestinal failure.,Nat Aging,"The induction of cellular reprogramming via expression of the transcription factors Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc (OSKM) can drive dedifferentiation of somatic cells and ameliorate age-associated phenotypes in multiple tissues and organs. However, the benefits of long-term in vivo reprogramming are limited by detrimental side-effects. Here, using complementary genetic approaches, we demonstrated that continuous induction of the reprogramming factors in vivo leads to hepatic and intestinal dysfunction resulting in decreased body weight and contributing to premature death (within 1?week). By generating a transgenic reprogrammable mouse strain, avoiding OSKM expression in both liver and intestine, we reduced the early lethality and adverse effects associated with in vivo reprogramming and induced a decrease in organismal biological age. This reprogramming mouse strain, which allows longer-term continuous induction of OSKM with attenuated toxicity, can help better understand rejuvenation, regeneration and toxicity during in vivo reprogramming.© 2023.

,38076956,Long-read RNA-seq atlas of novel microglia isoforms elucidates disease-associated genetic regulation of splicing.,medRxiv,"Microglia, the innate immune cells of the central nervous system, have been genetically implicated in multiple neurodegenerative diseases. We previously mapped the genetic regulation of gene expression and mRNA splicing in human microglia, identifying several loci where common genetic variants in microglia-specific regulatory elements explain disease risk loci identified by GWAS. However, identifying genetic effects on splicing has been challenging due to the use of short sequencing reads to identify causal isoforms. Here we present the isoform-centric microglia genomic atlas (isoMiGA) which leverages the power of long-read RNA-seq to identify 35,879 novel microglia isoforms. We show that the novel microglia isoforms are involved in stimulation response and brain region specificity. We then quantified the expression of both known and novel isoforms in a multi-ethnic meta-analysis of 555 human microglia short-read RNA-seq samples from 391 donors, the largest to date, and found associations with genetic risk loci in Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. We nominate several loci that may act through complex changes in isoform and splice site usage.",2.6E-38
,38047081,A machine learning and directed network optimization approach to uncover TP53 regulatory patterns.,iScience,"TP53, theGuardian of the Genome, is the most frequently mutated gene in human cancers and the functional characterization of its regulation is fundamental. To address this we employ two strategies: machine learning to predict the mutation status ofTP53from transcriptomic data, and directed regulatory networks to reconstruct the effect of mutations on the transcipt levels ofTP53targets. Using data from established databases (Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia, The Cancer Genome Atlas), machine learning could predict the mutation status, but not resolve different mutations. On the contrary, directed network optimization allowed to infer theTP53regulatory profile across: (1) mutations, (2) irradiation in lung cancer, and (3) hypoxia in breast cancer, and we could observe differential regulatory profiles dictated by (1) mutation type, (2) deleterious consequences of the mutation, (3) known hotspots, (4) protein changes, (5) stress condition (irradiation/hypoxia). This is an important first step toward using regulatory networks for the characterization of the functional consequences of mutations, and could be extended to other perturbations, with implications for drug design and precision medicine.© 2023 The Author(s).",2.48E-38
,38048351,Transcription induces context-dependent remodeling of chromatin architecture during differentiation.,PLoS Biol,"Metazoan chromosomes are organized into discrete spatial domains (TADs), believed to contribute to the regulation of transcriptional programs. Despite extensive correlation between domain organization and gene activity, a direct mechanistic link is unclear, with perturbation studies often showing little effect. To follow chromatin architecture changes during development, we used Capture Hi-C to interrogate the domains around key differentially expressed genes during mouse thymocyte maturation, uncovering specific remodeling events. Notably, one TAD boundary was broadened to accommodate RNA polymerase elongation past the border, and subdomains were formed around some activated genes without changes in CTCF binding. The ectopic induction of some genes was sufficient to recapitulate domain formation in embryonic stem cells, providing strong evidence that transcription can directly remodel chromatin structure. These results suggest that transcriptional processes drive complex chromosome folding patterns that can be important in certain genomic contexts.Copyright: © 2023 Chahar et al.

,38136334,Susceptibility Genes Associated with Multiple Primary Cancers.,Cancers (Basel),"With advancements in treatment and screening techniques, we have been witnessing an era where more cancer survivors harbor multiple primary cancers (MPCs), affecting approximately one in six patients. Identifying MPCs is crucial for tumor staging and subsequent treatment choices. However, the current clinicopathological criteria for clinical application are limited and insufficient, making it challenging to differentiate them from recurrences or metastases. The emergence of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology has provided a genetic perspective for defining multiple primary cancers. Researchers have found that, when considering multiple tumor pairs, it is crucial not only to examine well-known essential mutations like MLH1/MSH2, EGFR, PTEN, BRCA1/2, CHEK2, and TP53 mutations but also to explore certain pleiotropic loci. Moreover, specific deleterious mutations may serve as regulatory factors in second cancer development following treatment. This review aims to discuss these susceptibility genes and provide an explanation of their functions based on the signaling pathway background. Additionally, the association network between genetic signatures and different tumor pairs will be summarized.",2.03E-38
,38001391,Promoter Hypomethylation Upregulates ANXA2 Expression in Pancreatic Cancer and is Associated with Poor Prognosis.,Biochem Genet,"Pancreatic cancer (PC) is one of the world's most aggressive and deadly cancers, owing to non-specific early clinical symptoms, late-stage diagnosis, and poor survival. Therefore, it is critical to identify specific biomarkers for its early diagnosis. Annexin A2 (ANXA2) is a calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding protein that has been reported to be upregulated in several cancer types, making it an emerging biomarker and potential cancer therapeutic target. However, the mechanism underlying the regulation of ANXA2 overexpression is still unclear. It is well established that genetic and epigenetic alterations may lead to widespread dysregulation of gene expression. Hence, in this study, we focused on exploring the regulatory mechanism of ANXA2 by investigating the transcriptional profile, methylation pattern, somatic mutation, and prognostic value of ANXA2 in PC using several bioinformatics databases. Our results revealed that the expression levels of ANXA2 were remarkably increased in PC tissues comparing to normal tissues. Furthermore, the high expression of ANXA2 was significantly related to the poor prognosis of PC patients. More importantly, we demonstrated for the first time that the ANXA2 promoter is hypomethylated in PC tissues compared to normal tissues which may result in ANXA2 overexpression in PC. However, more experimental research is required to corroborate our findings.© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",1.94E-38
,37937667,Histone retention preserves epigenetic marks during heat stress-induced transcriptional memory in plants.,EMBO J,"Plants often experience recurrent stressful events, for example, during heat waves. They can be primed by heat stress (HS) to improve the survival of more severe heat stress conditions. At certain genes, sustained expression is induced for several days beyond the initial heat stress. This transcriptional memory is associated with hyper-methylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me3), but it is unclear how this is maintained for extended periods. Here, we determined histone turnover by measuring the chromatin association of HS-induced histone H3.3. Genome-wide histone turnover was not homogenous; in particular, H3.3 was retained longer at heat stress memory genes compared to HS-induced non-memory genes during the memory phase. While low nucleosome turnover retained H3K4 methylation, methylation loss did not affect turnover, suggesting that low nucleosome turnover sustains H3K4 methylation, but not vice versa. Together, our results unveil the modulation of histone turnover as a mechanism to retain environmentally mediated epigenetic modifications.© 2023 The Authors.

The datasets analyzed in this research were acquired from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) and limma package were used to obtain the ALI-related genes (ALIRGs) and differentially expressed genes (DEGs), respectively. In total, two biological markers (Gch1 and Tnfaip3) related to oxidative stress were identified by machine learning algorithms, Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC), and differential expression analyses. The area under the curve (AUC) value of biological markers was greater than 0.9, indicating an excellent power to distinguish between ALI and control groups. Moreover, 15 differential immune cells were selected between the ALI and control samples, and they were correlated to biological markers. The transcription factor (TF)-microRNA (miRNA)-Target network was constructed to explore the potential regulatory mechanisms. Finally, based on the quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), the expression of Gch1 and Tnfaip3 was significantly higher in ALI lung tissue than in healthy controls. In conclusion, the differences in expression profiles between ALI and normal controls were found, and two biological markers were identified, providing a research basis for further understanding the pathogenesis of ALI.© 2023.

Scalable single-cell CUT&Tag can be combined with distinct platforms to distinguish cellular identity, epigenetic features and even spatial chromatin profiling. In addition, CUT&Tag has been developed as a strategy for joint profiling of the epigenome, transcriptome or proteome on the same sample.

In addition, loss of DNMT1 in frontal cortex resulted in behavioral abnormalities in mice. Here we investigated the effects of increased as well as lack of DNMT1 expression usingDnmt1tet/tetneurons as a model for abnormal neurogenesis and 10,861 genes showing transcript level dysregulation in datasets from the four disorders. In case of overexpression, 3,211 (? 30%) genes were dysregulated, affecting pathways involved in neurogenesis, semaphorin signaling, ephrin receptor activity, etc. A disproportionately higher proportion of dysregulated genes were associated with epilepsy. When transcriptome data ofDnmt1tet/tetneurons treated with doxycycline that downregulated DNMT1 was used, 3,356 genes (?31%) were dysregulated with a significant proportion involved in pathways similar to those in untreated cells. Both conditions resulted in ?68% of dysregulated genes wherein a majority showed similar patterns of transcript level changes. Among the genes with transcripts returning to normal levels, ribosome assembly/biogenesis was most significant whereas in absence of DNMT1, a new set of 903 genes became dysregulated and are involved in similar pathways as mentioned above. These findings provide support for overexpression of DNMT1 as well as its downregulation as risk factor for the four disorders and that its levels within a tight range are essential for normal neurodevelopment/mental health.Copyright © 2023 Singh, Saxena and Mohan.",1.12E-38

Here we aggregate, process and release a dataset of 76,156 human genomes from the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD)-the largest public open-access human genome allele frequency reference dataset-and use it to build a genomic constraint map for the whole genome (genomic non-coding constraint of haploinsufficient variation (Gnocchi)). We present a refined mutational model that incorporates local sequence context and regional genomic features to detect depletions of variation. As expected, the average constraint for protein-coding sequences is stronger than that for non-coding regions. Within the non-coding genome, constrained regions are enriched for known regulatory elements and variants that are implicated in complex human diseases and traits, facilitating the triangulation of biological annotation, disease association and natural selection to non-coding DNA analysis. More constrained regulatory elements tend to regulate more constrained protein-coding genes, which in turn suggests that non-coding constraint can aid the identification of constrained genes that are as yet unrecognized by current gene constraint metrics. We demonstrate that this genome-wide constraint map improves the identification and interpretation of functional human genetic variation.© 2023.

India ranks second in the number of diabetes cases in the world. The increasing burden of DM can be explained by genetic predisposition of Indians to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) coupled with rapid urbanization and socio-economic development in the last 3 decades leading to drastic changes in lifestyle. Environment and lifestyle changes contribute to T2DM development by altering epigenetic processes such as DNA methylation, histone post-translational modifications, and long non-coding RNAs, all of which regulate chromatin structure and gene expression. Although the genetic predisposition of Indians to T2DM is well established, how environmental and genetic factors interact and lead to T2DM is not well understood. In this review, we discuss the prevalence of diabetes and its complications across different states in India and how various risk factors contribute to its pathogenesis. The review also highlights the role of genetic predisposition among the Indian population and epigenetic factors involved in the etiology of diabetes. Lastly, we review current treatments and emphasize the knowledge gap with respect to genetic and epigenetic factors in the Indian context. Further understanding of the genetic and epigenetic determinants will help in risk prediction and prevention as well as therapeutic interventions, which will improve the clinical management of diabetes and associated macro- and micro-vascular complications.© 2023.

Most of our knowledge about the underlying mechanisms comes from research on photoperiodic regulation of reproduction in plants, insects and mammals. However, even humans, who mostly live in environments with minimal seasonal influences, show annual rhythms in physiology (e.g., immune activity, brain function), behavior (e.g., sleep-wake cycles) and disease prevalence (e.g., infectious diseases). As seasonal variations in environmental conditions may be drastically altered due to climate change, the understanding of the mechanisms underlying seasonal adaptation of physiology and behavior becomes even more relevant. While many species have developed specific solutions for dedicated tasks of photoperiodic regulation, we find a number of common principles and mechanisms when comparing insect and mammalian systems: (1) the circadian system contributes to photoperiodic regulation; (2) similar signaling molecules (VIP and PDF) are used for transferring information from the circadian system to the neuroendocrine system controlling the photoperiodic response; (3) the hormone melatonin participates in seasonal adaptation in insects as well as mammals; and (4) changes in photoperiod affect neurotransmitter function in both animal groups. The few examples of overlap elaborated in this perspective article, as well as the discussion on relevance for humans, should be seen as encouragement to unravel the machinery of seasonal adaptation in a multitude of organisms.© 2023.

A prognostic model was trained with the identified genes using the LASSO method and was validated with three external cohorts. The correlations between the risk model and cancer-associated signatures in cancer were analyzed. Key hub genes of the gene set were identified by hub gene analysis and survival analysis. 47% of the MAPK signaling pathway genes were overexpressed in glioma. Subtypes based on these genes were distinguished in survival, cancer stemness, and the immune microenvironment. A risk model was calculated with high confidence in the prediction of overall survival and was correlated with multiple cancer-associated signatures. 12 hub genes were identified and 8 of them were associated with survival.

In the aorta of CRISPR-edited rats with the Mediterranean G6PD variant, we determined DNA methylation by whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, gene expression by RNA sequencing, and large artery stiffness by echocardiography. Here, we documented higher expression ofDnmt1, Dnmt3a,Tet2, andTet3in aortas from Mediterranean G6PDS188Fvariant (a loss-of-function single nucleotide polymorphism) rats than their wild-type littermates. Concomitantly, we identified 17,618 differentially methylated loci genome-wide (5787 hypermethylated loci, including down-regulated genes encoding inflammation- and vasoconstriction-causing proteins, and 11,827 hypomethylated loci, including up-regulated genes encoding smooth muscle cell differentiation- and fatty acid metabolism-promoting proteins) in aortas from G6PDS188Fas compared to wild-type rats. Our results demonstrated that nitric oxide, which is generated in a G6PD-derived NADPH-dependent manner, increases TET and decreases DNMT activity. Further, we observed less large artery (aorta) stiffness in G6PDS188Fas compared to wild-type rats. These results establish a noncanonical function of the wild-type G6PD and G6PDS188Fvariant in the regulation of DNA methylation and gene expression in healthy vascular tissue and reveal that the G6PDS188Fvariant contributes to reducing large artery stiffness.",5.3E-39
,37958512,ZNF714 Supports Pro-Oncogenic Features in Lung Cancer Cells.,Int J Mol Sci,"Despite the ongoing progress in diagnosis and treatments, cancer remains a threat to more than one-third of the human population. The emerging data indicate that many Krüppel-associated box zinc finger proteins (KRAB-ZNF) belonging to a large gene family may be involved in carcinogenesis. Our previous study identified Zinc Finger Protein 714 (ZNF714), a KRAB-ZNF gene of unknown function, as being commonly overexpressed in many tumors, pointing to its hypothetical oncogenic role. Here, we harnessed The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-centered databases and performed functional studies with transcriptomic and methylomic profiling to explore ZNF714 function in cancer. Our pan-cancer analyses confirmed frequent ZNF714 overexpression in multiple tumors, possibly due to regional amplification, promoter hypomethylation, and Nuclear Transcription Factor Y Subunit Beta (NFYB) signaling. We also showed that ZNF714 expression correlates with tumor immunosuppressive features. The in vitro studies indicated that ZNF714 expression positively associates with proliferation, migration, and invasion. The transcriptomic analysis of ZNF714 knocked-down cells demonstrated deregulation of cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation. Importantly, we provided evidence that ZNF714 negatively regulates the expression of several known TSGs indirectly via promoter methylation. However, as ZNF714 did not show nuclear localization in our research model, the regulatory mechanisms exerted by ZNF714 require further investigation. In conclusion, our results reveal, for the first time, that ZNF714 may support pro-oncogenic features in lung cancer cells.",4.65E-39
,37998398,Liquid Biopsy in Head and Neck Cancer: Its Present State and Future Role in Africa.,Cells,"The rising mortality and morbidity rate of head and neck cancer (HNC) in Africa has been attributed to factors such as the poor state of health infrastructures, genetics, and late presentation resulting in the delayed diagnosis of these tumors. If well harnessed, emerging molecular and omics diagnostic technologies such as liquid biopsy can potentially play a major role in optimizing the management of HNC in Africa. However, to successfully apply liquid biopsy technology in the management of HNC in Africa, factors such as genetic, socioeconomic, environmental, and cultural acceptability of the technology must be given due consideration. This review outlines the role of circulating molecules such as tumor cells, tumor DNA, tumor RNA, proteins, and exosomes, in liquid biopsy technology for the management of HNC with a focus on studies conducted in Africa. The present state and the potential opportunities for the future use of liquid biopsy technology in the effective management of HNC in resource-limited settings such as Africa is further discussed.",4.49E-39
,37989978,The Quest for Circulating Biomarkers in Neuroendocrine Neoplasms: a Clinical Perspective.,Curr Treat Options Oncol,"Given the considerable heterogeneity in neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs), it appears unlikely that a sole biomarker exists capable of fully capturing all useful clinical aspects of these tumors. This is reflected in the abundant number of biomarkers presently available for the diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring of NEN patients. Although assessment of immunohistochemical and radiological markers remains paramount and often obligatory, there has been a notable surge of interest in circulating biomarkers over the years given the numerous benefits associated with liquid biopsies. Currently, the clinic primarily relies on single-analyte assays such as the chromogranin A assay, but these are far from ideal because of limitations such as compromised sensitivity and specificity as well as a lack of standardization. Consequently, the quest for NEN biomarkers continued with the exploration of multianalyte markers, exemplified by the development of the NETest and ctDNA-based analysis. Here, an extensive panel of markers is simultaneously evaluated to identify distinct signatures that could enhance the accuracy of patient diagnosis, prognosis determination, and response to therapy prediction and monitoring. Given the promising results, the development and implementation of these multianalyte markers are expected to usher in a new era of NEN biomarkers in the clinic. In this review, we will outline both clinically implemented and more experimental circulating markers to provide an update on developments in this rapidly evolving field.© 2023.

This study aims to identify FXYD6 as a biomarker for glioma, by analyzing its expression and methylation patterns.Using TCGA and GTEx datasets, we analyzed FXYD6 expression in various tissues, confirming its levels in normal brain and different glioma grades via immunoblotting and immunostaining. FXYD6 biological functions were explored through enrichment analysis, and tumor immune infiltration was assessed using ESTIMATE and TIMER algorithms. Pearson correlation analysis probed FXYD6 associations with biological function-related genes. A glioma detection model was developed using FXYD6 methylation data from TCGA and GEO. Consistently, a FXYD6 methylation-based prognostic model was constructed for glioma via LASSO Cox regression.FXYD6 was observed to be downregulated in GBM and implicated in a range of cellular functions, including synapse formation, cell junctions, immune checkpoint, ferroptosis, EMT, and pyroptosis. Hypermethylation of specific FXYD6 CpG sites in gliomas was identified, which could be used to build a diagnostic model. Additionally, FXYD6 methylation-based prognostic model could serve as an independent factor as well.FXYD6 is a promising biomarker for the diagnosis and prognosis of glioma, with its methylation-based prognostic model serving as an independent factor. This highlights its potential in clinical application for glioma management.© 2023 The Authors. Cancer Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",3.9E-39
,37977512,High overall copy number variation burden by genome-wide methylation profiling holds negative prognostic value in surgically treated pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.,Hum Pathol,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive type of cancer with an overall 5-year survival of around 10 %. New prognostic tools to stratify patients are needed. Our main aim was to evaluate the prognostic value of overall copy number variation (CNV) burden in surgically treated PDAC. DNA extracted from 108 surgical PDAC specimens was examined to collect data on the genome-wide DNA methylation status of >850,000 CpG sites in promoter, gene body, and enhancer regions (Illumina Infinium Methylation EPIC BeadChip Kit). CNV profiles were obtained and all PDACs were stratified into one of three groups: Low, moderate, or high overall CNV burden. Tumors histologically showing a dominant conventional and/or tubulopapillary pattern in 60 %-100 % and 0-59 % were categorized as Group A and Group B as per Kalimuthu. We also performed targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) and immunohistochemistry. High overall CNV burden held independent negative prognostic value with poor survival (HR 4.01 (95%CI 1.96-8.19), p = 0.00014) and was more frequent in Group B (p = 0.0003). Most frequent chromosomal arm-level aberrations were gains of 8q (29 %) and 1q (19 %) and losses of 17p (55 %), 18q (43 %), 6q (37 %), 9p (36 %), 6p (26 %), 19p (26 %), and 8p (25 %). Most frequent mutations found were in KRAS (95 %), TP53 (62 %), CDKN2A (24 %), SMAD4 (23 %), ATM (9 %), ARID1A (7 %), RNF43 (7 %), GNAS (6 %), and KDM6A (6 %). Group A PDACs showed more frequently KRAS variants other than Gly12Val and Gly12Asp (p = 0.012). Our data indicate that overall CNV burden using genome-wide methylation profiling may be a useful prognostic tool in surgically treated PDAC. Importantly, our approach, using data from genome-wide methylation profiling for analysis of overall CNV burden, can be performed on formalin-fixed and paraffin embedded PDAC tissues. Future studies should examine the prognostic value of overall CNV burden in unresectable PDAC.Copyright © 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",3.68E-39

The correlation between neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and unfavorable outcome of COVID-19 patients hospitalized to ICU was the aim of this study.We evaluated a cross-sectional study of 312 COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized to the ICU (confirmed by PCR and CT-Scan), in Babol city, Mazandaran province. WBC, RBC, lymphocyte, neutrophil, monocyte, platelet count, NLR, C-reactive protein (CRP), ESR, MCV, MHC, and other factors were evaluated.Our findings indicated that all patients aged 56 to 69?years with COVID-19 had a significant difference (P< 0.05) in neu, lymph, PLT count, NLR, ESR, Hb, and CRP. Also, NLR was significantly (P< 0.05) correlated with the death or discharge of the ICU hospitalized patients. The cut-off of NLR was 7.02 and the mean of NLR was 11.3?±?10.93 and 5.8?±?7.45 in death and discharge COVID-19 patients hospitalized to ICU, respectively. ROC curve indicated that, for NLR, the area under curve was 0.76.Our findings showed that NLR can be utilized as a clinical laboratory predictive parameter for mortality of COVID-19 patients admitted to ICU.Copyright © 2023 Shahram Seyfi et al.",3.57E-39
,38016026,Targeted epigenetic silencing of UCHL1 expression suppresses collagen-1 production in human lung epithelial cells.,Epigenetics,"Ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCHL1) is highly expressed in smokers, but little is known about the molecular mechanism of UCHL1 in airway epithelium and its possible role in affecting extracellular matrix (ECM) remodelling in the underlying submucosa. Since cigarette smoking is a major cause of lung diseases, we studied its effect on UCHL1 expression and DNA methylation patterns in human bronchial epithelial cells, obtained after laser capture micro-dissection (LCM) or isolated from residual tracheal/main stem bronchial tissue. Targeted regulation of UCHL1 expressionviaCRISPR/dCas9 based-epigenetic editing was used to explore the function of UCHL1 in lung epithelium. Our results show that cigarette smoke extract (CSE) stimulated the expression of UCHL1in vitro. The methylation status of the UCHL1 gene was negatively associated with UCHL1 transcription in LCM-obtained airway epithelium at specific sites. Treatment with a UCHL1 inhibitor showed that the TGF-?1-induced upregulation of the ECM gene COL1A1 can be prevented by the inhibition of UCHL1 activity in cell lines. Furthermore, upon downregulation of UCHL1 by epigenetic editing using CRISPR/dCas-EZH2, mRNA expression of COL1A1 and fibronectin was reduced. In conclusion, we confirmed higher UCHL1 expression in current smokers compared to non- and ex-smokers, and induced downregulation of UCHL1 by epigenetic editing. The subsequent repression of genes encoding ECM proteins suggest a role for UCHL1 as a therapeutic target in fibrosis-related disease.",3.55E-39
,38023875,PSTVd infection in Nicotiana benthamiana plants has a minor yet detectable effect on CG methylation.,Front Plant Sci,"Viroids are small circular RNAs infecting a wide range of plants. They do not code for any protein or peptide and therefore rely on their structure for their biological cycle. Observed phenotypes of viroid infected plants are thought to occur through changes at the transcriptional/translational level of the host. A mechanism involved in such changes is RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM). Till today, there are contradictory works about viroids interference of RdDM. In this study, we investigated the epigenetic effect of viroid infection inNicotiana benthamianaplants. Using potato spindle tuber viroid (PSTVd) as the triggering pathogen and via bioinformatic analyses, we identified endogenous gene promoters and transposable elements targeted by 24 nt host siRNAs that differentially accumulated in PSTVd-infected and healthy plants. The methylation status of these targets was evaluated following digestion with methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes coupled with PCR amplification, and bisulfite sequencing. In addition, we used Methylation Sensitive Amplification Polymorphism (MSAP) followed by sequencing (MSAP-seq) to study genomic DNA methylation of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) in CG sites upon viroid infection. In this study we identified a limited number of target loci differentially methylated upon PSTVd infection. These results enhance our understanding of the epigenetic host changes as a result of pospiviroid infection.Copyright © 2023 Tselika, Belmezos, Kallemi, Andronis, Chiumenti, Navarro, Lavigne, Di Serio, Kalantidis and Katsarou.",3.53E-39
,37937685,"Interactions between BRD4S, LOXL2, and MED1 drive cell cycle transcription in triple-negative breast cancer.",EMBO Mol Med,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) often develops resistance to single-agent treatment, which can be circumvented using targeted combinatorial approaches. Here, we demonstrate that the simultaneous inhibition of LOXL2 and BRD4 synergistically limits TNBC proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, LOXL2 interacts in the nucleus with the short isoform of BRD4 (BRD4S), MED1, and the cell cycle transcriptional regulator B-MyB. These interactions sustain the formation of BRD4 and MED1 nuclear transcriptional foci and control cell cycle progression at the gene expression level. The pharmacological co-inhibition of LOXL2 and BRD4 reduces BRD4 nuclear foci, BRD4-MED1 colocalization, and the transcription of cell cycle genes, thus suppressing TNBC cell proliferation. Targeting the interaction between BRD4S and LOXL2 could be a starting point for the development of new anticancer strategies for the treatment of TNBC.© 2023 The Authors.

,37994369,Dosage amplification dictates oncogenic regulation by the NKX2-1 lineage factor in lung adenocarcinoma.,bioRxiv,"Amplified oncogene expression is a critical and widespread driver event in cancer, yet our understanding of how amplification-mediated elevated dosage mediates oncogenic regulation is limited. Here, we find that the most significant focal amplification event in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) targets a lineage super-enhancer near theNKX2-1lineage transcription factor. TheNKX2-1super-enhancer is targeted by focal and co-amplification withNKX2-1, and activation or repression controlsNKX2-1expression. We find thatNKX2-1is a widespread dependency in LUAD cell lines, where NKX2-1 pioneers enhancer accessibility to drive a lineage addicted state in LUAD, and NKX2-1 confers persistence to EGFR inhibitors. Notably, we find that oncogenic NKX2-1 regulation requires expression above a minimum dosage threshold-NKX2-1 dosage below this threshold is insufficient for cell viability, enhancer remodeling, and TKI persistence. Our data suggest that copy-number amplification can be a gain-of-function alteration, wherein amplification elevates oncogene expression above a critical dosage required for oncogenic regulation and cancer cell survival.",3.42E-39
,38106090,A Fluorescence-Based Sensor for Calibrated Measurement of Protein Kinase Stability in Live Cells.,bioRxiv,"Oncogenic mutations can destabilize signaling proteins, resulting in increased or unregulated activity. Thus, there is considerable interest in mapping the relationship between mutations and the stability of proteins, to better understand the consequences of oncogenic mutations and potentially inform the development of new therapeutics. Here, we develop a tool to study protein-kinase stability in live mammalian cells and the effects of the HSP90 chaperone system on the stability of these kinases. We monitor the fluorescence of kinases fused to a fluorescent protein relative to that of a co-expressed reference fluorescent protein. We used this tool to study the dependence of Src- and Raf-family kinases on the HSP90 system. We demonstrate that this sensor reports on destabilization induced by oncogenic mutations in these kinases. We also show that Src-homology 2 (SH2) and Src-homology 3 (SH3) domains, which are required for autoinhibition of Src-family kinases, stabilize these kinase domains in the cell. Our expression-calibrated sensor enables the facile characterization of the effects of mutations and small-molecule drugs on protein-kinase stability.",3.16E-39

Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are emerging small non-coding RNAs that are 24-31 nucleotides in length. Previous studies on piRNAs were mainly limited to evaluating the binding to the PIWI protein family to play the biological role. However, recent studies have shed more lights on piRNA functions; aberrant piRNAs play unique roles in many human diseases, including diverse lethal cancers. Therefore, understanding the mechanism of piRNAs expression and the specific functional roles of piRNAs in human diseases is crucial for developing its clinical applications. Presently, research on piRNAs mainly focuses on their cancer-specific functions but lacks investigation of their expressions and epigenetic modifications. This review discusses piRNA's biogenesis and functional roles and the recent progress of functions of piRNA/PIWI protein complexes in human diseases. Video Abstract.© 2023. The Author(s).",2.8E-39

The degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the basal ganglia is the primary pathological feature of Parkinson's disease. Due to a lack of integrated analysis of multiomics datasets across multiple basal ganglia brain regions, very little is known about the regulatory mechanisms of this area.We utilized high-throughput transcriptomic and epigenomic analysis to profile over 270,000 single-nucleus cells to create a cellular atlas of the basal ganglia, characterizing the cellular composition of 4 regions of basal ganglia in adult macaque brain, including the striatum, substantia nigra (SN), globus pallidum, and amygdala. We found a distinct epigenetic regulation on gene expression of neuronal and nonneuronal cells across regions in basal ganglia. We identified a cluster of SN-specific astrocytes associated with neurodegenerative diseases and further explored the conserved and primate-specific transcriptomics in SN cell types across human, macaque, and mouse. Finally, we integrated our epigenetic landscape of basal ganglia cells with human disease heritability and identified a regulatory module consisting of candidate cis-regulatory elements that are specific to medium spiny neurons and associated with schizophrenia.In general, our macaque basal ganglia atlas provides valuable insights into the comprehensive transcriptome and epigenome of the most important and populous cell populations in the macaque basal ganglia. We have identified 49 cell types based on transcriptomic profiles and 47 cell types based on epigenomic profiles, some of which exhibit region specificity, and characterized the molecular relationships underlying these brain regions.© The Author(s) 2023.

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are increasingly recognized as important players in gene expression and various cellular processes, including cancer development and progression. In recent years, lncRNAs have been implicated in the differences observed in cancer incidence, progression, and treatment responses between men and women. Here, we present a brief overview of the current knowledge regarding the role of lncRNAs in cancer sex dimorphism, focusing on how they affect epigenetic processes in male and female mammalian cells. We discuss the potential mechanisms by which lncRNAs may contribute to sex differences in cancer, including transcriptional control of sex chromosomes, hormonal signaling pathways, and immune responses. We also propose strategies for studying lncRNA functions in cancer sex dimorphism. Furthermore, we emphasize the importance of considering sex as a biological variable in cancer research and the need to investigate the role lncRNAs play in mediating these sex differences.

,38031056,Cisplatin exposure alters tRNA-derived small RNAs but does not affect epimutations in C. elegans.,BMC Biol,"The individual lifestyle and environment of an organism can influence its phenotype and potentially the phenotype of its offspring. The different genetic and non-genetic components of the inheritance system and their mutual interactions are key mechanisms to generate inherited phenotypic changes. Epigenetic changes can be transmitted between generations independently from changes in DNA sequence. In Caenorhabditis elegans, epigenetic differences, i.e. epimutations, mediated by small non-coding RNAs, particularly 22G-RNAs, as well as chromatin have been identified, and their average persistence is three to five generations. In addition, previous research showed that some epimutations had a longer duration and concerned genes that were enriched for multiple components of xenobiotic response pathways.?These results raise the possibility that environmental stresses might change the rate at which epimutations occur, with potential significance for adaptation.In this work, we explore this question by propagating C. elegans lines either in control conditions or in moderate or high doses of cisplatin, which introduces genotoxic stress by damaging DNA. Our results show that cisplatin has a limited effect on global small non-coding RNA epimutations and epimutations in gene expression levels. However, cisplatin exposure leads to increased fluctuations in the levels of small non-coding RNAs derived from tRNA cleavage. We show that changes in tRNA-derived small RNAs may be associated with gene expression changes.Our work shows that epimutations are not substantially altered by cisplatin exposure but identifies transient changes in tRNA-derived small RNAs as a potential source of variation induced by genotoxic stress.© 2023.

,38102481,Intranasal oxytocin in a genetic animal model of autism.,Mol Psychiatry,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a group of neurodevelopmental disorders mainly characterized by deficient sociability and repetitive behaviors. Effective treatment for the core symptoms of ASD is still lacking. Behavioral interventions show limited effectiveness, while pharmacotherapy focuses on the amelioration of secondary symptomatology. Oxytocin (OXT) is a neuropeptide known for its prosocial impact, making it a candidate drug for ASD treatment. Its alleviating effect has been and still is widely researched, but outcomes reported by clinical studies are ambiguous. We examined the effect of daily intranasal OXT (0.8?IU/kg) administration for 4 weeks on the ASD-like phenotype in Shank3-/-adult mice. Animals treated with OXT spent twice as much time interacting with the social partner as early as after 2 weeks of treatment. Furthermore, OXT-treated mice exhibited reduced explorative behavior by 50%, after 4 weeks of treatment, and a 30% reduction in repetitive behavior, 4 weeks after treatment termination. One-fold higher sociability and 30% reduced exploration due to OXT lasted up to 4 weeks following the treatment termination. However, social disinterest was elevated by roughly 10% as well, indicating a form of social ambivalence. Obtained results support the therapeutic potential of intranasally administered OXT in alleviating social shortfalls in a genetic model of ASD. Subsequent research is necessary to elucidate the benefits and risks of the long-term OXT administration, as well as its applicability in other ASD models and the potential treatment effect on social communication, which was not measured in the present study.© 2023.

,38068717,Decoding the Influence of Obesity on Prostate Cancer and Its Transgenerational Impact.,Nutrients,"In recent decades, the escalating prevalence of metabolic disorders, notably obesity and being overweight, has emerged as a pressing concern in public health. Projections for the future indicate a continual upward trajectory in obesity rates, primarily attributable to unhealthy dietary patterns and sedentary lifestyles. The ramifications of obesity extend beyond its visible manifestations, intricately weaving a web of hormonal dysregulation, chronic inflammation, and oxidative stress. This nexus of factors holds particular significance in the context of carcinogenesis, notably in the case of prostate cancer (PCa), which is a pervasive malignancy and a leading cause of mortality among men. A compelling hypothesis arises from the perspective of transgenerational inheritance, wherein genetic and epigenetic imprints associated with obesity may wield influence over the development of PCa. This review proposes a comprehensive exploration of the nuanced mechanisms through which obesity disrupts prostate homeostasis and serves as a catalyst for PCa initiation. Additionally, it delves into the intriguing interplay between the transgenerational transmission of both obesity-related traits and the predisposition to PCa. Drawing insights from a spectrum of sources, ranging from in vitro and animal model research to human studies, this review endeavors to discuss the intricate connections between obesity and PCa. However, the landscape remains partially obscured as the current state of knowledge unveils only fragments of the complex mechanisms linking these phenomena. As research advances, unraveling the associated factors and underlying mechanisms promises to unveil novel avenues for understanding and potentially mitigating the nexus between obesity and the development of PCa.",1.5E-39
,38078876,Sirtuin 6 activation rescues the age-related decline in DNA damage repair in primary human chondrocytes.,Aging (Albany NY),"While advanced age is widely recognized as the greatest risk factor for osteoarthritis (OA), the biological mechanisms behind this connection remain unclear. Previous work has demonstrated that chondrocytes from older cadaveric donors have elevated levels of DNA damage as compared to chondrocytes from younger donors. The purpose of this study was to determine whether a decline in DNA repair efficiency is one explanation for the accumulation of DNA damage with age, and to quantify the improvement in repair with activation of Sirtuin 6 (SIRT6). After acute damage with irradiation, DNA repair was shown to be more efficient in chondrocytes from young (?45 years old) as compared to middle-aged (50-65 years old) or older (>70 years old) cadaveric donors. Activation of SIRT6 with MDL-800 improved the repair efficiency, while inhibition with EX-527 reduced the rate of repair and increased the percentage of cells that retain high levels of damage. In addition to affecting repair after acute damage, treating chondrocytes from older donors with MDL-800 for 48 hours significantly reduced the amount of baseline DNA damage. Chondrocytes isolated from the knees of mice between 4 months and 22 months of age revealed both an increase in DNA damage with aging, and a decrease in DNA damage following MDL-800 treatment. Lastly, treating murine cartilage explants with MDL-800 lowered the percentage of chondrocytes with high p16 promoter activity, which supports the concept that using SIRT6 activation to maintain low levels of DNA damage may prevent the initiation of senescence.",1.48E-39

Applying computational methods for the detection and reconstruction of ecDNA across a retrospective cohort of 481 medulloblastoma tumors from 465 patients, we identify circular ecDNA in 82 patients (18%). Patients with ecDNA-positive medulloblastoma were more than twice as likely to relapse and three times as likely to die within 5 years of diagnosis. A subset of tumors harbored multiple ecDNA lineages, each containing distinct amplified oncogenes. Multimodal sequencing, imaging and CRISPR inhibition experiments in medulloblastoma models reveal intratumoral heterogeneity of ecDNA copy number per cell and frequent putative 'enhancer rewiring' events on ecDNA.

,37992275,Bifunctional Small Molecules That Induce Nuclear Localization and Targeted Transcriptional Regulation.,J Am Chem Soc,"The aberrant localization of proteins in cells is a key factor in the development of various diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disease. To better understand and potentially manipulate protein localization for therapeutic purposes, we engineered bifunctional compounds that bind to proteins in separate cellular compartments. We show these compounds induce nuclear import of cytosolic cargoes, using nuclear-localized BRD4 as a ""carrier"" for co-import and nuclear trapping of cytosolic proteins. We use this system to calculate kinetic constants for passive diffusion across the nuclear pore and demonstrate single-cell heterogeneity in response to these bifunctional molecules with cells requiring high carrier to cargo expression for complete import. We also observe incorporation of cargo into BRD4-containing condensates. Proteins shown to be substrates for nuclear transport include oncogenic mutant nucleophosmin (NPM1c) and mutant PI3K catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CAE545K), suggesting potential applications to cancer treatment. In addition, we demonstrate that chemically induced localization of BRD4 to cytosolic-localized DNA-binding proteins, namely, IRF1 with a nuclear export signal, induces target gene expression. These results suggest that induced localization of proteins with bifunctional molecules enables the rewiring of cell circuitry, with significant implications for disease therapy.",1.39E-39
,38041181,Age-dependent genetic regulation of osteoarthritis: independent effects of immune system genes.,Arthritis Res Ther,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is a joint disease with a heritable component. Genetic loci identified via genome-wide association studies (GWAS) account for an estimated 26.3% of the disease trait variance in humans. Currently, there is no method for predicting the onset or progression of OA. We describe the first use of the Collaborative Cross (CC), a powerful genetic resource, to investigate knee OA in mice, with follow-up targeted multi-omics analysis of homologous regions of the human genome.We histologically screened 275 mice for knee OA and conducted quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping in the complete cohort (>?8 months) and the younger onset sub-cohort (8-12 months). Multi-omic analysis of human genetic datasets was conducted to investigate significant loci.We observed a range of OA phenotypes. QTL mapping identified a genome-wide significant locus on mouse chromosome 19 containing Glis3, the human equivalent of which has been identified as associated with OA in recent GWAS. Mapping the younger onset sub-cohort identified a genome-wide significant locus on chromosome 17. Multi-omic analysis of the homologous region of the human genome (6p21.32) indicated the presence of pleiotropic effects on the expression of the HLA?-?DPB2 gene and knee OA development risk, potentially mediated through the effects on DNA methylation.The significant associations at the 6p21.32 locus in human datasets highlight the value of the CC model of spontaneous OA that we have developed and lend support for an immune role in the disease. Our results in mice also add to the accumulating evidence of a role for Glis3 in OA.© 2023. The Author(s).",9.98E-40
,38015716,Molecular characteristics and clinical implications of serine/arginine-rich splicing factors in human cancer.,Aging (Albany NY),"As critical splicing regulators, serine/arginine-rich splicing factors (SRSFs) play pivotal roles in carcinogenesis. As dysregulation of SRSFs may confer potential cancer risks, targeting SRSFs could provide important insights into cancer therapy. However, a global and comprehensive pattern to elaborate the molecular characteristics, mechanisms, and clinical links of SRSFs in a wide variety of human cancer is still lacking. In this study, a systematic analysis was conducted to reveal the molecular characteristics and clinical implications of SRSFs covering more than 10000 tumour samples of 33 human cancer types. We found that SRSFs experienced prevalent genomic alterations and expression perturbations in multiple cancer types. The DNA methylation, m6A modification, and miRNA regulation of SRSFs were all cancer context-dependent. Importantly, we found that SRSFs were strongly associated with cancer immunity, and were capable of predicting response to immunotherapy. And SRSFs had colossal potential for predicting survival in multiple cancer types, including those that have received immunotherapy. Moreover, we also found that SRSFs could indicate the drug sensitivity of targeted therapy and chemotherapy. Our research highlights the significance of SRSFs in cancer occurrence and development, and provides sufficient resources for understanding the biological characteristics of SRSFs, offering a new and unique perspective for developing cancer therapeutic strategies.",9.5E-40

Clinical diagnoses and pathological findings were used to establish the gold standard for metastatic cervical LNs. A reader study with two clinicians was also performed to evaluate the lymph node status in the test set. The performance of the proposed models and the clinicians was evaluated and compared by measuring using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy (ACC), sensitivity (SEN), and specificity (SPE).A fusion model combining deep learning with radiomics showed the best performance (ACC, 89.2%; SEN, 92.0%; SPE, 88.9%; and AUC, 0.950 [95% confidence interval: 0.908-0.993, P?<?0.001]) in the test set. In comparison with the clinicians, the fusion model showed higher sensitivity (92.0 vs. 72.0% and 60.0%) but lower specificity (88.9 vs. 97.5% and 98.8%).A fusion model combining radiomics and deep learning approaches outperformed other single-technique models and showed great potential to accurately predict cervical LNM in patients with OSCC.The fusion model can complement the preoperative identification of LNM of OSCC performed by the clinicians.© 2023.

,38107580,Chargaff's second parity rule lies at the origin of additive genetic interactions in quantitative traits to make omnigenic selection possible.,PeerJ,"Francis Crick's central dogma provides a residue-by-residue mechanistic explanation of the flow of genetic information in living systems. However, this principle may not be sufficient for explaining how random mutations cause continuous variation of quantitative highly polygenic complex traits. Chargaff's second parity rule (CSPR), also referred to as intrastrand DNA symmetry, defined as near-exact equalities G ? C and A ? T within a single DNA strand, is a statistical property of cellular genomes. The phenomenon of intrastrand DNA symmetry was discovered more than 50 years ago; at present, it remains unclear what its biological role is, what the mechanisms are that force cellular genomes to comply strictly with CSPR, and why genomes of certain noncellular organisms have broken intrastrand DNA symmetry. The present work is aimed at studying a possible link between intrastrand DNA symmetry and the origin of genetic interactions in quantitative traits.Computational analysis of single-nucleotide polymorphisms in human and mouse populations and of nucleotide composition biases at different codon positions in bacterial and human proteomes.The analysis of mutation spectra inferred from single-nucleotide polymorphisms observed in murine and human populations revealed near-exact equalities of numbers of reverse complementary mutations, indicating that random genetic variations obey CSPR. Furthermore, nucleotide compositions of coding sequences proved to be statistically interwovenviaCSPR because pyrimidine bias at the 3rd codon position compensates purine bias at the 1st and 2nd positions.According to Fisher's infinitesimal model, we propose that accumulation of reverse complementary mutations results in a continuous phenotypic variation due to small additive effects of statistically interwoven genetic variations. Therefore, additive genetic interactions can be inferred as a statistical entanglement of nucleotide compositions of separate genetic loci. CSPR challenges the neutral theory of molecular evolution-because all random mutations participate in variation of a trait-and provides an alternative solution to Haldane's dilemma by making a gene function diffuse. We propose that CSPR is symmetry of Fisher's infinitesimal model and that genetic information can be transferred in an implicit contactless manner.©2023 Matkarimov and Saparbaev.",7.1E-40
,38020304,Mechanistic insights into UHRF1âmediated DNA methylation by structureâbased functional clarification of UHRF1 domains (Review).,Oncol Lett,"Epigenetic modification is crucial for transmitting genetic information, while abnormalities in DNA methylation modification are primarily associated with cancer and neurological diseases. As a multifunctional epigenetic modifier, ubiquitin like with PHD and ring finger domains 1 (UHRF1) mainly affects cell energy metabolism and cell cycle control. It also inhibits the transcription of tumor suppressor genes through DNA and/or histone methylation modifications, promoting the occurrence and development of cancer. Therefore, comprehensively understanding the molecular mechanism of the epigenetic modification of UHRF1 in tumors will help identify targets for inhibiting the expression and function of UHRF1. Notably, each domain of UHRF1 functions as a whole and differently. Thus, the abnormality of any domain can lead to a change in phenotype or disease. However, the specific regulatory mechanism and proteins of each domain have not been fully elucidated. The present review aimed to contribute to the study of the regulatory mechanism of UHRF1 to a greater extent in different cancers and provide ideas for drug research by clarifying the function of UHRF1 domains.Copyright © 2023, Spandidos Publications.",7.09E-40
,38099298,CTCF deletion alters the pluripotency and DNA methylation profile of human iPSCs.,Front Cell Dev Biol,"Pluripotent stem cells are characterized by their differentiation potential toward endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm. However, it is still largely unclear how these cell-fate decisions are mediated by epigenetic mechanisms. In this study, we explored the relevance of CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), a zinc finger-containing DNA-binding protein, which mediates long-range chromatin organization, for directed cell-fate determination. We generated human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines with deletions in the protein-coding region in exon 3 of CTCF, resulting in shorter transcripts and overall reduced protein expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation showed a considerable loss of CTCF binding to target sites. The CTCF deletions resulted in slower growth and modest global changes in gene expression, with downregulation of a subset of pluripotency-associated genes and neuroectodermal genes. CTCF deletion also evoked DNA methylation changes, which were moderately associated with differential gene expression. Notably, CTCF-deletions lead to upregulation of endo-mesodermal associated marker genes and epigenetic signatures, whereas ectodermal differentiation was defective. These results indicate that CTCF plays an important role in the maintenance of pluripotency and differentiation, especially towards ectodermal lineages.Copyright © 2023 Puri, Maaßen, Varona Baranda, Zeevaert, Hahnfeld, Hauser, Fornero, Elsafi Mabrouk and Wagner.",5.91E-40
,37952855,Hypermethylation and low expression of FANCC involved in multi-walled carbon nanotube-induced toxicity on ARPE-19 cells.,Environ Res,"Multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) exposure was observed to cause damages on the viability of ocular cells, however, the underlying mechanisms remain not well understood. Epigenetic alterations that regulate gene expression have been identi?ed as a major responsiveness to environmental challenge. Thus, the aim of this study was to screen methylation-regulated genes involved in MWCNT exposure. The Illumina Human Methylation 850 K array was employed to determine the genome-wide DNA methylation profile of human retinal pigment epithelial cell line (ARPE-19) exposed to 50% inhibition concentration of MWCNTs (100 ?g/ml) for 24 h or without (n = 3 for each group). Then, the transcriptome data obtained by high-throughput RNA sequencing previously were integrated with DNA methylome to identify the overlapped genes. As a result, the integrative bioinformatics analysis identified that compared with controls, FA complementation group C (FANCC) was hypermethylated and downregulated in MWCNT-exposed ARPE-19 cells. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis confirmed the mRNA expression level of FANCC was significantly decreased following MWCNT treatment and the addition of DNA methylation inhibitor 5-Aza-deoxycytidine (10 ?M) reversed this decrease. Pyrosequencing analysis further validated the hypermethylation status at the 5'-untranslated promoter region of FANCC (cg14583550) in MWCNT-exposed ARPE-19 cells. Protein-protein interaction network and function analyses predicted that FANCC may contribute to MWCNT-induced cytotoxicity by interacting with heat shock protein 90 beta family member 1 and then upregulating cytokine interleukin-6 and apoptosis biomarker caspase 3. In conclusion, the present study links the epigenetic modification of FANCC with the pathogenesis of MWCNT-induced retinal toxicity.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",5.24E-40
,38014192,Multiomic analysis reveals cellular and epigenetic plasticity in intestinal pouches of ulcerative colitis patients.,medRxiv,"Total proctocolectomy with ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA) is the standard of care for patients with severe treatment resistant ulcerative colitis (UC). Despite improvements in patient outcomes, about 50% of patients will develop inflammation of the pouch within 1-2 years following surgery. Establishment of UC pouches is associated with profound histological changes of the mucosa. A detailed characterization of these changes on a cellular and molecular level is crucial for an improved understanding of pouch physiology and diseases management.We generated cell-type-resolved transcriptional and epigenetic atlases of UC pouches using scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data from paired biopsy samples from the ileal pouch and ileal segment above the pouch (pre-pouch) of UC-IPAA patients (n=6, female=2) without symptoms. We also collected data from paired biopsies of the terminal ileum (TI) and ascending colon (AC) from healthy controls (n=6, female=3).We identified novel populations of colon-like absorptive and secretory epithelial cells, constituting a significant proportion of the epithelial cell fraction in the pouch but not in matched pre-pouch samples. Pouch-specific enterocytes expressed colon-specific genes, including CEACAM5, CA2. However, in contrast to normal colonic epithelium, these cells also expressed a range of inflammatory and secretory genes, similar to previously detected gene expression signatures in IBD patients. Comparison to longitudinal bulk RNA-seq data from UC pouches demonstrated that colon-like epithelial cells are present early after pouch functionalization and independently of subsequent pouchitis. Finally, single cell chromatin accessibility revealed activation colonic transcriptional regulators, including CDX1, NFIA, and EHF.UC pouches are characterized by partial colonic metaplasia of the epithelium. These data constitute a resource of transcriptomic and epigenetic signatures of cell populations in the pouch and provide an anchor for understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms of pouchitis.",4.81E-40
,38060592,multi-GPA-Tree: Statistical approach for pleiotropy informed and functional annotation tree guided prioritization of GWAS results.,PLoS Comput Biol,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified over two hundred thousand genotype-trait associations. Yet some challenges remain. First, complex traits are often associated with many single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), most with small or moderate effect sizes, making them difficult to detect. Second, many complex traits share a common genetic basis due to 'pleiotropy' and and though few methods consider it, leveraging pleiotropy can improve statistical power to detect genotype-trait associations with weaker effect sizes. Third, currently available statistical methods are limited in explaining the functional mechanisms through which genetic variants are associated with specific or multiple traits. We propose multi-GPA-Tree to address these challenges. The multi-GPA-Tree approach can identify risk SNPs associated with single as well as multiple traits while also identifying the combinations of functional annotations that can explain the mechanisms through which risk-associated SNPs are linked with the traits. First, we implemented simulation studies to evaluate the proposed multi-GPA-Tree method and compared its performance with existing statistical approaches. The results indicate that multi-GPA-Tree outperforms existing statistical approaches in detecting risk-associated SNPs for multiple traits. Second, we applied multi-GPA-Tree to a systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and to a Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcertive colitis (UC) GWAS, and functional annotation data including GenoSkyline and GenoSkylinePlus. Our results demonstrate that multi-GPA-Tree can be a powerful tool that improves association mapping while facilitating understanding of the underlying genetic architecture of complex traits and potential mechanisms linking risk-associated SNPs with complex traits.Copyright: © 2023 Khatiwada et al.

Senescence was verified using ?-galactosidase staining, and DNA damage was detected using immunofluorescence staining for ?-H2A.X. 5-Methyl cytosine (5-mC) content in the genome was determined using ELISA.SPRY1 expression increased with age, whereas TET3 expression decreased. Similarly, SPRY1 was upregulated and TET3 was downregulated with increasing cell passages. TET3-siRNA upregulated SPRY1 expression in HaCaT cells. UVA irradiation promoted HaCaT cell senescence and induced cellular DNA damage. SPRY1 was upregulated and TET3 was downregulated upon UVA irradiation. Genome-wide 5-mC content increased upon TET3 silencing and UVA irradiation, indicating a surge in overall methylation.SPRY1 and TET3 are natural skin aging-related genes that counteract to regulate replicative aging and UVA-induced photoaging in HaCaT cells. The cell photoaging model may limit experimental bias caused by different exposure times of skin model samples.© 2023 The Authors.

,38046817,The possible role of gut microbiota dysbiosis in the pathophysiology of delirium in older persons.,Microbiome Res Rep,"Delirium is a clinical syndrome characterized by an acute change in attention, awareness and cognition with fluctuating course, frequently observed in older patients during hospitalization for acute medical illness or after surgery. Its pathogenesis is multifactorial and still not completely understood, but there is general consensus on the fact that it results from the interaction between an underlying predisposition, such as neurodegenerative diseases, and an acute stressor acting as a trigger, such as infection or anesthesia. Alterations in brain insulin sensitivity and metabolic function, increased blood-brain barrier permeability, neurotransmitter imbalances, abnormal microglial activation and neuroinflammation have all been involved in the pathophysiology of delirium. Interestingly, all these mechanisms can be regulated by the gut microbiota, as demonstrated in experimental studies investigating the microbiota-gut-brain axis in dementia. Aging is also associated with profound changes in gut microbiota composition and functions, which can influence several aspects of disease pathophysiology in the host. This review provides an overview of the emerging evidence linking age-related gut microbiota dysbiosis with delirium, opening new perspectives for the microbiota as a possible target of interventions aimed at delirium prevention and treatment.© The Author(s) 2023.",2.76E-40

How these transitions are affected by time, and how heterogeneous and spatially distinct various reactive astrocyte populations are, remain unclear. To address these questions, we performed spatial transcriptomics as well as single nucleus RNAseq of ~138,000 mouse forebrain astrocytes at 1, 3, and 14 days after ischemic injury. We observed a widespread and temporally diverse response across many astrocyte subtypes. We identified astrocyte clusters unique in injury, including a transiently proliferative substate that may be BRCA1-dependent. We also found an interferon-responsive population that rapidly expands to the perilesion cortex at 1 day and persists up to 14 days post stroke. These lowly abundant, spatially restricted populations are likely functionally important in post-injury stabilization and resolution. These datasets offer valuable insights into injury-induced reactive astrocyte heterogeneity and can be used to guide functional interrogation of biologically meaningful reactive astrocyte substates to understand their pro- and anti-reparative functions following acute injuries such as stroke.",2.19E-40

These responses occur in the context of the local chromatin landscape, but the contribution of organ-specific dynamic chromatin modifications in responses to external signals remains largely unexplored. We treated tomato seedlings with a supply of nitrate and measured the genome-wide changes of four histone marks, the permissive marks H3K27ac, H3K4me3, and H3K36me3 and repressive mark H3K27me3, in shoots and roots separately, as well as H3K9me2 in shoots. Dynamic and organ-specific histone acetylation and methylation were observed at functionally relevant gene loci. Integration of transcriptomic and epigenomic datasets generated from the same organ revealed largely syngenetic relations between changes in transcript levels and histone modifications, with the exception of H3K27me3 in shoots, where an increased level of this repressive mark is observed at genes activated by nitrate. Application of a machine learning approach revealed organ-specific rules regarding the importance of individual histone marks, as H3K36me3 is the most successful mark in predicting gene regulation events in shoots, while H3K4me3 is the strongest individual predictor in roots. Our integrated study substantiates a view that during plant environmental responses, the relationships between histone code dynamics and gene regulation are highly dependent on organ-specific contexts.© 2023.

,38015807,The Evolutionary Complexities of DNA Methylation in Animals: From Plasticity to Genetic Evolution.,Genome Biol Evol,"The importance of DNA methylation in plastic responses to environmental change and evolutionary dynamics is increasingly recognized. Here, we provide a Perspective piece on the diverse roles of DNA methylation on broad evolutionary timescales, including (i) short-term transient acclimation, (ii) stable phenotypic evolution, and (iii) genomic evolution. We show that epigenetic responses vary along a continuum, ranging from short-term acclimatory responses in variable environments within a generation to long-term modifications in populations and species. DNA methylation thus unlocks additional potential for organisms to rapidly acclimate to their environment over short timeframes. If these changes affect fitness, they can circumvent the need for adaptive changes at the genome level. However, methylation has a complex reciprocal relationship with genetic variation as it can be genetically controlled, yet it can also induce point mutations and contribute to genomic evolution. When habitats remain constant over many generations, or populations are separated across habitats, initially plastic phenotypes can become hardwired through epigenetically facilitated mutagenesis. It remains unclear under what circumstances plasticity contributes to evolutionary outcomes, and when plastic changes will become permanently encoded into genotype. We highlight how studies investigating the evolution of epigenetic plasticity need to carefully consider how plasticity in methylation state could evolve among different evolutionary scenarios, the possible phenotypic outcomes, its effects on genomic evolution, and the proximate energetic and ultimate fitness costs of methylation. We argue that accumulating evidence suggests that DNA methylation can contribute toward evolution on various timescales, spanning a continuum from acclimatory plasticity to genomic evolution.© The Author(s) 2023.

CXCL14 is highly expressed in colon epithelial cells and shows obvious gene silencing in clinical colon cancer samples, suggesting that its silencing is related to the immune escape of cancer cells. In this paper, we analyzed the expression profiles of multiple human clinical colon cancer datasets and mouse colon cancer models to reveal the variation trend of CXCL14 expression during colitis, colon polyps, primary colon cancer, and liver metastases. The relationship between CXCL14 gene silencing and promoter hypermethylation was revealed through the colorectal carcinoma methylation database. The results suggest that CXCL14 is a tumor suppressor gene in colorectal carcinoma which is activated first and then silenced during the process of tumor occurrence and deterioration. Promoter hypermethylation is the main cause of CXCL14 silencing. The methylation level of CXCL14 is correlated with the anatomic site of tumor occurrence, positively correlated with patient age, and associated with prognosis. Reversing the hypermethylation of CXCL14 may be an epigenetic therapy for colon cancer.",1.73E-40
,38092728,Niacin restriction with NAMPT-inhibition is synthetic lethal to neuroendocrine carcinoma.,Nat Commun,"Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) plays a major role in NAD biosynthesis in many cancers and is an attractive potential cancer target. However, factors dictating therapeutic efficacy of NAMPT inhibitors (NAMPTi) are unclear. We report that neuroendocrine phenotypes predict lung and prostate carcinoma vulnerability to NAMPTi, and that NAMPTi therapy against those cancers is enhanced by dietary modification. Neuroendocrine differentiation of tumor cells is associated with down-regulation of genes relevant to quinolinate phosphoribosyltransferase-dependent de novo NAD synthesis, promoting NAMPTi susceptibility in vitro. We also report that circulating nicotinic acid riboside (NAR), a non-canonical niacin absent in culture media, antagonizes NAMPTi efficacy as it fuels NAMPT-independent but nicotinamide riboside kinase 1-dependent NAD synthesis in tumors. In mouse transplantation models, depleting blood NAR by nutritional or genetic manipulations is synthetic lethal to tumors when combined with NAMPTi. Our findings provide a rationale for simultaneous targeting of NAR metabolism and NAMPT therapeutically in neuroendocrine carcinoma.© 2023. The Author(s).",1.68E-40

With the aggravation of social aging, the incidence of LBP has increased globally. Intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) is the primary cause of LBP. Currently, IDD treatment strategies include physiotherapy, medication, and surgery; however, none can address the root cause by ending the degeneration of intervertebral discs (IVDs). However, in recent years, targeted therapy based on specific molecules has brought hope for treating IDD. The tumor suppressor gene p53 produces a transcription factor that regulates cell metabolism and survival. Recently, p53 was shown to play an important role in maintaining IVD microenvironment homeostasis by regulating IVD cell senescence, apoptosis, and metabolism by activating downstream target genes. This study reviews research progress regarding the potential role of p53 in IDD and discusses the challenges of targeting p53 in the treatment of IDD.

To understand adaptive responses enabling DNA damage response (DDR) and CIN, we analyzed matched normal, premalignant, and malignant gastric lesions from human specimens and a carcinogen-induced mouse model, observing activation of replication stress, DDR, and p21 in neoplastic progression. In GEA cell lines, expression of DDR markers correlated with ploidy abnormalities, such as number of high-level focal amplifications and whole-genome duplication (WGD). IntegratingTP53status, ploidy abnormalities, and DDR markers into a compositive score helped predict GEA cell lines with enhanced sensitivity to Chk1/2 and Wee1 inhibition, either alone or combined with irinotecan (SN38). We demonstrate that Chk1/2 or Wee1 inhibition combined with SN38/irinotecan shows greater anti-tumor activity in human gastric cancer organoids and anin vivoxenograft mouse model. These findings indicate that specific DDR biomarkers and ploidy abnormalities may predict premalignant progression and response to DDR pathway inhibitors.© 2023 The Authors.",1.51E-40
,37956771,A complex with poly(A)-binding protein and EWS facilitates the transcriptional function of oncogenic ETS transcription factors in prostate cells.,J Biol Chem,"The ETS transcription factor ERG is aberrantly expressed in approximately 50% of prostate tumors due to chromosomal rearrangements such as TMPRSS2/ERG. The ability of ERG to drive oncogenesis in prostate epithelial cells requires interaction with distinct coactivators, such as the RNA-binding protein EWS. Here, we find that ERG has both direct and indirect interactions with EWS, and the indirect interaction is mediated by the poly-A RNA-binding protein PABPC1. PABPC1 directly bound both ERG and EWS. ERG expression in prostate cells promoted PABPC1 localization to the nucleus and recruited PABPC1 to ERG/EWS-binding sites in the genome. Knockdown of PABPC1 in prostate cells abrogated ERG-mediated phenotypes and decreased the ability of ERG to activate transcription. These findings define a complex including ERG and the RNA-binding proteins EWS and PABPC1 that represents a potential therapeutic target for ERG-positive prostate cancer and identify a novel nuclear role for PABPC1.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

BAX predominantly resides in the cytosol in a quiescent state and upon stress, it undergoes conformational activation and mitochondrial translocation leading to mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, a critical event in apoptosis execution. Previous studies reported two inactive conformations of cytosolic BAX, a monomer and a dimer, however, it remains unclear how they regulate BAX. Here we show that, surprisingly, cancer cell lines express cytosolic inactive BAX dimers and/or monomers. Expression of inactive dimers, results in reduced BAX activation, translocation and apoptosis upon pro-apoptotic drug treatments. Using the inactive BAX dimer structure and a pharmacophore-based drug screen, we identify a small-molecule modulator, BDM19 that binds and activates cytosolic BAX dimers and prompts cells to apoptosis either alone or in combination with BCL-2/BCL-XL inhibitor Navitoclax.

However, the biological mechanisms and symptomatology underlying this disorder are still largely unknown or poorly understood. Considerable evidence shows that PTSD results from a dysfunction in highly conserved brain systems involved in regulating stress, anxiety, fear, and reward circuitry. This review provides a contemporary update about PTSD, including new data from the clinical and preclinical literature on stress, PTSD, and fear memory consolidation and extinction processes. First, we present an overview of well-established laboratory models of PTSD and discuss their clinical translational value for finding various treatments for PTSD. We then highlight the research progress on the neural circuits of fear and extinction-related behavior, including the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala. We further describe different molecular mechanisms, including GABAergic, glutamatergic, cholinergic, and neurotropic signaling, responsible for the structural and functional changes during fear acquisition and fear extinction processes in PTSD.Copyright © 2023 Iqbal, Huang, Xue, Yang and Jia.",1.4E-40

Previously, we developed a novel epigenetic rejuvenation therapy, based on the expression of the three transcription factorsOct4,Sox2, andKlf4(OSK), which safely rejuvenates RGCs without altering cell identity in glaucomatous and old mice after 1 month of treatment. In the current year-long study, mice with continuous or cyclic OSK expression induced after glaucoma-induced vision damage had occurred were tracked for efficacy, duration, and safety. Surprisingly, only 2 months of OSK fully restored impaired vision, with a restoration of vision for 11 months with prolonged expression. In RGCs, transcription from the doxycycline (DOX)-inducible Tet-On AAV system, returned to baseline 4 weeks after DOX withdrawal. Significant vision improvements remained for 1 month post switching off OSK, after which the vision benefit gradually diminished but remained better than baseline. Notably, no adverse effects on retinal structure or body weight were observed in glaucomatous mice with OSK continuously expressed for 21 months providing compelling evidence of efficacy and safety. This work highlights the tremendous therapeutic potential of rejuvenating gene therapies using OSK, not only for glaucoma but also for other ocular and systemic injuries and age-related diseases.",1.33E-40

Neutrophils are the most abundant leukocyte in humans and represent innate immunity's first line of defense. We previously found that primary mouse bone marrow neutrophils show widespread sex-dimorphism throughout life, including at the transcriptional level. Extracellular matrix [ECM]-related terms were observed among the top sex-dimorphic genes. Since the ECM is emerging as an important regulator of innate immune responses, we sought to further investigate the transcriptomic profile of primary mouse bone marrow neutrophils at both the bulk and single-cell level to understand how biological sex may influence ECM component expression in neutrophils throughout life. Here, using curated gene lists of ECM components and unbiased weighted gene co-expression network analysis [WGCNA], we find that multiple ECM-related gene sets show widespread female-bias in expression in primary mouse neutrophils. Since many immune-related diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis) are more prevalent in females, our work may provide insights into the pathogenesis of sex-dimorphic inflammatory diseases.Copyright: © 2023 McGill et al.

The study aimed to examine whether comorbidities of COVID-19/CHD involved shared genetic pathology, as well as to clarify the shared genetic variants predisposing risks common to COVID-19 severity and CHD risks.By leveraging publicly available summary statistics, we assessed the genetically determined causality between COVID-19 and CHD with bidirectional Mendelian randomization. To further quantify the causality contributed by shared genetic variants, we interrogated their genetic correlation with the linkage disequilibrium score regression method. Bayesian colocalization analysis coupled with conditional/conjunctional false discovery rate analysis was applied to decipher the shared causal single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).Briefly, we observed that the incident CHD risks post COVID-19 infection were partially determined by shared genetic variants. The shared genetic variants contributed to the causality at a proportion of 0.18 (95% CI 0.18-0.19) to 0.23 (95% CI 0.23-0.24). The SNP (rs10490770) located near LZTFL1 suggested direct causality (SNPs ? COVID-19 ? CHD), and SNPs in ABO (rs579459, rs495828), ILRUN(rs2744961), and CACFD1(rs4962153, rs3094379) may simultaneously influence COVID-19 severity and CHD risks.Five SNPs located near LZTFL1 (rs10490770), ABO (rs579459, rs495828), ILRUN (rs2744961), and CACFD1 (rs4962153, rs3094379) may simultaneously influence their risks. The current study suggested that there may be shared mechanisms predisposing to both COVID-19 severity and CHD risks. Genetic predisposition to COVID-19 is a causal risk factor for CHD, supporting that reducing the COVID-19 infection risk or alleviating COVID-19 severity among those with specific genotypes might reduce their subsequent CHD adverse outcomes. Meanwhile, the shared genetic variants identified may be of clinical implications for identifying the target population who are more vulnerable to adverse CHD outcomes post COVID-19 and may also advance treatments of 'Long COVID-19.'© 2023.

There are several underlying causes for adrenal insufficiency, where an autoimmune attack by the immune system is the most common cause. A number of genes are known to confer early onset adrenal disease in monogenic inheritance patterns, usually genetic encoding enzymes of adrenal steroidogenesis. Autoimmune primary adrenal insufficiency is usually a polygenic disease where our information recently has increased due to genome association studies. In this review, we go through the physiology of the adrenals before explaining the different reasons for adrenal insufficiency with a particular focus on autoimmune primary adrenal insufficiency. We will give a clinical overview including diagnosis and current treatment, before giving an overview of the genetic causes including monogenetic reasons for adrenal insufficiency and the polygenic background and inheritance pattern in autoimmune adrenal insufficiency. We will then look at the autoimmune mechanisms underlying autoimmune adrenal insufficiency and how autoantibodies are important for diagnosis.

The prognosis of breast cancer patients differs among molecular types. Compared with other subtypes, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has been a research hotspot in recent years because of its high degree of malignancy, strong invasiveness, rapid progression, easy of recurrence, distant metastasis, poor prognosis, and high mortality. Many studies have found that long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) plays an important role in the occurrence, proliferation, migration, recurrence, chemotherapy resistance, and other characteristics of TNBC. Some lncRNAs are expected to become biomarkers in the diagnosis and prognosis of TNBC, and even new targets for its treatment. Based on a PubMed literature search, this review summarizes the progress in research on lncRNAs in TNBC and discusses their roles in TNBC diagnosis, prognosis, and chemotherapy with the hope of providing help for future research.",1.12E-40

At present, the RPL7L1 (60S Ribosomal Protein L7-Like 1) were less reported by literature search. Study reports that RPL7L1 is associated with mouse embryonic and skeletal muscle. The study of RPL7L1 on tumors has not been reported.Our team downloaded the pan-cancer dataset that is uniformly normalized from the UCSC database (N=19131). Our study examined the relationship between RPL7L1 expression level and clinical prognosis with methylation, anti-tumour immunity, functional states, MSI, TMB, DNSss, LOH and chemotherapeutic responses in 43 cancer types and subtypes.RPL7L1 was overexpressed in nine tumor types. Gene mutation, tumor microenvironment and methylation modification of RPL7L1 plays a key role in patient prognosis. And the high expression of RPL7L1 was associated with TMB, MSI, LOH especially LIHC and HNSC. We experimentally verified that genes can promote the proliferation and migration of tumor cells. Our study suggested that RPL7L1 biomarker can be used for treating cancer, detecting it, and predicting its prognosis.Copyright © 2023. Published by Elsevier Inc.",7.37E-41

In this study, our aim was to investigate this role, identify associated metabolic subtypes, and assess their clinical implications in GC.We conducted a comprehensive analysis of cholesterol metabolism genes (CMGs) using transcriptomic data from TCGA and GEO. Based on 23 representative CMGs, we classified GC into metabolic subtypes. We evaluated clinical features and immune cell infiltration between these subtypes. Additionally, we identified a CMG signature and assessed its clinical relevance in GC. We retrospectively enrolled thirty-five GC patients receiving chemotherapy plus a PD-1 inhibitor to assess the CMG signature using multiplex immunohistochemistry.Our analysis revealed two cholesterol metabolism subtypes in GC: Cholesterol Metabolism Type 1 (CMT1) and Cholesterol Metabolism Type 2 (CMT2). These subtypes exhibited distinct patterns: CMT1 indicated heightened cholesterol biosynthesis, while CMT2 showed abnormal cholesterol transport. CMT2 was associated with unfavorable clinical features, enriched malignant pathways, and a pro-tumor immune microenvironment. Furthermore, we developed a five-CMG prognostic signature (ABCA1, NR1H3, TSPO, NCEH1, and HMGCR) that effectively predicted the prognosis of patients with GC and their response to chemotherapy plus a PD-1 inhibitor. This signature was validated in a clinical cohort using multiplex immunohistochemistry.Our results highlight the effectiveness of cholesterol metabolism patterns as biomarkers for predicting the prognosis and immunotherapy response in GC. The expression of cholesterol metabolism genes and the assessment of cholesterol metabolism patterns have the potential to predict the outcome of immunotherapy and guide treatment strategies.© 2023.

,37968388,"Single-cell, whole-embryo phenotyping of mammalian developmental disorders.",Nature,"Mouse models are a critical tool for studying human diseases, particularly developmental disorders1. However, conventional approaches for phenotyping may fail to detect subtle defects throughout the developing mouse2. Here we set out to establish single-cell RNA sequencing of the whole embryo as a scalable platform for the systematic phenotyping of mouse genetic models. We applied combinatorial indexing-based single-cell RNA sequencing3to profile 101 embryos of 22 mutant and 4 wild-type genotypes at embryonic day 13.5, altogether profiling more than 1.6?million nuclei. The 22 mutants represent a range of anticipated phenotypic severities, from established multisystem disorders to deletions of individual regulatory regions4,5. We developed and applied several analytical frameworks for detecting differences in composition and/or gene expression across 52 cell types or trajectories. Some mutants exhibit changes in dozens of trajectories whereas others exhibit changes in only a few cell types. We also identify differences between widely used wild-type strains, compare phenotyping of gain- versus loss-of-function mutants and characterize deletions of topological associating domain boundaries. Notably, some changes are shared among mutants, suggesting that developmental pleiotropy might be 'decomposable' through further scaling of this approach. Overall, our findings show how single-cell profiling of whole embryos can enable the systematic molecular and cellular phenotypic characterization of mouse mutants with unprecedented breadth and resolution.© 2023.

,37926287,Prioritizing cardiovascular disease-associated variants altering NKX2-5 and TBX5 binding through an integrative computational approach.,J Biol Chem,"Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death worldwide and are heavily influenced by genetic factors. Genome-wide association studies have mapped >90% of CVD-associated variants within the noncoding genome, which can alter the function of regulatory proteins, such as transcription factors (TFs). However, due to the overwhelming number of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (>500,000) in genome-wide association studies, prioritizing variants for in vitro analysis remains challenging. In this work, we implemented a computational approach that considers support vector machine (SVM)-based TF binding site classification and cardiac expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis to identify and prioritize potential CVD-causing SNPs. We identified 1535 CVD-associated SNPs within TF footprints and putative cardiac enhancers plus 14,218 variants in linkage disequilibrium with genotype-dependent gene expression in cardiac tissues. Using ChIP-seq data from two cardiac TFs (NKX2-5 and TBX5) in human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes, we trained a large-scale gapped k-mer SVM model to identify CVD-associated SNPs that altered NKX2-5 and TBX5 binding. The model was tested by scoring human heart TF genomic footprints within putative enhancers and measuring in vitro binding through electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Five variants predicted to alter NKX2-5 (rs59310144, rs6715570, and rs61872084) and TBX5 (rs7612445 and rs7790964) binding were prioritized for in vitro validation based on the magnitude of the predicted change in binding and are in cardiac tissue eQTLs. All five variants altered NKX2-5 and TBX5 DNA binding. We present a bioinformatic approach that considers tissue-specific eQTL analysis and SVM-based TF binding site classification to prioritize CVD-associated variants for in vitro analysis.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

,38086376,Genome-wide study reveals novel roles for formin-2 in axon regeneration as a microtubule dynamics regulator and therapeutic target for nerve repair.,Neuron,"Peripheral nerves regenerate successfully; however, clinical outcome after injury is poor. We demonstrated that low-dose ionizing radiation (LDIR) promoted axon regeneration and function recovery after peripheral nerve injury (PNI). Genome-wide CpG methylation profiling identified LDIR-induced hypermethylation of the Fmn2 promoter, exhibiting injury-induced Fmn2 downregulation in dorsal root ganglia (DRGs). Constitutive knockout or neuronal Fmn2 knockdown accelerated nerve repair and function recovery. Mechanistically, increased microtubule dynamics at growth cones was observed in time-lapse imaging of Fmn2-deficient DRG neurons. Increased HDAC5 phosphorylation and rapid tubulin deacetylation were found in regenerating axons of neuronal Fmn2-knockdown mice after injury. Growth-promoting effect of neuronal Fmn2 knockdown was eliminated by pharmaceutical blockade of HDAC5 or neuronal Hdac5 knockdown, suggesting that Fmn2deletion promotes axon regeneration via microtubule post-translational modification. In silico screening of FDA-approved drugs identified metaxalone, administered either immediately or 24-h post-injury, accelerating function recovery. This work uncovers a novel axon regeneration function of Fmn2 and a small-molecule strategy for PNI.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",4.57E-41
,38033464,Epigenetics Mechanisms of Honeybees: Secrets of Royal Jelly.,Epigenet Insights,"Early diets in honeybees have effects on epigenome with consequences on their phenotype. Depending on the early larval diet, either royal jelly (RJ) or royal worker, 2 different female castes are generated from identical genomes, a long-lived queen with fully developed ovaries and a short-lived functionally sterile worker. To generate these prominent physiological and morphological differences between queen and worker, honeybees utilize epigenetic mechanisms which are controlled by nutritional input. These mechanisms include DNA methylation and histone post-translational modifications, mainly histone acetylation. In honeybee larvae, DNA methylation and histone acetylation may be differentially altered by RJ. This diet has biologically active ingredients with inhibitory effects on thede novomethyltransferase DNMT3A or the histone deacetylase 3 HDAC3 to create and maintain the epigenetic state necessary for developing larvae to generate a queen. DNMT and HDAC enzymes work together to induce the formation of a compacted chromatin structure, repressing transcription. Such dialog could be coordinated by their association with other epigenetic factors including the ubiquitin-like containing plant homeodomain (PHD) and really interesting new gene (RING) ?nger domains 1 (UHRF1). Through its multiple functional domains, UHRF1 acts as an epigenetic reader of both DNA methylation patterns and histone marks. The present review discusses the epigenetic regulation of honeybee's chromatin and how the early diets in honeybees can affect the DNA/histone modifying types of machinery that are necessary to stimulate the larvae to turn into either queen or worker. The review also looks at future directions in epigenetics mechanisms of honeybees, mainly the potential role of UHRF1 in these mechanisms.© The Author(s) 2023.",4.38E-41

The existence of countless bioinformatics tools, for the different analytical steps, increases the complexity of data interpretation and the difficulty to derive biological insights. In this article, we present SCALA, a bioinformatics tool for analysis and visualization of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (scATAC-seq) datasets, enabling either independent or integrative analysis of the two modalities. SCALA combines standard types of analysis by integrating multiple software packages varying from quality control to the identification of distinct cell populations and cell states. Additional analysis options enable functional enrichment, cellular trajectory inference, ligand-receptor analysis, and regulatory network reconstruction. SCALA is fully parameterizable, presenting data in tabular format and producing publication-ready visualizations.

,38059913,Hsf1 and the molecular chaperone Hsp90 support a 'rewiring stress response' leading to an adaptive cell size increase in chronic stress.,Elife,"Cells are exposed to a wide variety of internal and external stresses. Although many studies have focused on cellular responses to acute and severe stresses, little is known about how cellular systems adapt to sublethal chronic stresses. Using mammalian cells in culture, we discovered that they adapt to chronic mild stresses of up to two weeks, notably proteotoxic stresses such as heat, by increasing their size and translation, thereby scaling the amount of total protein. These adaptations render them more resilient to persistent and subsequent stresses. We demonstrate that Hsf1, well known for its role in acute stress responses, is required for the cell size increase, and that the molecular chaperone Hsp90 is essential for coupling the cell size increase to augmented translation. We term this translational reprogramming the 'rewiring stress response', and propose that this protective process of chronic stress adaptation contributes to the increase in size as cells get older, and that its failure promotes aging.© 2023, Maiti et al.",2.41E-41

While PD and DLB share some clinical and pathological similarities, each disease presents distinct characteristics, including the primary affected brain region and neuronal type. We aimed to develop neuronal-type-specificSNCA-targeted epigenome therapies for synucleinopathies. The system is based on an all-in-one lentiviral vector comprised of CRISPR-dSaCas9 and guide RNA (gRNA) targeted atSNCAintron 1 fused with a synthetic repressor molecule of Krüppel-associated box (KRAB)/ methyl CpG binding protein 2 (MeCp2) transcription repression domain (TRD). To achieve neuronal-type specificity for dopaminergic and cholinergic neurons, the system was driven by tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) promoters, respectively. Delivering the system into human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived dopaminergic and cholinergic neurons from a patient with theSNCAtriplication resulted in efficient and neuronal-type-specific downregulation ofSNCA-mRNA and protein. Furthermore, the reduction inSNCAlevels by the gRNA-dSaCas9-repressor system rescued disease-related cellular phenotypes including Ser129-phophorylated ?-synuclein, neuronal viability, and mitochondrial dysfunction. We established a novel neuronal-type-specificSNCA-targeted epigenome therapy and providedin vitroproof of concept using human-based disease models.

,38106048,Electrostatic encoding of genome organization principles within single native nucleosomes.,bioRxiv,"The eukaryotic genome, first packed into nucleosomes of about 150 bp around the histone core, is organized into euchromatin and heterochromatin, corresponding to the A and B compartments, respectively. Here, we asked if individual nucleosomes in vivo know where to go. That is, do mono-nucleosomes by themselves contain A/B compartment information, associated with transcription activity, in their biophysical properties? We purified native mono-nucleosomes to high monodispersity and used physiological concentrations of biological polyamines to determine their condensability. The chromosomal regions known to partition into A compartments have low condensability and vice versa.In silicochromatin polymer simulations using condensability as the only input showed that biophysical information needed to form compartments is all contained in single native nucleosomes and no other factors are needed. Condensability is also strongly anticorrelated with gene expression, and especially so near the promoter region and in a cell type dependent manner. Therefore, individual nucleosomes in the promoter know whether the gene is on or off, and that information is contained in their biophysical properties. Comparison with genetic and epigenetic features suggest that nucleosome condensability is a very meaningful axis onto which to project the high dimensional cellular chromatin state. Analysis of condensability using various condensing agents including those that are protein-based suggests that genome organization principle encoded into individual nucleosomes is electrostatic in nature. Polyamine depletion in mouse T cells, by either knocking out ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) or inhibiting ODC, results in hyperpolarized condensability, suggesting that when cells cannot rely on polyamines to translate biophysical properties of nucleosomes to control gene expression and 3D genome organization, they accentuate condensability contrast, which may explain dysfunction known to occur with polyamine deficiency.",2.3E-41

It has not been known which molecules are involved in age-dependent renal impairment. Messenger RNA (mRNA) has been reported to modulate various renal diseases, and we therefore investigated mRNA signatures in age-dependent renal impairment. We performed an initial microarray-profiling analysis to screen mRNAs, the expression levels of which changed in the kidneys of 50-week-old senescence-accelerated prone (SAMP1) mice (which have accelerated age-dependent renal impairments) compared with those of 50 wk old senescence-accelerated-resistant (SAMR1) mice (which have normal aged kidneys) and with younger (10 wk old) SAMP1 and SAMR1 mice. We next assessed the expressions of mRNAs that were differentially expressed in the kidneys of SAMP1-50wk mice by conducting a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and compared the expressions among the SAMP1-10wk, SAMR1-10wk, and SAMR1-50wk mice. The results of the microarray together with the qRT-PCR analysis revealed five mRNAs whose expression levels were significantly altered in SAMP1-50wk mouse kidneys versus the control mice. The expression levels of the five mRNAs were increased in the kidneys of the mice with age-dependent renal impairment.

Favorable outcomes after targeting epigenetic regulators during disease states have further emphasized their importance in hematological malignancy. However, these targeted therapies are only effective in some patients, suggesting that further research is needed to decipher the complexity of epigenetic regulation during hematopoiesis.

Nonetheless, the problem of missing heritability persists. To solve this problem, it is essential to explain the genetic structure of disease incidence risk and prognosis by incorporating interactions. The development of the Bayesian theory has provided new approaches for developing models for interaction identification and estimation. Several Bayesian models have been developed to improve the accuracy of model and identify the main effect, gene-environment (G×E) and gene-gene (G×G) interactions. Studies based on single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are significant for the exploration of rare and common variants. Models based on the effect heredity principle and group-based models are relatively flexible and do not require strict constraints when dealing with the hierarchical structure between the main effect and interactions (M-I). These models have a good interpretability of biological mechanisms. Machine learning-based Bayesian approaches are highly competitive in improving prediction accuracy. These models provide insights into the mechanisms underlying the occurrence and progression of complex diseases, identify more reliable biomarkers, and develop higher predictive accuracy. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of these Bayesian approaches.Copyright © 2023, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.

Notably, tsRNAs can also directly bind to protein and exhibit functions in transcription, protein modification, gene expression, protein stabilization, and signaling pathways. tsRNAs can control the expression of tumor suppressor genes and participate in the initiation of cancer. It can also mediate the progression of diseases by regulating cell viability, migration ability, inflammatory factor content and autophagy ability. Precision medicine targeting tsRNAs and drug therapy of plant-derived tsRNAs are expected to be used in clinical practice.

Although HD is monogenetic, the specific pathophysiology and biomarkers are yet unknown specifically, also, complex to diagnose at an early stage, and identification is restricted in accuracy and precision. This study combined bioinformatics analysis and network-based system biology approaches to discover the biomarker, pathways, and drug targets related to molecular mechanism of HD etiology. The gene expression profile data sets GSE64810 and GSE95343 were analyzed to predict the molecular markers in HD where 162 mutual differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected. Ten hub genes among them (DUSP1, NKX2-5, GLI1, KLF4, SCNN1B, NPHS1, SGK2, PITX2, S100A4, andMSX1) were identified from protein-protein interaction (PPI) network which were mostly expressed as down-regulated. Following that, transcription factors (TFs)-DEGs interactions (FOXC1, GATA2, etc), TF-microRNA (miRNA) interactions (hsa-miR-340, hsa-miR-34a, etc), protein-drug interactions, and disorders associated with DEGs were predicted. Furthermore, we used gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to emphasize relevant gene ontology terms (eg, TF activity, sequence-specific DNA binding) linked to DEGs in HD. Disease interactions revealed the diseases that are linked to HD, and the prospective small drug molecules like cytarabine and arsenite was predicted against HD.

,38127959,Social isolation-induced transcriptomic changes in mouse hippocampus impact the synapse and show convergence with human genetic risk for neurodevelopmental phenotypes.,PLoS One,"Early life stress (ELS) can impact brain development and is a risk factor for neurodevelopmental disorders such as schizophrenia. Post-weaning social isolation (SI) is used to model ELS in animals, using isolation stress to disrupt a normal developmental trajectory. We aimed to investigate how SI affects the expression of genes in mouse hippocampus and to investigate how these changes related to the genetic basis of neurodevelopmental phenotypes. BL/6J mice were exposed to post-weaning SI (PD21-25) or treated as group-housed controls (n = 7-8 per group). RNA sequencing was performed on tissue samples from the hippocampus of adult male and female mice. Four hundred and 1,215 differentially-expressed genes (DEGs) at a false discovery rate of < 0.05 were detected between SI and control samples for males and females respectively. DEGS for both males and females were significantly overrepresented in gene ontologies related to synaptic structure and function, especially the post-synapse. DEGs were enriched for common variant (SNP) heritability in humans that contributes to risk of neuropsychiatric disorders (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder) and to cognitive function. DEGs were also enriched for genes harbouring rare de novo variants that contribute to autism spectrum disorder and other developmental disorders. Finally, cell type analysis revealed populations of hippocampal astrocytes that were enriched for DEGs, indicating effects in these cell types as well as neurons.

TheABCFsubfamily is involved in ribosomal synthesis, antibiotic resistance, and transcriptional regulation. However, few studies have investigated the role ofABCFin wheat (Triticum aestivum) immunity. Here, we identified 18TaABCFs and classified them into four categories based on their domain characteristics. Functional similarity betweenArabidopsisand wheatABCFgenes was predicted using phylogenetic analysis. A comprehensive genome-wide analysis of gene structure, protein motifs, chromosomal location, and cis-acting elements was also performed. Tissue-specific analysis and expression profiling under temperature, hormonal, and viral stresses were performed using real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction after randomly selecting one gene from each group. The results revealed that allTaABCFgenes had the highest expression at 25 °C and responded to methyl jasmonate induction. Notably,TaABCF2was highly expressed in all tissues except the roots, and silencing it significantly increased the accumulation of Chinese wheat mosaic virus or wheat yellow mosaic virus in wheat leaves. These results indicated thatTaABCFmay function in response to viral infection, laying the foundation for further studies on the mechanisms of this protein family in plant defence.",1.05E-41

The high degree of plasticity in the mammary epithelium is reflected in extensive heterogeneity among breast cancers. Here, we have analyzed RNA-sequencing data from three different mammary epithelial cell line-derived EMT models and identified a robust mammary EMT gene expression signature that separates breast cancers into distinct subgroups. Most strikingly, the basal-like breast cancers form two subgroups displaying partial-EMT and post-EMT gene expression patterns. We present evidence that key EMT-associated transcription factors play distinct roles at different stages of EMT in mammary epithelial cells.Copyright © 2023 Knutsen, Das Sajib, Fiskaa, Lorens, Gudjonsson, Mælandsmo, Johansen, Seternes and Perander.",8.75E-42
,38105946,Noncoding function of super enhancer derived mRNA in modulating neighboring gene expression and TAD interaction.,bioRxiv,"Super enhancers are important regulators of gene expression that often overlap with protein-coding genes. However, it is unclear whether the overlapping protein-coding genes and the mRNA derived from them contribute to enhancer activity. Using an erythroid-specific super enhancer that overlaps theCpoxgene as a model, we found thatCpoxmRNA has a non-coding function in regulating neighboring protein-coding genes, eRNA expression and TAD interactions. Depletion ofCpoxmRNA leads to accumulation of H3K27me3 and release of p300 from theCpoxlocus, activating an intra-TAD enhancer and gene expression. Additionally, we identified a head-to-tail interaction between the TAD boundary genesCpoxandDcbld2that is facilitated by a novel type of repressive loop anchored by p300 and PRC2/H3K27me3. Our results uncover a regulatory role for mRNA transcribed within a super enhancer context and provide insight into head-to-tail inter-gene interaction in the regulation of gene expression and oncogene activation.",8.41E-42

These proteins share three highly conserved, contiguous zinc fingers in their carboxy-terminus, requisite for binding to cis elements in DNA. Each SP/KLF protein has unique primary sequence within its amino-terminal and carboxy-terminal regions, and it is these regions which interact with co-activators, co-repressors, and chromatin-modifying proteins to support the transcriptional activation and repression of target genes. Krüppel-like Factor 9 (KLF9) and Krüppel-like Factor 13 (KLF13) are two of the smallest members of the SP/KLF family, are paralogous, emerged early in metazoan evolution, and are highly conserved. Paradoxically, while most similar in primary sequence, KLF9 and KLF13 display many distinct roles in target cells. In this article, we summarize the work that has identified the roles of KLF9 (and to a lesser degree KLF13) in tumor suppression or promotion via unique effects on differentiation, pro- and anti-inflammatory pathways, oxidative stress, and tumor immune cell infiltration. We also highlight the great diversity of miRNAs, lncRNAs, and circular RNAs which provide mechanisms for the ubiquitous tumor-specific suppression of KLF9 mRNA and protein. Elucidation of KLF9 and KLF13 in cancer biology is likely to provide new inroads to the understanding of oncogenesis and its prevention and treatments.",6.15E-42

,38129675,NA,NA,"The ability to comprehensively analyze the chromatin state with single-cell resolution is crucial for understanding gene regulatory principles in heterogenous tissues or during development. Recently, we developed a nanobody-based single-cell CUT&Tag (nano-CT) protocol to simultaneously profile three epigenetic modalities-two histone marks and open chromatin state-from the same single cell. Nano-CT implements a new set of secondary nanobody-Tn5 fusion proteins to direct barcoded tagmentation by Tn5 transposase to genomic targets labeled by primary antibodies raised in different species. Such nanobody-Tn5 fusion proteins are currently not commercially available, and their in-house production and purification can be completed in 3-4 d by following our detailed protocol. The single-cell indexing in nano-CT is performed on a commercially available platform, making it widely accessible to the community. In comparison to other multimodal methods, nano-CT stands out in data complexity, low sample requirements and the flexibility to choose two of the three modalities. In addition, nano-CT works efficiently with fresh brain samples, generating multimodal epigenomic profiles for thousands of brain cells at single-cell resolution. The nano-CT protocol can be completed in just 3 d by users with basic skills in standard molecular biology and bioinformatics, although previous experience with single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (scATAC-seq) is beneficial for more in-depth data analysis. As a multimodal assay, nano-CT holds immense potential to reveal interactions of various chromatin modalities, to explore epigenetic heterogeneity and to increase our understanding of the role and interplay that chromatin dynamics has in cellular development.© 2023.

,38033156,Mutational impact of APOBEC3A and APOBEC3B in a human cell line and comparisons to breast cancer.,PLoS Genet,"A prominent source of mutation in cancer is single-stranded DNA cytosine deamination by cellular APOBEC3 enzymes, which results in signature C-to-T and C-to-G mutations in TCA and TCT motifs. Although multiple enzymes have been implicated, reports conflict and it is unclear which protein(s) are responsible. Here we report the development of a selectable system to quantify genome mutation and demonstrate its utility by comparing the mutagenic activities of three leading candidates-APOBEC3A, APOBEC3B, and APOBEC3H. The human cell line, HAP1, is engineered to express the thymidine kinase (TK) gene of HSV-1, which confers sensitivity to ganciclovir. Expression of APOBEC3A and APOBEC3B, but not catalytic mutant controls or APOBEC3H, triggers increased frequencies of TK mutation and similar TC-biased cytosine mutation profiles in the selectable TK reporter gene. Whole genome sequences from independent clones enabled an analysis of thousands of single base substitution mutations and extraction of local sequence preferences with APOBEC3A preferring YTCW motifs 70% of the time and APOBEC3B 50% of the time (Y = C/T; W = A/T). Signature comparisons with breast tumor whole genome sequences indicate that most malignancies manifest intermediate percentages of APOBEC3 signature mutations in YTCW motifs, mostly between 50 and 70%, suggesting that both enzymes contribute in a combinatorial manner to the overall mutation landscape. Although the vast majority of APOBEC3A- and APOBEC3B-induced single base substitution mutations occur outside of predicted chromosomal DNA hairpin structures, whole genome sequence analyses and supporting biochemical studies also indicate that both enzymes are capable of deaminating the single-stranded loop regions of DNA hairpins at elevated rates. These studies combine to help resolve a long-standing etiologic debate on the source of APOBEC3 signature mutations in cancer and indicate that future diagnostic and therapeutic efforts should focus on both APOBEC3A and APOBEC3B.Copyright: This is an open access article, free of all copyright, and may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, modified, built upon, or otherwise used by anyone for any lawful purpose.

BC is the most common type of cancer in women, and progress with regard to treatment has been made in recent years. Despite this, there remain a number of unresolved issues in the treatment of BC; in particular, early detection and diagnosis, reliable markers of response to treatment and for the prediction of recurrence and metastasis, especially for unfavorable subtypes, are needed. It is also important to identify biomarkers for the assessment of drug resistance and for disease monitoring. Our work is devoted to ctDNA, which may be such a marker. Here, we describe its main characteristics and potential applications in clinical oncology. This review considers the results of studies devoted to the analysis of the prognostic and predictive roles of various methods for the determination of ctDNA in BC patients. Currently known epigenetic changes in ctDNA with clinical significance are reviewed. The possibility of using ctDNA as a predictive and prognostic marker for monitoring BC and predicting the recurrence and metastasis of cancer is also discussed, which may become an important part of a precision approach to the treatment of BC.",4.74E-42

Transgenic mice overexpressing TGF?1 in the brain (TGF mice) recapitulate VCID-associated cerebrovascular pathology and develop cognitive deficits in old age or when submitted to comorbid cardiovascular risk factors for dementia. We characterized the cerebrovascular proteome of TGF mice using mass spectrometry (MS)-based quantitative proteomics. Cerebral arteries were surgically removed from 6-month-old-TGF and wild-type mice, and proteins were extracted and analyzed by gel-free nanoLC-MS/MS. We identified 3602 proteins in brain vessels, with 20 demonstrating significantly altered levels in TGF mice. For total and/or differentially expressed proteins (p? 0.01, ? 2-fold change), using multiple databases, we (a) performed protein characterization, (b) demonstrated the presence of their RNA transcripts in both mouse and human cerebrovascular cells, and (c) demonstrated that several of these proteins were present in human extracellular vesicles (EVs) circulating in blood. Finally, using human plasma, we demonstrated the presence of several of these proteins in plasma and plasma EVs. Dysregulated proteins point to perturbed brain vessel vasomotricity, remodeling, and inflammation. Given that blood-isolated EVs are novel, attractive, and a minimally invasive biomarker discovery platform for age-related dementias, several proteins identified in this study can potentially serve as VCID markers in humans.",4.59E-42

In addition, research hotspots and fronts were examined.A total of 1,350 publications with 59,818 citations were identified. The number of publications and citations presented a significant rising trend since 2013. The United States was the leading country with an overwhelming number of publications (775) and citations (42,237).

The research fronts are (1) looking for genetic similarities between AD and other neurological diseases and syndromes, and (2) searching for causal variants of AD. These hotspots suggest noteworthy directions for future studies on AD pathogenesis and genetics, in which basic research regarding immunity is promising for clinical conversion. The current under-researched directions are (1) GWAS in AD biomarkers based on large sample sizes, (2) studies of causal variants of AD, and (3) GWAS in AD based on non-European populations, which need to be strengthened in the future.Copyright © 2023 Zhang, Wang, Zhang and Yao.",4.43E-42
,38037805,WGBS of embryonic gonads revealed that long non-coding RNAs in the MHM region might be involved in cell autonomous sex identity and female gonadal development in chickens.,Epigenetics,"DNA methylation plays a key role in sex determination and differentiation in vertebrates. However, there are few studies on DNA methylation involved in chicken gonad development, and most focused on male hypermethylated regions (MHM). It is unclear whether there are specific differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in chicken embryonic gonads regulating sex determination and differentiation. Here, the DNA methylation maps showed that the difference of DNA methylation level between sexes was much higher at embryonic day 10 (E10) than that at embryonic day 6 (E6), and the significant differentially methylated regions at both stages were mainly distributed on the Z chromosome, including MHM1 and MHM2. The results of bisulphite sequencing PCR (BSP) and qRT-PCR showed hypomethylation of female MHM and upregulation of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) whose promoter in the MHM region was consistent with the sequencing results, and similar results were in brain and muscle. In female sex-reversed gonads, the methylation pattern of MHM remained unchanged, and the expression levels of the three candidate lncRNAs were significantly decreased compared with those in females, but were significantly increased compared to males. The fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) results also showed that these lncRNAs were highly expressed in female embryonic gonads. The results of methyltransferase inhibitor and dual-luciferase reporter assay suggest that lncRNA expression may be regulated by DNA methylation within their promoters. Therefore, we speculated that MHM may be involved in cell-autonomous sex identity in chickens, and that lncRNAs regulated by MHM may be involved in female sexual differentiation.",4.05E-42

The enormous diversity and intricate organization of cells have impeded our understanding of the molecular and cellular basis of brain function. Recent advances in spatially resolved single-cell transcriptomics have enabled systematic mapping of the spatial organization of molecularly defined cell types in complex tissues1-3, including several brain regions (for example, refs.1-11). However, a comprehensive cell atlas of the whole brain is still missing. Here we imaged a panel of more than 1,100 genes in approximately 10 million cells across the entire adult mouse brains using multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization12and performed spatially resolved, single-cell expression profiling at the whole-transcriptome scale by integrating multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization and single-cell RNA sequencing data. Using this approach, we generated a comprehensive cell atlas of more than 5,000 transcriptionally distinct cell clusters, belonging to more than 300 major cell types, in the whole mouse brain with high molecular and spatial resolution. Registration of this atlas to the mouse brain common coordinate framework allowed systematic quantifications of the cell-type composition and organization in individual brain regions. We further identified spatial modules characterized by distinct cell-type compositions and spatial gradients featuring gradual changes of cells. Finally, this high-resolution spatial map of cells, each with a transcriptome-wide expression profile, allowed us to infer cell-type-specific interactions between hundreds of cell-type pairs and predict molecular (ligand-receptor) basis and functional implications of these cell-cell interactions. These results provide rich insights into the molecular and cellular architecture of the brain and a foundation for functional investigations of neural circuits and their dysfunction in health and disease.© 2023.

However, detailed genome-wide identification and expression analyses ofOMTgene family members have not been performed in melons. In this study, we aimed to perform the genome-wide identification ofOMTgene family members in melon to identify and clarify their actions during stress.Genome-wide identification ofOMTgene family members was performed using data from the melon genome database. TheCucumis meloOMT genes (CmOMTs)were then compared with the genes from two representative monocotyledons and three representative dicotyledons. The basic information,cis-regulatory elements in the promoter, predicted 3-D-structures, and GO enrichment results of the 21CmOMTswere analyzed.In our study, 21CmOMTs(namedCmOMT1-21) were obtained by analyzing the melon genome. These genes were located on six chromosomes and divided into three groups composed of nine, six, and sixCmOMTsbased on phylogenetic analysis. Gene structure and motif descriptions were similar within the same classes. EachCmOMTgene contains at least onecis-acting element associated with hormone transport regulation. Analysis ofcis-acting elements illustrated the potential role ofCmOMTsin developmental regulation and adaptations to various abiotic and biotic stresses. The RNA-seq and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) results indicated that NaCl stress significantly inducedCmOMT6/9/14/18and chilling and high temperature and humidity (HTH) stresses significantly upregulatedCmOMT14/18. Furthermore, the expression pattern ofCmOMT18may be associated withFusarium oxysporumf. sp.melonisrace 1.2 (FOM1.2) and powdery mildew resistance. Our study tentatively explored the biological functions ofCmOMTgenes in various stress regulation pathways and provided a conceptual basis for further detailed studies of the molecular mechanisms.©2023 Wang et al.",1.93E-42
,38153590,Regulation potential of transcribed simple repeated sequences in developing neurons.,Hum Genet,"Simple repeated sequences (SRSs), defined as tandem iterations of microsatellite- to satellite-sized DNA units, occupy a substantial part of the human genome. Some of these elements are known to be transcribed in the context of repeat expansion disorders. Mounting evidence suggests that the transcription of SRSs may also contribute to normal cellular functions. Here, we used genome-wide bioinformatics approaches to systematically examine SRS transcriptional activity in cells undergoing neuronal differentiation. We identified thousands of long noncoding RNAs containing >200-nucleotide-long SRSs (SRS-lncRNAs), with hundreds of these transcripts significantly upregulated in the neural lineage. We show that SRS-lncRNAs often originate from telomere-proximal regions and that they have a strong potential to form multivalent contacts with a wide range of RNA-binding proteins. Our analyses also uncovered a cluster of neurally upregulated SRS-lncRNAs encoded in a centromere-proximal part of chromosome 9, which underwent an evolutionarily recent segmental duplication. Using a newly established in vitro system for rapid neuronal differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells, we demonstrate that at least some of the bioinformatically predicted SRS-lncRNAs, including those encoded in the segmentally duplicated part of chromosome 9, indeed increase their expression in developing neurons to readily detectable levels. These and other lines of evidence suggest that many SRSs may be expressed in a cell type and developmental stage-specific manner, providing a valuable resource for further studies focused on the functional consequences of SRS-lncRNAs in the normal development of the human brain, as well as in the context of neurodevelopmental disorders.© 2023.

,37969738,The F-box-only protein 44 regulates pregnane X receptor protein level by ubiquitination and degradation.,Acta Pharm Sin B,"Pregnane X receptor (PXR) is a ligand-activated nuclear receptor that transcriptionally upregulates drug-metabolizing enzymes [e.g., cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4)] and transporters. Although the regulation of PXR target genes is well-characterized, less is known about the regulation of PXR protein level. By screening an RNAi library, we identified the F-box-only protein 44 (FBXO44) as a novel E3 ligase for PXR. PXR abundance increases upon knockdown of FBXO44, and, inversely, decreases upon overexpression of FBXO44. Further analysis revealed that FBXO44 interacts with PXR, leading to its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, and we determined that the F-box associated domain of FBXO44 and the ligand binding domain of PXR are required for the functional interaction. In summary, FBXO44 regulates PXR protein abundance, which has downstream consequences forCYP3A4levels and drug-drug interactions. The results of this study provide new insight into the molecular mechanisms that regulate PXR protein level and activity and suggest the importance of considering how modulating E3 ubiquitin ligase activities will affect PXR-mediated drug metabolism.© 2023 Chinese Pharmaceutical Association and Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.

Here, we used whole-genome sequencing to track hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from six patients with SCD at pre- and post-GT time points to map the somatic mutation and clonal landscape of gene-modified and unmodified HSCs. Pre-GT, phylogenetic trees were highly polyclonal and mutation burdens per cell were elevated in some, but not all, patients. Post-GT, no clonal expansions were identified among gene-modified or unmodified cells; however, an increased frequency of potential driver mutations associated with myeloid neoplasms or clonal hematopoiesis (DNMT3A- and EZH2-mutated clones in particular) was observed in both genetically modified and unmodified cells, suggesting positive selection of mutant clones during GT. This work sheds light on HSC clonal dynamics and the mutational landscape after GT in SCD, highlighting the enhanced fitness of some HSCs harboring pre-existing driver mutations. Future studies should define the long-term fate of mutant clones, including any contribution to expansions associated with myeloid neoplasms.© 2023. The Author(s).",1.47E-42

Here we report a comprehensive and high-resolution transcriptomic and spatial cell-type atlas for the whole adult mouse brain. The cell-type atlas was created by combining a single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) dataset of around 7 million cells profiled (approximately 4.0 million cells passing quality control), and a spatial transcriptomic dataset of approximately 4.3 million cells using multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH). The atlas is hierarchically organized into 4 nested levels of classification: 34 classes, 338 subclasses, 1,201 supertypes and 5,322 clusters. We present an online platform, Allen Brain Cell Atlas, to visualize the mouse whole-brain cell-type atlas along with the single-cell RNA-sequencing and MERFISH datasets. We systematically analysed the neuronal and non-neuronal cell types across the brain and identified a high degree of correspondence between transcriptomic identity and spatial specificity for each cell type. The results reveal unique features of cell-type organization in different brain regions-in particular, a dichotomy between the dorsal and ventral parts of the brain. The dorsal part contains relatively fewer yet highly divergent neuronal types, whereas the ventral part contains more numerous neuronal types that are more closely related to each other. Our study also uncovered extraordinary diversity and heterogeneity in neurotransmitter and neuropeptide expression and co-expression patterns in different cell types. Finally, we found that transcription factors are major determinants of cell-type classification and identified a combinatorial transcription factor code that defines cell types across all parts of the brain. The whole mouse brain transcriptomic and spatial cell-type atlas establishes a benchmark reference atlas and a foundational resource for integrative investigations of cellular and circuit function, development and evolution of the mammalian brain.© 2023.

,38002955,Small RNA Sequencing Reveals a Distinct MicroRNA Signature between Glucocorticoid Responder and Glucocorticoid Non-Responder Primary Human Trabecular Meshwork Cells after Dexamethasone Treatment.,Genes (Basel),"Glucocorticoids (GCs) are known to regulate several physiological processes and are the mainstay in the management of inflammatory eye diseases. The long-term use of GC causes raised intraocular pressure (IOP) or ocular hypertension (OHT) in about 30-50% of the susceptible individuals depending on the route of administration, and can lead to steroid-induced secondary glaucoma. The present study aims to understand the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in differential glucocorticoid (GC) responsiveness in human trabecular meshwork (HTM) cells using small RNA sequencing. The human organ-cultured anterior segment (HOCAS) model was used to identify whether donor eyes were from GC-responders (GC-R;n= 4) or GC-non-responders (GC-NR;n= 4) following treatment with either 100 nM dexamethasone (DEX) or ethanol (ETH) for 7 days. The total RNA was extracted from cultured HTM cells with known GC responsiveness, and the differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMIRs) were compared among the following five groups: Group #1: ETH vs. DEX-treated GC-R; #2: ETH vs. DEX-treated GC-NR; #3: overlapping DEGs between Group #1 and #2; #4: Unique DEMIRs of GC-R; #5: Unique DEMIRs of GC-NR; and validated by RT-qPCR. There were 13 and 21 DEMIRs identified in Group #1 and Group #2, respectively. Seven miRNAs were common miRNAs dysregulated in both GC-R and GC-NR (Group #3). This analysis allowed the identification of DEMIRs that were unique to GC-R (6 miRNAs) and GC-NR (14 miRNAs) HTM cells, respectively. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis identified enriched pathways and biological processes associated with differential GC responsiveness in HTM cells. This is the first study to reveal a unique miRNA signature between GC-R and GC-NR HTM cells, which raises the possibility of developing new molecular targets for the management of steroid-OHT/glaucoma.",1.18E-42
,38010205,Bidirectional interplay between metabolism andÂ epigenetics in hematopoietic stem cells andÂ leukemia.,EMBO J,"During the last decades, remarkable progress has been made in further understanding the complex molecular regulatory networks that maintain hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) function. Cellular and organismal metabolisms have been shown to directly instruct epigenetic alterations, and thereby dictate stem cell fate, in the bone marrow. Epigenetic regulatory enzymes are dependent on the availability of metabolites to facilitate DNA- and histone-modifying reactions. The metabolic and epigenetic features of HSCs and their downstream progenitors can be significantly altered by environmental perturbations, dietary habits, and hematological diseases. Therefore, understanding metabolic and epigenetic mechanisms that regulate healthy HSCs can contribute to the discovery of novel metabolic therapeutic targets that specifically eliminate leukemia stem cells while sparing healthy HSCs. Here, we provide an in-depth review of the metabolic and epigenetic interplay regulating hematopoietic stem cell fate. We discuss the influence of metabolic stress stimuli, as well as alterations occurring during leukemic development. Additionally, we highlight recent therapeutic advancements toward eradicating acute myeloid leukemia cells by intervening in metabolic and epigenetic pathways.© 2023 The Authors.

Mechanistic studies and therapeutic development on SFT/HPC are impeded by scarcity and lack of system models. In this study, we established and characterized a novel SFT/HPC patient-derived cell line (PDC), SFT-S1, and screened for potential drug candidates that could be repurposed for the treatment of SFT/HPC. Immunohistochemistry profiles of the PDC was consistent with the patient's tumor sample (CD99+/CD34+/desmin-). RNA sequencing, followed by Sanger sequencing confirmed the pathognomonic NAB2exon3-STAT6exon18 fusion in both the PDC and the original tumor. Transcriptomic data showed strong enrichment for oncogenic pathways (epithelial-mesenchymal transition, FGF, EGR1 and TGF? signaling pathways) in the tumor. Whole genome sequencing identified potentially pathogenic somatic variants such as MAGEA10 and ABCA2. Among a panel of 14 targeted agents screened, dasatinib was identified to be the most potent small molecule inhibitor against the PDC (IC50, 473 nM), followed by osimertinib (IC50, 730 nM) and sunitinib (IC50, 1765 nM). Methylation profiling of the tumor suggests that this specific variant of SFT/HPC could lead to genome-wide hypomethylation. In conclusion, we established a novel PDC model of SFT/HPC with comprehensive characterization of its genomic, epigenomic and transcriptomic landscape, which can facilitate future preclinical studies of SFT/HPC, such as in vitro drug screening and in vivo drug testing.© 2023.

To identify potential genetic indicators for disease resilience that can be measured on selection candidates, we focused on the blood transcriptome of 1594 young healthy pigs with subsequent records on disease resilience.

Genes with heritable expression levels were spread across chromosomes, but were enriched in the swine leukocyte antigen region (average estimate?>?0.2). The correlation of heritability estimates with the corresponding estimates obtained for genes expressed in human blood was weak but a sizable number of genes with heritable expression levels overlapped. Genes with heritable expression levels were significantly enriched for biological processes such as cell activation, immune system process, stress response, and leukocyte activation, and were involved in various disease annotations such as RNA virus infection, including SARS-Cov2, as well as liver disease, and inflammation. To estimate genetic correlations with disease resilience, 3205 genotyped pigs, including the 1594 pigs with transcriptome data, were evaluated for disease resilience following their exposure to a natural polymicrobial disease challenge. Significant genetic correlations (p?<?0.05) were observed with all resilience phenotypes, although few exceeded expected false discovery rates. Enrichment analysis of genes ranked by estimates of genetic correlations with resilience phenotypes revealed significance for biological processes such as regulation of cytokines, including interleukins and interferons, and chaperone mediated protein folding.These results suggest that expression levels in the blood of young healthy pigs for genes in biological pathways related to immunity and endoplasmic reticulum stress have potential to be used as genetic indicator traits to select for disease resilience.© 2023.

,37948433,A novel f-divergence based generative adversarial imputation method for scRNA-seq data analysis.,PLoS One,"Comprehensive analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data can enhance our understanding of cellular diversity and aid in the development of personalized therapies for individuals. The abundance of missing values, known as dropouts, makes the analysis of scRNA-seq data a challenging task. Most traditional methods made assumptions about specific distributions for missing values, which limit their capability to capture the intricacy of high-dimensional scRNA-seq data. Moreover, the imputation performance of traditional methods decreases with higher missing rates. We propose a novel f-divergence based generative adversarial imputation method, called sc-fGAIN, for the scRNA-seq data imputation. Our studies identify four f-divergence functions, namely cross-entropy, Kullback-Leibler (KL), reverse KL, and Jensen-Shannon, that can be effectively integrated with the generative adversarial imputation network to generate imputed values without any assumptions, and mathematically prove that the distribution of imputed data using sc-fGAIN algorithm is same as the distribution of original data. Real scRNA-seq data analysis has shown that, compared to many traditional methods, the imputed values generated by sc-fGAIN algorithm have a smaller root-mean-square error, and it is robust to varying missing rates, moreover, it can reduce imputation variability. The flexibility offered by the f-divergence allows the sc-fGAIN method to accommodate various types of data, making it a more universal approach for imputing missing values of scRNA-seq data.Copyright: © 2023 Si et al.

,37946251,Structural and non-coding variants increase the diagnostic yield of clinical whole genome sequencing for rare diseases.,Genome Med,"Whole genome sequencing is increasingly being used for the diagnosis of patients with rare diseases. However, the diagnostic yields of many studies, particularly those conducted in a healthcare setting, are often disappointingly low, at 25-30%. This is in part because although entire genomes are sequenced, analysis is often confined to in silico gene panels or coding regions of the genome.We undertook WGS on a cohort of 122 unrelated rare disease patients and their relatives (300 genomes) who had been pre-screened by gene panels or arrays. Patients were recruited from a broad spectrum of clinical specialties. We applied a bioinformatics pipeline that would allow comprehensive analysis of all variant types. We combined established bioinformatics tools for phenotypic and genomic analysis with our novel algorithms (SVRare, ALTSPLICE and GREEN-DB) to detect and annotate structural, splice site and non-coding variants.Our diagnostic yield was 43/122 cases (35%), although 47/122 cases (39%) were considered solved when considering novel candidate genes with supporting functional data into account. Structural, splice site and deep intronic variants contributed to 20/47 (43%) of our solved cases. Five genes that are novel, or were novel at the time of discovery, were identified, whilst a further three genes are putative novel disease genes with evidence of causality. We identified variants of uncertain significance in a further fourteen candidate genes. The phenotypic spectrum associated with RMND1 was expanded to include polymicrogyria. Two patients with secondary findings in FBN1 and KCNQ1 were confirmed to have previously unidentified Marfan and long QT syndromes, respectively, and were referred for further clinical interventions. Clinical diagnoses were changed in six patients and treatment adjustments made for eight individuals, which for five patients was considered life-saving.Genome sequencing is increasingly being considered as a first-line genetic test in routine clinical settings and can make a substantial contribution to rapidly identifying a causal aetiology for many patients, shortening their diagnostic odyssey. We have demonstrated that structural, splice site and intronic variants make a significant contribution to diagnostic yield and that comprehensive analysis of the entire genome is essential to maximise the value of clinical genome sequencing.© 2023.

,38086852,Nuclear cGAS restricts L1 retrotransposition by promoting TRIM41-mediated ORF2p ubiquitination and degradation.,Nat Commun,"Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), initially identified as a cytosolic DNA sensor, detects DNA fragments to trigger an innate immune response. Recently, accumulating evidence reveals the presence of cGAS within the nucleus. However, the biological functions of nuclear cGAS are not fully understood. Here, we demonstrate that nuclear cGAS represses LINE-1 (L1) retrotransposition to preserve genome integrity in human cells. Mechanistically, the E3 ligase TRIM41 interacts with and ubiquitinates ORF2p to influence its stability, and cGAS enhances the association of ORF2p with TRIM41, thereby promoting TRIM41-mediated ORF2p degradation and the suppression of L1 retrotransposition. In response to DNA damage, cGAS is phosphorylated at serine residues 120 and 305 by CHK2, which promotes cGAS-TRIM41 association, facilitating TRIM41-mediated ORF2p degradation. Moreover, we show that nuclear cGAS mediates the repression of L1 retrotransposition in senescent cells induced by DNA damage agents. We also identify several cancer-associated cGAS mutations that abolish the suppressive effect on L1 retrotransposition by disrupting the CHK2-cGAS-TRIM41-ORF2p regulatory axis. Together, these findings indicate that nuclear cGAS exhibits an inhibitory function in L1 retrotransposition which could provide avenues for future interventions in both aging and tumorigenesis.© 2023.

,37973910,"A toolbox of astrocyte-specific, serotype-independent adeno-associated viral vectors using microRNA targeting sequences.",Nat Commun,"Astrocytes, one of the most prevalent cell types in the central nervous system (CNS), are critically involved in neural function. Genetically manipulating astrocytes is an essential tool in understanding and affecting their roles. Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) enable rapid genetic manipulation; however, astrocyte specificity of AAVs can be limited, with high off-target expression in neurons and sparsely in endothelial cells. Here, we report the development of a cassette of four copies of six miRNA targeting sequences (4x6T) which triggers transgene degradation specifically in neurons and endothelial cells. In combination with the GfaABC1D promoter, 4x6T increases astrocytic specificity of Cre with a viral reporter from <50% to >99% in multiple serotypes in mice, and confers astrocyte specificity in multiple recombinases and reporters. We also present empty vectors to add 4x6T to other cargo, independently and in Cre/Dre-dependent forms. This toolbox of AAVs allows rapid manipulation of astrocytes throughout the CNS, is compatible with different AAV serotypes, and demonstrates the efficacy of using multiplexed miRNA targeting sequences to decrease expression in multiple off-target cell populations simultaneously.© 2023.

,38014295,Cardiac Molecular Analysis Reveals Aging-Associated Metabolic Alterations Promoting Glycosaminoglycans Accumulation Via Hexosamine Biosynthetic Pathway.,bioRxiv,"Age is a prominent risk factor for cardiometabolic disease, and often leads to heart structural and functional changes. However, precise molecular mechanisms underlying cardiac remodeling and dysfunction resulting from physiological aging per se remain elusive. Understanding these mechanisms requires biological models with optimal translation to humans. Previous research demonstrated that baboons undergo age-related reduction in ejection fraction and increased heart sphericity, mirroring changes observed in humans. The goal of this study was to identify early cardiac molecular alterations that precede functional adaptations, shedding light on the regulation of age-associated changes. We performed unbiased transcriptomics of left ventricle (LV) samples from female baboons aged 7.5-22.1 years (human equivalent ~30-88 years). Weighted-gene correlation network and pathway enrichment analyses were performed to identify potential age-associated mechanisms in LV, with histological validation. Myocardial modules of transcripts negatively associated with age were primarily enriched for cardiac metabolism, including oxidative phosphorylation, tricarboxylic acid cycle, glycolysis, and fatty-acid ?-oxidation. Transcripts positively correlated with age suggest upregulation of glucose uptake, pentose phosphate pathway, and hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP), indicating a metabolic shift towards glucose-dependent anabolic pathways. Upregulation of HBP commonly results in increased glycosaminoglycan precursor synthesis. Transcripts involved in glycosaminoglycan synthesis, modification, and intermediate metabolism were also upregulated in older animals, while glycosaminoglycan degradation transcripts were downregulated with age. These alterations would promote glycosaminoglycan accumulation, which was verified histologically. Upregulation of extracellular matrix (ECM)-induced signaling pathways temporally coincided with glycosaminoglycan accumulation. We found a subsequent upregulation of cardiac hypertrophy-related pathways and an increase in cardiomyocyte width. Overall, our findings revealed a transcriptional shift in metabolism from catabolic to anabolic pathways that leads to ECM glycosaminoglycan accumulation through HBP prior to upregulation of transcripts of cardiac hypertrophy-related pathways. This study illuminates cellular mechanisms that precede development of cardiac hypertrophy, providing novel potential targets to remediate age-related cardiac diseases.",1.48E-43
,38082340,Current status and challenges of breast cancer prevention~DNA methylation would lead to groundbreaking progress in breast cancer prevention~.,Genes Environ,"The number of breast cancer patients is increasing worldwide. Furthermore, breast cancer often develops in young people, even those only in their 30s, who play a central role in their families and society. Results from many cohort studies suggest that dietary factors, alcohol consumption, lack of physical activity, obesity, nulliparity, breastfeeding, oral contraceptive use, fertility treatment and hormone replacement therapy are risk factors for breast cancer. However, the effects of lifestyle habits on the human body are complexly intertwined with various factors, and the effects vary from person to person depending on their constitution, etc., so there is no basis for this. Therefore, primary prevention of breast cancer is still not being implemented appropriately and efficiently. Furthermore, advances in genomic technology make it possible to assess the risk of developing breast cancer in some individuals. As a result, the establishment of breast cancer prevention methods has become a health priority for high-risk individuals.Drugs such as tamoxifen and raloxifene are known to prevent the development of breast cancer, based on the results of multiple randomized controlled trials, but there are concerns regarding the side effects of these powerful agents. In addition, several clinical studies have shown that prophylactic mastectomy for women who have BRCA mutations or who are identified as being at high risk reduces the incidence of breast cancer development. However, many issues, such as changes in long-term quality of life after preventive surgery, the optimal timing of surgery and the identification of women who are at high risk but will not develop breast cancer, remain uncertain. In other words, although many researchers have focused on chemoprevention and surgical prevention and clear preventive effects of these strategies have been confirmed, it cannot be said that they are widely accepted. Therefore, the current evidence for chemoprevention and surgical prevention, as well as highlights of several interesting lines of research currently underway, are summarized in this article.© 2023.

We investigated age-dependent LDR effects using adaptive response experiments in young (7-to 12-week-old) and middle-aged (40-to 62-week-old) C57BL/6 mice. Compared with 3?Gy irradiation, 0.02?Gy preirradiation followed by 3?Gy irradiation prolonged life in young mice but not middle-aged mice. Preirradiation also suppressed irradiation-induced 53BP1 repair foci in the small intestines, splenic apoptosis, and p53 activity in young mice but not middle-aged mice. Young p53+/-C57BL/6 mice did not show these adaptive responses, indicating that insufficient p53 function in young mice mitigated the adaptive responses. Interestingly, p53 activation in middle-aged mice spontaneously became approximately 4.5-fold greater than that in young mice, possibly masking LDR stresses. Furthermore, adaptive responses in young mice, but not in middle-aged mice, suppressed some senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) factors (IL-6, CCL2, CCL5, CXCL1). Thus, LDR-induced adaptive responses associated with specific SASP factors may be attenuated by a combination of reduced DNA damage sensor/transducer function and chronic p53 activation in middle-aged mice.© 2023.

,38129834,Selection on the promoter regions plays an important role in complex traits during duck domestication.,BMC Biol,"Identifying the key factors that underlie complex traits during domestication is a great challenge for evolutionary and biological studies. In addition to the protein-coding region differences caused by variants, a large number of variants are located in the noncoding regions containing multiple types of regulatory elements. However, the roles of accumulated variants in gene regulatory elements during duck domestication and economic trait improvement are poorly understood.We constructed a genomics, transcriptomics, and epigenomics map of the duck genome and assessed the evolutionary forces that have been in play across the whole genome during domestication. In total, 304 (42.94%) gene promoters have been specifically selected in Pekin duck among all selected genes. Joint multi-omics analysis reveals that 218 genes (72.01%) with selected promoters are located in open and active chromatin, and 267 genes (87.83%) with selected promoters were highly and differentially expressed in domestic trait-related tissues. One important candidate gene ELOVL3, with a strong signature of differentiation on the core promoter region, is known to regulate fatty acid elongation. Functional experiments showed that the nearly fixed variants in the top selected ELOVL3 promoter in Pekin duck decreased binding ability with HLF and increased gene expression, with the overexpression of ELOVL3 able to increase lipid deposition and unsaturated fatty acid enrichment.This study presents genome resequencing, RNA-Seq, Hi-C, and ATAC-Seq data of mallard and Pekin duck, showing that selection of the gene promoter region plays an important role in gene expression and phenotypic changes during domestication and highlights that the variants of the ELOVL3 promoter may have multiple effects on fat and long-chain fatty acid content in ducks.© 2023.

However, to date, no safe, effective and appropriate treatment modalities are available. In recent years, ferroptosis has emerged as a significant mode of cell death and has been found to play a key regulatory role in the development of NAFLD. In this study, we found that arbutin (ARB), a natural antioxidant derived from Arctostaphylos uva-ursi (L.), inhibits the onset of ferroptosis and ameliorates high-fat diet-induced NAFLD in vivo and in vitro. Using reverse docking, we identified the demethylase fat mass and obesity-related protein (FTO) as a potential target of ARB. Subsequent mechanistic studies revealed that ARB plays a role in controlling methylation of the SLC7A11 gene through inhibition of FTO. In addition, we demonstrated that SLC7A11 could alleviate the development of NAFLD in vivo and in vitro. Our findings identify the FTO/SLC7A11 axis as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of NAFLD. Specifically, we show that ARB alleviates NAFLD by acting on the FTO/SLC7A11 pathway to inhibit ferroptosis.Copyright © 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",8.45E-44

The optic nerve, in particular, lacks the capacity to spontaneously regenerate, requiring the development of an effective approach for optic nerve repair, which has proven challenging. Here, we demonstrate that a combination of the small molecules 3BDO and trichostatin A (TSA)-which regulate mTOR and HDAC, respectively-packaged in thermosensitive hydrogel for 4-week-sustained release after intravitreal injection, effectively induced optic nerve regeneration in a mouse model of optic nerve crush injury. Moreover, this combination of 3BDO and TSA also protected axon projections and improved visual responses in an old mouse model (11 months old) of glaucoma. Taken together, our data provide a new, local small molecule-based treatment for the effective induction of optic nerve repair, which may represent a foundation for the development of pharmacological methods to treat irreversible eye diseases.© 2023.

,37981682,Cellular reprogramming is driven by widespread rewiring of promoter-enhancer interactions.,BMC Biol,"Long-range interactions between promoters and cis-regulatory elements, such as enhancers, play critical roles in gene regulation. However, the role of three-dimensional (3D) chromatin structure in orchestrating changes in transcriptional regulation during direct cell reprogramming is not fully understood.Here, we performed integrated analyses of chromosomal architecture, epigenetics, and gene expression using Hi-C, promoter Capture Hi-C (PCHi-C), ChIP-seq, and RNA-seq during trans-differentiation of Pre-B cells into macrophages with a ?-estradiol inducible C/EBP?ER transgene. Within 1h of ?-estradiol induction, C/EBP? translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, binding to thousands of promoters and putative regulatory elements, resulting in the downregulation of Pre-B cell-specific genes and induction of macrophage-specific genes. Hi-C results were remarkably consistent throughout trans-differentiation, revealing only a small number of TAD boundary location changes, and A/B compartment switches despite significant changes in the expression of thousands of genes. PCHi-C revealed widespread changes in promoter-anchored loops with decreased interactions in parallel with decreased gene expression, and new and increased promoter-anchored interactions in parallel with increased expression of macrophage-specific genes.Overall, our data demonstrate that C/EBP?-induced trans-differentiation involves few changes in genome architecture at the level of TADs and A/B compartments, in contrast with widespread reorganization of thousands of promoter-anchored loops in association with changes in gene expression and cell identity.© 2023.

Disruption of such homeostasis leads to HF disorders, such as alopecia, pigment loss, and hair aging, which is causing severe health problems and aesthetic concerns. Among these disorders, hair aging is characterized by hair graying, hair loss, hair follicle miniaturization (HFM), and structural changes to the hair shaft. Hair aging occurs under physiological conditions, while premature hair aging is often associated with certain pathological conditions. Numerous investigations have been made to determine the mechanisms and explore treatments to prevent hair aging. The most well-known hypotheses about hair aging include oxidative stress, hormonal disorders, inflammation, as well as DNA damage and repair defects. Ultimately, these factors pose threats to HF cells, especially stem cells such as hair follicle stem cells, melanocyte stem cells, and mesenchymal stem cells, which hamper hair regeneration and pigmentation.

Naturally, genome accessibility and gene expression are interlinked. To understand the variability in genomic feature activation in the GABAergic neurons of different spatial origins, we have mapped accessible chromatin regions and mRNA expression in single cells derived from the developing mouse central nervous system (CNS). We first defined a reference set of open chromatin regions for scATAC-seq read quantitation across samples, allowing comparison of chromatin accessibility between brain regions and cell types directly. Second, we integrated the scATAC-seq and scRNA-seq data to form a unified resource of transcriptome and chromatin accessibility landscape for the cell types in di- and telencephalon, midbrain and anterior hindbrain of E14.5 mouse embryo. Importantly, we implemented resolution optimization at the clustering, and automatized the cell typing step. We show high level of concordance between the cell clustering based on the chromatin accessibility and the transcriptome in analyzed neuronal lineages, indicating that both genome and transcriptome features can be used for cell type definition. Hierarchical clustering by the similarity in accessible chromatin reveals that the genomic feature activation correlates with neurotransmitter phenotype, selector gene expression, cell differentiation stage and neuromere origins.© 2023.

Recent whole genome sequencing from individuals with autism has shown that manyde novomutations also occur in untranslated regions (UTRs) of genes, but it is difficult to predict from sequence alone which mutations are functional, let alone causal. Therefore, we developed a high throughput assay to screen the transcriptional and translational effects of 997 variants from 5'UTR patient mutations. This assay successfully enriched for elements that alter reporter translation, identifying over 100 potentially functional mutations from probands. Studies in patient-derived cell lines further confirmed that these mutations can alter protein production in individuals with autism, and some variants fall in genes known to cause syndromic forms of autism, suggesting a diagnosis for these individual patients. Since UTR function varies by cell type, we further optimized this high throughput assay to enable assessment of mutations in neuronsin vivo. First, comparingin cellulotoin vivoresults, we demonstrate neurons have different principles of regulation by 5'UTRs, consistent with a more robust mechanism for reducing the impact of RNA secondary structure.

A vector space model type data transformation technique was designed to build consistently homogeneous new datasets containing, as predictive features, calls for somatic point mutations and copy number variations at chromosome arm-level, thus allowing the use of the XGBoost classifier models. Considering the imbalance in the dataset, due to large difference in the number of cases for each tumor, two preprocessing strategies were considered: i) setting a percentage cut-off threshold to remove less represented cancer types, ii) dividing cancer types into different groups based on biological criteria and training a specific XGBoost model for each of them. The performance of all trained models was mainly assessed by the out-of-sample balanced accuracy (BACC) and the AUC scores.The XGBoost classifier achieved the best performance (BACC 77%; AUC 97%) on a dataset containing the 10 most represented tumor types. Moreover, dividing the 18 most represented cancers into three different groups (endocrine-related carcinomas, other carcinomas and other cancers),such analysis models achieved 78%, 71% and 86% BACC, respectively, with AUC scores greater than 96%. In addition, the model capable of linking each group to a specific cancer type reached 81% BACC and 94% AUC. Overall, the diagnostic potential of our model was comparable/higher with respect to others already described in literature and based on similar molecular data and ML approaches.A boosted ML approach able to accurately discriminate different cancer types was developed. The methodology builds datasets simpler and more interpretable than the original data, while keeping enough information to accurately train standard ML models without resorting to sophisticated Deep Learning architectures. In combination with histopathological examinations, this approach could improve cancer diagnosis by using specific DNA alterations, processed by a replicable and easy-to-use automated technology. The study encourages new investigations which could further increase the classifier's performance, for example by considering more features and dividing tumors into their main molecular subtypes.© 2023.

Because of the low incidence of these diseases, there have been few therapeutic novelties developed over time. Nevertheless, this fact is changing presently as epigenetic modifiers have been shown to be recurrently mutated in some types of PTCLs, especially in the cases of PTCLs not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS), T follicular helper (TFH), and angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL). These have brought about more insight into PTCL biology, especially in the case of PTCLs arising from TFH lymphocytes. From a biological perspective, it has been observed that ten-eleven translocators (TET2) mutated T lymphocytes tend to polarize to TFH, while Tregs lose their inhibitory properties. IDH2 R172 was shown to have inhibitory effects on TET2, mimicking the effects of TET2 mutations, as well as having effects on histone methylation. DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A) loss-of-function, although it was shown to have opposite effects to TET2 from an inflammatory perspective, was also shown to increase the number of T lymphocyte progenitors. Aside from bringing about more knowledge of PTCL biology, these mutations were shown to increase the sensitivity of PTCLs to certain epigenetic therapies, like hypomethylating agents (HMAs) and histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis).

A COSA model was established by intermittently obstructing the endotracheal cannula during exhalation for 12 weeks. Left parasternal thoracotomy through the fourth intercostal space allowed for superior left ganglionated plexi (SLGP) ablation. In vivo open-chest electrophysiological programmed stimulation was performed to assess AF inducibility. Histological, transcriptomic, and proteomic analyses were conducted on atrial samples.After 12 weeks, the OSA group exhibited increased AF inducibility and longer AF durations compared to the CON group. Integrated transcriptomic and proteomic analyses identified 2422 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 1194 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) between OSA and CON groups, as well as between OSA+GP and OSA groups (1850 DEGs and 1418 DEPs). The analysis revealed that differentially regulated DEGs were primarily enriched in mitochondrial biological processes in the CON-vs.-OSA and OSA-vs.-GP comparisons. Notably, the key regulatory molecule GSTZ1 was activated in OSA and inhibited by GP ablation.These findings suggest that GSTZ1 may play a pivotal role in mitochondrial damage, triggering AF substrate formation, and increasing susceptibility to AF in the context of COSA.© 2023 Shen et al.",2.56E-44

Moreover, external validation was performed using flow cytometry and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis.Both scRNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq data revealed a positive correlation between the severity of IVDD and the AA metabolic pathway. They also revealed increased AA metabolic activity in macrophages and neutrophils, as well as enhanced intercellular communication with nucleus pulposus cells. Utilizing advanced machine learning algorithms, five hub genes (AKR1C3, ALOX5, CYP2B6, EPHX2, and PLB1) were identified, and an incipient diagnostic model was developed with an AUC of 0.961 in the training cohort and 0.72 in the validation cohort. An in-depth exploration of the functionality of these hub genes revealed their notable association with inflammatory responses and immune cell infiltration. Lastly, AH6809 was found to delay IVDD by inhibiting AKR1C3.This study offers comprehensive insights into potential biomarkers and small molecules associated with the early pathogenesis of IVDD. The identified biomarkers and the developed integrated diagnostic model hold great promise in predicting the onset of early IVDD. AH6809 was established as a therapeutic target for AKR1C3 in the treatment of IVDD, as evidenced by computer simulations and biological experiments.© 2023. The Author(s).",1.78E-44
,37986932,Secreted protein profiling of human aortic smooth muscle cells identifies vascular disease associations.,medRxiv,"Smooth muscle cells (SMCs), which make up the medial layer of arteries, are key cell types involved in cardiovascular diseases (CVD), the leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. In response to microenvironment alterations, SMCs dedifferentiate from a ""contractile"" to a ""synthetic"" phenotype characterized by an increased proliferation, migration, production of extracellular matrix (ECM) components, and decreased expression of SMC-specific contractile markers. These phenotypic changes result in vascular remodeling and contribute to the pathogenesis of CVD, including coronary artery disease (CAD), stroke, hypertension, and aortic aneurysms. Here, we aim to identify the genetic variants that regulate ECM secretion in SMCs and predict the causal proteins associated with vascular disease-related loci identified in genome-wide association studies (GWAS).Using human aortic SMCs from 123 multi-ancestry healthy heart transplant donors, we collected the serum-free media in which the cells were cultured for 24 hours and conducted Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-based proteomic analysis of the conditioned media.We measured the abundance of 270 ECM and related proteins. Next, we performed protein quantitative trait locus mapping (pQTL) and identified 20 loci associated with secreted protein abundance in SMCs. We functionally annotated these loci using a colocalization approach. This approach prioritized the genetic variant rs6739323-A at the 2p22.3 locus, which is associated with lower expression of LTBP1 in SMCs and atherosclerosis-prone areas of the aorta, and increased risk for SMC calcification. We found that LTBP1 expression is abundant in SMCs, and its expression at mRNA and protein levels was reduced in unstable and advanced atherosclerotic plaque lesions.Our results unravel the SMC proteome signature associated with vascular disorders, which may help identify potential therapeutic targets to accelerate the pathway to translation.",1.45E-44
,37961263,Sex and species associated differences in Complement-mediated immunity in Humans and Rhesus macaques.,bioRxiv,"The complement system can be viewed as a 'moderator' of innate immunity, 'instructor' of humoral immunity, and 'regulator' of adaptive immunity. While sex and aging are known to affect humoral and cellular immune systems, their impact on the complement pathway in humans and rhesus macaques, a commonly used non-human primate model system, have not been well-studied. To address this knowledge gap, we analyzed serum samples from 90 humans and 75 rhesus macaques for the abundance and activity of the complement system components. While sequences of cascade proteins were highly conserved, dramatically different levels were observed between species. Whereas the low levels detected in rhesus samples raised questions about the suitability of the test, differences in levels of complement proteins were observed in male and female humans. Levels of total and antibody-dependent deposition of C1q and C3b on a glycosylated antigen differed between human and rhesus, suggesting differential recognition of glycans. Functional differences in complement-mediated lysis of antibody-sensitized cells were observed in multiple assays and showed that human females frequently exhibited higher lytic activity than human males or rhesus macaques, which typically did not exhibit such sexual dimorphism. Other differences between species and sexes were observed in more narrow contexts-for only certain antibodies, antigens, or assays. Collectively, these results expand our knowledge of sexual dimorphism in the complement system in humans, identifying differences that appear to be absent from rhesus macaques.",1.39E-44
,37978273,TRIM3 facilitates ferroptosis in non-small cell lung cancer through promoting SLC7A11/xCT K11-linked ubiquitination and degradation.,Cell Death Differ,"Ferroptosis, a unique form of regulated necrotic cell death, is caused by excessive iron-dependent lipid peroxidation. However, the underlying mechanisms driving ferroptosis in human cancers remain elusive. In this study, we identified TRIM3, an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase, as a key regulator of ferroptosis. TRIM3 is downregulated in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), two major types of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Forced expression of TRIM3 promotes cell death by enhancing the cellular level of ROS and lipid peroxidation. Moreover, our in vivo study determined that TRIM3 overexpression diminishes the tumorigenicity of NSCLC cells, indicating that TRIM3 functions as a tumor suppressor in NSCLC. Mechanistically, TRIM3 directly interacts with SLC7A11/xCT through its NHL domain, leading to SCL7A11 K11-linked ubiquitination at K37, which promotes SLC7A11 proteasome-mediated degradation. Importantly, TRIM3 expression exhibits a negative correlation with SCL7A11 expression in clinical NSCLC samples, and low TRIM3 expression is associated with a worse prognosis. This study reveals that TRIM3 functions as a tumor suppressor that can impede the tumorigenesis of NSCLC by degrading SLC7A11, suggesting a novel therapeutic strategy against NSCLC.© 2023.

,38146368,NLRP6 controls pulmonary inflammation from cigarette smoke in a gut microbiota-dependent manner.,Front Immunol,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major health issue primarily caused by cigarette smoke (CS) and characterized by breathlessness and repeated airway inflammation. NLRP6 is a cytosolic innate receptor controlling intestinal inflammation and orchestrating the colonic host-microbial interface. However, its roles in the lungs remain largely unexplored. Using CS exposure models, our data show that airway inflammation is strongly impaired in Nlrp6-deficient mice with drastically fewer recruited neutrophils, a key cell subset in inflammation and COPD. We found that NLRP6 expression in lung epithelial cells is important to control airway and lung tissue inflammation in an inflammasome-dependent manner. Since gut-derived metabolites regulate NLRP6 inflammasome activation in intestinal epithelial cells, we investigated the link between NLRP6, CS-driven lung inflammation, and gut microbiota composition. We report that acute CS exposure alters gut microbiota in both wild-type (WT) and Nlrp6-deficient mice and that antibiotic treatment decreases CS-induced lung inflammation. In addition, gut microbiota transfer from dysbiotic Nlrp6-deficient mice to WT mice decreased airway lung inflammation in WT mice, highlighting an NLRP6-dependent gut-to-lung axis controlling pulmonary inflammation.Copyright © 2023 Nascimento, Huot-Marchand, Fanny, Straube, Le Bert, Savigny, Apetoh, Van Snick, Trovero, Chamaillard, Quesniaux, Ryffel, Gosset, Gombault, Riteau, Sokol and Couillin.",1.32E-44
,38017297,Hi-C sequencing unravels dynamic three-dimensional chromatin interactions in muntjac lineage: insights from chromosome fusions in Fea's muntjac genome.,Chromosome Res,"Eukaryotes have varying numbers and structures of characteristic chromosomes across lineages or species. The evolutionary trajectory of species may have been affected by spontaneous genome rearrangements. Chromosome fusion drastically alters karyotypes. However, the mechanisms and consequences of chromosome fusions, particularly in muntjac species, are poorly understood. Recent research-based advancements in three-dimensional (3D) genomics, particularly high-throughput chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) sequencing, have allowed for the identification of chromosome fusions and provided mechanistic insights into three muntjac species: Muntiacus muntjak, M. reevesi, and M. crinifrons. This study aimed to uncover potential genome rearrangement patterns in the threatened species Fea's muntjac (Muntiacus feae), which have not been previously examined for such characteristics. Deep Hi-C sequencing (31.42?×?coverage) was performed to reveal the 3D chromatin architecture of the Fea's muntjac genome. Patterns of repeated chromosome fusions that were potentially mediated by high-abundance transposable elements were identified. Comparative Hi-C maps demonstrated linkage homology between the sex chromosomes in Fea's muntjac and autosomes in M. reevesi, indicating that fusions may have played a crucial role in the evolution of the sex chromosomes of the lineage. The species-level dynamics of topologically associated domains (TADs) suggest that TAD organization could be altered by differential chromosome interactions owing to repeated chromosome fusions. However, research on the effect of TADs on muntjac genome evolution is insufficient. This study generated Hi-C data for the Fea's muntjac, providing a genomic resource for future investigations of the evolutionary patterns of chromatin conformation at the chromosomal level.© 2023.

,38098677,Intestinal microbiota: a new perspective on delaying aging?,Front Microbiol,"The global aging situation is severe, and the medical pressures associated with aging issues should not be underestimated. The need and feasibility of studying aging and intervening in aging have been confirmed. Aging is a complex natural physiological progression, which involves the irreversible deterioration of body cells, tissues, and organs with age, leading to enhanced risk of disease and ultimately death. The intestinal microbiota has a significant role in sustaining host dynamic balance, and the study of bidirectional communication networks such as the brain-gut axis provides important directions for human disease research. Moreover, the intestinal microbiota is intimately linked to aging. This review describes the intestinal microbiota changes in human aging and analyzes the causal controversy between gut microbiota changes and aging, which are believed to be mutually causal, mutually reinforcing, and inextricably linked. Finally, from an anti-aging perspective, this study summarizes how to achieve delayed aging by targeting the intestinal microbiota. Accordingly, the study aims to provide guidance for further research on the intestinal microbiota and aging.Copyright © 2023 Zhang, Wang, Li, Yang, Wu, Lyu and Yue.",1.18E-44
,37969391,The transcription activity of OTX2 on p16 expression is significantly blocked by methylation of CpG shore in non-promoter of lung cancer cell lines.,Transl Cancer Res,"The aberrant expression of the classical tumor suppressor genep16is a frequent event in lung cancer mainly due to the hypermethylation of its 5'-cytosine-phosphate-guanine-3' island (Cgi). However, whether methylation happens in other regions and howp16expression and function are affected are largely unknown.Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats/dCas9 (CRISPR/dCas9) technology was used for methylation editing at specific site ofp16. The effects of methylation editing were detected by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfopheny)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt (MTS), transwell migration and wound healing tests. Chromatin immnoprecipitation-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (CHIP-qPCR) was performed to explore the impact of Cgi shore methylation on the binding abilities of transcription factors (TFs) includingYY1,SP1,ZNF148andOTX2top16gene. A rescue experiment was performed to verify the regulatory effect ofOTX2onp16. The negative relationship betweenp16expression and the methylation level of Cgi shore in non-promoter region was further verified with datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) program and lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients' samples.The suppressive effect ofp16Cgi shore methylation on its expression was demonstrated in both HEK293 and A549 cells using CRISPR/dCas9-mediated specific site methylation editing. Methylation of the Cgi shore in thep16non-promoter region significantly decreased its expression and promoted cell growth and migration. The ability ofOTX2bound top16was significantly reduced by 19.35% after methylation modification. Over-expression ofOTX2in A549 cells partly reversed the inhibitory effect of methylation onp16expression by 19.04%. The verification results with TCGA and LUAD patients' samples supported that thep16Cgi shore is a key methylation regulatory region.Our findings suggested that methylation of the Cgi shore in thep16non-promoter region can hamper the transcriptional activity ofOTX2, leading to a reduction in the expression ofp16, which might contribute to the development of lung cancer.2023 Translational Cancer Research.

,37965008,Epigenetic control of plant senescence and cell death and its application in crop improvement.,Front Plant Sci,"Plant senescence is the last stage of plant development and a type of programmed cell death, occurring at a predictable time and cell. It involves the functional conversion from nutrient assimilation to nutrient remobilization, which substantially impacts plant architecture and plant biomass, crop quality, and horticultural ornamental traits. In past two decades, DNA damage was believed to be a main reason for cell senescence. Increasing evidence suggests that the alteration of epigenetic information is a contributing factor to cell senescence in organisms. In this review, we summarize the current research progresses of epigenetic and epitranscriptional mechanism involved in cell senescence of plant, at the regulatory level of DNA methylation, histone methylation and acetylation, chromatin remodeling, non-coding RNAs and RNA methylation. Furthermore, we discuss their molecular genetic manipulation and potential application in agriculture for crop improvement.

,38152401,Novel antibody competition binding assay identifies distinct serological profiles associated with protection.,Front Immunol,"Pre-erythrocytic malaria vaccines hold the promise of inducing sterile protection thereby preventing the morbidity and mortality associated withPlasmodiuminfection. The main surface antigen ofP. falciparumsporozoites, i.e., the circumsporozoite protein (CSP), has been extensively explored as a target of such vaccines with significant success in recent years. Systematic adjuvant selection, refinements of the immunization regimen, and physical properties of the antigen may all contribute to the potential of increasing the efficacy of CSP-based vaccines. Protection appears to be dependent in large part on CSP antibodies. However due to a knowledge gap related to the exact correlates of immunity, there is a critical need to improve our ability to down select candidates preclinically before entering clinical trials including with controlled human malaria infections (CHMI).We developed a novel multiplex competition assay based on well-characterized monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that target crucial epitopes across the CSP molecule. This new tool assesses both, quality and epitope-specific concentrations of vaccine-induced antibodies by measuring their equivalency with a panel of well-characterized, CSP-epitope-specific mAbs.Applying this method to RTS,S-immune sera from a CHMI trial demonstrated a quantitative epitope-specificity profile of antibody responses that can differentiate between protected vs. nonprotected individuals. Aligning vaccine efficacy with quantitation of the epitope fine specificity results of this equivalency assay reveals the importance of epitope specificity.The newly developed serological equivalence assay will inform future vaccine design and possibly even adjuvant selection. This methodology can be adapted to other antigens and disease models, when a panel of relevant mAbs exists, and could offer a unique tool for comparing and down-selecting vaccine formulations.Copyright © 2023 Bolton, MacGill, Locke, Regules and Bergmann-Leitner.",4.87E-45
,38127902,Study of molecular patterns associated with ferroptosis in Parkinson's disease and its immune signature.,PLoS One,"Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in the world. We downloaded data on Parkinson's disease and Ferroptosis-related genes from the GEO and FerrDb databases. We used WCGAN and Random Forest algorithm to screen out five Parkinson's disease ferroptosis-related hub genes. Two genes were identified for the first time as possibly playing a role in Braak staging progression. Unsupervised clustering analysis based on hub genes yielded ferroptosis isoforms, and immune infiltration analysis indicated that these isoforms are associated with immune cells and may represent different immune patterns. FRHGs scores were obtained to quantify the level of ferroptosis modifications in each individual. In addition, differences in interleukin expression were found between the two ferroptosis subtypes. The biological functions involved in the hub gene are analyzed. The ceRNA regulatory network of hub genes was mapped. The disease classification diagnosis model and risk prediction model were also constructed by applying hub genes based on logistic regression. Multiple external datasets validated the hub gene and classification diagnostic model with some accuracy. This study explored hub genes associated with ferroptosis in Parkinson's disease and their molecular patterns and immune signatures to provide new ideas for finding new targets for intervention and predictive biomarkers.Copyright: © 2023 Chen et al.

Although vascular pathologies have been reported, whether HGPS patients exhibit cardiac dysfunction and its underlying mechanism is unclear, rendering limited options for treating HGPS-related cardiomyopathy. In this study, we reported a cardiac atrophy phenotype in theLmnaG609G/G609Gmice (hereafter, HGPS mice). Using a GFP-based reporter system, we demonstrated that the efficiency of nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) declined by 50% in HGPS cardiomyocytes in vivo, due to the attenuated interaction between ?H2AX and Progerin, the causative factor of HGPS. As a result, genomic instability in cardiomyocytes led to an increase of CHK2 protein level, promoting the LKB1-AMPK? interaction and AMPK? phosphorylation, which further led to the activation of FOXO3A-mediated transcription of atrophy-related genes. Moreover, inhibiting AMPK enlarged cardiomyocyte sizes both in vitro and in vivo. Most importantly, our proof-of-concept study indicated that isoproterenol treatment significantly reduced AMPK? and FOXO3A phosphorylation in the heart, attenuated the atrophy phenotype, and extended the mean lifespan of HGPS mice by ~21%, implying that targeting cardiac atrophy may be an approach to HGPS treatment.",4.37E-45

As technologies for the generation of high-throughput multiomics data have advanced, gene regulatory network modeling has become an increasingly powerful tool in understanding coronary artery disease. This review summarizes recent and novel gene regulatory network tools for bulk tissue and single cell data, existing databases for network construction, and applications of gene regulatory networks in coronary artery disease.New gene regulatory network tools can integrate multiomics data to elucidate complex disease mechanisms at unprecedented cellular and spatial resolutions. At the same time, updates to coronary artery disease expression data in existing databases have enabled researchers to build gene regulatory networks to study novel disease mechanisms. Gene regulatory networks have proven extremely useful in understanding CAD heritability beyond what is explained by GWAS loci and in identifying mechanisms and key driver genes underlying disease onset and progression. Gene regulatory networks can holistically and comprehensively address the complex nature of coronary artery disease. In this review, we discuss key algorithmic approaches to construct gene regulatory networks and highlight state-of-the-art methods that model specific modes of gene regulation. We also explore recent applications of these tools in coronary artery disease patient data repositories to understand disease heritability and shared and distinct disease mechanisms and key driver genes across tissues, between sexes, and between species.© 2023.

,38106070,SIRPÎ± controls CD47-dependent platelet clearance in mice and humans.,bioRxiv,"Over the last decade, more data has revealed that increased surface expression of the ""don't eat me"" CD47 protein on cancer cells plays a role in immune evasion and tumor progression, with CD47 blockade emerging as a new therapy in immuno-oncology. CD47 is critical in regulating cell homeostasis and clearance, as binding of CD47 to the inhibitory receptor SIRP? can prevent phagocytosis and macrophage-mediated cell clearance. The purpose of this study was to examine the role of the CD47-SIRP? signal in platelet homeostasis and clearance. Therapeutic reagents targeting the CD47-SIRP? axis are very promising for treatment of hematologic malignancies and solid tumors, but lead to transient anemia or thrombocytopenia in a subset of patients. We found that platelet homeostatic clearance is regulated through the CD47-SIRP? axis and that therapeutic blockade to disrupt this interaction in mice and in humans has a significant impact on platelet levels. Furthermore, we identified genetic variations at theSIRPAlocus that impact platelet levels in humans such that higherSIRPAgene expression is associated with higher platelet levels.SIRPAexpression at either end of the normal range may affect clinical outcomes of treatment with anti-CD47 therapy.",4.15E-45
,37938770,TNRC18 engages H3K9me3 to mediate silencing of endogenous retrotransposons.,Nature,"Trimethylation of histone H3 lysine?9 (H3K9me3) is crucial for the regulation of gene repression and heterochromatin formation, cell-fate determination and organismal development1. H3K9me3 also provides an essential mechanism for silencing transposable elements1-4. However, previous studies have shown that canonical H3K9me3 readers (for example, HP1 (refs.5-9) and MPP8 (refs.10-12)) have limited roles in silencing endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), one of the main transposable element classes in the mammalian genome13. Here we report that trinucleotide-repeat-containing?18 (TNRC18), a poorly understood chromatin regulator, recognizes H3K9me3 to mediate the silencing of ERV class?I (ERV1) elements such as LTR12 (ref.14). Biochemical, biophysical and structural studies identified the carboxy-terminal bromo-adjacent homology (BAH) domain of TNRC18 (TNRC18(BAH)) as an H3K9me3-specific reader. Moreover, the amino-terminal segment of TNRC18 is a platform for the direct recruitment of co-repressors such as HDAC-Sin3-NCoR complexes, thus enforcing optimal repression of the H3K9me3-demarcated ERVs. Point mutagenesis that disrupts the TNRC18(BAH)-mediated H3K9me3 engagement caused neonatal death in mice and, in multiple mammalian cell models, led to derepressed expression of ERVs, which affected the landscape of cis-regulatory elements and, therefore, gene-expression programmes. Collectively, we describe a new H3K9me3-sensing and regulatory pathway that operates to epigenetically silence evolutionarily young ERVs and exert substantial effects on host genome integrity, transcriptomic regulation, immunity and development.© 2023.

Using luciferase assays and Q-RT-PCR technique, we have discovered a distinct allele-specific influence of the MMP-9-1562C/T polymorphism on theMMP-9(Extracellular Matrix Metalloproteinase-9) promoter activity and the expression ofMMP-9mRNA in human neurons derived from SH-SY5Y cells. Subsequently, by employing a pull-down assay paired with mass spectrometry analysis, EMSA (Electromobility Shift Assay), and EMSA supershift techniques, as well as DsiRNA-dependent gene silencing, we have elucidated the mechanism responsible for the allele-specific impact of the MMP-9-1562C/T polymorphism on the transcriptional regulation of theMMP-9gene. We have discovered that the activity of theMMP-9promoter and the expression ofMMP-9mRNA in human neurons are regulated in a manner that is specific to the MMP-9-1562C/T allele, with a stronger upregulation being attributed to the C allele. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that the allele-specific action of the MMP-9-1562C/T polymorphism on the neuronalMMP-9expression is related toHDAC1(Histone deacetylase 1) andZNF384(Zinc Finger Protein 384) transcriptional regulators. We show that HDAC1 and ZNF384 bind to the C and the T alleles differently, forming different regulatory complexes in vitro.

Spanning from molecular omics to organism-level deep phenotyping, Big Data demands large computational resources for storage and analysis, as well as new analytical tools and conceptual frameworks to gain novel insights leading to discovery. Systems biology has emerged as a paradigm that utilizes Big Data to gain insightful information enabling a better understanding of living organisms, visualized as multilayered networks of interacting molecules, cells, tissues and organs at different spatiotemporal scales. In this framework, where aging, health and disease represent emergent states from an evolving dynamic complex system, context given by, for example, strain, sex and feeding times, becomes paramount for defining the biological trajectory of an organism. Using bioinformatics and artificial intelligence, the systems biology approach is leading to remarkable advances in our understanding of the underlying mechanism of aging biology and assisting in creative experimental study designs in animal models. Future in-depth knowledge acquisition will depend on the ability to fully integrate information from different spatiotemporal scales in organisms, which will probably require the adoption of theories and methods from the field of complex systems.

While plants represent an essential component of future long-duration space travel, the impacts of spaceflight on plant telomeres and telomerase have not been examined. Here we report on the telomere dynamics of Arabidopsis thaliana grown aboard the International Space Station. We observe no changes in telomere length in space-flown Arabidopsis seedlings, despite a dramatic increase in telomerase activity (up to 150-fold in roots), as well as elevated genome oxidation. Ground-based follow up studies provide further evidence that telomerase is induced by different environmental stressors, but its activity is uncoupled from telomere length. Supporting this conclusion, genetically engineered super-telomerase lines with enhanced telomerase activity maintain wildtype telomere length. Finally, genome oxidation is inversely correlated with telomerase activity levels. We propose a redox protective capacity for Arabidopsis telomerase that may promote survivability in harsh environments.© 2023. The Author(s).",1.56E-45

Perturbations in tau's structure and function are implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases collectively known as tauopathies, the most common disorder of which is Alzheimer's disease (AD). In tauopathies, it has been found that tau has a variety of post-translational modification (PTM) abnormalities and/or tau is cleaved into a variety of fragments by some specific proteolytic enzymes; however, the precise contributions of these abnormal modifications and fragments to disease onset and progression remain incompletely understood. Herein, we provide an overview about the involvement of distinctive abnormal tau PTMs and different tau fragments in the pathogenesis of AD and other tauopathies and discuss the involvement of proteolytic enzymes such as caspases, calpains, and asparagine endopeptidase in mediating tau cleavage while also addressing the intercellular transmission role played by tau.

To address this question, we profile gene expression and chromatin accessibility in cells from healthy retinae of 20 human donors through single-cell multiomics and genomic sequencing.We map eQTL, caQTL, allelic-specific expression, and allelic-specific chromatin accessibility in major retinal cell types. By integrating these results, we identify and characterize regulatory elements and genetic variants effective on gene regulation in individual cell types. The majority of identified sc-eQTLs and sc-caQTLs display cell type-specific effects, while the cis-elements containing genetic variants with cell type-specific effects are often accessible in multiple cell types. Furthermore, the transcription factors whose binding sites are perturbed by genetic variants tend to have higher expression levels in the cell types where the variants exert their effects, compared to the cell types where the variants have no impact. We further validate our findings with high-throughput reporter assays. Lastly, we identify the enriched cell types, candidate causal variants and genes, and cell type-specific regulatory mechanism underlying GWAS loci.Overall, genetic effects on gene regulation are highly context dependent. Our results suggest that cell type-dependent genetic effect is driven by precise modulation of both trans-factor expression and chromatin accessibility of cis-elements. Our findings indicate hierarchical collaboration among transcription factors plays a crucial role in mediating cell type-specific effects of genetic variants on gene regulation.© 2023.

Here, we present a comprehensive contemporary review of the mechanisms and phenotype of senescence in the adaptive immune system. Although modern research has not yet identified specific markers of aging lymphocytes, several sets of markers facilitate the separation of the aging population based on normal memory and exhausted cells for further genetic and functional analysis. The reasons for the higher predisposition of CD8+T-lymphocytes to senescence compared to the CD4+population are also discussed. We point out approaches for senescent-lymphocyte-targeting markers using small molecules (senolytics), antibodies and immunization against senescent cells.

When these processes go awry, they influence cancer onset, growth, spread, and cancer stemness. In this review, we delve into the epigenetic and isoform nuances of the protein kinase, doublecortin-like kinase 1 (DCLK1). Recognized as a hallmark of tumor stemness, DCLK1 plays a pivotal role in tumorigenesis, and DCLK1 isoforms, shaped by alternative promoter usage and splicing, can reveal potential therapeutic touchpoints. Our discussion centers on recent findings pertaining to the specific functions of DCLK1 isoforms and the prevailing understanding of its epigenetic regulation via its two distinct promoters. It is noteworthy that all DCLK1 isoforms retain their kinase domain, suggesting that their unique functionalities arise from non-kinase mechanisms. Consequently, our research has pivoted to drugs that specifically influence the epigenetic generation of these DCLK1 isoforms. We posit that a combined therapeutic approach, harnessing both the epigenetic regulators of specific DCLK1 isoforms and DCLK1-targeted drugs, may prove more effective than therapies that solely target DCLK1.",7.07E-46

Attention was initially focused on fatty acid desaturases, but it can involve a wide range of processes that remain largely unexplored. How all this can be driven by a different genetic background is hardly underlined, and the present study aimed to assess how broodstock nutrition affects differentially the transcriptome and genome-wide DNA methylome of reference and genetically selected fish within the PROGENSA® selection program.After the stimulus phase with a low fish oil diet, two offspring subsets of each genetic background received a control or a FUTURE-based diet. This highlighted a different hepatic transcriptome (RNA-seq) and genome-wide DNA methylation (MBD-seq) pattern depending on the genetic background. The number of differentially expressed transcripts following the challenge phase varied from 323 in reference fish to 2,009 in genetically selected fish. The number of discriminant transcripts, and associated enriched functions, were also markedly higher in selected fish. Moreover, correlation analysis depicted a hyper-methylated and down-regulated gene expression state in selected fish with the FUTURE diet, whereas the opposite pattern appeared in reference fish. After filtering for highly represented functions in selected fish, 115 epigenetic markers were retrieved in this group. Among them, lipid metabolism genes (23) were the most reactive following ordering by fold-change in expression, rendering a final list of 10 top markers with a key role on hepatic lipogenesis and fatty acid metabolism (cd36, pitpna, cidea, fasn, g6pd, lipt1, scd1a, acsbg2, acsl14, acsbg2).Gene expression profiles and methylation signatures were dependent on genetic background in our experimental model. Such assumption affected the magnitude, but also the type and direction of change. Thus, the resulting epigenetic clock of reference fish might depict an older phenotype with a lower methylation for the epigenetically responsive genes with a negative methylation-expression pattern. Therefore, epigenetic markers will be specific of each genetic lineage, serving the broodstock programming in our selected fish to prevent and mitigate later in life the risk of hepatic steatosis through changes in hepatic lipogenesis and fatty acid metabolism.© 2023.

,37957361,Senolytic therapy alleviates physiological human brain aging and COVID-19 neuropathology.,Nat Aging,"Aging is a major risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases, and coronavirus disease?2019 (COVID-19) is linked to severe neurological manifestations. Senescent cells contribute to brain aging, but the impact of virus-induced senescence on neuropathologies is unknown. Here we show that senescent cells accumulate in aged human brain organoids and that senolytics reduce age-related inflammation and rejuvenate transcriptomic aging clocks. In postmortem brains of patients with severe COVID-19 we observed increased senescent cell accumulation compared with age-matched controls. Exposure of human brain organoids to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus?2 (SARS-CoV-2) induced cellular senescence, and transcriptomic analysis revealed a unique SARS-CoV-2 inflammatory signature. Senolytic treatment of infected brain organoids blocked viral replication and prevented senescence in distinct neuronal populations. In human-ACE2-overexpressing mice, senolytics improved COVID-19 clinical outcomes, promoted dopaminergic neuron survival and alleviated viral and proinflammatory gene expression. Collectively our results demonstrate an important role for cellular senescence in driving brain aging and SARS-CoV-2-induced neuropathology, and a therapeutic benefit of senolytic treatments.© 2023.

,37936072,Age-related promoter-switch regulates Runx1 expression in adult rat hearts.,BMC Cardiovasc Disord,"Runt-related transcription factor-1 (RUNX1), a key member of the core-binding factor family of transcription factors, has emerged as a novel therapeutic target for cardiovascular disease. There is an urgent need to fully understand the expression pattern of Runx1 in the heart and the mechanisms by which it is controlled under normal conditions and in response to disease. The expression of Runx1 is regulated at the transcriptional level by two promoters designated P1 and P2. Alternative usage of these two promoters creates differential mRNA transcripts diversified in distribution and translational potential. While the significance of P1/P2 promoter-switch in the transcriptional control of Runx1 has been highlighted in the embryogenic process, very little is known about the level of P1- and P2-specific transcripts in adult hearts, and the underlying mechanisms controlling the promoter-switch.To amplify P1/P2 specific sequences in the heart, we used two different sense primers complementary to either P1 or P2 5'-regions to monitor the expression of P1/P2 transcripts. DNA methylation levels were assessed at the Runx1 promoter regions. Rats were grouped by age.The expression levels of both P1- and P2-derived Runx1 transcripts were decreased in older rats when compared with that in young adults, paralleled with an age-dependent decline in Runx1 protein level. Furthermore, older rats demonstrated a higher degree of DNA methylation at Runx1 promoter regions. Alternative promoter usage was observed in hearts with increased age, as reflected by altered P1:P2 mRNA ratio.Our data demonstrate that the expression of Runx1 in the heart is age-dependent and underscore the importance of gene methylation in the promoter-mediated transcriptional control of Runx1, thereby providing new insights to the role of epigenetic regulation in the heart.© 2023.

,37938585,Speos: an ensemble graph representation learning framework to predict core gene candidates for complex diseases.,Nat Commun,"Understanding phenotype-to-genotype relationships is a grand challenge of 21st century biology with translational implications. The recently proposed ""omnigenic"" model postulates that effects of genetic variation on traits are mediated by core-genes and -proteins whose activities mechanistically influence the phenotype, whereas peripheral genes encode a regulatory network that indirectly affects phenotypes via core gene products. Here, we develop a positive-unlabeled graph representation-learning ensemble-approach based on a nested cross-validation to predict core-like genes for diverse diseases using Mendelian disorder genes for training. Employing mouse knockout phenotypes for external validations, we demonstrate that core-like genes display several key properties of core genes: Mouse knockouts of genes corresponding to our most confident predictions give rise to relevant mouse phenotypes at rates on par with the Mendelian disorder genes, and all candidates exhibit core gene properties like transcriptional deregulation in disease and loss-of-function intolerance. Moreover, as predicted for core genes, our candidates are enriched for drug targets and druggable proteins. In contrast to Mendelian disorder genes the new core-like genes are enriched for druggable yet untargeted gene products, which are therefore attractive targets for drug development. Interpretation of the underlying deep learning model suggests plausible explanations for our core gene predictions in form of molecular mechanisms and physical interactions. Our results demonstrate the potential of graph representation learning for the interpretation of biological complexity and pave the way for studying core gene properties and future drug development.© 2023.

,38113005,Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 in Oncology.,Cancer Treat Res,"Dynamic regulation of the chromatin state by Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) provides an important mean for epigenetic gene control that can profoundly influence normal development and cell lineage specification. PRC2 and PRC2-induced methylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) are critically involved in a wide range of DNA-templated processes, which at least include transcriptional repression and gene imprinting, organization of three-dimensional chromatin structure, DNA replication and DNA damage response and repair. PRC2-based genome regulation often goes wrong in diseases, notably cancer. This chapter discusses about different modes-of-action through which PRC2 and EZH2, a catalytic subunit of PRC2, mediate (epi)genomic and transcriptomic regulation. We will also discuss about how alteration or mutation of the PRC2 core or axillary component promotes oncogenesis, how post-translational modification regulates functionality of EZH2 and PRC2, and how PRC2 and other epigenetic pathways crosstalk. Lastly, we will briefly touch on advances in targeting EZH2 and PRC2 dependence as cancer therapeutics.© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",3.61E-46
,38139229,Childhood Obesity: Insight into Kidney Involvement.,Int J Mol Sci,"This review examines the impact of childhood obesity on the kidney from an epidemiological, pathogenetic, clinical, and pathological perspective, with the aim of providing pediatricians and nephrologists with the most current data on this topic. The prevalence of childhood obesity and chronic kidney disease (CKD) is steadily increasing worldwide, reaching epidemic proportions. While the impact of obesity in children with CKD is less pronounced than in adults, recent studies suggest a similar trend in the child population. This is likely due to the significant association between obesity and the two leading causes of end-stage renal disease (ESRD): diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypertension. Obesity is a complex, systemic disease that reflects interactions between environmental and genetic factors. A key mechanism of kidney damage is related to metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance. Therefore, we can speculate about an adipose tissue-kidney axis in which neurohormonal and immunological mechanisms exacerbate complications resulting from obesity. Adipose tissue, now recognized as an endocrine organ, secretes cytokines called adipokines that may induce adaptive or maladaptive responses in renal cells, leading to kidney fibrosis. The impact of obesity on kidney transplant-related outcomes for both donors and recipients is also significant, making stringent preventive measures critical in the pre- and post-transplant phases. The challenge lies in identifying renal involvement as early as possible, as it is often completely asymptomatic and not detectable through common markers of kidney function. Ongoing research into innovative technologies, such as proteomics and metabolomics, aims to identify new biomarkers and is constantly evolving. Many aspects of pediatric disease progression in the population of children with obesity still require clarification. However, the latest scientific evidence in the field of nephrology offers glimpses into various new perspectives, such as genetic factors, comorbidities, and novel biomarkers. Investigating these aspects early could potentially improve the prognosis of these young patients through new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Hence, the aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive exploration of the pathogenetic mechanisms and prevalent pathological patterns of kidney damage observed in children with obesity.",2.98E-46
,38022387,Multi-omics analysis in developmental bone biology.,Jpn Dent Sci Rev,"Single-cell omics and multi-omics have revolutionized our understanding of molecular and cellular biological processes at a single-cell level. In bone biology, the combination of single-cell RNA-sequencing analyses and in vivo lineage-tracing approaches has successfully identified multi-cellular diversity and dynamics of skeletal cells. This established a new concept that bone growth and regeneration are regulated by concerted actions of multiple types of skeletal stem cells, which reside in spatiotemporally distinct niches. One important subtype is endosteal stem cells that are particularly abundant in young bone marrow. The discovery of this new skeletal stem cell type has been facilitated by single-cell multi-omics, which simultaneously measures gene expression and chromatin accessibility. Using single-cell omics, it is now possible to computationally predict the immediate future state of individual cells and their differentiation potential. In vivo validation using histological approaches is the key to interpret the computational prediction. The emerging spatial omics, such as spatial transcriptomics and epigenomics, have major advantage in retaining the location of individual cells within highly complex tissue architecture. Spatial omics can be integrated with other omics to further obtain in-depth insights. Single-cell multi-omics are now becoming an essential tool to unravel intricate multicellular dynamics and intercellular interactions of skeletal cells.© 2023 The Authors.",2.38E-46
,38132477,The Cytotoxicity of Cotyledon orbiculata Aqueous Extract and the Biogenic Silver Nanoparticles Derived from the Extract.,Curr Issues Mol Biol,"Green synthesized silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have become popular because of their promising biological activities. However, for most of these nanoparticles, the cytotoxic effects have not been determined and their safety is not guaranteed. In a previous study, we successfully synthesized AgNPs (Cotyledon-AgNPs) using an extract ofCotyledon orbiculata, a medicinal plant traditionally used in South Africa to treat skin conditions.Cotyledon-AgNPs were shown to have significant antimicrobial and wound-healing activities. Fibroblast cells treated with extracts ofC. orbiculataandCotyledon-AgNPs demonstrated an enhanced growth rate, which is essential in wound healing. These nanoparticles therefore have promising wound-healing activities. However, the cytotoxicity of these nanoparticles is not known. In this study, the toxic effects ofC. orbiculataextract andCotyledon-AgNPs on the non-cancerous skin fibroblast (KMST-6) were determined using in vitro assays to assess oxidative stress and cell death. Both theC. orbiculataextract and theCotyledon-AgNPs did not show any significant cytotoxic effects in these assays. Gene expression analysis was also used to assess the cytotoxic effects ofCotyledon-AgNPs at a molecular level. Of the eighty-four molecular toxicity genes analysed, only eight (FASN,SREBF1,CPT2,ASB1,HSPA1B,ABCC2,CASP9, andMKI67) were differentially expressed. These genes are mainly involved in fatty acid and mitochondrial energy metabolism. The results support the finding thatCotyledon-AgNPs have low cytotoxicity at the concentrations tested. The upregulation of genes such asFASN,SERBF1, andMKI-67also support previous findings thatCotyledon-AgNPs can promote wound healing via cell growth and proliferation. It can therefore be concluded thatCotyledon-AgNPs are not toxic to skin fibroblast cells at the concentration that promotes wound healing. These nanoparticles could possibly be safely used for wound healing.",1.81E-46
,38129947,Genomic-wide identification and expression analysis of AP2/ERF transcription factors in Zanthoxylum armatum reveals the candidate genes for the biosynthesis of terpenoids.,Plant Genome,"Terpenoids are the main active components in the Zanthoxylum armatum leaves, which have extensive medicinal value. The Z. armatum leaf is the main by-product in the Z. armatum industry. However, the transcription factors involved in the biosynthesis of terpenoids are rarely reported. This study was performed to identify and classify the APETALA2/ethylene-responsive factor (AP2/ERF) gene family of Z. armatum. The chromosome distribution, gene structure, conserved motifs, and cis-acting elements of the promoter of the species were also comprehensively analyzed. A total of 214 ZaAP2/ERFs were identified. From the obtained transcriptome and terpenoid content data, four candidate ZaAP2/ERFs involved in the biosynthesis of terpenoids were selected via correlation and weighted gene co-expression network analysis. A phylogenetic tree was constructed using 13 AP2/ERFs related to the biosynthesis of terpenoids in other plants. ZaERF063 and ZaERF166 showed close evolutionary relationships with the ERFs in other plant species and shared a high AP2-domain sequence similarity with the two closest AP2/ERF proteins, namelySmERF8 from Salvia miltiorrhiza and AaERF4 from Artemisia annua. Further investigation into the effects of methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatment on the content of terpenoids in Z. armatum leaves revealed that MeJA significantly induced the upregulation of ZaERF166 and led to a significant increase in the terpenoids content in Z. armatum leaves, indicating that ZaERF166 might be involved in the accumulation of terpenoids of Z. armatum. Results will be beneficial for the functional characterization of AP2/ERFs in Z. armatum and establishment of the theoretical foundation to increase the production of terpenoids via the manipulation of the regulatory elements and strengthen the development and utilization of Z. armatum leaves.© 2023 The Authors.

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-? is reported to have neuroprotective effects in addition to having antitumor effects in various cancers. Thus, we aimed to clarify the role of PPAR-? agonist and antagonist in malignant neuroblastomas, which also possess neuronal features. InMYCN-amplified neuroblastoma CHP212 cells, treatment with the PPAR-? antagonist GW9662 induced growth inhibition in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, the PPAR-? antagonist treatment changed cell morphology with increasing expression of the neuronal differentiation marker tubulin beta 3 (TUBB3) and induced G1 phase arrest and apoptosis inMYCN-amplified neuroblastoma. Notably, the PPAR-? antagonist treatment significantly decreased expression of NMYC, B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) and bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4). It is implied that BRD4, NMYC, BCL2 suppression by the PPAR-? antagonist resulted in cell growth inhibition, differentiation, and apoptosis induction. In ourin vivostudy, the PPAR-? antagonist treatment induced CHP212 cells differentiation and resultant tumor growth inhibition. Our results provide a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of tumor cell differentiation and suggest that PPAR-? antagonist is a new therapeutic and prevention option for neuroblastomas.Copyright © 2023 JCBN.",1.06E-46
,37953264,"Differential usage of DNA modifications in neurons, astrocytes, and microglia.",Epigenetics Chromatin,"Cellular identity is determined partly by cell type-specific epigenomic profiles that regulate gene expression. In neuroscience, there is a pressing need to isolate and characterize the epigenomes of specific CNS cell types in health and disease. In this study, we developed an in vivo tagging mouse model (Camk2a-NuTRAP) for paired isolation of neuronal DNA and RNA without cell sorting and then used this model to assess epigenomic regulation, DNA modifications in particular, of gene expression between neurons and glia.After validating the cell-specificity of the Camk2a-NuTRAP model, we performed TRAP-RNA-Seq and INTACT-whole genome oxidative bisulfite sequencing (WGoxBS) to assess the neuronal translatome and epigenome in the hippocampus of young mice (4 months old). WGoxBS findings were validated with enzymatic methyl-Seq (EM-Seq) and nanopore sequencing. Comparing neuronal data to microglial and astrocytic data from NuTRAP models, microglia had the highest global mCG levels followed by astrocytes and then neurons, with the opposite pattern observed for hmCG and mCH. Differentially modified regions between cell types were predominantly found within gene bodies and distal intergenic regions, rather than proximal promoters. Across cell types there was a negative correlation between DNA modifications (mCG, mCH, hmCG) and gene expression at proximal promoters. In contrast, a negative correlation of gene body mCG and a positive relationship between distal promoter and gene body hmCG with gene expression was observed. Furthermore, we identified a neuron-specific inverse relationship between mCH and gene expression across promoter and gene body regions.Neurons, astrocytes, and microglia demonstrate different genome-wide levels of mCG, hmCG, and mCH that are reproducible across analytical methods. However, modification-gene expression relationships are conserved across cell types. Enrichment of differential modifications across cell types in gene bodies and distal regulatory elements, but not proximal promoters, highlights epigenomic patterning in these regions as potentially greater determinants of cell identity. These findings also demonstrate the importance of differentiating between mC and hmC in neuroepigenomic analyses, as up to 30% of what is conventionally interpreted as mCG can be hmCG, which often has a different relationship to gene expression than mCG.© 2023.

,38086793,Inhibition of PFKP in renal tubular epithelial cell restrains TGF-Î² induced glycolysis and renal fibrosis.,Cell Death Dis,"Metabolic reprogramming to glycolysis is closely associated with the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Although it has been reported that phosphofructokinase 1 (PFK) is a rate-limiting enzyme in glycolysis, the role of the platelet isoform of PFK (PFKP) in kidney fibrosis initiation and progression is as yet poorly understood. Here, we investigated whether PFKP could mediate the progression of kidney interstitial fibrosis by regulating glycolysis in proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTECs). We induced PFKP overexpression or knockdown in renal tubules via an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector in the kidneys of mice following unilateral ureteral occlusion. Our results show that the dilated tubules, the area of interstitial fibrosis, and renal glycolysis were promoted by proximal tubule-specific overexpression of PFKP, and repressed by knockdown of PFKP. Furthermore, knockdown of PFKP expression restrained, while PFKP overexpression promoted TGF-?1-induced glycolysis in the human PTECs line. Mechanistically, Chip-qPCR revealed that TGF-?1 recruited the small mothers against decapentaplegic (SMAD) family member 3-SP1 complex to the PFKP promoter to enhance its expression. Treatment of mice with isorhamnetin notably ameliorated PTEC-elevated glycolysis and kidney fibrosis. Hence, our results suggest that PFKP mediates the progression of kidney interstitial fibrosis by regulating glycolysis in PTECs.© 2023. The Author(s).",9.26E-47

The combination of diet, lifestyle and the exposure to dietary xenobiotics categorised into microbiota-disrupting chemicals (MDCs) could determine obesogenic-related dysbiosis. This modification of the microbiota diversity impacts on individual health-disease balance, inducing altered phenotypes. Specific, complementary, and combined prevention and treatments are needed to face these altered microbial patterns and the specific misbalances triggered. In this sense, searching for next-generation probiotics (NGP) by microbiota culturing, and focusing on their demonstrated, extensive scope and well-defined functions could contribute to counteracting and repairing the effects of obesogens. Therefore, EU-FORA project contributes to present a perspective through compiling information and key strategies for directed taxa searching and culturing of NGP that could be administered for preventing obesity and endocrine-related dysbiosis by (i) observing the differential abundance of specific microbiota taxa in obesity-related patients and analysing their functional roles, (ii) developing microbiota-directed strategies for culturing these taxa groups, and (iii) design and applying the successful compiled criteria from recent NGP clinical studies. New isolated or cultivable microorganisms from healthy gut microbiota specifically related to xenobiotic obesogens' neutralisation effects might be used as an NGP single strain or in consortia, both presenting functions and the ability to palliate metabolic-related disorders.

However, new approaches are required to probe specific nucleotide sequences within key genes. Systematic mutagenesis in primary human T cells could reveal alleles that tune specific phenotypes. DNA base editors are powerful tools for introducing targeted mutations with high efficiency7,8. Here we develop a large-scale base-editing mutagenesis platform with the goal of pinpointing nucleotides that encode amino acid residues that tune primary human T cell activation responses. We generated a library of around 117,000 single guide RNA molecules targeting base editors to protein-coding sites across 385 genes implicated in T cell function and systematically identified protein domains and specific amino acid residues that regulate T cell activation and cytokine production. We found a broad spectrum of alleles with variants encoding critical residues in proteins including PIK3CD, VAV1, LCP2, PLCG1 and DGKZ, including both gain-of-function and loss-of-function mutations. We validated the functional effects of many alleles and further demonstrated that base-editing hits could positively and negatively tune T cell cytotoxic function. Finally, higher-resolution screening using a base editor with relaxed protospacer-adjacent motif requirements9(NG versus NGG) revealed specific structural domains and protein-protein interaction sites that can be targeted to tune T cell functions. Base-editing screens in primary immune cells thus provide biochemical insights with the potential to accelerate immunotherapy design.© 2023.

Herein, this research examined the actions and specific mechanisms of LINC00482 in cisplatin (DDP) resistance in NSCLC. LINC00482 expression was assessed using RT-qPCR in clinical NSCLC tissues and cell lines. Knockdown and ectopic expression assays were conducted in A549 and HCC44 cells, followed by determination of cell proliferation with CCK-8 and clone formation assays, apoptosis with flow cytometry, and DDP sensitivity. The association between LINC00482, E2F1, and CLASRP was evaluated with dual-luciferase reporter, ChIP, and RIP assays. The role of LINC00482 in NSCLC was confirmed in nude mice. NSCLC tissues and cells had upregulated LINC00482 expression. LINC00482 was mainly localized in the cell nucleus, and LINC00482 recruited E2F1 to enhance CLASRP expression in NSCLC cells. LINC00482 knockdown enhanced the DDP sensitivity and apoptosis of NSCLC cells while reducing cell proliferation, which was negated by overexpressing CLASRP. LINC00482 knockdown restricted tumor growth and enhanced DDP sensitivity in NSCLC in vivo. LINC00482 silencing downregulated CLASRP through E2F1 to facilitate the sensitivity to DDP in NSCLC.© 2023.

However, the potential for manipulating chromatin accessibility to regulate radiation sensitivity remains unclear. Our findings demonstrated that the histone demethylase inhibitor, 5-carboxy-8-hydroxyquinoline (IOX1), could enhance the radiosensitivity of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, IOX1 treatment reduced chromatin accessibility in the promoter region of DNA damage repair genes, leading to decreased DNA repair efficiency and elevated DNA damage induced by ? irradiation. Notably, IOX1 treatment significantly reduced both chromatin accessibility and the transcription of phytochrome interacting factor 1 (PIF1), a key player in telomere maintenance. Inhibition of PIF1 delayed radiation-induced DNA and telomeric DNA damage repair, as well as increased radiosensitivity of NSCLC in vitro and in vivo. Further study indicated that the above process was regulated by a reduction of transcription factor myc-associated zinc finger protein (MAZ) binding to the distal intergenic region of the PIF1. Taken together, IOX1-mediated demethylase inactivation reduced chromatin accessibility, leading to elevated telomere damage which is partly due to PIF1 inhibition, thereby enhancing NSCLC radiosensitivity.© 2023.

However, a comprehensive investigation into the transcriptional control of DNA methylation-mediated dysregulation of transcription factors (TFs) on lncRNAs has been lacking. Here, we integrated the transcriptome, methylome, and regulatome across 21 human cancers and systematically identified the transcriptional regulation of DNA methylation-mediated TF dysregulations (DMTDs) on lncRNAs. Our findings reveal that TF regulation of lncRNAs is significantly impacted by DNA methylation. Comparative analysis of DMTDs on mRNAs revealed a conserved pattern of TFs involvement. Pan-cancer Methylation TFs (MethTFs) and Methylation LncRNAs (MethLncRNAs) were identified, and were found to be closely associated with cancer hallmarks and clinical features. In-depth analysis of co-expressed mRNAs with pan-cancer MethLncRNAs unveiled frequent disruptions in cancer immunity, particularly in the context of inflammatory response. Furthermore, we identified five immune-related network modules that contribute to immune cell infiltration in cancer. Immune-related subtypes were subsequently classified, characterized by high levels of immune cell infiltration, expression of immunomodulatory genes, and relevant immune cytolytic activity score, major histocompatibility complex score, response to chemotherapy, and prognosis.

The diversity of cell types and individual differences between cells have brought inspiration to the study of the mechanism of central nervous system diseases. In order to explore the role of different cells, a new technology, single-cell sequencing technology has emerged to perform specific analysis of high-throughput cell populations, and has been continuously developed. Single-cell sequencing technology can accurately analyze single-cell expression in mixed-cell populations and collect cells from different spatial locations, time stages and types. By using single-cell sequencing technology to compare gene expression profiles of normal and diseased cells, it is possible to discover cell subsets associated with specific diseases and their associated genes. Therefore, scientists can understand the development process, related functions and disease state of the nervous system from an unprecedented depth.

,37931371,Epigenetic modifications: Key players in cancer heterogeneity and drug resistance.,Transl Oncol,"Cancer heterogeneity and drug resistance remain pivotal obstacles in effective cancer treatment and management. One major contributor to these challenges is epigenetic modifications - gene regulation that does not involve changes to the DNA sequence itself but significantly impacts gene expression. As we elucidate these phenomena, we underscore the pivotal role of epigenetic modifications in regulating gene expression, contributing to cellular diversity, and driving adaptive changes that can instigate therapeutic resistance. This review dissects essential epigenetic modifications - DNA methylation, histone modifications, and chromatin remodeling - illustrating their significant yet complex contributions to cancer biology. While these changes offer potential avenues for therapeutic intervention due to their reversible nature, the interplay of epigenetic and genetic changes in cancer cells presents unique challenges that must be addressed to harness their full potential. By critically analyzing the current research landscape, we identify knowledge gaps and propose future research directions, exploring the potential of epigenetic therapies and discussing the obstacles in translating these concepts into effective treatments. This comprehensive review aims to stimulate further research and aid in developing innovative, patient-centered cancer therapies. Understanding the role of epigenetic modifications in cancer heterogeneity and drug resistance is critical for scientific advancement and paves the way towards improving patient outcomes in the fight against this formidable disease.Copyright © 2023.

,37953829,From Genotype to Phenotype: How Enhancers Control Gene Expression and Cell Identity in Hematopoiesis.,Hemasphere,"Blood comprises a wide array of specialized cells, all of which share the same genetic information and ultimately derive from the same precursor, the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC). This diversity of phenotypes is underpinned by unique transcriptional programs gradually acquired in the process known as hematopoiesis. Spatiotemporal regulation of gene expression depends on many factors, but critical among them are enhancers-sequences of DNA that bind transcription factors and increase transcription of genes under their control. Thus, hematopoiesis involves the activation of specific enhancer repertoires in HSCs and their progeny, driving the expression of sets of genes that collectively determine morphology and function. Disruption of this tightly regulated process can have catastrophic consequences: in hematopoietic malignancies, dysregulation of transcriptional control by enhancers leads to misexpression of oncogenes that ultimately drive transformation. This review attempts to provide a basic understanding of enhancers and their role in transcriptional regulation, with a focus on normal and malignant hematopoiesis. We present examples of enhancers controlling master regulators of hematopoiesis and discuss the main mechanisms leading to enhancer dysregulation in leukemia and lymphoma.Copyright © 2023 the Author(s).

,38076935,Differential CpG methylation at Nnat in the early establishment of beta cell heterogeneity.,bioRxiv,"Beta cells within the pancreatic islet represent a heterogenous population wherein individual sub-groups of cells make distinct contributions to the overall control of insulin secretion. These include a subpopulation of highly-connected 'hub' cells, important for the propagation of intercellular Ca2+waves. Functional subpopulations have also been demonstrated in human beta cells, with an altered subtype distribution apparent in type 2 diabetes. At present, the molecular mechanisms through which beta cell hierarchy is established are poorly understood. Changes at the level of the epigenome provide one such possibility which we explore here by focussing on the imprinted gene neuronatin (Nnat), which is required for normal insulin synthesis and secretion.Single cell RNA-seq datasets were examined using Seurat 4.0 and ClusterProfiler running under R. Transgenic mice expressing eGFP under the control of theNnatenhancer/promoter regions were generated for fluorescence-activated cell (FAC) sorting of beta cells and downstream analysis of CpG methylation by bisulphite and RNA sequencing, respectively. Animals deleted for the de novo methyltransferase, DNMT3A from the pancreatic progenitor stage were used to explore control of promoter methylation. Proteomics was performed using affinity purification mass spectrometry and Ca2+dynamics explored by rapid confocal imaging of Cal-520 and Cal-590. Insulin secretion was measured using Homogeneous Time Resolved Fluorescence Imaging.NnatmRNA was differentially expressed in a discrete beta cell population in a developmental stage- and DNA methylation (DNMT3A)-dependent manner. Thus, pseudo-time analysis of embryonic data sets demonstrated the early establishment ofNnat-positive and negative subpopulations during embryogenesis. NNAT expression is also restricted to a subset of beta cells across the human islet that is maintained throughout adult life. NNAT+beta cells also displayed a discrete transcriptome at adult stages, representing a sub-population specialised for insulin production, reminiscent of recently-described ""?HI"" cells and were diminished indb/dbmice. 'Hub' cells were less abundant in the NNAT+population, consistent with epigenetic control of this functional specialization.These findings demonstrate that differential DNA methylation atNnatrepresents a novel means through which beta cell heterogeneity is established during development. We therefore hypothesise that changes in methylation at this locus may thus contribute to a loss of beta cell hierarchy and connectivity, potentially contributing to defective insulin secretion in some forms of diabetes.",2.21E-47
,38014055,Deep learning-based predictive classification of functional subpopulations of hematopoietic stem cells and multipotent progenitors.,Res Sq,"Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and multipotent progenitors (MPPs) play a pivotal role in maintaining lifelong hematopoiesis. The distinction between stem cells and other progenitors, as well as the assessment of their functions, has long been a central focus in stem cell research. In recent years, deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool for cell image analysis and classification/prediction.In this study, we explored the feasibility of employing deep learning techniques to differentiate murine HSCs and MPPs based solely on their morphology, as observed through light microscopy (DIC) images.After rigorous training and validation using extensive image datasets, we successfully developed a three-class classifier, referred to as the LSM model, capable of reliably distinguishing long-term HSCs (LT-HSCs), short-term HSCs (ST-HSCs), and MPPs. The LSM model extracts intrinsic morphological features unique to different cell types, irrespective of the methods used for cell identification and isolation, such as surface markers or intracellular GFP markers. Furthermore, employing the same deep learning framework, we created a two-class classifier that effectively discriminates between aged HSCs and young HSCs. This discovery is particularly significant as both cell types share identical surface markers yet serve distinct functions. This classifier holds the potential to offer a novel, rapid, and efficient means of assessing the functional states of HSCs, thus obviating the need for time-consuming transplantation experiments.Our study represents the pioneering use of deep learning to differentiate HSCs and MPPs under steady-state conditions. With ongoing advancements in model algorithms and their integration into various imaging systems, deep learning stands poised to become an invaluable tool, significantly impacting stem cell research.",2.14E-47
,37965091,From multi-omics approaches to personalized medicine in myocardial infarction.,Front Cardiovasc Med,"Myocardial infarction (MI) is a prevalent cardiovascular disease characterized by myocardial necrosis resulting from coronary artery ischemia and hypoxia, which can lead to severe complications such as arrhythmia, cardiac rupture, heart failure, and sudden death. Despite being a research hotspot, the etiological mechanism of MI remains unclear. The emergence and widespread use of omics technologies, including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and other omics, have provided new opportunities for exploring the molecular mechanism of MI and identifying a large number of disease biomarkers. However, a single-omics approach has limitations in understanding the complex biological pathways of diseases. The multi-omics approach can reveal the interaction network among molecules at various levels and overcome the limitations of the single-omics approaches. This review focuses on the omics studies of MI, including genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and other omics. The exploration extended into the domain of multi-omics integrative analysis, accompanied by a compilation of diverse online resources, databases, and tools conducive to these investigations. Additionally, we discussed the role and prospects of multi-omics approaches in personalized medicine, highlighting the potential for improving diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of MI.© 2023 Zhan, Tang, Wu, Zhang, He, Wu, Bi, Wang, Zhang and Shen.",1.98E-47
,37992195,"DegronMD: Leveraging Evolutionary and Structural Features for Deciphering Protein-Targeted Degradation, Mutations, and Drug Response to Degrons.",Mol Biol Evol,"Protein-targeted degradation is an emerging and promising therapeutic approach. The specificity of degradation and the maintenance of cellular homeostasis are determined by the interactions between E3 ubiquitin ligase and degradation signals, known as degrons. The human genome encodes over 600 E3 ligases; however, only a small number of targeted degron instances have been identified so far. In this study, we introduced DegronMD, an open knowledgebase designed for the investigation of degrons, their associated dysfunctional events, and drug responses. We revealed that degrons are evolutionarily conserved and tend to occur near the sites of protein translational modifications, particularly in the regions of disordered structure and higher solvent accessibility. Through pattern recognition and machine learning techniques, we constructed the degrome landscape across the human proteome, yielding over 18,000 new degrons for targeted protein degradation. Furthermore, dysfunction of degrons disrupts the degradation process and leads to the abnormal accumulation of proteins; this process is associated with various types of human cancers. Based on the estimated phenotypic changes induced by somatic mutations, we systematically quantified and assessed the impact of mutations on degron function in pan-cancers; these results helped to build a global mutational map on human degrome, including 89,318 actionable mutations that may induce the dysfunction of degrons and disrupt protein degradation pathways. Multiomics integrative analysis unveiled over 400 drug resistance events associated with the mutations in functional degrons. DegronMD, accessible at https://bioinfo.uth.edu/degronmd, is a useful resource to explore the biological mechanisms, infer protein degradation, and assist with drug discovery and design on degrons.© The Author(s) 2023.

,37935964,Scalable single-cell profiling of chromatin modifications with sciCUT&Tag.,Nat Protoc,"Cleavage under targets and tagmentation (CUT&Tag) is an antibody-directed in situ chromatin profiling strategy that is rapidly replacing immune precipitation-based methods, such as chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing. The efficiency of the method enables chromatin profiling in single cells but is limited by the numbers of cells that can be profiled. Here, we describe a combinatorial barcoding strategy for CUT&Tag that harnesses a nanowell dispenser for simple, high-resolution, high-throughput, single-cell chromatin profiling. In this single-cell combinatorial indexing CUT&Tag (sciCUT&Tag) protocol, lightly cross-linked nuclei are bound to magnetic beads and incubated with primary and secondary antibodies in bulk and then arrayed in a 96-well plate for a first round of cellular indexing by antibody-directed Tn5 tagmentation. The sample is then repooled, mixed and arrayed across 5,184 nanowells at a density of 12-24 nuclei per well for a second round of cellular indexing during PCR amplification of the sequencing-ready library. This protocol can be completed in 1.5 days by a research technician, and we illustrate the optimized protocol by profiling histone modifications associated with developmental gene repression (H3K27me3) as well as transcriptional activation (H3K4me1-2-3) in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and use single-nucleotide polymorphisms to facilitate collision removal. We have also used sciCUT&Tag for simultaneous profiling of multiple chromatin epitopes in single cells. The reduced cost, improved resolution and scalability of sciCUT&Tag make it an attractive platform to profile chromatin features in single cells.© 2023. Springer Nature Limited.",1.15E-47

We provide a molecular classification for 59 reported rare IL6ST pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants and additional polymorphisms. Based on loss- or gain-of-function, cytokine selectivity, mono- and biallelic associations, and variable cellular mosaicism, we grade six classes of IL6ST variants and explore the potential for additional variants. We classify variants according to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics criteria. Loss-of-function variants with (i) biallelic complete loss of GP130 function that presents with extended Stüve-Wiedemann Syndrome; (ii) autosomal recessive hyper-IgE syndrome (HIES) caused by biallelic; and (iii) autosomal dominant HIES caused by monoallelic IL6ST variants both causing selective IL-6 and IL-11 cytokine loss-of-function defects; (iv) a biallelic cytokine-specific variant that exclusively impairs IL-11 signaling, associated with craniosynostosis and tooth abnormalities; (v) somatic monoallelic mosaic constitutively active gain-of-function variants in hepatocytes that present with inflammatory hepatocellular adenoma; and (vi) mosaic constitutively active gain-of-function variants in hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells that are associated with an immune dysregulation syndrome. In addition to Mendelian IL6ST coding variants, there are common non-coding cis-acting variants that modify gene expression, which are associated with an increased risk of complex immune-mediated disorders and trans-acting variants that affect GP130 protein function. Our taxonomy highlights IL6ST as a gene with particularly strong functional and phenotypic diversity due to the combinatorial biology of the IL-6 cytokine family and predicts additional genotype-phenotype associations.© 2023.

Massive mutant libraries sequenced by next-generation sequencing technology facilitate mutant identification and functional analysis of genes of interest. Here, we report the creation and release of an open-access database called Mutation-induced Rice in Kyushu University (MiRiQ), designed for in silico mutant screening based on a whole-genome sequenced mutant library. This database allows any user to easily find mutants of interest without laborious efforts such as large-scale screening by PCR. The initial version of the MiRiQ database (version 1.0) harbors a total of 1.6 million single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and InDels of 721 M1 plants that were mutagenized by N-methyl-N-nitrosourea treatment of the rice cultivar Nipponbare (Oryza sativa ssp. japonica). The SNVs were distributed among 87% of all 35,630 annotated protein-coding genes of the Nipponbare genome and were predicted to induce missense and nonsense mutations. The MiRiQ database provides built-in tools, such as a search tool by keywords and JBrowse for mutation searches. Users can request mutant seeds in the M2 or M3 generations from a request form linked to this database. We believe the availability of a wide range of gene mutations in this database will benefit the plant science community and breeders worldwide by accelerating functional genomic research and crop improvement.© The Author(s) 2023.

,38139172,Epigenomic Profiling Advises Therapeutic Potential of Leukotriene Receptor Inhibitors for a Subset of Triple-Negative Breast Tumors.,Int J Mol Sci,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive molecular subtype, with a poor survival rate compared to others subtypes. For a long time, chemotherapy was the only systemic treatment for TNBC, and the identification of actionable molecular targets might ultimately improve the prognosis for TNBC patients. We performed a genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation at CpG islands on a collection of one hundred ten breast carcinoma samples and six normal breast tissue samples using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing with the XmaI restriction enzyme (XmaI-RRBS) and identified a subset of TNBC samples with significant hypomethylation at theLTB4R/LTB4R2genes' CpG islands, including CpG dinucleotides covered with cg12853742 and cg21886367 HumanMethylation 450K microarray probes. Abnormal DNA hypomethylation of this region in TNBC compared to normal samples was confirmed by bisulfite Sanger sequencing. Gene expression generally anticorrelates with promoter methylation, and thus, the promoter hypomethylation detected and confirmed in our study might be revealed as an indirect marker of highLTB4R/LTB4R2expression using a simple methylation-sensitive PCR test. Analysis of RNA-seq expression and DNA methylation data from the TCGA dataset demonstrates that the expression of theLTB4RandLTB4R2genes significantly negatively correlates with DNA methylation at both CpG sites cg12853742 (R = -0.4,p= 2.6 × 10-6; R = -0.21,p= 0.015) and cg21886367 (R = -0.45,p= 7.3 × 10-8; R = -0.24,p= 0.005), suggesting the upregulation of these genes in tumors with abnormal hypomethylation of their CpG island. Kaplan-Meier analysis using the TCGA-BRCA gene expression and clinical data revealed poorer overall survival for TNBC patients with an upregulatedLTB4R. To this day, only the leukotriene inhibitor LY255283 has been tested on an MCF-7/DOX cell line, which is a luminal A breast cancer molecular subtype. Other studies compare the effects of Montelukast and Zafirlukast (inhibitors of the cysteinyl leukotriene receptor, which is different from LTB4R/LTB4R2) on the MDA-MB-231 (TNBC) cell line, with high methylation and low expression levels of LTB4R. In our study, we assess the therapeutic effects of various drugs (including leukotriene receptor inhibitors) with the DepMap gene effect and drug sensitivity data for TNBC cell lines with hypomethylated and upregulatedLTB4R/LTB4R2genes. LY255283, Minocycline, Silibinin, Piceatannol, Mitiglinide, 1-Azakenpaullone, Carbetocin, and Pim-1-inhibitor-2 can be considered as candidates for the additional treatment of TNBC patients with tumors demonstratingLTB4R/LTB4R2hypomethylation/upregulation. Finally, our results suggest that the epigenetic status of leukotriene B4 receptors is a novel, potential, predictive, and prognostic biomarker for TNBC. These findings might improve individualized therapy for TNBC patients by introducing new therapeutic adjuncts as anticancer agents.",7.38E-48
,38001741,Mobilization of Circulating Tumor Cells after Short- and Long-Term FOLFIRINOX and GEM/nab-PTX Chemotherapy in Xenograft Mouse Models of Human Pancreatic Cancer.,Cancers (Basel),"Mobilization of CTCs after various types of therapy, such as radiation therapy, has been reported, but systematic study of CTCs after chemotherapy remained quite limited. In this study, we sequentially examined CTC numbers after single-dose and repetitive-dose chemotherapy, including FORFIRINOX (FFX) and Gemcitabine and nab-Paclitaxel (GnP) using two pancreatic cancer xenograft models. CTC was detected by the immunocytology-based microfluidic platform. We further examined the dynamic change in the histology of primary tumor tissues during chemotherapy. We confirmed a transient increase in CTCs 1-2 weeks after single-dose and repetitive-dose of FFX/GnP chemotherapy. Histological examination of the primary tumors revealed that the peak period of CTC at 1-2 weeks after chemotherapy corresponded to the maximal destructive phase consisting of cell cycle arrest, apoptosis of tumor cells, and blood vessel destruction without secondary reparative tissue reactions and regeneration of tumor cells. These findings indicate that mobilization of CTCs early after chemotherapy is mediated by the shedding of degenerated tumor cells into the disrupted blood vessels driven by the pure destructive histological changes in primary tumor tissues. These results suggest that sequential CTC monitoring during chemotherapy can be a useful liquid biopsy diagnostic tool to predict tumor chemosensitivity and resistance in preclinical and clinical settings.",7.12E-48
,37934570,ZMYM2 controls human transposable element transcription through distinct co-regulatory complexes.,Elife,"ZMYM2 is a zinc finger transcriptional regulator that plays a key role in promoting and maintaining cell identity. It has been implicated in several diseases such as congenital anomalies of the kidney where its activity is diminished and cancer where it participates in oncogenic fusion protein events. ZMYM2 is thought to function through promoting transcriptional repression and here we provide more evidence to support this designation. Here we studied ZMYM2 function in human cells and demonstrate that ZMYM2 is part of distinct chromatin-bound complexes including the established LSD1-CoREST-HDAC1 corepressor complex. We also identify new functional and physical interactions with ADNP and TRIM28/KAP1. The ZMYM2-TRIM28 complex forms in a SUMO-dependent manner and is associated with repressive chromatin. ZMYM2 and TRIM28 show strong functional similarity and co-regulate a large number of genes. However, there are no strong links between ZMYM2-TRIM28 binding events and nearby individual gene regulation. Instead, ZMYM2-TRIM28 appears to regulate genes in a more regionally defined manner within TADs where it can directly regulate co-associated retrotransposon expression. We find that different types of ZMYM2 binding complex associate with and regulate distinct subclasses of retrotransposons, with ZMYM2-ADNP complexes at SINEs and ZMYM2-TRIM28 complexes at LTR elements. We propose a model whereby ZMYM2 acts directly through retrotransposon regulation, which may then potentially affect the local chromatin environment and associated coding gene expression.© 2023, Owen, Aguilar-Martinez, Ji et al.",5.07E-48
,37995198,Scaling of an antibody validation procedure enables quantification of antibody performance in major research applications.,Elife,"Antibodies are critical reagents to detect and characterize proteins. It is commonly understood that many commercial antibodies do not recognize their intended targets, but information on the scope of the problem remains largely anecdotal, and as such, feasibility of the goal of at least one potent and specific antibody targeting each protein in a proteome cannot be assessed. Focusing on antibodies for human proteins, we have scaled a standardized characterization approach using parental and knockout cell lines (Laflamme et al., 2019) to assess the performance of 614 commercial antibodies for 65 neuroscience-related proteins. Side-by-side comparisons of all antibodies against each target, obtained from multiple commercial partners, have demonstrated that: (i) more than 50% of all antibodies failed in one or more applications, (ii) yet, ~50-75% of the protein set was covered by at least one high-performing antibody, depending on application, suggesting that coverage of human proteins by commercial antibodies is significant; and (iii) recombinant antibodies performed better than monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies. The hundreds of underperforming antibodies identified in this study were found to have been used in a large number of published articles, which should raise alarm. Encouragingly, more than half of the underperforming commercial antibodies were reassessed by the manufacturers, and many had alterations to their recommended usage or were removed from the market. This first study helps demonstrate the scale of the antibody specificity problem but also suggests an efficient strategy toward achieving coverage of the human proteome; mine the existing commercial antibody repertoire, and use the data to focus new renewable antibody generation efforts.© 2023, Ayoubi et al.",4.54E-48
,38057720,Genome-wide characterization of the wall-associated kinase-like (WAKL) family in sesame (Sesamum indicum) identifies a SiWAKL6 gene involved in resistance to Macrophomina Phaseolina.,BMC Plant Biol,"Sesame charcoal rot caused by Macrophomina phaseolina is one of the most serious fungal diseases in sesame production, and threatens the yield and quality of sesame. WAKL genes are important in the plant response to biotic stresses by sensing and transmitting external signals to the intracellular receptor. However, there is still a lack about the WAKL gene family and its function in sesame resistance to M. phaseolina. The aim of this study was to interpret the roles of WAKL genes in sesame resistance to M. phaseolina.In this study, a comprehensive study of the WAKL gene family was conducted and 31 WAKL genes were identified in the sesame genome. Tandem duplication events were the main factor in expansion of the SiWAKL gene family. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the sesame SiWAKL gene family was divided into 4 groups. SiWAKL genes exhibited different expression patterns in diverse tissues. Under M. phaseolina stress, most SiWAKL genes were significantly induced. Notably, SiWAKL6 was strongly induced in the resistant variety ""Zhengzhi 13"". Functional analysis showed that SiWAKL6 was induced by salicylic acid but not methyl jasmonate in sesame. Overexpression of SiWAKL6 in transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants enhanced their resistance to M. phaseolina by inducing the expression of genes involved in the salicylic acid signaling pathway and reconstructing reactive oxygen species homeostasis.Taken together, the results provide a better understanding of functions about SiWAKL gene family and suggest that manipulation of these SiWAKL genes can improve plant resistance to M. phaseolina. The findings contributed to further understanding of functions of SiWAKL genes in plant immunity.© 2023. The Author(s).",4.24E-48
,38113256,Somatic mutations of MLL4/COMPASS induce cytoplasmic localization providing molecular insight into cancer prognosis and treatment.,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,"Cancer genome sequencing consortiums have recently catalogued an abundance of somatic mutations, across a wide range of human cancers, in the chromatin-modifying enzymes that regulate gene expression. Defining the molecular mechanisms underlying the potentially oncogenic functions of these epigenetic mutations could serve as the basis for precision medicine approaches to cancer therapy. MLL4 encoded by theKMT2Dgene highly mutated in a large number of human cancers, is a key histone lysine monomethyltransferase within the Complex of Proteins Associated with Set1 (COMPASS) family that regulates gene expression through enhancer function, potentially functioning as a tumor suppressor. We report that theKMT2Dmutations which cause MLL4 protein truncation also alter MLL4's subcellular localization, resulting in loss-of-function in the nucleus and gain-of-function in the cytoplasm. We demonstrate that isogenic correction ofKMT2Dtruncation mutation rescues the aberrant localization phenotype and restores multiple regulatory functions of MLL4, including COMPASS integrity/stabilization, histone H3K4 mono-methylation, enhancer activation, and therefore transcriptional regulation. Moreover, isogenic correction diminishes the sensitivity ofKMT2D-mutated cancer cells to targeted metabolic inhibition. Using immunohistochemistry, we identified that cytoplasmic MLL4 is unique to the tissue of bladder cancer patients withKMT2Dtruncation mutations. Using a preclinical carcinogen model of bladder cancer in mouse, we demonstrate that truncated cytoplasmic MLL4 predicts response to targeted metabolic inhibition therapy for bladder cancer and could be developed as a biomarker forKMT2D-mutated cancers. We also highlight the broader potential for prognosis, patient stratification and treatment decision-making based onKMT2Dmutation status in MLL4 truncation-relevant diseases, including human cancers and Kabuki Syndrome.",3.94E-48

These features include histopathological variability, molecular expression profiles, genetic and cellular heterogeneity of parental tissue, and furthermore growing evidence suggests the ability to predict patient therapeutic response. Concentrating on the highly lethal and heterogeneous gastrointestinal (GI) tumors, herein we present the state-of-the-art and the current methodology of PDOs.

However, the mechanism of gender dimorphism in HCC is still not completely understood.5-Hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC)-Seal technology was utilised to detect the global 5hmC levels from four female and four male HCC samples. Methylation of XIST was detected by Sequenom MassARRAY methylation profiling between HCC tissues (T) and adjacent normal liver tissues (L). The role of Tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2 (TET2) was investigated using diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-administered Tet2-/-female mice, which regulated XIST in hepatocarcinogenesis. All statistical analyses were carried out by GraphPad Prism 9.0 and SPSS version 19.0 software.The results demonstrated that the numbers of 5hmC reads in the first exon of XIST from female HCC tissues (T) were remarkably lower than that in female adjacent normal liver tissues (L). Correspondingly, DNA methylation level of XIST first exon region was significantly increased in female T than in L. By contrast, no significant change was observed in male HCC patients. Compared to L, the expression of XIST in T was also significantly downregulated. Female patients with higher XIST in HCC had a higher overall survival (OS) and more extended recurrence-free survival (RFS). Moreover, TET2 can interact with YY1 binding to the promoter region of XIST and maintain the hypomethylation state of XIST. In addition, DEN-administered Tet2-/-mice developed more tumours than controls in female mice.Our study provided that YY1 and TET2 could interact to form protein complexes binding to the promoter region of XIST, regulating the methylation level of XIST and then affecting the expression of XIST. This research will provide a new clue for studying sex disparities in hepatocarcinogenesis.XIST was significantly downregulated in HCC tissues and had gender disparity. Methylation levels in the XIST first exon were higher in female HCC tissues, but no significant change in male HCC patients. The TET2-YY1 complex regulate XIST expression in female hepatocytes.

,37993882,A pangenome graph reference of 30 chicken genomes allows genotyping of large and complex structural variants.,BMC Biol,"The red junglefowl, the wild outgroup of domestic chickens, has historically served as a reference for genomic studies of domestic chickens. These studies have provided insight into the etiology of traits of commercial importance. However, the use of a single reference genome does not capture diversity present among modern breeds, many of which have accumulated molecular changes due to drift and selection. While reference-based resequencing is well-suited to cataloging simple variants such as single-nucleotide changes and short insertions and deletions, it is mostly inadequate to discover more complex structural variation in the genome.We present a pangenome for the domestic chicken consisting of thirty assemblies of chickens from different breeds and research lines.We demonstrate how this pangenome can be used to catalog structural variants present in modern breeds and untangle complex nested variation. We show that alignment of short reads from 100 diverse wild and domestic chickens to this pangenome reduces reference bias by 38%, which affects downstream genotyping results. This approach also allows for the accurate genotyping of a large and complex pair of structural variants at the K feathering locus using short reads, which would not be possible using a linear reference.We expect that this new paradigm of genomic reference will allow better pinpointing of exact mutations responsible for specific phenotypes, which will in turn be necessary for breeding chickens that meet new sustainability criteria and are resilient to quickly evolving pathogen threats.© 2023.

,37986835,Ribosome Decision Graphs for the Representation of Eukaryotic RNA Translation Complexity.,bioRxiv,"The application of ribosome profiling has revealed an unexpected abundance of translation in addition to that responsible for the synthesis of previously annotated protein-coding regions. Multiple short sequences have been found to be translated within single RNA molecules, both within annotated protein-coding and non-coding regions. The biological significance of this translation is a matter of intensive investigation. However, current schematic or annotation-based representations of mRNA translation generally do not account for the apparent multitude of translated regions within the same molecules. They also do not take into account the stochasticity of the process that allows alternative translations of the same RNA molecules by different ribosomes. There is a need for formal representations of mRNA complexity that would enable the analysis of quantitative information on translation and more accurate models for predicting the phenotypic effects of genetic variants affecting translation. To address this, we developed a conceptually novel abstraction that we term Ribosome Decision Graphs (RDGs). RDGs represent translation as multiple ribosome paths through untranslated and translated mRNA segments. We termed the later 'translons'. Non-deterministic events, such as initiation, re-initiation, selenocysteine insertion or ribosomal frameshifting are then represented as branching points. This representation allows for an adequate representation of eukaryotic translation complexity and focuses on locations critical for translation regulation. We show how RDGs can be used for depicting translated regions, analysis of genetic variation and quantitative genome-wide data on translation for characterisation of regulatory modulators of translation.",1.21E-48
,37958372,Adding Value to Liquid Biopsy for Brain Tumors: The Role of Imaging.,Cancers (Basel),"Clinical management in neuro-oncology has changed to an integrative approach that incorporates molecular profiles alongside histopathology and imaging findings. While the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline recommends the genotyping of informative alterations as a routine clinical practice for central nervous system (CNS) tumors, the acquisition of tumor tissue in the CNS is invasive and not always possible. Liquid biopsy is a non-invasive approach that provides the opportunity to capture the complex molecular heterogeneity of the whole tumor through the detection of circulating tumor biomarkers in body fluids, such as blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Despite all of the advantages, the low abundance of tumor-derived biomarkers, particularly in CNS tumors, as well as their short half-life has limited the application of liquid biopsy in clinical practice. Thus, it is crucial to identify the factors associated with the presence of these biomarkers and explore possible strategies that can increase the shedding of these tumoral components into biological fluids. In this review, we first describe the clinical applications of liquid biopsy in CNS tumors, including its roles in the early detection of recurrence and monitoring of treatment response. We then discuss the utilization of imaging in identifying the factors that affect the detection of circulating biomarkers as well as how image-guided interventions such as focused ultrasound can help enhance the presence of tumor biomarkers through blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption.",1.13E-48

Advanced knowledge of molecular and signaling mechanisms in the NVU and the emergence of improved experimental models allow BBB permeability prediction and the development of new brain-targeted therapies. As NVU constituents, astrocytes are the most numerous glial cells, characterized by a heterogeneity that occurs as a result of developmental and context-based gene expression profiles and the differential expression of non-coding ribonucleic acids (RNAs). Due to their heterogeneity and dynamic responses to different signals, astrocytes may have a beneficial or detrimental role in the BBB's barrier function, with deep effects on the pathophysiology of (and on the progression of) central nervous system diseases. The implication of astrocytic-derived extracellular vesicles in pathological mechanisms, due to their ability to pass the BBB, must also be considered. The molecular mechanisms of astrocytes' interaction with endothelial cells at the BBB level are considered promising therapeutic targets in different neurological conditions. Nevertheless, a personalized and well-founded approach must be addressed, due to the temporal and spatial heterogeneity of reactive astrogliosis states during disease.",1.1E-48
,38001935,Enrichment of Deleterious Mutated Genes Involved in Ciliary Function and Histone Modification in Brain Cancer Patient-Derived Xenograft Models.,Biomedicines,"Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models, which can retain the characteristics of original tumors in an in vivo-mimicking environment, have been developed to identify better treatment options. However, although original tumors and xenograft tissues mostly share oncogenic mutations and global gene expression patterns, their detailed mutation profiles occasionally do not overlap, indicating that selection occurs in the xenograft environment. To understand this mutational alteration in xenografts, we established 13 PDX models derived from 11 brain tumor patients and confirmed their histopathological similarity. Surprisingly, only a limited number of somatic mutations were shared between the original tumor and xenograft tissue. By analyzing deleteriously mutated genes in tumors and xenografts, we found that previously reported brain tumor-related genes were enriched in PDX samples, demonstrating that xenografts are a valuable platform for studying brain tumors. Furthermore, mutated genes involved in cilium movement, microtubule depolymerization, and histone methylation were enriched in PDX samples compared with the original tumors. Even with the limitations of the heterogeneity of clinical lesions with a heterotropic model, our study demonstrates that PDX models can provide more information in genetic analysis using samples with high heterogeneity, such as brain tumors.",1.03E-48

Here, we seek to identify shared and compartment-specific events that may represent potential therapeutic targets and candidate drivers of sarcomatous compartment formation through epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT).We performed multiomic profiling (exome sequencing, RNA-sequencing, microRNA profiling) of paired carcinomatous and sarcomatous components in 12 OCS cases.While paired sarcomatous and carcinomatous compartments demonstrate substantial genomic similarities, multiple loci are recurrently copy number-altered between components; regions containing GNAS and SRC are recurrently gained within the sarcomatous compartment. CCNE1 gain is a common event in OCS, occurring more frequently than in high grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC). Transcriptomic analysis suggests increased MAPK activity and subtype switching toward poor prognosis HGSOC-derived transcriptomic subtypes within the sarcomatous component. The two compartments show global differences in microRNA profiles, with differentially expressed microRNAs targeting EMT-related genes (SIRT1, ZEB2) and regulators of pro-tumourigenic pathways (TGF?, NOTCH); chrX is a highly enriched target of these microRNAs and is also frequently deleted across samples. The sarcomatous component harbours significantly fewer CD8-positive cells, suggesting poorer immune engagement.CCNE1 gain and chrX loss are frequent in OCS. SRC gain, increased GNAS expression and microRNA dysregulation represent potential mechanisms driving sarcomatous compartment formation.© 2023. The Author(s).",9.53E-49
,37951964,Relapse of acute myeloid leukemia after allogeneic stem cell transplantation: immune escape mechanisms and current implications for therapy.,Mol Cancer,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disease characterized by the expansion of immature myeloid cells in the bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) resulting in failure of normal hematopoiesis and life-threating cytopenia. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HCT) is an established therapy with curative potential. Nevertheless, post-transplant relapse is common and associated with poor prognosis, representing the major cause of death after allo-HCT. The occurrence of relapse after initially successful allo-HCT indicates that the donor immune system is first able to control the leukemia, which at a later stage develops evasion strategies to escape from immune surveillance. In this review we first provide a comprehensive overview of current knowledge regarding immune escape in AML after allo-HCT, including dysregulated HLA, alterations in immune checkpoints and changes leading to an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. In the second part, we draw the line from bench to bedside and elucidate to what extend immune escape mechanisms of relapsed AML are yet exploited in treatment strategies. Finally, we give an outlook how new emerging technologies could help to improve the therapy for these patients, and elucidate potential new treatment options.© 2023. The Author(s).",6.99E-49
,38088823,Expanding horizons of tandem repeats in biology and medicine: Why 'genomic dark matter' matters.,Emerg Top Life Sci,"Approximately half of the human genome includes repetitive sequences, and these DNA sequences (as well as their transcribed repetitive RNA and translated amino-acid repeat sequences) are known as the repeatome. Within this repeatome there are a couple of million tandem repeats, dispersed throughout the genome. These tandem repeats have been estimated to constitute ?8% of the entire human genome. These tandem repeats can be located throughout exons, introns and intergenic regions, thus potentially affecting the structure and function of tandemly repetitive DNA, RNA and protein sequences. Over more than three decades, more than 60 monogenic human disorders have been found to be caused by tandem-repeat mutations. These monogenic tandem-repeat disorders include Huntington's disease, a variety of ataxias, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia, as well as many other neurodegenerative diseases. Furthermore, tandem-repeat disorders can include fragile X syndrome, related fragile X disorders, as well as other neurological and psychiatric disorders. However, these monogenic tandem-repeat disorders, which were discovered via their dominant or recessive modes of inheritance, may represent the 'tip of the iceberg' with respect to tandem-repeat contributions to human disorders. A previous proposal that tandem repeats may contribute to the 'missing heritability' of various common polygenic human disorders has recently been supported by a variety of new evidence. This includes genome-wide studies that associate tandem-repeat mutations with autism, schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease and various types of cancers. In this article, I will discuss how tandem-repeat mutations and polymorphisms could contribute to a wide range of common disorders, along with some of the many major challenges of tandem-repeat biology and medicine. Finally, I will discuss the potential of tandem repeats to be therapeutically targeted, so as to prevent and treat an expanding range of human disorders.© 2023 The Author(s).",6.43E-49

We curated a case series in which we documented patterns of recurrence and efficacy and safety of osimertinib after recurrence.Patients who received osimertinib as first-line treatment for postoperative recurrence between September 2018 and January 2023 were included. Clinicopathological factors, duration of osimertinib treatment (DoT), and adverse events were collected and analyzed.Twenty patients received osimertinib [male, n=6; median age, 75 years (range, 55-85 years)]. TheEGFRmutation type was L858R in 11 patients and exon 19 deletion in eight patients. The performance status (PS) was 0 or 1 in all but two patients, who had symptomatic brain metastasis and were therefore PS 3. The first site of postoperative recurrence was locoregional in five patients and distant in 15 patients, including seven with brain metastasis. As of February 2023, 10 patients were still on osimertinib, including three with brain metastasis. Patients with brain metastasis or poor PS had a considerably shorter DoT than their counterparts. Three patients with symptomatic brain metastasis or leptomeningeal metastasis initially responded to osimertinib, but all died of disease progression. Five patients discontinued osimertinib due to serious adverse effects (pneumonitis, drug eruption, and heart failure).Although osimertinib exerts great disease control, even in patients with brain metastasis or poor PS, their presence was associated with a poor prognosis, even with osimertinib treatment. Therefore, adjuvant osimertinib is recommended unless contraindicated.2023 Journal of Thoracic Disease. All rights reserved.",5.98E-49

,37958666,Altered Clock Gene Expression in Female APP/PS1 Mice and Aquaporin-Dependent Amyloid Accumulation in the Retina.,Int J Mol Sci,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most prevalent form of dementia, is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by different pathological symptomatology, including disrupted circadian rhythm. The regulation of circadian rhythm depends on the light information that is projected from the retina to the suprachiasmatic nucleus in the hypothalamus. Studies of AD patients and AD transgenic mice have revealed AD retinal pathology, including amyloid-? (A?) accumulation that can directly interfere with the regulation of the circadian cycle. Although the cause of AD pathology is poorly understood, one of the main risk factors for AD is female gender. Here, we found that female APP/PS1 mice at 6- and 12-months old display severe circadian rhythm disturbances and retinal pathological hallmarks, including A? deposits in retinal layers. Since brain A? transport is facilitated by aquaporin (AQP)4, the expression of AQPs were also explored in APP/PS1 retina to investigate a potential correlation between retinal A? deposits and AQPs expression. Important reductions in AQP1, AQP4, and AQP5 were detected in the retinal tissue of these transgenic mice, mainly at 6-months of age. Taken together, our findings suggest that abnormal transport of A?, mediated by impaired AQPs expression, contributes to the retinal degeneration in the early stages of AD.",4.62E-49
,37939836,Methylome-wide analysis of milk somatic cells upon subclinical mastitis in dairy cattle.,J Dairy Sci,"Better understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind bovine mastitis is fundamental for improving the management of this disease, which continues to be of major concern for the dairy industry, especially in its subclinical form. Disease severity and progression depend on numerous aspects, such as livestock genetics, and the interaction between the causative agent, the host, and the environment. In this context, epigenetic mechanisms have proven to have a role in controlling the response of the animal to inflammation. Therefore, in this study we aimed to explore genome wide DNA methylation of milk somatic cells (SC) in healthy cows (n = 15) and cows affected by naturally occurring subclinical mastitis by Streptococcus (Strep.) agalactiae (n = 12) and Prototheca spp. (n = 11), to better understand the role of somatic cells methylome in the host response to disease. Differentially methylated regions (DMR) were evaluated comparing: i) Strep. agalactiae-infected vs. healthy; ii) Prototheca-infected vs. healthy, and iii) mastitis vs. healthy and iv) Strep. agalactiae-infected vs. Prototheca-infected. The functional analysis was performed at 2 levels. To begin with, we extracted differentially methylated genes (DMG) from promoter - DMR, which were analyzed using the Cytoscape ClueGO plug-in. Coupled with this DMG-driven approach, all the genes associated with promoter - methylated regions were fed to the Pathifier algorithm. From the DMR analysis, we identified 1,081 hypermethylated and 361 hypomethylated promoter regions in Strep. agalactiae infected animals, while 1,514 hypermethylated and 358 hypomethylated promoter regions were identified in Prototheca infected animals, when compared with the healthy controls. When considering infected animals as a whole group (regardless of the pathogen), we found 1,576 hypermethylated and 460 hypomethylated promoter regions. Both pathogens were associated with methylation differences in genes involved in pathways related to meiosis, reproduction and tissue remodeling. Exploring the whole methylome, in subclinically infected cows we observed a strong deregulation of immune related pathways, such as nuclear factor kB and toll-like receptors signaling pathways, and of energy-related pathways such as the tricarboxylic acid cycle and unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis. In conclusion, no evident pathogen-specific SC methylome signature was detected in the present study. Overall, we observed a clear regulation of host immune response driven by DNA methylation upon subclinical mastitis. Further studies on a larger cohort of animals are needed to validate our results and to possibly identify a unique SC methylome that signifies pathogen-specific alterations.© 2024, The Authors.

However, the altered DNA methylation levels in endothelial cells under these conditions and their implication for the etiopathology of AMI have not been investigated in detail. This study aimed to explore the relationship between DNA methylation and pathologically altered gene expression profile in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD), and its clinical implications in AMI patients. The Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip assay was used to explore the genome-wide DNA methylation profile using the Novaseq6000 platform for mRNA sequencing in 3 pairs of HUVEC-OGD and control samples. GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses, as well as correlation, causal inference test (CIT), and protein-protein interaction (PPI) analyses identified 22 hub genes that were validated by MethylTarget sequencing as well as qRT-PCR. ELISA was used to detect four target molecules associated with the progression of AMI. A total of 2,524 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 22,148 differentially methylated positions (DMPs) corresponding to 6,642 differentially methylated genes (DMGs) were screened (|??|>0.1 and detectionp< 0.05). After GO, KEGG, correlation, CIT, and PPI analyses, 441 genes were filtered. qRT-PCR confirmed the overexpression of VEGFA, CCL2, TSP-1, SQSTM1, BCL2L11, and TIMP3 genes, and downregulation of MYC, CD44, BDNF, GNAQ, RUNX1, ETS1, NGFR, MME, SEMA6A, GNAI1, IFIT1, and MEIS1. DNA fragments BDNF_1_ (r = 0.931,p< 0.0001) and SQSTM1_2_NEW (r = 0.758,p= 0.0043) were positively correlated with the expressions of corresponding genes, and MYC_1_ (r = -0.8245,p= 0.001) was negatively correlated. Furthermore, ELISA confirmed TNFSF10 and BDNF were elevated in the peripheral blood of AMI patients (p= 0.0284 andp= 0.0142, respectively).

When linked to somatic mutations in myeloid malignancy-associated genes, such as TET2-mediated clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential or CHIP, it represents increased risk for hematological malignancies and cardiovascular disease. IL1? is elevated in patients with CHIP, however, its effect is not well understood. Here we show that IL1? promotes expansion of pro-inflammatory monocytes/macrophages, coinciding with a failure in the demethylation of lymphoid and erythroid lineage associated enhancers and transcription factor binding sites, in a mouse model of CHIP with hematopoietic-cell-specific deletion of Tet2. DNA-methylation is significantly lost in wild type HSPCs upon IL1? administration, which is resisted by Tet2-deficient HSPCs, and thus IL1? enhances the self-renewing ability of Tet2-deficient HSPCs by upregulating genes associated with self-renewal and by resisting demethylation of transcription factor binding sites related to terminal differentiation. Using aged mouse models and human progenitors, we demonstrate that targeting IL1 signaling could represent an early intervention strategy in preleukemic disorders. In summary, our results show that Tet2 is an important mediator of an IL1?-promoted epigenetic program to maintain the fine balance between self-renewal and lineage differentiation during hematopoiesis.© 2023.

Both elements are mutually reinforcing, thereby expediting the ontogeny and progression of malignant neoplasms. Intriguingly, recent findings have highlighted the translocation of metabolites and metabolic enzymes from the cytoplasm into the nuclear compartment, where they appear to be intimately associated with tumor cell proliferation. Despite these advancements, significant gaps persist in our understanding of their specific roles within the nuclear milieu, their modulatory effects on gene transcription and cellular proliferation, and the intricacies of their coordination with the genomic landscape. In this comprehensive review, we endeavor to elucidate the regulatory landscape of metabolic signaling within the nuclear domain, namely nuclear metabolic signaling involving metabolites and metabolic enzymes. We explore the roles and molecular mechanisms through which metabolic flux and enzymatic activity impact critical nuclear processes, including epigenetic modulation, DNA damage repair, and gene expression regulation. In conclusion, we underscore the paramount significance of nuclear metabolic signaling in cancer biology and enumerate potential therapeutic targets, associated pharmacological interventions, and implications for clinical applications.

A subset of SCLCs that lose their ASCL1 neuroendocrine phenotype and restore innate immune signaling (termed the ""inflammatory"" subtype) have durable responses to PD-L1. Some SCLCs are highly sensitive to Aurora kinase inhibitors, but early-phase trials show short-lived responses, suggesting effective therapeutic combinations are needed to increase their durability. Using immunocompetent SCLC genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) and syngeneic xenografts, we show durable efficacy with the combination of a highly specific Aurora A kinase inhibitor (LSN3321213) and PD-L1. LSN3321213 causes accumulation of tumor cells in mitosis with lower ASCL1 expression and higher expression of interferon target genes and antigen-presentation genes mimicking the inflammatory subtype in a cell-cycle-dependent manner.

Here, we aimed to analyze SPRYD7's role in CRC via functional proteomics. Through immunohistochemistry, the overexpression of SPRYD7 was observed to be associated with the poor survival of CRC patients and with an aggressive and metastatic phenotype. Stable SPRYD7 overexpression was performed in KM12C and SW480 poorly metastatic CRC cells and in their isogenic highly metastatic-to-liver-KM12SM-and-to-lymph-nodes SW620 CRC cells, respectively. Upon upregulation of SPRYD7, in vitro and in vivo functional assays confirmed a key role of SPRYD7 in the invasion and migration of CRC cells and in liver homing and tumor growth. Additionally, transient siRNA SPRYD7 silencing allowed us to confirm in vitro functional results. Furthermore, SPRYD7 was observed as an inductor of angiogenesis.

While ultrasonography and mammography have enabled the more reliable detection of early-stage breast cancer, these approaches entail high rates of false positive and false negative results Mammograms also expose patients to radiation, raising clinical concerns. As such, there is substantial interest in the development of more accurate and efficacious approaches to diagnosing breast cancer in its early stages when patients are more likely to benefit from curative treatment efforts. Blood-based biomarkers derived from the tumor microenvironment (TME) have frequently been studied as candidate targets that can enable tumor detection when used for patient screening.

In this study, we explored the use ofC. elegansto examine the toxicities of alkylating sulphur mustard analogues, specifically the monofunctional agent 2-chloroethyl-ethyl sulphide (CEES) and the bifunctional, crosslinking agent mechlorethamine (HN2). We exposed wild-type worms at different life cycle stages (from larvae L1 to adulthood day 10) to CEES or HN2 and scored their viability 24 h later. The susceptibility ofC. elegansto CEES and HN2 paralleled that of human cells, with HN2 exhibiting higher toxicity than CEES, reflected in LC50values in the high µM to low mM range. Importantly, the effects were dependent on the worms' developmental stage as well as organismic age: the highest susceptibility was observed in L1, whereas the lowest was observed in L4 worms. In adult worms, susceptibility to alkylating agents increased with advanced age, especially to HN2. To examine reproductive effects, L4 worms were exposed to CEES and HN2, and both the offspring and the percentage of unhatched eggs were assessed. Moreover, germline apoptosis was assessed by usingced-1p::GFP (MD701) worms. In contrast to concentrations that elicited low toxicities to L4 worms, CEES and HN2 were highly toxic to germline cells, manifesting as increased germline apoptosis as well as reduced offspring number and percentage of eggs hatched. Again, HN2 exhibited stronger effects than CEES. Compound specificity was also evident in toxicities to dopaminergic neurons-HN2 exposure affected expression of dopamine transporter DAT-1 (strain BY200) at lower concentrations than CEES, suggesting a higher neurotoxic effect. Mechanistically, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) has been linked to mustard agent toxicities. Therefore, the NAD+-dependent system was investigated in the response to CEES and HN2 treatment. Overall NAD+levels in worm extracts were revealed to be largely resistant to mustard exposure except for high concentrations, which lowered the NAD+levels in L4 worms 24 h post-treatment. Interestingly, however, mutant worms lacking components of NAD+-dependent pathways involved in genome maintenance, namelypme-2,parg-2, andsirt-2.1showed a higher and compound-specific susceptibility, indicating an active role of NAD+in genotoxic stress response. In conclusion, the present results demonstrate thatC. elegansrepresents an attractive model to study the toxicology of alkylating agents, which supports its use in mechanistic as well as intervention studies with major strength in the possibility to analyze toxicities at different life cycle stages.",8.79E-50

In this review, we focus on the current understanding and highlight knowledge gaps of the contribution of histone variants to aneuploidy, and we have compiled a database (HistoPloidyDB) of histone gene alterations linked to aneuploidy in cancers of the The Cancer Genome Atlas project.Copyright © 2023 Ragusa and Vagnarelli.",7.11E-50
,37940583,Beyond the 5-HT(2A) Receptor: Classic and Nonclassic Targets in Psychedelic Drug Action.,J Neurosci,"Serotonergic psychedelics, such as psilocybin and LSD, have garnered significant attention in recent years for their potential therapeutic effects and unique mechanisms of action. These compounds exert their primary effects through activating serotonin 5-HT2Areceptors, found predominantly in cortical regions. By interacting with these receptors, serotonergic psychedelics induce alterations in perception, cognition, and emotions, leading to the characteristic psychedelic experience. One of the most crucial aspects of serotonergic psychedelics is their ability to promote neuroplasticity, the formation of new neural connections, and rewire neuronal networks. This neuroplasticity is believed to underlie their therapeutic potential for various mental health conditions, including depression, anxiety, and substance use disorders. In this mini-review, we will discuss how the 5-HT2Areceptor activation is just one facet of the complex mechanisms of action of serotonergic psychedelics. They also interact with other serotonin receptor subtypes, such as 5-HT1Aand 5-HT2Creceptors, and with neurotrophin receptors (e.g., tropomyosin receptor kinase B). These interactions contribute to the complexity of their effects on perception, mood, and cognition. Moreover, as psychedelic research advances, there is an increasing interest in developing nonhallucinogenic derivatives of these drugs to create safer and more targeted medications for psychiatric disorders by removing the hallucinogenic properties while retaining the potential therapeutic benefits. These nonhallucinogenic derivatives would offer patients therapeutic advantages without the intense psychedelic experience, potentially reducing the risks of adverse reactions. Finally, we discuss the potential of psychedelics as substrates for post-translational modification of proteins as part of their mechanism of action.Copyright © 2023 the authors.",6.63E-50

Intratumoral heterogeneity with a wide range of proteomic, genetic, and epigenetic dysregulation contributes to treatment resistance and poor prognosis, thus demanding novel therapeutic approaches. To date, numerous clinical trials have been developed to target the proteome and epigenome of high-grade gliomas with promising results. However, studying RNA modifications, or RNA epitranscriptomics, is a new frontier within neuro-oncology. RNA epitranscriptomics was discovered in the 1970s, but in the last decade, the extent of modification of mRNA and various non-coding RNAs has emerged and been implicated in transposable element activation and many other oncogenic processes within the tumor microenvironment. This review provides background information and discusses the therapeutic potential of agents modulating epitranscriptomics in high-grade gliomas. A particular emphasis will be placed on how combination therapies that include immune agents targeting hERV-mediated viral mimicry could improve the treatment of GBM.© 2023. The Author(s).",5.61E-50
,37950299,Statistical learning quantifies transposable element-mediated cis-regulation.,Genome Biol,"Transposable elements (TEs) have colonized the genomes of most metazoans, and many TE-embedded sequences function as cis-regulatory elements (CREs) for genes involved in a wide range of biological processes from early embryogenesis to innate immune responses. Because of their repetitive nature, TEs have the potential to form CRE platforms enabling the coordinated and genome-wide regulation of protein-coding genes by only a handful of trans-acting transcription factors (TFs).Here, we directly test this hypothesis through mathematical modeling and demonstrate that differences in expression at protein-coding genes alone are sufficient to estimate the magnitude and significance of TE-contributed cis-regulatory activities, even in contexts where TE-derived transcription fails to do so. We leverage hundreds of overexpression experiments and estimate that, overall, gene expression is influenced by TE-embedded CREs situated within approximately 500?kb of promoters. Focusing on the cis-regulatory potential of TEs within the gene regulatory network of human embryonic stem cells, we find that pluripotency-specific and evolutionarily young TE subfamilies can be reactivated by TFs involved in post-implantation embryogenesis. Finally, we show that TE subfamilies can be split into truly regulatorily active versus inactive fractions based on additional information such as matched epigenomic data, observing that TF binding may better predict TE cis-regulatory activity than differences in histone marks.Our results suggest that TE-embedded CREs contribute to gene regulation during and beyond gastrulation. On a methodological level, we provide a statistical tool that infers TE-dependent cis-regulation from RNA-seq data alone, thus facilitating the study of TEs in the next-generation sequencing era.© 2023.

An array of complex genetic and epigenetic facets majorly contributes to the progression of AD, thus providing significant insight into the regulatory mechanism of microRNA (miRNA). miRNAs are short, non-coding RNAs that have been identified as essential contributors to the post-transcriptional regulation of host genome expression and as crucial regulators of a myriad of biological processes such as immune homeostasis, T helper cell differentiation, central and peripheral tolerance, and immune cell development.This article tends to deliberate and conceptualize the brief pathogenesis and pertinent epigenetic regulatory mechanism as well as miRNA networks majorly affecting five different ADs namely rheumatoid arthritis (RA), type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis (MS), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and inflammatory bowel disorder (IBD) thereby providing novel miRNA-based theranostic interventions.Pertaining to the differential expression of miRNA attributed in target tissues and cellular bodies of innate and adaptive immunity, a paradigm of scientific expeditions suggests an optimistic correlation between immunogenic dysfunction and miRNA alterations.Therefore, it is not astonishing that dysregulations in miRNA expression patterns are now recognized in a wide spectrum of disorders, establishing themselves as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Owing to its theranostic potencies, miRNA targets have been widely utilized in the development of biosensors and other therapeutic molecules originating from the same.© 2023 The Authors.

,38000027,Partial in vivo reprogramming enables injury-free intestinal regeneration via autonomous Ptgs1 induction.,Sci Adv,"Tissue regeneration after injury involves the dedifferentiation of somatic cells, a natural adaptive reprogramming that leads to the emergence of injury-responsive cells with fetal-like characteristics. However, there is no direct evidence that adaptive reprogramming involves a shared molecular mechanism with direct cellular reprogramming. Here, we induced dedifferentiation of intestinal epithelial cells using OSKM (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc) in vivo. The OSKM-induced forced dedifferentiation showed similar molecular features of intestinal regeneration, including a transition from homeostatic cell types to injury-responsive-like cell types. These injury-responsive-like cells, sharing gene signatures of revival stem cells and atrophy-induced villus epithelial cells, actively assisted tissue regeneration following damage. In contrast to normal intestinal regeneration involvingPtgs2induction, the OSKM promotes autonomous production of prostaglandin E2 via epithelialPtgs1expression. These results indicate prostaglandin synthesis is a common mechanism for intestinal regeneration but involves a different enzyme when partial reprogramming is applied to the intestinal epithelium.",2.36E-50
,38035131,Gene essentiality in cancer is better predicted by mRNA abundance than by gene regulatory network-inferred activity.,NAR Cancer,"Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) are often deregulated in tumor cells, resulting in altered transcriptional programs that facilitate tumor growth. These altered networks may make tumor cells vulnerable to the inhibition of specific regulatory proteins. Consequently, the reconstruction of GRNs in tumors is often proposed as a means to identify therapeutic targets. While there are examples of individual targets identified using GRNs, the extent to which GRNs can be used to predict sensitivity to targeted intervention in general remains unknown. Here we use the results of genome-wide CRISPR screens to systematically assess the ability of GRNs to predict sensitivity to gene inhibition in cancer cell lines. Using GRNs derived from multiple sources, including GRNs reconstructed from tumor transcriptomes and from curated databases, we infer regulatory gene activity in cancer cell lines from ten cancer types. We then ask, in each cancer type, if the inferred regulatory activity of each gene is predictive of sensitivity to CRISPR perturbation of that gene. We observe slight variation in the correlation between gene regulatory activity and gene sensitivity depending on the source of the GRN and the activity estimation method used. However, we find that there is consistently a stronger relationship between mRNA abundance and gene sensitivity than there is between regulatory gene activity and gene sensitivity. This is true both when gene sensitivity is treated as a binary and a quantitative property. Overall, our results suggest that gene sensitivity is better predicted by measured expression than by GRN-inferred activity.© The Author(s) 2023.

,38135758,Decoding the basis of histological variation in human cancer.,Nat Rev Cancer,"Molecular abnormalities that shape human neoplasms dissociate their phenotypic landscape from that of the healthy counterpart. Through the lens of a microscope, tumour pathology optically captures such aberrations projected onto a tissue slide and has categorized human epithelial neoplasms into distinct histological subtypes based on the diverse morphogenetic and molecular programmes that they manifest. Tumour histology often reflects tumour aggressiveness, patient prognosis and therapeutic vulnerability, and thus has been used as a de facto diagnostic tool and for making clinical decisions. However, it remains elusive how the diverse histological subtypes arise and translate into pleiotropic biological phenotypes. Molecular analysis of clinical tumour tissues and their culture, including patient-derived organoids, and add-back genetic reconstruction of tumorigenic pathways using gene engineering in culture models and rodents further elucidated molecular mechanisms that underlie morphological variations. Such mechanisms include genetic mutations and epigenetic alterations in cellular identity codes that erode hard-wired morphological programmes and histologically digress tumours from the native tissues. Interestingly, tumours acquire the ability to grow independently of the niche-driven stem cell ecosystem along with these morphological alterations, providing a biological rationale for histological diversification during tumorigenesis. This Review comprehensively summarizes our current understanding of such plasticity in the histological and lineage commitment fostered cooperatively by molecular alterations and the tumour environment, and describes basic and clinical implications for future cancer therapy.© 2023.

,38012706,Muscle miRNAs are influenced by sex at baseline and in response to exercise.,BMC Biol,"Sex differences in microRNA (miRNA) expression profiles have been found across multiple tissues. Skeletal muscle is one of the most sex-biased tissues of the body. MiRNAs are necessary for development and have regulatory roles in determining skeletal muscle phenotype and have important roles in the response to exercise in muscle. Yet there is limited research into the role and regulation of miRNAs in the skeletal muscle at baseline and in response to exercise, a well-known modulator of miRNA expression. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of sex on miRNA expression in the skeletal muscle at baseline and after an acute bout of high-intensity interval exercise. A total of 758 miRNAs were measured using Taqman®miRNA arrays in the skeletal muscle of 42 healthy participants from the Gene SMART study (23 males and 19 females of comparable fitness levels and aged 18-45 years), of which 308 were detected. MiRNAs that differed by sex at baseline and whose change in expression following high-intensity interval exercise differed between the sexes were identified using mixed linear models adjusted for BMI and Wpeak. We performed in silico analyses to identify the putative gene targets of the exercise-induced, sex-specific miRNAs and overrepresentation analyses to identify enriched biological pathways. We performed functional assays by overexpressing two sex-biased miRNAs in human primary muscle cells derived from male and female donors to understand their downstream effects on the transcriptome.At baseline, 148 miRNAs were differentially expressed in the skeletal muscle between the sexes. Interaction analysis identified 111 miRNAs whose response to an acute bout of high-intensity interval exercise differed between the sexes. Sex-biased miRNA gene targets were enriched for muscle-related processes including proliferation and differentiation of muscle cells and numerous metabolic pathways, suggesting that miRNAs participate in programming sex differences in skeletal muscle function. Overexpression of sex-biased miRNA-30a and miRNA-30c resulted in profound changes in gene expression profiles that were specific to the sex of the cell donor in human primary skeletal muscle cells.We uncovered sex differences in the expression levels of muscle miRNAs at baseline and in response to acute high-intensity interval exercise. These miRNAs target regulatory pathways essential to skeletal muscle development and metabolism. Our findings highlight that miRNAs play an important role in programming sex differences in the skeletal muscle phenotype.© 2023. The Author(s).",1.17E-50

However, the expression pattern and biological roles of TMEM178, a member of TMEM family, remains unclear in breast cancer (BRCA).Methylation and RNA-seq data were obtained to explore methylation level. Expression of TMEM178, methylation inhibitor 5-Aza-CdR was used to verify the effect of methylation status on the expression of TMEM178. We comprehensively investigated the prognostic outcomes, biological functions and effects on immune cell infiltration of the TMEM178 in BRCA using multiple bioinformatics methods.The expression of TMEM178 was downregulated and negatively correlated with the level of DNA methylation and DNA methyltransferase (DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B) in BRCA. Consistently, TMEM178 mRNA were confirmed to be downregulated, while upregulated in response to treatment with methylation inhibitor 5-Aza-CdR by RT-qPCR. Patients with high expression of TMEM178 have better prognosis and are more sensitive to targeted drug Pazopanib. Immune infiltration analysis showed that the infiltration levels of CD4+T cell subsets were reduced in BRAC tissues with high TMEM178 expression, and immunosuppressive molecules of T-cell exhaustion were lower expression level.Hypermethylation of the TMEM178 promoter region was a contributing factor to the downregulation of its expression, and TMEM178 may reflect a prognostic and immunosuppressive situation in BRCA.Copyright© 2023 Yan et al.

Deregulation of these regulatory molecules is associated with cell state transitions, which in turn is accountable for diverse maladies, including developmental disorders, metabolic disorders, and most significantly, cancer. A decade back most transcription factors, the key enablers of disease development, were historically viewed as 'undruggable'; however, in the intervening years, a wealth of literature validated that they can be targeted indirectly through transcriptional co-activators, their confederates in various physiological and molecular processes. These co-activators, along with transcription factors, have the ability to initiate and modulate transcription of diverse genes necessary for normal physiological functions, whereby, deregulation of such interactions may foster tissue-specific disease phenotype. Hence, it is essential to analyze how these co-activators modulate specific multilateral processes in coordination with other factors. The proposed review attempts to elaborate an in-depth account of the transcription co-activators, their involvement in transcription regulation, and context-specific contributions to pathophysiological conditions. This review also addresses an issue that has not been dealt with in a comprehensive manner and hopes to direct attention towards future research that will encompass patient-friendly therapeutic strategies, where drugs targeting co-activators will have enhanced benefits and reduced side effects. Additional insights into currently available therapeutic interventions and the associated constraints will eventually reveal multitudes of advanced therapeutic targets aiming for disease amelioration and good patient prognosis.© 2023.

Transgenic animals mimicking human genetic diseases have long been used as a primary research tool to decipher the underlying pathogenesis, but there are still some obvious limitations. As an alternative strategy, patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), particularly three-dimensional (3D) organoid technology, are considered a promising platform for modeling different forms of IRDs, including retinitis pigmentosa, Leber congenital amaurosis, X-linked recessive retinoschisis, Batten disease, achromatopsia, and best vitelliform macular dystrophy. Here, this paper focuses on the status of patient-derived iPSCs and organoids in IRDs in recent years concerning disease modeling and therapeutic exploration, along with potential challenges for translating laboratory research to clinical application. Finally, the importance of human iPSCs and organoids in combination with emerging technologies such as multi-omics integration analysis, 3D bioprinting, or microfluidic chip platform are highlighted.

,37932451,CRISPR-Cas9-based functional interrogation of unconventional translatome reveals human cancer dependency on cryptic non-canonical open reading frames.,Nat Struct Mol Biol,"Emerging evidence suggests that cryptic translation beyond the annotated translatome produces proteins with developmental or physiological functions. However, functions of cryptic non-canonical open reading frames (ORFs) in cancer remain largely unknown. To fill this gap and systematically identify colorectal cancer (CRC) dependency on non-canonical ORFs, we apply an integrative multiomic strategy, combining ribosome profiling and a CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screen with large-scale analysis of molecular and clinical data. Many such ORFs are upregulated in CRC compared to normal tissues and are associated with clinically relevant molecular subtypes. We confirm the in vivo tumor-promoting function of the microprotein SMIMP, encoded by a primate-specific, long noncoding RNA, the expression of which is associated with poor prognosis in CRC, is low in normal tissues and is specifically elevated in CRC and several other cancer types. Mechanistically, SMIMP interacts with the ATPase-forming domains of SMC1A, the core subunit of the cohesin complex, and facilitates SMC1A binding to cis-regulatory elements to promote epigenetic repression of the tumor-suppressive cell cycle regulators encoded by CDKN1A and CDKN2B. Thus, our study reveals a cryptic microprotein as an important component of cohesin-mediated gene regulation and suggests that the 'dark' proteome, encoded by cryptic non-canonical ORFs, may contain potential therapeutic or diagnostic targets.© 2023.

Although technology has seen significant development, this issue has still not been adequately resolved. Therefore, we conducted a bibliometric analysis to assess the progress in research on sleep quality and associated genes over the past 2 decades. Through our statistical data and discussions, we aimed to provide researchers with better research directions and ideas, thus promoting the advancement of this field.On December 29, 2022, we utilized bibliometric techniques, such as co-cited and cluster analysis and keyword co-occurrence, using tools such as CiteSpace, VOSviewer, and the Online Analysis Platform of Literature Metrology (http://bibliometric.com/), to conduct a thorough examination of the relevant publications extracted from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC). Our analysis aimed to identify the emerging trends and hot spots in this field while also predicting their potential development in future.Cluster analysis of the co-cited literature revealed the most popular terms relating to sleep quality and associated genes in the manner of cluster labels; these included genome-wide association studies (GWAS), circadian rhythms, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), DNA methylation, and depression. Keyword burst detection suggested that obstructive sleep apnea, circadian clock, circadian genes, and polygenic risk score were newly emergent research hot spots.Based on this bibliometric analysis of the publications in the last 20 years, a comprehensive analysis of the literature clarified the contributions, changes in research hot spots, and evolution of research techniques regarding sleep quality and associated genes.

,38027209,"Developmental, cytogenetic and epigenetic consequences of removing complex proteins and adding melatonin during in vitro maturation of bovine oocytes.",Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),"In vitromaturation (IVM) of germinal vesicle intact oocytes prior toin vitrofertilization (IVF) is practiced widely in animals. In human assisted reproduction it is generally reserved for fertility preservation or where ovarian stimulation is contraindicated. Standard practice incorporates complex proteins (CP), in the form of serum and/or albumin, into IVM media to mimic the ovarian follicle environment. However, the undefined nature of CP, together with batch variation and ethical concerns regarding their origin, necessitate the development of more defined formulations. A known component of follicular fluid, melatonin, has multifaceted roles including that of a metabolic regulator and antioxidant. In certain circumstances it can enhance oocyte maturation. At this stage in development, the germinal-vesicle intact oocyte is prone to aneuploidy and epigenetic dysregulation.To determine the developmental, cytogenetic and epigenetic consequences of removing CP and including melatonin during bovine IVM.The study comprised a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement comparing (i) the inclusion or exclusion of CP, and (ii) the addition (100 nM) or omission of melatonin, during IVM. Cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) were retrieved from stimulated cycles. Following IVM and IVF, putative zygotes were cultured to Day 8 in standard media. RNAseq was performed on isolated cumulus cells, cytogenetic analyses (SNP-based algorithms) on isolated trophectoderm cells, and DNA methylation analysis (reduced representation bisulfite sequencing) on isolated cells of the inner-cell mass.Removal of CP during IVM led to modest reductions in blastocyst development, whilst added melatonin was beneficial in the presence but detrimental in the absence of CP. The composition of IVM media did not affect the nature or incidence of chromosomal abnormalities but cumulus-cell transcript expression indicated altered metabolism (primarily lipid) in COCs. These effects preceded the establishment of distinct metabolic and epigenetic signatures several days later in expanded and hatching blastocysts.These findings highlight the importance of lipid, particularly sterol, metabolism by the COC during IVM. They lay the foundation for future studies that seek to develop chemically defined systems of IVM for the generation of transferrable embryos that are both cytogenetically and epigenetically normal.Copyright © 2023 Tutt, Guven-Ates, Kwong, Simmons, Sang, Silvestri, Canedo-Ribeiro, Handyside, Labrecque, Sirard, Emes, Griffin and Sinclair.",2E-51

This review delves into the emerging significance of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in transforming the landscape of CUP diagnosis, classification, and treatment. ML approaches, trained on extensive molecular profiling data, have shown promise in accurately predicting tissue of origin. Genomic profiling, encompassing driver mutations and copy number variations, plays a pivotal role in CUP diagnosis by providing insights into tumor type-specific oncogenic alterations. Mutational signatures (MS), reflecting somatic mutation patterns, offer further insights into CUP diagnosis. Known MS with established etiology, such as ultraviolet (UV) light-induced DNA damage and tobacco exposure, have been identified in cases of dedifferentiated/transdifferentiated melanoma and carcinoma. Deep learning models that integrate gene expression data and DNA methylation patterns offer insights into tissue lineage and tumor classification. In digital pathology, machine learning algorithms analyze whole-slide images to aid in CUP classification. Finally, precision oncology, guided by molecular profiling, offers targeted therapies independent of primary tissue identification. Clinical trials assigning CUP patients to molecularly guided therapies, including targetable alterations and tumor mutation burden as an immunotherapy biomarker, have resulted in improved overall survival in a subset of patients. In conclusion, AI- and ML-driven approaches are revolutionizing CUP management by enhancing diagnostic accuracy. Precision oncology utilizing enhanced molecular profiling facilitates the identification of targeted therapies that transcend the need to identify the tissue of origin, ultimately improving patient outcomes.© 2023.

We annotate all significant variants and those variants in high LD (R2> 0.8) from the COVID-19 host genetics initiative (HGI) and identify risk genes by recognizing genes intolerant nonsynonymous mutations in coding regions and genes associated with cis-expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTL) in non-coding regions. These genes are enriched in the immune response pathway and viral life cycle. It has been found that host RNA binding proteins (RBPs) participate in different phases of the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle. We collect 503 RBPs that interact with SARS-CoV-2 RNA concluded from in vitro studies. Combining risk genes from the HGI with RBPs, we identify two COVID-19 risk loci that regulate the expression levels of FUBP1 and RAB2A in the lung. Due to the risk allele, COVID-19 patients show downregulation of FUBP1 and upregulation of RAB2A. Using single-cell RNA sequencing data, we show that FUBP1 and RAB2A are expressed in SARS-CoV-2-infected upper respiratory tract epithelial cells.

It is critical to create a specific prognostication methodology and to investigate additional treatment options for CTNNB1-mutant HCCs.A total of 926 samples in five independent cohorts were enrolled in this study, including 127 CTNNB1-mutant samples and 75 estimated CTNNB1-mutant samples. The prognostic signature was constructed by LASSO-Cox regression and evaluated by bioinformatics analyses. The selection of possible drug targets and agents was produced based on the expression profiles and drug sensitivity data of cancer cell lines in two databases.A prognostic signature based on 15 genes categorized the CTNNB1-mutant HCCs into two groups with different risks. Compared to low-risk patients, high-risk patients had significantly inferior prognoses. ROC curve and multivariate analysis also indicated the superior performance of our signature on the prognosis estimation, particularly in CTNNB1-mutant HCCs. Besides, the nomogram was constructed according to the prognostic signature with excellent predictive performance confirmed by the calibration curve. Subsequently, we suggested that AT-7519 and PHA-793887 might be potential drug agents for high-risk patients.We established a 15-gene prognostic model, particularly in HCCs with CTNNB1 mutations with good predictive efficiency. Besides, we explored the potential drug targets and agents for patients with high risk.

Many HSV-1 genomes have been sequenced with high-throughput sequencing technologies and the annotation of these genome sequences heavily relies on the known genes in reference strains. Consequently, the accuracy of reference strain annotation is critical for future research and treatment of HSV-1 infection. In this study, we analyzed RNA-Seq data of HSV-1 from NCBI databases and discovered a novel intron in the overlapping coding sequence (CDS) ofUS10andUS11, and the 3' UTR ofUS12in strain 17, a commonly used HSV-1 reference strain. To comprehensively understand the sharedUS10/US11/US12intron structure, we usedUS11as a representative and surveyed allUS11gene sequences from the NCBI nt/nr database. A total of 193 high-qualityUS11sequences were obtained, of which 186 sequences have a domain of uninterrupted tandemly repeated RXP (Arg-X-Pro) in the C-terminus half of the protein. In total, 97 of the 186 sequences encode US11 protein with the same length of the mature US11 in strain 17:26 of them have the same structure ofUS11and can be spliced as in strain 17; 71 of them have transcripts that are the same as matureUS11mRNA in strain 17. In total, 76US11gene sequences have either canonical or known noncanonical intron border sequences and may be spliced like strain 17 and obtain matureUS11CDS with the same length. If not spliced, they will have extra RXP repeats. A tandemly repeated RXP domain was proposed to be essential for US11 to bind with RNA and other host factors. US10 protein sequences from the same strains have also been studied. The results of this study show that even a frequently used reference organism may have errors in widely used databases. This study provides accurate annotation of theUS10,US11, andUS12gene structure, which will build a more solid foundation to study expression regulation of the function of these genes.",1.12E-51

To unravel the intricacies of tumor cells and the immune microenvironment in MIA, this study performs a comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic analysis and profiles the transcriptomes of 156,447 cells from fresh paired MIA and invasive adenocarcinoma (IA) tumor samples, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and adjacent normal tissue samples from three patients with synchronous multiple primary lung adenocarcinoma. This study highlights a connection and heterogeneity between the tumor ecosystem of MIA and IA. MIA tumor cells exhibited high expression of aquaporin-1 and angiotensin II receptor type 2 and a basal-like molecular character. Furthermore, it identifies that cathepsin B+tumor-associated macrophages may over-activate CD8+T cells in MIA, leading to an enrichment of granzyme K+senescent CD8+T cells, indicating the possibility of malignant progression behind the indolent appearance of MIA.

,38048343,FMRP deficiency leads to multifactorial dysregulation of splicing and mislocalization of MBNL1 to the cytoplasm.,PLoS Biol,"Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is often modeled in Fmr1 knockout mice where the RNA-binding protein FMRP is absent. Here, we show that in Fmr1-deficient mice, RNA mis-splicing occurs in several brain regions and peripheral tissues. To assess molecular mechanisms of splicing mis-regulation, we employed N2A cells depleted of Fmr1. In the absence of FMRP, RNA-specific exon skipping events are linked to the splicing factors hnRNPF, PTBP1, and MBNL1. FMRP regulates the translation of Mbnl1 mRNA as well as Mbnl1 RNA auto-splicing. Elevated Mbnl1 auto-splicing in FMRP-deficient cells results in the loss of a nuclear localization signal (NLS)-containing exon. This in turn alters the nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio of MBNL1. This redistribution of MBNL1 isoforms in Fmr1-deficient cells could result in downstream splicing changes in other RNAs. Indeed, further investigation revealed that splicing disruptions resulting from Fmr1 depletion could be rescued by overexpression of nuclear MBNL1. Altered Mbnl1 auto-splicing also occurs in human FXS postmortem brain. These data suggest that FMRP-controlled translation and RNA processing may cascade into a general dys-regulation of splicing in Fmr1-deficient cells.Copyright: © 2023 Jung et al.

,38040871,Leveraging synthetic lethality to uncover potential therapeutic target in gastric cancer.,Cancer Gene Ther,"Since trastuzumab was approved in 2012 for the first-line treatment of gastric cancer (GC), no significant advancement in GC targeted therapies has occurred. Synthetic lethality refers to the concept that simultaneous dysfunction of a pair of genes results in a lethal effect on cells, while the loss of an individual gene does not cause this effect. Through exploiting synthetic lethality, novel targeted therapies can be developed for the individualized treatment of GC. In this study, we proposed a computational strategy named Gastric cancer Specific Synthetic Lethality inference (GSSL) to identify synthetic lethal interactions in GC. GSSL analysis was used to infer probable synthetic lethality in GC using four accessible clinical datasets. In addition, prediction results were confirmed by experiments. GSSL analysis identified a total of 34 candidate synthetic lethal pairs, which included 33 unique targets. Among the synthetic lethal gene pairs, TP53-CHEK1 was selected for further experimental validation. Both computational and experimental results indicated that inhibiting CHEK1 could be a potential therapeutic strategy for GC patients with TP53 mutation. Meanwhile, in vitro experimental validation of two novel synthetic lethal pairs TP53-AURKB and ARID1A-EP300 further proved the universality and reliability of GSSL. Collectively, GSSL has been shown to be a reliable and feasible method for comprehensive analysis of inferring synthetic lethal interactions of GC, which may offer novel insight into the precision medicine and individualized treatment of GC.© 2023.

,37953873,Characterization of transcriptional enhancers in the chicken genome using CRISPR-mediated activation.,Front Genome Ed,"DNA regulatory elements intricately control when, where, and how genes are activated. Therefore, understanding the function of these elements could unveil the complexity of the genetic regulation network. Genome-wide significant variants are predominantly found in non-coding regions of DNA, so comprehending the predicted functional regulatory elements is crucial for understanding the biological context of these genomic markers, which can be incorporated into breeding programs. The emergence of CRISPR technology has provided a powerful tool for studying non-coding regulatory elements in genomes. In this study, we leveraged epigenetic data from the Functional Annotation of Animal Genomes project to identify promoter and putative enhancer regions associated with three genes (HBBA, IRF7, andPPARG) in the chicken genome. To identify the enhancer regions, we designed guide RNAs targeting the promoter and candidate enhancer regions and utilized CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) with dCas9-p300 and dCas9-VPR as transcriptional activators in chicken DF-1 cells. By comparing the expression levels of target genes between the promoter activation and the co-activation of the promoter and putative enhancers, we were able to identify functional enhancers that exhibited augmented upregulation. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate the remarkable efficiency of CRISPRa in precisely manipulating the expression of endogenous genes by targeting regulatory elements in the chicken genome, highlighting its potential for functional validation of non-coding regions.Copyright © 2023 Han, Lee and Kim.",5.59E-52
,38157020,TRIOBP modulates Î²-catenin signaling by regulation of miR-29b in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.,Cell Mol Life Sci,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal and devastating lung disease of unknown etiology, described as the result of multiple cycles of epithelial cell injury and fibroblast activation. Despite this impressive increase in understanding, a therapy that reverses this form of fibrosis remains elusive. In our previous study, we found that miR-29b has a therapeutic effect on pulmonary fibrosis. However, its anti-fibrotic mechanism is not yet clear. Recently, our study identified that F-Actin Binding Protein (TRIOBP) is one of the target genes of miR-29b and found that deficiency of TRIOBP increases resistance to lung fibrosis in vivo. TRIOBP knockdown inhibited the proliferation of epithelial cells and attenuated the activation of fibroblasts. In addition, deficiency of Trio Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factor (TRIO) in epithelial cells and fibroblasts decreases susceptibility to lung fibrosis. TRIOBP interacting with TRIO promoted abnormal epithelial-mesenchymal crosstalk and modulated the nucleocytoplasmic translocation of ?-catenin. We concluded that the miR-29b?TRIOBP-TRIO-?-catenin axis might be a key anti-fibrotic axis in IPF to regulate lung regeneration and fibrosis, which may provide a promising treatment strategy for lung fibrosis.© 2023.

,37961628,Comprehensive detection of structural variation and transposable element differences between wild type laboratory lineages of C. elegans.,bioRxiv,"Genomic structural variations (SVs) and transposable elements (TEs) can be significant contributors to genome evolution, altered gene expression, and risk of genetic diseases. Recent advancements in long-read sequencing have greatly improved the quality ofde novogenome assemblies and enhanced the detection of sequence variants at the scale of hundreds or thousands of bases. Comparisons between two diverged wild isolates ofCaenorhabditis elegans, the Bristol and Hawaiian strains, have been widely utilized in the analysis of small genetic variations. Genetic drift, including SVs and rearrangements of repeated sequences such as TEs, can occur over time from long-term maintenance of wild type isolates within the laboratory. To comprehensively detect both large and small structural variations as well as TEs due to genetic drift, we generatedde novogenome assemblies and annotations for each strain from our lab collection using both long- and short-read sequencing and compared our assemblies and annotations with that of other lab wild type strains. Within our lab assemblies, we annotate over 3.1Mb of sequence divergence between the Bristol and Hawaiian isolates: 337,584 SNPs, 94,503 small insertion-deletions (<50bp), and 4,334 structural variations (>50bp). Further, we define the location and movement of specific DNA TEs between N2 Bristol and CB4856 Hawaiian wild type isolates. Specifically, we find the N2 Bristol genome has 20.6% more TEs from theTc1/marinerfamily than the CB4856 Hawaiian genome. Moreover, we identified Zator elements as the most abundant and mobile TE family in the genome. Using specific TE sequences with unique SNPs, we also identify 38 TEs that moved intrachromosomally and 9 TEs that moved interchromosomally between the N2 Bristol and CB4856 Hawaiian genomes. By comparing thede novogenome assembly of our lab collection Bristol isolate to the VC2010 Bristol assembly, we also reveal that lab lineages display over 2 Mb of total variation: 1,162 SNPs, 1,528 indels, and 897 SVs with 95% of the variation due to SVs. Overall, our work demonstrates the unique contribution of SVs and TEs to variation and genetic drift between wild type laboratory strains assumed to be isogenic despite growing evidence of genetic drift and phenotypic variation.",4.74E-52
,38113003,The SWI/SNF Complex: A Frequently Mutated Chromatin Remodeling Complex in Cancer.,Cancer Treat Res,"The switch/sucrose non-fermenting (SWI/SNF) chromatin remodeling complex is a global regulator of gene expression known to maintain nucleosome-depleted regions at active enhancers and promoters. The mammalian SWI/SNF protein subunits are encoded by 29 genes and 11-15 subunits including an ATPase domain of either SMARCA4 (BRG1) or SMARCA2 (BRM) are assembled into a complex. Based on the distinct subunits, SWI/SNF are grouped into 3 major types (subfamilies): the canonical BRG1/BRM-associated factor (BAF/cBAF), polybromo-associated BAF (PBAF), and non-canonical BAF (GBAF/ncBAF). Pan-cancer genome sequencing studies have shown that nearly 25% of all cancers bear mutations in subunits of the SWI/SNF complex, many of which are loss of function (LOF) mutations, suggesting a tumor suppressor role. Inactivation of SWI/SNF complex subunits causes widespread epigenetic dysfunction, including increased dependence on antagonistic components such as polycomb repressor complexes (PRC1/2) and altered enhancer regulation, likely promoting an oncogenic state leading to cancer. Despite the prevalence of mutations, most SWI/SNF-mutant cancers lack targeted therapeutic strategies. Defining the dependencies created by LOF mutations in SWI/SNF subunits will identify better targets for these cancers.© 2023.

Here we explored how the epigenome contributes to matrix metalloprotease (MMP) dysregulation impacting tumor invasion, which is the first step of the metastatic process.We combined RNA expression and chromatin interaction data to identify insulator elements potentially associated with MMP gene expression and invasion. We employed CRISPR/Cas9 to disrupt the CCCTC-Binding Factor (CTCF) binding site on an insulator element downstream of the MMP8 gene (IE8) in two TNBC cellular models. We characterized these models by combining Hi-C, ATAC-seq, and RNA-seq with functional experiments to determine invasive ability. The potential of our findings to predict the progression of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), was tested in data from clinical specimens.We explored the clinical relevance of an insulator element located within the Chr11q22.2 locus, downstream of the MMP8 gene (IE8). This regulatory element resulted in a topologically associating domain (TAD) boundary that isolated nine MMP genes into two anti-correlated expression clusters. This expression pattern was associated with worse relapse-free (HR?=?1.57 [1.06?-?2.33]; p?=?0.023) and overall (HR?=?2.65 [1.31?-?5.37], p?=?0.005) survival of TNBC patients. After CRISPR/Cas9-mediated disruption of IE8, cancer cells showed a switch in the MMP expression signature, specifically downregulating the pro-invasive MMP1 gene and upregulating the antitumorigenic MMP8 gene, resulting in reduced invasive ability and collagen degradation. We observed that the MMP expression pattern predicts DCIS that eventually progresses into invasive ductal carcinomas (AUC?=?0.77, p?<?0.01).Our study demonstrates how the activation of an IE near the MMP8 gene determines the regional transcriptional regulation of MMP genes with opposing functional activity, ultimately influencing the invasive properties of aggressive forms of breast cancer.© 2023.

,37951955,Inhibition of UTX/KDM6A improves recovery of spinal cord injury by attenuating BSCB permeability and macrophage infiltration through the MLCK/p-MLC pathway.,J Neuroinflammation,"Spinal cord injury (SCI) can prompt an immediate disruption to the blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB). Restoring the integrity of this barrier is vital for the recovery of neurological function post-SCI. The UTX protein, a histone demethylase, has been shown in previous research to promote vascular regeneration and neurological recovery in mice with SCI. However, it is unclear whether UTX knockout could facilitate the recovery of the BSCB by reducing its permeability. In this study, we systematically studied BSCB disruption and permeability at different time points after SCI and found that conditional UTX deletion in endothelial cells (ECs) can reduce BSCB permeability, decrease inflammatory cell infiltration and ROS production, and improve neurological function recovery after SCI. Subsequently, we used RNA sequencing and ChIP-qPCR to confirm that conditional UTX knockout in ECs can down-regulate expression of myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), which specifically mediates myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation and is involved in actin contraction, cell retraction, and tight junctions (TJs) protein integrity. Moreover, we found that MLCK overexpression can increase the ratio of p-MLC/MLC, further break TJs, and exacerbate BSCB deterioration. Overall, our findings indicate that UTX knockout could inhibit the MLCK/p-MLC pathway, resulting in decreased BSCB permeability, and ultimately promoting neurological recovery in mice. These results suggest that UTX is a promising new target for treating SCI.© 2023. The Author(s).",2.8E-52

Despite the extensive knowledge of the ""light genome"", the poorly understood ""dark genome"" remains understudied. In this study, we integrated data from 20,412 protein-coding genes in Pharos and 8,395 patient-derived tumours from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to examine the genetic and pharmacological dependencies in human cancers and their treatment implications. We discovered that dark genes exhibited high mutation rates in certain cancers, similar to light genes. By combining the drug response profiles of cancer cells with cell fitness post-CRISPR-mediated gene knockout, we identified the crucial vulnerabilities associated with both dark and light genes. Our analysis also revealed that tumours harbouring dark gene mutations displayed worse overall and disease-free survival rates than those without such mutations. Furthermore, dark gene expression levels significantly influenced patient survival outcomes. Our findings demonstrated a similar distribution of genetic and pharmacological dependencies across the light and dark genomes, suggesting that targeting the dark genome holds promise for cancer treatment. This study underscores the need for ongoing research on the dark genome to better comprehend the underlying mechanisms of cancer and develop more effective therapies.Copyright: © 2023 Kafita et al.

,38023251,Lack of racial and ethnic diversity in lung cancer cell lines contributes to lung cancer health disparities.,Front Oncol,"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the United States and worldwide, and a major source of cancer health disparities. Lung cancer cell lines provide keyin vitromodels for molecular studies of lung cancer development and progression, and for pre-clinical drug testing. To ensure health equity, it is imperative that cell lines representing different lung cancer histological types, carrying different cancer driver genes, and representing different genders, races, and ethnicities should be available. This is particularly relevant for cell lines from Black men, who experience the highest lung cancer mortality in the United States. Here, we undertook a review of the available lung cancer cell lines and their racial and ethnic origin. We noted a marked imbalance in the availability of cell lines from different races and ethnicities. Cell lines from Black patients were strongly underrepresented, and we identified no cell lines from Hispanic/Latin(x) (H/L), American Indian/American Native (AI/AN), or Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander (NHOPI) patients. The majority of cell lines were derived from White and Asian patients. Also missing are cell lines representing the cells-of-origin of the major lung cancer histological types, which can be used to model lung cancer development and to study the effects of environmental exposures on lung tissues. To our knowledge, the few available immortalized alveolar epithelial cell lines are all derived from White subjects, and the race and ethnicity of a handful of cell lines derived from bronchial epithelial cells are unknown. The lack of an appropriately diverse collection of lung cancer cell lines and lung cancer cell-of-origin lines severely limits racially and ethnically inclusive lung cancer research. It impedes the ability to develop inclusive models, screen comprehensively for effective compounds, pre-clinically test new drugs, and optimize precision medicine. It thereby hinders the development of therapies that can increase the survival of minority and underserved patients. The noted lack of cell lines from underrepresented groups should constitute a call to action to establish additional cell lines and ensure adequate representation of all population groups in this critical pre-clinical research resource.Copyright © 2023 Leon, Manley, Neely, Castillo, Ramos Correa, Velarde, Yang, Puente, Romero, Ren, Chai, Gladstone, Lamango, Huang and Offringa.",1.91E-52

This cell line belongs to the GBM class according to the World Health Organization 2021 Classification of Central Nervous System Tumors, identified by methylation profiling. GBM33 expresses the astrocytic marker GFAP, as well as markers of neuronal origin commonly expressed in GBM cells, such as ?III-tubulin and neurofilament. Functional assays demonstrated an increased growth rate when compared to the U87 commercial cell line and a similar sensitivity to temozolamide. GBM33 cells retained response to serum starvation, with reduced growth and diminished activation of the Akt signaling pathway. Unlike LN-18 and LN-229 commercial cell lines, GBM33 is able to produce primary cilia upon serum starvation. In summary, the successful establishment and comprehensive characterization of this GBM cell line provide researchers with invaluable tools for studying GBM biology, identifying novel therapeutic targets, and evaluating the efficacy of potential treatments.",1.31E-52

CBX2 has been demonstrated to impact the development and advancement of various cancers, albeit it has received limited attention in relation to HCC. In this study, CBX2 and CEP55 were screened out with the refined triple regulatory networks constructed by total RNA-seq datasets (TCGA-LIHC, GSE140845) and a robust prognostic model. Aberrantly higher expression levels ofCBX2andCEP55in HCC may be caused by CNV alterations, promoter hypo-methylation, open chromatin accessibility, and greater active marks such as H3K4me3, H3K4me1, and H3K27ac. Functionally,CBX2, which was highly correlated with CD44, shaped a cancer stem cell-like phenotype by positively regulating cell-cycle progression, proliferation, invasion, metastasis, wound healing, and radiation resistance, revealed by combining bulk RNA-seq and scRNA-seq datasets.CBX2knockdown validated its role in affecting the cell cycle. Importantly, we revealed CBX2 could activate gene by cooperating with co-regulators or not rather than a recognizer of the repressive mark H3K27me3. For instance, we uncovered CBX2 bound to promoter ofCTNNB1andCEP55to augment their expressions.CBX2showed a highly positive correlation withCEP55at pan-cancer level. In addition,CBX2andCEP55may enhance extracellular matrix reprograming via cancer-associated fibroblast.

Currently, no clinical treatment can restore spinal cord function. Comparison of molecular responses in regenerating to non-regenerating vertebrates can shed light on neural restoration. The axolotl (Ambystoma mexicanum) is an amphibian that regenerates regions of the brain or spinal cord after damage.In this study, we compared the transcriptomes after SCI at acute (1-2 days after SCI) and sub-acute (6-7 days post-SCI) periods through the analysis of RNA-seq public datasets from axolotl and non-regenerating rodents.Genes related to wound healing and immune responses were upregulated in axolotls, rats, and mice after SCI; however, the immune-related processes were more prevalent in rodents. In the acute phase of SCI in the axolotl, the molecular pathways and genes associated with early development were upregulated, while processes related to neuronal function were downregulated. Importantly, the downregulation of processes related to sensorial and motor functions was observed only in rodents. This analysis also revealed that genes related to pluripotency, cytoskeleton rearrangement, and transposable elements (e.g.,Sox2,Krt5, andLOC100130764) were among the most upregulated in the axolotl. Finally, gene regulatory networks in axolotls revealed the early activation of genes related to neurogenesis, includingAtf3/4andFoxa2.Immune-related processes are upregulated shortly after SCI in axolotls and rodents; however, a strong immune response is more noticeable in rodents. Genes related to early development and neurogenesis are upregulated beginning in the acute stage of SCI in axolotls, while the loss of motor and sensory functions is detected only in rodents during the sub-acute period of SCI.

However, the programs governing the lineage choice in chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells are unclear. Here, by simultaneously profiling single-cell chromatin accessibility and transcriptome in the same CAR T cells, we identified heterogeneous chromatin states within CD8+T cell subsets that foreshadowed transcriptional changes and were primed for regulation by distinct transcription factors. Transcription factors that controlled each CD8+T cell subset were regulated by high numbers of enhancers and positioned as hubs of gene networks. FOXP1, a hub in the stem-like network, promoted expansion and stemness of CAR T cells and limited excessive effector differentiation. In the effector network, KLF2 enhanced effector CD8+T cell differentiation and prevented terminal exhaustion. Thus, we identified gene networks and hub transcription factors that controlled the differentiation of stem-like CD8+CAR T cells into effector or exhausted CD8+CAR T cells.© 2023.

Recently, mutations in genes encoding histone proteins that drive oncogenesis have been identified, converting these essential proteins into ""oncohistones"". Understanding how oncohistone mutants, which are commonly single missense mutations, subvert the normal function of histones to drive oncogenesis requires defining the functional consequences of such changes. Histones genes are present in multiple copies in the human genome with 15 genes encoding histone H3 isoforms, the histone for which the majority of oncohistone variants have been analyzed thus far. With so many wildtype histone proteins being expressed simultaneously within the oncohistone, it can be difficult to decipher the precise mechanistic consequences of the mutant protein. In contrast to humans, budding and fission yeast contain only two or three histone H3 genes, respectively. Furthermore, yeast histones share ~90% sequence identity with human H3 protein. Its genetic simplicity and evolutionary conservation make yeast an excellent model for characterizing oncohistones. The power of genetic approaches can also be exploited in yeast models to define cellular signaling pathways that could serve as actionable therapeutic targets. In this review, we focus on the value of yeast models to serve as a discovery tool that can provide mechanistic insights and inform subsequent translational studies in humans.",5.31E-53
,37932845,Abnormal expression of PRKAG2-AS results in dysfunction of cardiomyocytes through regulating PRKAG2 transcription by interacting with PPARG.,Clin Epigenetics,"The role of PRKAG2 in the maintenance of heart function is well established, but little is known about how PRKAG2 is regulated in cardiomyocytes. In this study, we investigated the role of the lncRNA PRKAG2-AS, which is present at the PRKAG2 promoter, in the regulation of PRKAG2 expression. PRKAG2-AS expression was predominantly nuclear, as determined by RNA nucleoplasmic separation and fluorescence in situ hybridization. Knockdown of PRKAG2-AS in the nucleus, but not the cytoplasm, significantly decreased the expression of PRKAG2b and PRKAG2d. Interestingly, we found that PRKAG2-AS and its target genes, PRKAG2b and PRKAG2d, were reduced in the hearts of patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy, suggesting a potential role for PRKAG2-AS in myocardial ischemia. Indeed, knockdown of PRKAG2-AS in the nucleus resulted in apoptosis of cardiomyocytes. We further elucidated the mechanism by which PRKAG2-AS regulates PRKAG2 transcription by identifying 58 PRKAG2-AS interacting proteins. Among them, PPARG was selected for further investigation based on its correlation and potential interaction with PRKAG2-AS in regulating transcription. Overexpression of PPARG, or its activation with rosiglitazone, led to a significant increase in the expression of PRKAG2b and PRKAG2d in cardiomyocytes, which could be attenuated by PRKAG2-AS knockdown. This finding suggests that PRKAG2-AS mediates, at least partially, the protective effects of rosiglitazone on hypoxia-induced apoptosis. However, given the risk of rosiglitazone in heart failure, we also examined the involvement of PRKAG2-AS in this condition and found that PRKAG2-AS, as well as PRKAG2b and PRKAG2d, was elevated in hearts with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and that overexpression of PRKAG2-AS led to a significant increase in PRKAG2b and PRKAG2d expression, indicating that up-regulation of PRKAG2-AS may contribute to the mechanism of heart failure by promoting transcription of PRKAG2. Consequently, proper expression of PRKAG2-AS is essential for maintaining cardiomyocyte function, and aberrant PRKAG2-AS expression induced by hypoxia or other stimuli may cause cardiac dysfunction.© 2023.

,38003198,An Analysis of a Transposable Element Expression Atlas during 27 Developmental Stages in Porcine Skeletal Muscle: Unveiling Molecular Insights into Pork Production Traits.,Animals (Basel),"The development and growth of porcine skeletal muscle determine pork quality and yield. While genetic regulation of porcine skeletal muscle development has been extensively studied using various omics data, the role of transposable elements (TEs) in this context has been less explored. To bridge this gap, we constructed a comprehensive atlas of TE expression throughout the developmental stages of porcine skeletal muscle. This was achieved by integrating porcine TE genomic coordinates with whole-transcriptome RNA-Seq data from 27 developmental stages. We discovered that in pig skeletal muscle, active Tes are closely associated with active epigenomic marks, including low levels of DNA methylation, high levels of chromatin accessibility, and active histone modifications. Moreover, these TEs include 6074 self-expressed TEs that are significantly enriched in terms of muscle cell development and myofibril assembly. Using the TE expression data, we conducted a weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and identified a module that is significantly associated with muscle tissue development as well as genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of the signals of pig meat and carcass traits. Within this module, we constructed a TE-mediated gene regulatory network by adopting a unique multi-omics integration approach. This network highlighted several established candidate genes associated with muscle-relevant traits, including HES6, CHRNG, ACTC1, CHRND, MAMSTR, and PER2, as well as novel genes like ENSSSCG00000005518, ENSSSCG00000033601, and PIEZO2. These novel genes hold promise for regulating muscle-related traits in pigs. In summary, our research not only enhances the TE-centered dissection of the genetic basis underlying pork production traits, but also offers a general approach for constructing TE-mediated regulatory networks to study complex traits or diseases.",4.04E-53
,37984255,Dual role of CASP8AP2/FLASH in regulating epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition plasticity (EMP).,Transl Oncol,"Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a developmental program that consists of the loss of epithelial features concomitant with the acquisition of mesenchymal features. Activation of EMT in cancer facilitates the acquisition of aggressive traits and cancer invasion. EMT plasticity (EMP), the dynamic transition between multiple hybrid states in which cancer cells display both epithelial and mesenchymal markers, confers survival advantages for cancer cells in constantly changing environments during metastasis.RNAseq analysis was performed to assess genome-wide transcriptional changes in cancer cells depleted for histone regulators FLASH, NPAT, and SLBP. Quantitative PCR and Western blot were used for the detection of mRNA and protein levels. Computational analysis was performed on distinct sets of genes to determine the epithelial and mesenchymal score in cancer cells and to correlate FLASH expression with EMT markers in the CCLE collection.We demonstrate that loss of FLASH in cancer cells gives rise to a hybrid E/M phenotype with high epithelial scores even in the presence of TGF?, as determined by computational methods using expression of predetermined sets of epithelial and mesenchymal genes. Multiple genes involved in cell-cell junction formation are similarly specifically upregulated in FLASH-depleted cells, suggesting that FLASH acts as a repressor of the epithelial phenotype. Further, FLASH expression in cancer lines is inversely correlated with the epithelial score. Nonetheless, subsets of mesenchymal markers were distinctly up-regulated in FLASH, NPAT, or SLBP-depleted cells.The ZEB1low/SNAILhigh/E-cadherinhighphenotype described in FLASH-depleted cancer cells is driving a hybrid E/M phenotype in which epithelial and mesenchymal markers coexist.Copyright © 2023.

In the study, we attempted to ascertain its phenotypes based on metabolic and autophagy-related genes and infiltrated immune cells.Transcription datasets of ARDS patients were obtained from Gene expression omnibus (GEO), autophagy and metabolic-related genes were from the Human Autophagy Database and the GeneCards Database, respectively. Autophagy and metabolism-related differentially expressed genes (AMRDEGs) were further identified by machine learning and processed for constructing the nomogram and the risk prediction model. Functional enrichment analyses of differentially expressed genes were performed between high- and low-risk groups. According to the protein-protein interaction network, these hub genes closely linked to increased risk of ARDS were identified with CytoHubba. ssGSEA and CIBERSORT was applied to analyze the infiltration pattern of immune cells in ARDS. Afterwards, immunologically characterized and molecular phenotypes were constructed according to infiltrated immune cells and hub genes.A total of 26 AMRDEGs were obtained, and CTSB and EEF2 were identified as crucial AMRDEGs. The predictive capability of the risk score, calculated based on the expression levels of CTSB and EEF2, was robust for ARDS in both the discovery cohort (AUC = 1) and the validation cohort (AUC = 0.826). The mean risk score was determined to be 2.231332, and based on this score, patients were classified into high-risk and low-risk groups. 371 differential genes in high- and low-risk groups were analyzed. ITGAM, TYROBP, ITGB2, SPI1, PLEK, FGR, MPO, S100A12, HCK, and MYC were identified as hub genes. A total of 12 infiltrated immune cells were differentially expressed and have correlations with hub genes. According to hub genes and implanted immune cells, ARDS patients were divided into two different molecular phenotypes (Group 1: n = 38; Group 2: n = 19) and two immune phenotypes (Cluster1: n = 22; Cluster2: n = 35), respectively.This study picked up hub genes of ARDS related to autophagy and metabolism and clustered ARDS patients into different molecular phenotypes and immunophenotypes, providing insights into the precision medicine of treating patients with ARDS.Copyright © 2023 Xia, Chen, Liu, Huang, Meng, Xu, Xie, Wang and Guo.",2.44E-53

Floral meristem development involves multiscale-level regulation, including lineage and positional mechanisms for establishing cell-type identity, and transcriptional regulation mediated by changes in the chromatin environment. However, many key aspects of floral meristem development remain to be determined, such as: 1) the exact role of cellular location in connecting transcriptional inputs to morphological outcomes, and 2) the precise interactions between transcription factors and chromatin regulators underlying the transcriptional networks that regulate the transition from cell proliferation to differentiation during floral meristem development. Here, we highlight recent studies addressing these points through newly developed spatial reconstruction techniques and high-resolution transcription factor-chromatin environment interactions in the model plantArabidopsis thaliana. Specifically, we feature studies that reconstructed 3D gene expression atlases of the floral meristem. We also discuss how the precise timing of floral meristem specification, floral organ patterning, and floral meristem termination is determined through temporally defined epigenetic dynamics for fine-tuning of gene expression. These studies offer fresh insights into the well-established principles of floral meristem development and outline the potential for further advances in this field in an age of integrated, powerful, multiscale resolution approaches.Copyright © 2023 Pelayo and Yamaguchi.",1.55E-53
,38074856,Developing a novel SARS-CoV-2 risk index to predict the prognostic and therapeutic effects in acute myeloid leukemia.,Heliyon,"There is growing evidence of a strong association between SARS-CoV-2 and cancer prognosis and treatment outcome. However, there are no reliable SARS-CoV-2 assessment models to accurately predict prognostic and therapeutic effects in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Here, differentially expressed genes associated with SARS-CoV-2 were detected, and multiple Cox regression methods were used to construct a SARS-CoV-2 risk index (SC2RI). Then, RT-qPCR was used to validate the gene expression levels in the AML samples. Finally, we explored how the SC2RI affected prognosis, immune infiltration, immunotherapy, and drug sensitivity in AML. We found that CYB5R3 and CLIP4 had been confirmed as hub genes in AML and were used to generate the SC2RI. The datasets indicated that the SC2RI had a superior predictive impact on the prognosis of AML. In addition, high expression of immune checkpoints and numerous immunological infiltrations were substantially correlated with a high SC2RI. However, it responded poorly to immune checkpoint blockade, which may be related to T-cell dysfunction, lack of effective antigens, and deficiency of synaptic capacity. Moreover, a high SC2RI was less susceptible to mTOR-related pathway medications but more sensitive to cell cycle suppressors. Therefore, categorization based on SC2RI could enhance the prognostic prediction of AML and help identify novel therapeutic approaches.© 2023 The Authors.",6.24E-54
,38003932,Anterior Open Bite Malocclusion: From Clinical Treatment Strategies towards the Dissection of the Genetic Bases of the Disease Using Human and Collaborative Cross Mice Cohorts.,J Pers Med,"Anterior open bite malocclusion is a complex dental condition characterized by a lack of contact or overlap between the upper and lower front teeth. It can lead to difficulties with speech, chewing, and biting. Its etiology is multifactorial, involving a combination of genetic, environmental, and developmental factors. Genetic studies have identified specific genes and signaling pathways involved in jaw growth, tooth eruption, and dental occlusion that may contribute to open bite development. Understanding the genetic and epigenetic factors contributing to skeletal open bite is crucial for developing effective prevention and treatment strategies. A thorough manual search was undertaken along with searches on PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct, and Web of Science for relevant studies published before June 2022. RCTs (clinical trials) and subsequent observational studies comprised the included studies. Orthodontic treatment is the primary approach for managing open bites, often involving braces, clear aligners, or other orthodontic appliances. In addition to orthodontic interventions, adjuvant therapies such as speech therapy and/or physiotherapy may be necessary. In some cases, surgical interventions may be necessary to correct underlying skeletal issues. Advancements in technology, such as 3D printing and computer-assisted design and manufacturing, have improved treatment precision and efficiency. Genetic research using animal models, such as the Collaborative Cross mouse population, offers insights into the genetic components of open bite and potential therapeutic targets. Identifying the underlying genetic factors and understanding their mechanisms can lead to the development of more precise treatments and preventive strategies for open bite. Here, we propose to perform human research using mouse models to generate debatable results. We anticipate that a genome-wide association study (GWAS) search for significant genes and their modifiers, an epigenetics-wide association study (EWAS), RNA-seq analysis, the integration of GWAS and expression-quantitative trait loci (eQTL), and micro-, small-, and long noncoding RNA analysis in tissues associated with open bite in humans and mice will uncover novel genes and genetic factors influencing this phenotype.",5.66E-54

Preventive (diet, physical exercise, obesity pharmacotherapy, bariatric surgery) measures, repurposing drugs, candidate therapeutic agents targeting oncogenic pathways of obesity and insulin resistance in leukemia as well as challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic are also discussed.Obesity has been implicated in the development of 13 cancers, such as breast, endometrial, colon, renal, esophageal cancers, and multiple myeloma. Leukemia is estimated to account for approximately 2.5% and 3.1% of all new cancer incidence and mortality, respectively, while it represents the most frequent cancer in children younger than 5 years. Current evidence indicates that obesity may have an impact on the risk of leukemia. Increased birthweight may be associated with the development of childhood leukemia. Obesity is also associated with worse outcomes and increased mortality in leukemic patients. However, there are several limitations and challenges in meta-analyses and epidemiological studies. In addition, weight gain may occur in a substantial number of childhood ALL survivors while the majority of studies have documented an increased risk of relapse and mortality among patients with childhood ALL and obesity. The main pathophysiological pathways linking obesity to leukemia include bone marrow adipose tissue; hormones such as insulin and the insulin-like growth factor system as well as sex hormones; pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and TNF-?; adipocytokines, such as adiponectin, leptin, resistin, and visfatin; dyslipidemia and lipid signaling; chronic low-grade inflammation and oxidative stress; and other emerging mechanisms. Obesity represents a risk factor for leukemia, being among the only known risk factors that could be prevented or modified through weight loss, healthy diet, and physical exercise. Pharmacological interventions, repurposing drugs used for cardiometabolic comorbidities, and bariatric surgery may be recommended for leukemia and obesity-related cancer prevention.© 2023.

,38132178,Repurposing Metabolic Inhibitors in the Treatment of Colon Adenocarcinoma Patient-Derived Models.,Cells,"The effect of agonists on AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), mainly metformin and phenformin, has been appreciated in the treatment of multiple types of tumors. Specifically, the antitumor activity of phenformin has been demonstrated in melanomas containing the v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF) activating mutation. In this report, we elucidated the synergistic antitumor effects of biguanides with metabolism inhibitors on colon tumors. Phenformin with 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG) inhibited tumor cell growth in cancer cell lines, including HT29 cells harboring BRAF- and p53-mutations. Biochemical analyses showed that two chemotherapeutics exerted cooperative effects to reduce tumor growth through cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and autophagy. The drugs demonstrated activity against phosphorylated ERK and the gain-of-function p53 mutant protein. To demonstrate tumor regressive effects in vivo, we established patient-derived models, including xenograft (PDX) and organoids (PDO). Co-treatment of biguanides with chemotherapeutics efficiently reduced the growth of patient-derived colon models in comparison to treatment with a single agent. These results strongly suggest that significant therapeutic advantages would be achieved by combining AMPK activators such as phenformin and cancer metabolic inhibitors such as 2DG.",5.3E-54
,38023853,Mining the Utricularia gibba genome for insulator-like elements for genetic engineering.,Front Plant Sci,"Gene expression is often controlled via cis-regulatory elements (CREs) that modulate the production of transcripts. For multi-gene genetic engineering and synthetic biology, precise control of transcription is crucial, both to insulate the transgenes from unwanted native regulation and to prevent readthrough or cross-regulation of transgenes within a multi-gene cassette. To prevent this activity, insulator-like elements, more properly referred to as transcriptional blockers, could be inserted to separate the transgenes so that they are independently regulated. However, only a few validated insulator-like elements are available for plants, and they tend to be larger than ideal.To identify additional potential insulator-like sequences, we conducted a genome-wide analysis ofUtricularia gibba(humped bladderwort), one of the smallest known plant genomes, with genes that are naturally close together. The 10 best insulator-like candidates were evaluated in vivo for insulator-like activity.We identified a total of 4,656 intergenic regions with expression profiles suggesting insulator-like activity. Comparisons of these regions across 45 other plant species (representing Monocots, Asterids, and Rosids) show low levels of syntenic conservation of these regions. Genome-wide analysis of unmethylated regions (UMRs) indicates ~87% of the targeted regions are unmethylated; however, interpretation of this is complicated becauseU. gibbahas remarkably low levels of methylation across the genome, so that large UMRs frequently extend over multiple genes and intergenic spaces. We also could not identify any conserved motifs among our selected intergenic regions or shared with existing insulator-like elements for plants. Despite this lack of conservation, however, testing of 10 selected intergenic regions for insulator-like activity found two elements on par with a previously published element (EXOB) while being significantly smaller.Given the small number of insulator-like elements currently available for plants, our results make a significant addition to available tools. The high hit rate (2 out of 10) also implies that more useful sequences are likely present in our selected intergenic regions; additional validation work will be required to identify which will be most useful for plant genetic engineering.Copyright © 2023 Laspisa, llla-Berenguer, Bang, Schmitz, Parrott and Wallace.",4.91E-54
,37947059,Ferroptosis triggers airway inflammation in asthma.,Ther Adv Respir Dis,"Ferroptosis is a regulatory cell death characterized by intracellular iron accumulation and lipid peroxidation that leads to oxidative stress. Many signaling pathways such as iron metabolism, lipid metabolism, and amino acid metabolism precisely regulate the process of ferroptosis. Ferroptosis is involved in a variety of lung diseases, such as acute lung injury, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and pulmonary fibrosis. Increasing studies suggest that ferroptosis is involved in the development of asthma. Ferroptosis plays an important role in asthma. Iron metabolism disorders, lipid peroxidation, amino acid metabolism disorders lead to the occurrence of ferroptosis in airway epithelial cells, and then aggravate clinical symptoms in asthmatic patients. Moreover, several regulators of ferroptosis are involved in the pathogenesis of asthma, such as Nrf2, heme oxygenase-1, mevalonate pathway, and ferroptosis inhibitor protein 1. Importantly, ferroptosis inhibitors improve asthma. Thus, the pathogenesis of ferroptosis and its contribution to the pathogenesis of asthma help us better understand the occurrence and development of asthma, and provide new directions in asthma treatment. This article aimed to review the role and mechanism of ferroptosis in asthma, describing the relationship between ferroptosis and asthma based on signaling pathways and related regulatory factors. At the same time, we summarized current observations of ferroptosis in eosinophils, airway epithelial cells, and airway smooth muscle cells in asthmatic patients.",4.43E-54

With the immunological pathologies and pathogenesis of psoriasis becoming gradually revealed, the therapeutic approaches for this disease have gained revolutionary progress. Nevertheless, the mechanisms of less common forms of psoriasis remain elusive. Furthermore, severe adverse effects and the recurrence of disease upon treatment cessation should be noted and addressed during the treatment, which, however, has been rarely explored with the integration of preliminary findings. Therefore, it is crucial to have a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms behind psoriasis pathogenesis, which might offer new insights for research and lead to more substantive progress in therapeutic approaches and expand clinical options for psoriasis treatment. In this review, we looked to briefly introduce the epidemiology, clinical subtypes, pathophysiology, and comorbidities of psoriasis and systematically discuss the signaling pathways involving extracellular cytokines and intracellular transmission, as well as the cross-talk between them. In the discussion, we also paid more attention to the potential metabolic and epigenetic mechanisms of psoriasis and the molecular mechanistic cascades related to its comorbidities. This review also outlined current treatment for psoriasis, especially targeted therapies and novel therapeutic strategies, as well as the potential mechanism of disease recurrence.© 2023.

,37978513,"Long read sequencing characterises a novel structural variant, revealing underactive AKR1C1 with overactive AKR1C2 as a possible cause of severe chronic fatigue.",J Transl Med,"Causative genetic variants cannot yet be found for many disorders with a clear heritable component, including chronic fatigue disorders like myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). These conditions may involve genes in difficult-to-align genomic regions that are refractory to short read approaches. Structural variants in these regions can be particularly hard to detect or define with short reads, yet may account for a significant number of cases. Long read sequencing can overcome these difficulties but so far little data is available regarding the specific analytical challenges inherent in such regions, which need to be taken into account to ensure that variants are correctly identified. Research into chronic fatigue disorders faces the additional challenge that the heterogeneous patient populations likely encompass multiple aetiologies with overlapping symptoms, rather than a single disease entity, such that each individual abnormality may lack statistical significance within a larger sample. Better delineation of patient subgroups is needed to target research and treatment.We use nanopore sequencing in a case of unexplained severe fatigue to identify and fully characterise a large inversion in a highly homologous region spanning the AKR1C gene locus, which was indicated but could not be resolved by short-read sequencing. We then use GC-MS/MS serum steroid analysis to investigate the functional consequences.Several commonly used bioinformatics tools are confounded by the homology but a combined approach including visual inspection allows the variant to be accurately resolved. The DNA inversion appears to increase the expression of AKR1C2 while limiting AKR1C1 activity, resulting in a relative increase of inhibitory GABAergic neurosteroids and impaired progesterone metabolism which could suppress neuronal activity and interfere with cellular function in a wide range of tissues.This study provides an example of how long read sequencing can improve diagnostic yield in research and clinical care, and highlights some of the analytical challenges presented by regions containing tandem arrays of genes. It also proposes a novel gene associated with a novel disease aetiology that may be an underlying cause of complex chronic fatigue. It reveals biomarkers that could now be assessed in a larger cohort, potentially identifying a subset of patients who might respond to treatments suggested by the aetiology.© 2023.

The ""limma"" package was used for differentially expressed analysis. The key modules associated with vital immune cells were identified using WGCNA. GO and KEGG enrichment analysis revealed the biological functions of the candidate genes. Ultimately, a novel diagnostic prediction model was constructed via machine learning methods and multivariate logistic regression analysis based on GSE20257. Furthermore, we examined the stability of the model on one internal test set (GSE10006), three external test sets (GSE8545, GSE57148 and GSE76925), one single-cell transcriptome dataset (GSE167295), macrophages (THP-M cells) and lung tissue from COPD patients.M0 macrophages (AUC > 0.7 in GSE20257 and GSE10006) were considered as the most important immune cells through exploring the immune microenvironment landscapes in COPD patients and healthy controls. The differentially expressed genes from GSE20257 and GSE10006 were divided into six and five modules via WGCNA, respectively. The green module in GSE20257 (cor = 0.41, P < 0.001) and the brown module in GSE10006 (cor = 0.67, P < 0.001) were highly correlated with M0 macrophages and were selected as key modules. Forty-one intersected genes obtained from two modules were primarily involved in regulation of cytokine production, regulation of innate immune response, specific granule, phagosome, lysosome, ferroptosis, and other biological processes. On the basis of the candidate genetic markers further characterized via the ""Boruta"" and ""LASSO"" algorithm for COPD, a diagnostic model comprising CLEC5A, FTL and SLC2A3 was constructed, which could accurately distinguish COPD patients from healthy controls in multiple datasets. GSE20257 as the training set has an AUC of 0.916. The AUCs of the internal test set and three external test sets were 0.873, 0.932, 0.675 and 0.688, respectively. Single-cell sequencing analysis suggested that CLEC5A, FTL and SLC2A3 were expressed in macrophages from COPD patients. The expressions of CLEC5A, FTL and SLC2A3 were up-regulated in THP-M cells and lung tissue from COPD patients.According to the variations of immune microenvironment in COPD patients, we constructed and validated a novel macrophage M0-associated diagnostic model with satisfactory predictive value. CLEC5A, FTL and SLC2A3 are expected to be promising targets of immunotherapy in COPD.© 2023 Zhang et al.",2.65E-54

In this study, we detailed the clinical, pathological, immunohistochemical, and molecular features of a series of DDOC/UDOC. We collected a multi-institutional cohort of 23 DDOC/UDOC and performed immunohistochemistry for core switch/sucrose nonfermentable (SWI/SNF) complex proteins (ARID1A, ARID1B, SMARCA4, and SMARCB1), mismatch repair (MMR) proteins, and p53. Array-based genome-wide DNA methylation and copy number variation analyses were performed on a subset of cases with comparison made to a previously reported cohort of undifferentiated endometrial carcinoma (UDEC), small cell carcinoma of the ovary, hypercalcemic type (SCCOHT), and tubo-ovarian high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC). The age of all 23 patients with DDOC/UDOC ranged between 22 and 71 years (with an average age of 50 years), and a majority of them presented with extraovarian disease (16/23). Clinical follow-up was available for 19 patients. Except for 2 patients, the remaining 17 patients died from disease, with rapid disease progression resulting in mortality within a year in stage II-IV settings (median disease-specific survival of 3 months). Eighteen of 22 cases with interpretable immunohistochemistry results showed loss of expression of core SWI/SNF protein(s) that are expected to result in SWI/SNF complex inactivation as 10 exhibited coloss of ARID1A and ARID1B, 7 loss of SMARCA4, and 1 loss of SMARCB1. Six of 23 cases were MMR-deficient. Two of 20 cases exhibited mutation-type p53 immunoreactivity. Methylation profiles showed coclustering of DDOC/UDOC with UDEC, which collectively were distinct from SCCOHT and HGSC. However, DDOC/UDOC showed an intermediate degree of copy number variation, which was slightly greater, compared with SCCOHT but much less compared with HGSC. Overall, DDOC/UDOC, like its endometrial counterpart, is highly aggressive and is characterized by frequent inactivation of core SWI/SNF complex proteins and MMR deficiency. Its molecular profile overlaps with UDEC while being distinct from SCCOHT and HGSC.Copyright © 2023 United States & Canadian Academy of Pathology. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Here, we integrate epigenetic (DNA methylation) and transcriptome data to identify a ccRCC subtype characterized by cancer-specific promoter hypermethylation and epigenetic silencing of Polycomb targets. We develop and validate an index of methylation-based epigenetic silencing (iMES) that predicts primary resistance to immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) in the BIONIKK trial. High iMES is associated with VEGF pathway silencing, endothelial cell depletion, immune activation/suppression, EZH2 activation, BAP1/SETD2 deficiency, and resistance to ICI. Combination therapy with hypomethylating agents or tyrosine kinase inhibitors may benefit patients with high iMES. Intriguingly, tumors with low iMES exhibit increased endothelial cells and improved ICI response, suggesting the importance of angiogenesis in ICI treatment. We also develop a transcriptome-based analogous system for extended applicability of iMES.

In this study, we investigated the immunomodulatory function of recombinantT. spiralisnovel cystatin (rTsCstN) in ameliorating acute inflammatory asthma disorders in a murine model.Female BALB/c mice were sensitized using intraperitoneal injection of ovalbumin (OVA)/alum and subsequently challenged with intranasal administration of OVA alone or OVA + rTsCstN for 3 consecutive days, producing OVA-induced allergic asthma models. To evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of rTsCstN, the inflammatory cells and cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and OVA-specific immunoglobulin E levels in serum were assessed. Histological alterations in the lung tissues were determined by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and eventually scored for the extent of inflammatory cell infiltration.The asthmatic mouse models challenged with OVA + rTsCstN demonstrated a significant reduction of eosinophils (p < 0.01), macrophages (p < 0.05), and cytokines tumor necrosis factor-? (p < 0.05) and interferon (IFN)-? (p < 0.05) in BALF when compared with the mice challenged with OVA alone. However, the levels of interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-10 remained unchanged. Histological examination revealed that mice administered OVA + rTsCstN were less likely to have inflammatory cell infiltration in their perivascular and peribronchial lung tissues than those administered OVA alone.RecombinantT. spiralisnovel cystatin demonstrated immunomodulatory effects to reduce severe pathogenic alterations in asthma mouse models, encouraging a viable alternative treatment for asthma and other immunoregulatory disorders in humans and animals in the future.Copyright: © Thammasonthijarern, et al.",1.02E-54

In fact, the prevalence of post-COVID symptoms ranges from 50% during the first months after the infection up to 20% two-years after. This perspective review aimed to map the existing literature on post-COVID symptoms and to identify gaps in the literature to guide the global effort toward an improved understanding of long-COVID and suggest future research directions. There is a plethora of symptomatology that can be due to COVID-19; however, today, there is no clear classification and definition of this condition, termed long-COVID or post-COVID-19 condition. The heterogeneity in the symptomatology has led to the presence of groups/clusters of patients, which could exhibit different risk factors and different mechanisms. Viral persistence, long-lasting inflammation, immune dysregulation, autoimmune reactions, reactivation of latent infections, endothelial dysfunction and alteration in gut microbiota have been proposed as potential mechanisms explaining the complexity of long-COVID. In such an equation, viral biology (e.g., re-infections, SARS-CoV-2 variants), host biology (e.g., genetics, epigenetics) and external factors (e.g., vaccination) should be also considered.

,38017410,Detection of continuous hierarchical heterogeneity by single-cell surface antigen analysis in the prognosis evaluation of acute myeloid leukaemia.,BMC Bioinformatics,"Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is characterised by the malignant accumulation of myeloid progenitors with a high recurrence rate after chemotherapy. Blasts (leukaemia cells) exhibit a complete myeloid differentiation hierarchy hiding a wide range of temporal information from initial to mature clones, including genesis, phenotypic transformation, and cell fate decisions, which might contribute to relapse in AML patients.Based on the landscape of AML surface antigens generated by mass cytometry (CyTOF), we combined manifold analysis and principal curve-based trajectory inference algorithm to align myelocytes on a single-linear evolution axis by considering their phenotype continuum that correlated with differentiation order. Backtracking the trajectory from mature clusters located automatically at the terminal, we recurred the molecular dynamics during AML progression and confirmed the evolution stage of single cells. We also designed a 'dispersive antigens in neighbouring clusters exhibition (DANCE)' feature selection method to simplify and unify trajectories, which enabled the exploration and comparison of relapse-related traits among 43 paediatric AML bone marrow specimens.The feasibility of the proposed trajectory analysis method was verified with public datasets. After aligning single cells on the pseudotime axis, primitive clones were recognized precisely from AML blasts, and the expression of the inner molecules before and after drug stimulation was accurately plotted on the trajectory. Applying DANCE to 43 clinical samples with different responses for chemotherapy, we selected 12 antigens as a general panel for myeloblast differentiation performance, and obtain trajectories to those patients. For the trajectories with unified molecular dynamics, CD11c overexpression in the primitive stage indicated a good chemotherapy outcome. Moreover, a later initial peak of stemness heterogeneity tended to be associated with a higher risk of relapse compared with complete remission.In this study, pseudotime was generated as a new single-cell feature. Minute differences in temporal traits among samples could be exhibited on a trajectory, thus providing a new strategy for predicting AML relapse and monitoring drug responses over time scale.© 2023.

Our study aimed to delve deeper into their morphology, transcriptome, and epigenome changes in response to psoriasis-like inflammation. We created a novel cytokine mixture to mimic mild and severe psoriasis-like inflammatory conditions in cultured keratinocytes. Upon induction of inflammation, we observed that the keratinocytes exhibited a mesenchymal-like phenotype, further confirmed by increasedVIMmRNA expression and results obtained from confocal microscopy. We performed RNA sequencing to achieve a more global view, revealing 858 and 6987 DEGs in mildly and severely inflamed keratinocytes, respectively. Surprisingly, we found that the transcriptome of mildly inflamed keratinocytes more closely mimicked that of the psoriatic epidermis transcriptome than the severely inflamed keratinocytes. Genes involved in the IL-17 pathway were a major contributor to the similarities of the transcriptomes between mildly inflamed KCs and psoriatic epidermis. Mild and severe inflammation led to the gene regulation of epigenetic modifiers such as HATs, HDACs, DNMTs, and TETs. Immunofluorescence staining revealed distinct 5-hmC patterns in inflamed versus control keratinocytes, and consistently low 5-mC intensity in both groups. However, the global DNA methylation assay detected a tendency of decreased 5-mC levels in inflamed keratinocytes versus controls. This study emphasizes how inflammation severity affects the transcriptomic similarity of keratinocytes to psoriatic epidermis and proves dynamic epigenetic regulation and adaptive morphological changes in inflamed keratinocytes.",6.97E-55
,38062440,The hypothalamic steroidogenic pathway mediates susceptibility to inflammation-evoked depression in female mice.,J Neuroinflammation,"Depression is two-to-three times more frequent among women. The hypothalamus, a sexually dimorphic area, has been implicated in the pathophysiology of depression. Neuroinflammation-induced hypothalamic dysfunction underlies behaviors associated with depression. The lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse model of depression has been well-validated in numerous laboratories, including our own, and is widely used to investigate the relationship between neuroinflammation and depression. However, the sex-specific differences in metabolic alterations underlying depression-associated hypothalamic neuroinflammation remain unknown.Here, we employed the LPS-induced mouse model of depression to investigate hypothalamic metabolic changes in both male and female mice using a metabolomics approach. Through bioinformatics analysis, we confirmed the molecular pathways and biological processes associated with the identified metabolites. Furthermore, we employed quantitative real-time PCR, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, western blotting, and pharmacological interventions to further elucidate the underlying mechanisms.A total of 124 and 61 differential metabolites (DMs) were detected in male and female mice with depressive-like behavior, respectively, compared to their respective sex-matched control groups. Moreover, a comparison between female and male model mice identified 37 DMs. We capitalized on biochemical clustering and functional enrichment analyses to define the major metabolic changes in these DMs. More than 55% of the DMs clustered into lipids and lipid-like molecules, and an imbalance in lipids metabolism was presented in the hypothalamus. Furthermore, steroidogenic pathway was confirmed as a potential sex-specific pathway in the hypothalamus of female mice with depression. Pregnenolone, an upstream component of the steroid hormone biosynthesis pathway, was downregulated in female mice with depressive-like phenotypes but not in males and had considerable relevance to depressive-like behaviors in females. Moreover, exogenous pregnenolone infusion reversed depressive-like behaviors in female mice with depression. The 5?-reductase type I (SRD5A1), a steroidogenic hub enzyme involved in pregnenolone metabolism, was increased in the hypothalamus of female mice with depression. Its inhibition increased hypothalamic pregnenolone levels and ameliorated depressive-like behaviors in female mice with depression.Our study findings demonstrate a marked sexual dimorphism at the metabolic level in depression, particularly in hypothalamic steroidogenic metabolism, identifying a potential sex-specific pathway in female mice with depressive-like behaviors.© 2023.

,38148333,SMYD3: a new regulator of adipocyte precursor proliferation at the early steps of differentiation.,Int J Obes (Lond),"In obesity, adipose tissue undergoes a remodeling process characterized by increased adipocyte size (hypertrophia) and number (hyperplasia). The ability to tip the balance toward the hyperplastic growth, with recruitment of new fat cells through adipogenesis, seems to be critical for a healthy adipose tissue expansion, as opposed to a hypertrophic growth that is accompanied by the development of inflammation and metabolic dysfunction. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the fine-tuned regulation of adipose tissue expansion are far from being understood.We analyzed by mass spectrometry-based proteomics visceral white adipose tissue (vWAT) samples collected from C57BL6 mice fed with a HFD for 8 weeks. A subset of these mice, called low inflammation (Low-INFL), showed reduced adipose tissue inflammation, as opposed to those developing the expected inflammatory response (Hi-INFL). We identified the discriminants between Low-INFL and Hi-INFL vWAT samples and explored their function in Adipose-Derived human Mesenchymal Stem Cells (AD-hMSCs) differentiated to adipocytes.vWAT proteomics allowed us to quantify 6051 proteins. Among the candidates that most differentiate Low-INFL from Hi-INFL vWAT, we found proteins involved in adipocyte function, including adiponectin and hormone sensitive lipase, suggesting that adipocyte differentiation is enhanced in Low-INFL, as compared to Hi-INFL. The chromatin modifier SET and MYND Domain Containing 3 (SMYD3), whose function in adipose tissue was so far unknown, was another top-scored hit. SMYD3 expression was significantly higher in Low-INFL vWAT, as confirmed by western blot analysis. Using AD-hMSCs in culture, we found that SMYD3 mRNA and protein levels decrease rapidly during the adipocyte differentiation. Moreover, SMYD3 knock-down before adipocyte differentiation resulted in reduced H3K4me3 and decreased cell proliferation, thus limiting the number of cells available for adipogenesis.Our study describes an important role of SMYD3 as a newly discovered regulator of adipocyte precursor proliferation during the early steps of adipogenesis.© 2023.

Survival analysis was performed for the intersectional genes. A risk score model was subsequently constructed based on the survival-related genes for prognosis prediction and validated in external datasets.In total, 33 coagulation and macrophage-related (COMAR) genes were obtained, 19 of which were selected for the risk score model construction. Finally, 10 survival-associated genes (APOE, ARRB2, C1QB, F13A1, FCGR2A, FYN, ITGB2, MMP9, OLR1, and VSIG4) were involved in the COMAR risk score model. According to the risk score, patients were equally divided into low- and high-risk groups, and the prognosis of patients in the high-risk group was significantly worse than that in the low-risk group. The ROC curve indicated that the risk score model had high sensitivity and specificity, which was validated in multiple external datasets. Moreover, the model also had high efficacy in predicting the clinical outcomes of LUAD patients who received anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy.The COMAR risk score model constructed in this study has excellent predictive value for the prognosis and immunotherapeutic clinical outcomes of patients with LUAD, which provides potential biomarkers for the treatment and prognostic prediction.Copyright © 2023 Li, Yin, Luan, Zhang, Wang, Zhang, Chen, Yang and Tian.",3.19E-55

Genes associated with inborn metabolic errors may also play roles in cancer development. This study evaluated the overall impact of these genes on gastric cancer (GC).In total, 162 genes involved in 203 hereditary metabolic diseases were identified in the Human Phenotype Ontology database. Clinical and multi-omic data were acquired from the GC cohort of the Affiliated Hospital of Jiangsu University and other published cohorts. A 4-gene and 32-gene signature was established for diagnosis and prognosis or therapeutic prediction, respectively, and corresponding abnormal metabolism scores (AMscores) were calculated.The diagnostic AMscore showed high sensitivity (0.88-1.00) and specificity (0.89-1.00) to distinguish between GC and paired normal tissues, with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) ranging from 0.911 to 1.000 in four GC cohorts. The prognostic or predictive AMscore was an independent predictor of overall survival (OS) in five GC cohorts and a predictor of the OS and disease-free survival benefit of postoperative chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy in one GC cohort with such data. The AMscore adversely impacts immune biomarkers, including tumor mutation burden, tumor neoantigen burden, microsatellite instability, programmed death-ligand 1 protein expression, tumor microenvironment score, T cell receptor clonality, and immune cell infiltration detected by multiplex immunofluorescence staining. The AUC of the AMscore for predicting immunotherapy response ranging from 0.780 to 0.964 in four cohorts involving GC, urothelial cancer, melanoma, and lung cancer. The objective response rates in the low and high AMscore subgroups were 78.6% and 3.2%, 40.4% and 7%, 52.6% and 0%, and 72.7% and 0%, respectively (all p<0.001). In cohorts with survival data, a high AMscore was hazardous for OS or progression-free survival, with hazard ratios ranged from 5.79 to 108.59 (all p<0.001). Importantly, the AMscore significantly improved the prediction of current immune biomarkers for both response and survival, thus redefining the advantaged and disadvantaged immunotherapy populations.Signatures based on genes associated with hereditary metabolic diseases and their corresponding scores could be used to guide the diagnosis and treatment of GC.

Hence, interfering with this signaling network forms the basis for cancer therapy. Yet, many types of cancer, in particular, solid tumors, are refractory to the currently used treatments, so there is an urgent need for novel molecular targets that could improve current anti-cancer therapeutic strategies. Lipocalin-2 (Lcn-2), a secreted siderophore-binding glycoprotein that regulates iron homeostasis, is highly upregulated in various cancer types. Due to its pleiotropic role in the crosstalk between cancer cells and stromal cells, favoring tumor progression, it could be considered as a novel biomarker for prognostic and therapeutic purposes. However, the exact signaling route by which Lcn-2 promotes tumorigenesis remains unknown, and Lcn-2-targeting moieties are largely uninvestigated. This review will (i) provide an overview on the role of Lcn-2 in orchestrating the TME at the level of iron homeostasis, macrophage polarization, extracellular matrix remodeling, and cell migration and survival, and (ii) discuss the potential of Lcn-2 as a promising novel drug target that should be pursued in future translational research.",2.24E-55

Every year, More than 830?000 people are diagnosed with HNSCC globally, with more than 430?000 fatalities. HNSCC is a deadly diverse malignancy with many tumor locations and biological characteristics. It originates from the squamous epithelium of the oral cavity, oropharynx, nasopharynx, larynx, and hypopharynx. The most frequently impacted regions are the tongue and larynx. Previous investigations have demonstrated the critical role of host genetic susceptibility in the progression of HNSCC. Despite the advances in our knowledge, the improved survival rate of HNSCC patients over the last 40?years has been limited. Failure to identify the molecular origins of development of HNSCC and the genetic basis of the disease and its biological heterogeneity impedes the development of new therapeutic methods. These results indicate a need to identify more genetic factors underlying this complex disease, which can be better used in early detection and prevention strategies. The lack of reliable animal models to investigate the underlying molecular processes is one of the most significant barriers to understanding HNSCC tumors. In this report, we explore and discuss potential research prospects utilizing the Collaborative Cross mouse model and crossing it to mice carrying single or double knockout genes (e.g. Smad4 and P53 genes) to identify genetic factors affecting the development of this complex disease using genome-wide association studies, epigenetics, microRNA, long noncoding RNA, lncRNA, histone modifications, methylation, phosphorylation, and proteomics.© 2023 Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.

,37938765,Functional involvement of septal miR-132 in extinction and oxytocin-mediated reversal of social fear.,Mol Psychiatry,"Social interactions are critical for mammalian survival and evolution. Dysregulation of social behavior often leads to psychopathologies such as social anxiety disorder, denoted by intense fear and avoidance of social situations. Using the social fear conditioning (SFC) paradigm, we analyzed expression levels of miR-132-3p and miR-124-3p within the septum, a brain region essential for social preference and avoidance behavior, after acquisition and extinction of social fear. Here, we found that SFC dynamically altered both microRNAs. Functional in vivo approaches using pharmacological strategies, inhibition of miR-132-3p, viral overexpression of miR-132-3p, and shRNA-mediated knockdown of miR-132-3p specifically within oxytocin receptor-positive neurons confirmed septal miR-132-3p to be critically involved not only in social fear extinction, but also in oxytocin-induced reversal of social fear. Moreover, Argonaute-RNA-co-immunoprecipitation-microarray analysis and further in vitro and in vivo quantification of target mRNA and protein, revealed growth differentiation factor-5 (Gdf-5) as a target of miR-132-3p. Septal application of GDF-5 impaired social fear extinction suggesting its functional involvement in the reversal of social fear. In summary, we show that septal miR-132-3p and its downstream target Gdf-5 regulate social fear expression and potentially mediate oxytocin-induced reversal of social fear.© 2023.

However, progress is still hindered as clinical benefit is only available for a fraction of patients. A lack of understanding of CAR-T cell behaviors in vivo at the single-cell level impedes their more extensive application in clinical practice. Mounting evidence suggests that single-cell sequencing techniques can help perfect the receptor design, guide gene-based T cell modification, and optimize the CAR-T manufacturing conditions, and all of them are essential for long-term immunosurveillance and more favorable clinical outcomes. The information generated by employing these methods also potentially informs our understanding of the numerous complex factors that dictate therapeutic efficacy and toxicities.

The mechanisms of this regenerative failure are not fully understood1,2. Here, through small-molecule and genetic screening for epigenetic modulators3, we identify DNA methyltransferase 3a (DNMT3a) as a potent inhibitor of axon regeneration in mouse and human retinal explants. Selective suppression of DNMT3a in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) by gene targeting or delivery of shRNA leads to robust, full-length regeneration of RGC axons through the optic nerve and restoration of vision in adult mice after nerve crush injury. Genome-wide bisulfite and transcriptome profiling in combination with single nucleus RNA-sequencing of RGCs revealed selective DNA demethylation and reactivation of genetic programs supporting neuronal survival and axonal growth/regeneration by DNMT3a deficiency. This was accompanied by the suppression of gene networks associated with apoptosis and inflammation. Our results identify DNMT3a as the central orchestrator of an RGC-intrinsic mechanism that limits optic nerve regeneration. Suppressing DNMT3a expression in RGCs unlocks the epigenetic switch for optic nerve regeneration and presents a promising therapeutic avenue for effectively reversing vision loss resulted from optic nerve trauma or diseases.",9.63E-56

As >90% of human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cases are driven by activating mutations inKRAS, we assessed the therapeutic potential of RMC-7977 in a comprehensive range of PDAC models, including human and murine cell lines, human patient-derived organoids, human PDAC explants, subcutaneous and orthotopic cell-line or patient derived xenografts, syngeneic allografts, and genetically engineered mouse models. We observed broad and pronounced anti-tumor activity across these models following direct RAS inhibition at doses and concentrations that were well-toleratedin vivo. Pharmacological analyses revealed divergent responses to RMC-7977 in tumor versus normal tissues. Treated tumors exhibited waves of apoptosis along with sustained proliferative arrest whereas normal tissues underwent only transient decreases in proliferation, with no evidence of apoptosis.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the effect of polyamines in KIRC cancer remain largely unknown.The messenger RNA (mRNA) expression profile of KIRC was downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), and ArrayExpress database. Differential expression analysis was performed with the ""limma"" package in R. Univariate Cox regression and multivariable Cox regression were used to estimate correlation between variables and prognosis. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression analysis was employed to screen variables and construct a risk signature. A nomogram model was established using the risk signature and clinical variables. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC), calibration curve, and decision curve analysis (DCA) were used to assess the predicted accuracy and clinical benefit of the model.We identified nine differentially expressed polyamine metabolism-related genes (PMRGs) in TCGA-KIRC. Of these, six were closely associated with patients' outcomes. These six genes participated in different pathways and originated from different cell types within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Using the mRNA expression values of these genes, we constructed a 4-gene PMRG risk signature. Patients with high PMRG risk exhibited worse outcomes, and our analysis showed that the PMRG risk signature was an independent prognostic factor when clinical information was used as a covariate. We also found that multiple immune- or metabolism-related pathways were differentially enriched in high or low PMRG risk groups, suggesting that altering these pathways could lead to different clinical outcomes. Finally, in two external datasets, we found that the PMRG risk signature could predict the response of patients to immune therapy.In summary, our study identified several potentially important PMRGs in KIRC and constructed a practical risk signature, which could serve as a foundation for further development of polyamine metabolism-based targeted therapies for KIRC.2023 Translational Cancer Research.

Retinal cell types may have evolved to accommodate these varied needs, but this has not been systematically studied. Here we generated and integrated single-cell transcriptomic atlases of the retina from 17 species: humans, two non-human primates, four rodents, three ungulates, opossum, ferret, tree shrew, a bird, a reptile, a teleost fish and a lamprey. We found high molecular conservation of the six retinal cell classes (photoreceptors, horizontal cells, bipolar cells, amacrine cells, retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and Müller glia), with transcriptomic variation across species related to evolutionary distance. Major subclasses were also conserved, whereas variation among cell types within classes or subclasses was more pronounced. However, an integrative analysis revealed that numerous cell types are shared across species, based on conserved gene expression programmes that are likely to trace back to an early ancestral vertebrate. The degree of variation among cell types increased from the outer retina (photoreceptors) to the inner retina (RGCs), suggesting that evolution acts preferentially to shape the retinal output. Finally, we identified rodent orthologues of midget RGCs, which comprise more than 80% of RGCs in the human retina, subserve high-acuity vision, and were previously believed to be restricted to primates2. By contrast, the mouse orthologues have large receptive fields and comprise around 2% of mouse RGCs. Projections of both primate and mouse orthologous types are overrepresented in the thalamus, which supplies the primary visual cortex. We suggest that midget RGCs are not primate innovations, but are descendants of evolutionarily ancient types that decreased in size and increased in number as primates evolved, thereby facilitating high visual acuity and increased cortical processing of visual information.© 2023.

At the heart of the shift towards personalized medicine, omics-driven systems biology becomes a driving force as it leverages high-throughput technologies and novel bioinformatics tools. These enable the creation of systems-based maps, providing a comprehensive view of individual tumor's functional plasticity. We highlight the innovative PHENOSTAMP program, which leverages high-dimensional data to construct a visually intuitive and user-friendly map. This map was created to encapsulate complex transitional states in cancer cells, such as Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) and Mesenchymal-Epithelial Transition (MET), offering a visually intuitive way to understand disease progression and therapeutic responses at single-cell resolution in relation to EMT-related single-cell phenotypes. Most importantly, PHENOSTAMP functions as a reference map, which allows researchers and clinicians to assess one clinical specimen at a time in relation to their phenotypic heterogeneity, setting the foundation on constructing phenotypic maps for personalized medicine. This perspective argues that such dynamic predictive maps could also catalyze the development of personalized cancer treatment. They hold the potential to transform our understanding of cancer biology, providing a foundation for a future where therapy is tailored to each patient's unique molecular and cellular tumor profile.

There are profound sex differences in adipose tissue deposition and obesity-related conditions. The underlying mechanisms driving sexual dimorphism in obesity and its associated metabolic disorders remain unclear. Histone variant macroH2A1.1 is a candidate epigenetic mechanism linking environmental and dietary factors to obesity. Here, we used a mouse model genetically depleted of macroH2A1.1 to investigate its potential epigenetic role in sex dimorphic obesity, metabolic disturbances and gut dysbiosis. Whole body macroH2A1 knockout (KO) mice, generated with the Cre/loxP technology, and their control littermates were fed a high fat diet containing 60% of energy derived from fat. The diet was administered for three months starting from 10 to 12 weeks of age. We evaluated the progression in body weight, the food intake, and the tolerance to glucose by means of a glucose tolerance test. Gut microbiota composition, visceral adipose and liver tissue morphology were assessed. In addition, adipogenic gene expression patterns were evaluated in the visceral adipose tissue. Female KO mice for macroH2A1.1 had a more pronounced weight gain induced by high fat diet compared to their littermates, while the increase in body weight in male mice was similar in the two genotypes. Food intake was generally increased upon KO and decreased by high fat diet in both sexes, with the exception of KO females fed a high fat diet that displayed the same food intake of their littermates. In glucose tolerance tests, glucose levels were significantly elevated upon high fat diet in female KO compared to a standard diet, while this effect was absent in male KO. There were no differences in hepatic histology. Upon a high fat diet, in female adipocyte cross-sectional area was larger in KO compared to littermates: activation of proadipogenic genes (ACACB, AGT, ANGPT2, FASN, RETN, SLC2A4) and downregulation of antiadipogenic genes (AXIN1, E2F1, EGR2, JUN, SIRT1, SIRT2, UCP1, CCND1, CDKN1A, CDKN1B, EGR2) was detected. Gut microbiota profiling showed increase in Firmicutes and a decrease in Bacteroidetes in females, but not males, macroH2A1.1 KO mice. MacroH2A1.1 KO mice display sexual dimorphism in high fat diet-induced obesity and in gut dysbiosis, and may represent a useful model to investigate epigenetic and metabolic differences associated to the development of obesity-associated pathological conditions in males and females.© 2023.

,37993808,H2A.X promotes endosperm-specific DNA methylation in Arabidopsis thaliana.,BMC Plant Biol,"H2A.X is an H2A variant histone in eukaryotes, unique for its ability to respond to DNA damage, initiating the DNA repair pathway. H2A.X replacement within the histone octamer is mediated by the FAcilitates Chromatin Transactions (FACT) complex, a key chromatin remodeler. FACT is required for DEMETER (DME)-mediated DNA demethylation at certain loci in Arabidopsis thaliana female gametophytes during reproduction. Here, we sought to investigate whether H2A.X is involved in DME- and FACT-mediated DNA demethylation during reproduction.H2A.X is encoded by two genes in Arabidopsis genome, HTA3 and HTA5. We generated h2a.x double mutants, which displayed a normal growth profile, whereby flowering time, seed development, and root tip organization, S-phase progression and proliferation were all normal. However, h2a.x mutants were more sensitive to genotoxic stress, consistent with previous reports. H2A.X fused to Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) under the H2A.X promoter was highly expressed especially in newly developing Arabidopsis tissues, including in male and female gametophytes, where DME is also expressed. We examined DNA methylation in h2a.x developing seeds and seedlings using whole genome bisulfite sequencing, and found that CG DNA methylation is decreased genome-wide in h2a.x mutant endosperm. Hypomethylation was most striking in transposon bodies, and occurred on both parental alleles in the developing endosperm, but not the embryo or seedling. h2a.x-mediated hypomethylated sites overlapped DME targets, but also included other loci, predominately located in heterochromatic transposons and intergenic DNA.Our genome-wide methylation analyses suggest that H2A.X could function in preventing access of the DME demethylase to non-canonical sites. Overall, our data suggest that H2A.X is required to maintain DNA methylation homeostasis in the unique chromatin environment of the Arabidopsis endosperm.© 2023. The Author(s).",6.98E-57
,38043973,Genetics of migraine: Delineation of contemporary understanding of the genetic underpinning of migraine.,Handb Clin Neurol,"Migraine is a disabling episodic brain disorder with an increased familial relative risk, an increased concordance in monozygotic twins, and an estimated heritability of approximately 50%. Various genetic approaches have been applied to identify genetic factors conferring migraine risk. Initially, candidate gene associations studies (CGAS) have been performed that test DNA variants in genes prioritized based on presumed a priori knowledge of migraine pathophysiology. More recently, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are applied that test genetic variants, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), in a hypothesis-free manner. To date, GWAS have identified ~40 genetic loci associated with migraine. New GWAS data, which are expected to come out soon, will reveal over 100 loci. Also, large-scale GWAS, which have appeared for many traits over the last decade, have enabled studying the overlap in genetic architecture between migraine and its comorbid disorders. Importantly, other genetic factors that cannot be identified by a GWAS approach also confer risk for migraine. First steps have been taken to determine the contribution of these mechanisms by investigating mitochondrial DNA and epigenetic mechanisms. In addition to typical epigenetic mechanisms, that is, DNA methylation and histone modifications, also RNA-based mechanisms regulating gene silencing and activation have recently gotten attention. Regardless, until now, most relevant genetic discoveries related to migraine still come from investigating monogenetic syndromes with migraine as a prominent part of the phenotype. Experimental studies on these syndromes have expanded our knowledge on the mechanisms underlying migraine pathophysiology. It can be envisaged that when all (epi)genetic and phenotypic data on the common and rare forms of migraine will be integrated, this will help to unravel the biological mechanisms for migraine, which will likely guide decision-making in clinical practice in the future.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

,38132125,Mapping Chromatin Occupancy of Ppp1r1b-lncRNA Genome-Wide Using Chromatin Isolation by RNA Purification (ChIRP)-seq.,Cells,"Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) mediated transcriptional regulation is increasingly recognized as an important gene regulatory mechanism during development and disease. LncRNAs are emerging as critical regulators of chromatin state; yet the nature and the extent of their interactions with chromatin remain to be fully revealed. We have previously identifiedPpp1r1b-lncRNAas an essential epigenetic regulator of myogenic differentiation in cardiac and skeletal myocytes in mice and humans. We further demonstrated thatPpp1r1b-lncRNAfunction is mediated by the interaction with the chromatin-modifying complex polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) at the promoter of myogenic differentiation transcription factors,TBX5andMyoD1. Herein, we employed unbiased chromatin isolation by RNA purification (ChIRP) and high throughput sequencing to map the repertoire ofPpp1r1b-lncRNAchromatin occupancy genome-wide in the mouse muscle myoblast cell line. We uncovered a total of 99732 true peaks corresponding toPpp1r1b-lncRNAbinding sites at high confidence (p-value < 1E-5) and enrichment score ? 10). ThePpp1r1b-lncRNA-binding sites averaged 558 bp in length and were distributed widely within the coding and non-coding regions of the genome. Approximately 46% of these true peaks were mapped to gene elements, of which 1180 were mapped to experimentally validated promoter sequences. Importantly, the promoter-mapped binding sites were enriched in myogenic transcription factors and heart development while exhibiting focal interactions with known motifs of proximal promoters and transcription initiation by RNA Pol-II, including TATA-box, transcription initiator motif, CCAAT-box, and GC-box, supportingPpp1r1b-lncRNArole in transcription initiation of myogenic regulators. Remarkably, nearly 40% ofPpp1r1b-lncRNA-binding sites mapped to gene introns were enriched with the Homeobox family of transcription factors and exhibited TA-rich motif sequences, suggesting potential motif-specificPpp1r1b-lncRNA-bound introns. Lastly, more than 136521 enhancer sequences were detected inPpp1r1b-lncRNA-occupancy sites at high confidence. Among these enhancers, 3390 (12%) exhibited cell type/tissue-specific enrichment in fetal heart and muscles. Together, our findings provide further insights into the genome-widePpp1r1b-lncRNA:Chromatin interactome that may dictate its function in myogenic differentiation and potentially other cellular and biological processes.",3.08E-57
,37948464,Attention-based deep clustering method for scRNA-seq cell type identification.,PLoS Comput Biol,"Single-cell sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology provides higher resolution of cellular differences than bulk RNA sequencing and reveals the heterogeneity in biological research. The analysis of scRNA-seq datasets is premised on the subpopulation assignment. When an appropriate reference is not available, such as specific marker genes and single-cell reference atlas, unsupervised clustering approaches become the predominant option. However, the inherent sparsity and high-dimensionality of scRNA-seq datasets pose specific analytical challenges to traditional clustering methods. Therefore, a various deep learning-based methods have been proposed to address these challenges. As each method improves partially, a comprehensive method needs to be proposed. In this article, we propose a novel scRNA-seq data clustering method named AttentionAE-sc (Attention fusion AutoEncoder for single-cell). Two different scRNA-seq clustering strategies are combined through an attention mechanism, that include zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB)-based methods dealing with the impact of dropout events and graph autoencoder (GAE)-based methods relying on information from neighbors to guide the dimension reduction. Based on an iterative fusion between denoising and topological embeddings, AttentionAE-sc can easily acquire clustering-friendly cell representations that similar cells are closer in the hidden embedding. Compared with several state-of-art baseline methods, AttentionAE-sc demonstrated excellent clustering performance on 16 real scRNA-seq datasets without the need to specify the number of groups. Additionally, AttentionAE-sc learned improved cell representations and exhibited enhanced stability and robustness. Furthermore, AttentionAE-sc achieved remarkable identification in a breast cancer single-cell atlas dataset and provided valuable insights into the heterogeneity among different cell subtypes.Copyright: © 2023 Li et al.

,38036577,Comprehensive analysis of necroptotic patterns and associated immune landscapes in individualized treatment of skin cutaneous melanoma.,Sci Rep,"Skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) constitutes a malignant cutaneous neoplasm characterized by an exceedingly unfavorable prognosis. Over the past years, necroptosis, a manifestation of inflammatory programmed cell demise, has gained substantial traction in its application. However, a conclusive correlation between the expression of necroptosis-related genes (NRGs) and SKCM patient's prognosis remains elusive. In this endeavor, we have undertaken an integrative analysis of genomic data, aiming to provide an exhaustive evaluation of the intricate interplay between melanoma necroptosis and immune-infiltration nuances within the tumor microenvironment. Through meticulous scrutiny, we have endeavored to discern the prognostic potency harbored by individual necroptosis-associated genes. Our efforts culminated in the establishment of a risk stratification framework, allowing for the appraisal of necroptosis irregularities within each afflicted cutaneous melanoma patient. Notably, those SKCM patients classified within the low-risk cohort exhibited a markedly elevated survival quotient, in stark contrast to their high-risk counterparts (p?<?0.001). Remarkably, the low-risk cohort not only displayed a more favorable survival rate but also exhibited an enhanced responsiveness to immunotherapeutic interventions, relative to their high-risk counterparts. The outcomes of this investigation proffer insights into a conceivable mechanistic underpinning linking necroptosis-related attributes to the intricacies of the tumor microenvironment. This prompts a conjecture regarding the plausible association between necroptosis characteristics and the broader tumor microenvironmental milieu. However, it is imperative to emphasize that the pursuit of discerning whether the expression profiles of NRG genes can indeed be regarded as viable therapeutic targets necessitates further comprehensive exploration and scrutiny. In conclusion, our study sheds light on the intricate interrelationship between necroptosis-related factors and the tumor microenvironment, potentially opening avenues for therapeutic interventions. However, the prospect of translating these findings into clinical applications mandates rigorous investigation.© 2023. The Author(s).",2.16E-57
,37991688,Conserved and non-conserved RNA-target modules in plants: lessons for a better understanding of Marchantia development.,Plant Mol Biol,"A wide variety of functional regulatory non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) have been identified as essential regulators of plant growth and development. Depending on their category, ncRNAs are not only involved in modulating target gene expression at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels but also are involved in processes like RNA splicing and RNA-directed DNA methylation. To fulfill their molecular roles properly, ncRNAs must be precisely processed by multiprotein complexes. In the case of small RNAs, DICER-LIKE (DCL) proteins play critical roles in the production of mature molecules. Land plant genomes contain at least four distinct classes of DCL family proteins (DCL1-DCL4), of which DCL1, DCL3 and DCL4 are also present in the genomes of bryophytes, indicating the early divergence of these genes. The liverwort Marchantia polymorpha has become an attractive model species for investigating the evolutionary history of regulatory ncRNAs and proteins that are responsible for ncRNA biogenesis. Recent studies on Marchantia have started to uncover the similarities and differences in ncRNA production and function between the basal lineage of bryophytes and other land plants. In this review, we summarize findings on the essential role of regulatory ncRNAs in Marchantia development. We provide a comprehensive overview of conserved ncRNA-target modules among M. polymorpha, the moss Physcomitrium patens and the dicot Arabidopsis thaliana, as well as Marchantia-specific modules. Based on functional studies and data from the literature, we propose new connections between regulatory pathways involved in Marchantia's vegetative and reproductive development and emphasize the need for further functional studies to understand the molecular mechanisms that control ncRNA-directed developmental processes.© 2023.

,38027011,Multi-omics analysis reveals CLIC1 as a therapeutic vulnerability of gliomas.,Front Pharmacol,"Introduction:Despite advances in comprehending cancer biology, malignant gliomas remain incurable. The present work conducted a multi-omics analysis for investigating the significance of chloride intracellular channel 1 (CLIC1) in gliomas.Methods:Multi-omics data of glioma covering transcriptomics, genomics, DNA methylation and single-cell transcriptomics from multiple public cohorts were enrolled for analyzing CLIC1.In vitroexperiments were conducted to measure apoptosis and cell mobility in U251 and U373 glioma cells following transfection of CLIC1 siRNAs.Results:Elevated CLIC1 expression was proven to stably and independently estimate worse survival outcomes. CLIC1 expression was higher in more advanced stage, wild-type IDH and unmethylated MGMT samples. Tumorigenic and anticancer immunity pathways were remarkably enriched in CLIC1-up-regulated tumors. Additionally, CLIC1 was positively linked with cancer-immunity cycle, stromal activation, DNA damage repair and cell cycle. Suppressing CLIC1 resulted in apoptosis and attenuated cell motility of glioma cells. More frequent genomic alterations were found in CLIC1-up-regulated tumors. CLIC1 expression presented a remarkably negative connection to DNA methylation. High CLIC1 expression samples were more sensitive to camptothecin, cisplatin, doxorubicin, erlotinib, paclitaxel, rapamycin, clofarabine, tanespimycin, methotrexate, everolimus, TAK-733, trametinib and AZD8330. Tumors with upregulated CLIC1 presented abundant immune cell infiltration, higher expression of immune-checkpoints and -modulators and similar transcriptome profiling, indicative of well response to immune-checkpoint blockade (ICB). Nevertheless, due to elevated TIDE score, tumors with CLIC1 upregulation appeared to be resistant to ICB. Single-cell analysis unveiled that CLIC1 was expressed ubiquitously in tumor cells and tumor microenvironment.Conclusions:Overall, CLIC1 was a promising treatment vulnerability in glioma.Copyright © 2023 Wang and He.",1.8E-57
,38130628,Efficacy of prednisone combined with mycophenolate mofetil for immunoglobulin A nephropathy with moderate-to-severe renal dysfunction.,World J Clin Cases,"Immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) is a common form of chronic glomerulonephritis. Currently, IgAN is one of the main causes of chronic renal failure in China; its prognosis varies greatly between patients, with renal function at the time of diagnosis and prognosis being strongly correlated. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is a drug with a good immunomodulatory effect and is commonly used clinically. However, its effects in IgAN have not yet been clearly demonstrated. Therefore, herein, we retrospectively compared the effectiveness and safety of prednisone alone or combined with MMF for the treatment of primary IgAN with moderate-to-severe renal impairment.To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of prednisone and MMF in treating IgAN with moderate-to-severe renal dysfunction.Between January 2011 and December 2020, 200 patients with moderate-to-severe IgAN were included in this study, all of whom were admitted to Wuxi People's Hospital affiliated with Nanjing Medical University. All patients underwent a renal puncture biopsy, which revealed primary IgAN with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 30-60 mL/min. The patients were divided into a glucocorticoid therapy group (GTG) and an immunosuppressive therapy group (ITG) according to the different treatment regimens, with 100 patients in each group. Based on general treatments, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/ angiotensin receptor blockers, patients in the GTG were administered prednisone 0.5-0.8 mg/ (kg·d-1) for 4-8 wk, which was reduced by 5 mg every two weeks until the maintenance(30 mg/d) dose was reached and maintained for 12 mo. In the ITG, MMF was administered at 1.0 g/d for 6-12 mo, followed by a maintenance dosage of 0.5 g/d for 12 mo. Age, sex, blood pressure, 24-h urinary egg white measurement, serum creatinine (Scr), blood uric acid, blood albumin, blood potassium (K), hemoglobin, GFR, alanine aminotransferase, total cholesterol (T-CHO), fasting blood glucose, and body mass index were recorded. The 24-h urinary protein, Scr, and GFR levels were recorded 3, 6, 9, and 12 mo after treatment. Follow-up data were also collected.No discernible differences existed between the two groups in terms of age, sex, blood pressure, creatinine, 24-h urinary protein level, GFR, or other biochemical indicators at the time of enrollment. Both regimens significantly reduced the 24-h urinary protein quantitation and stabilized renal function. Nine months after treatment, the 24-h urinary protein and Scr of the ITG decreased more significantly than those of the GTG. By the 12thmonth of treatment, the 24-h urinary protein and Scr in both groups continued to decrease compared to those by the 9thmonth. In addition, the overall response rate in the ITG was significantly higher than that in the GTG. The occurrence of side effects did not vary significantly between the two regimens; however, endpoint events were significantly more common in the GTG than in the ITG. The follow-up time for the GTG was noticeably lower than that for the ITG.Prednisone combined with MMF was effective for the treatment of IgAN with moderate-to-severe renal dysfunction.©The Author(s) 2023.

,38028548,Machine learning combining multi-omics data and network algorithms identifies adrenocortical carcinoma prognostic biomarkers.,Front Mol Biosci,"Background:Rare endocrine cancers such as Adrenocortical Carcinoma (ACC) present a serious diagnostic and prognostication challenge. The knowledge about ACC pathogenesis is incomplete, and patients have limited therapeutic options. Identification of molecular drivers and effective biomarkers is required for timely diagnosis of the disease and stratify patients to offer the most beneficial treatments. In this study we demonstrate how machine learning methods integrating multi-omics data, in combination with system biology tools, can contribute to the identification of new prognostic biomarkers for ACC.Methods:ACC gene expression and DNA methylation datasets were downloaded from the Xena Browser (GDC TCGA Adrenocortical Carcinoma cohort). A highly correlated multi-omics signature discriminating groups of samples was identified with the data integration analysis for biomarker discovery using latent components (DIABLO) method. Additional regulators of the identified signature were discovered using Clarivate CBDD (Computational Biology for Drug Discovery) network propagation and hidden nodes algorithms on a curated network of molecular interactions (MetaBase). The discriminative power of the multi-omics signature and their regulators was delineated by training a random forest classifier using 55 samples, by employing a 10-fold cross validation with five iterations. The prognostic value of the identified biomarkers was further assessed on an external ACC dataset obtained from GEO (GSE49280) using the Kaplan-Meier estimator method. An optimal prognostic signature was finally derived using the stepwise Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) that allowed categorization of samples into high and low-risk groups.Results:A multi-omics signature including genes, micro RNA's and methylation sites was generated. Systems biology tools identified additional genes regulating the features included in the multi-omics signature. RNA-seq, miRNA-seq and DNA methylation sets of features revealed a high power to classify patients from stages I-II and stages III-IV, outperforming previously identified prognostic biomarkers. Using an independent dataset, associations of the genes included in the signature with Overall Survival (OS) data demonstrated that patients with differential expression levels of 8 genes and 4 micro RNA's showed a statistically significant decrease in OS. We also found an independent prognostic signature for ACC with potential use in clinical practice, combining 9-gene/micro RNA features, that successfully predicted high-risk ACC cancer patients.Conclusion:Machine learning and integrative analysis of multi-omics data, in combination with Clarivate CBDD systems biology tools, identified a set of biomarkers with high prognostic value for ACC disease. Multi-omics data is a promising resource for the identification of drivers and new prognostic biomarkers in rare diseases that could be used in clinical practice.Copyright © 2023 Martin-Hernandez, Espeso-Gil, Domingo, Latorre, Hervas, Hernandez Mora and Kotelnikova.",1.05E-57

Early detection of CAD is challenging due to the lack of specific biomarkers. The gut microbiota and host-microbiota interactions have been well documented to affect human health. However, investigation that reveals the role of gut microbes in CAD is still limited. This study aims to uncover the synergistic effects of host genes and gut microbes associated with CAD through integrative genomic analyses.Herein, we collected 52 fecal and 50 blood samples from CAD patients and matched controls, and performed amplicon and transcriptomic sequencing on these samples, respectively. By comparing CAD patients with health controls, we found that dysregulated gut microbes were significantly associated with CAD. By leveraging the Random Forest method, we found that combining 20 bacteria and 30 gene biomarkers could distinguish CAD patients from health controls with a high performance (AUC?=?0.92). We observed that there existed prominent associations of gut microbes with several clinical indices relevant to heart functions. Integration analysis revealed that CAD-relevant gut microbe genus Fusicatenibacter was associated with expression of CAD-risk genes, such as GBP2, MLKL, and CPR65, which is in line with previous evidence (Tang et al., Nat Rev Cardiol 16:137-154, 2019; Kummen et al., J Am Coll Cardiol 71:1184-1186, 2018). In addition, the upregulation of immune-related pathways in CAD patients were identified to be primarily associated with higher abundance of genus Blautia, Eubacterium, Fusicatenibacter, and Monoglobus.Our results highlight that dysregulated gut microbes contribute risk to CAD by interacting with host genes. These identified microbes and interacted risk genes may have high potentials as biomarkers for CAD.© 2023. The Author(s).",8.52E-58
,38065939,LncRNA MIR200CHG inhibits EMT in gastric cancer by stabilizing miR-200c from target-directed miRNA degradation.,Nat Commun,"Gastric cancer (GC) is a heterogeneous disease, threatening millions of lives worldwide, yet the functional roles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in different GC subtypes remain poorly characterized. Microsatellite stable (MSS)/epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) GC is the most aggressive subtype associated with a poor prognosis. Here, we apply integrated network analysis to uncover lncRNA heterogeneity between GC subtypes, and identify MIR200CHG as a master regulator mediating EMT specifically in MSS/EMT GC. The expression of MIR200CHG is silenced in MSS/EMT GC by promoter hypermethylation, associated with poor prognosis. MIR200CHG reverses the mesenchymal identity of GC cells in vitro and inhibits metastasis in vivo. Mechanistically, MIR200CHG not only facilitates the biogenesis of its intronic miRNAs miR-200c and miR-141, but also protects miR-200c from target-directed miRNA degradation (TDMD) through direct binding to miR-200c. Our studies reveal a landscape of a subtype-specific lncRNA regulatory network, providing clinically relevant biological insights towards MSS/EMT GC.© 2023. The Author(s).",7.74E-58

To predict long-term prognosis and design novel therapies for BRCA, more sensitive markers need to be explored.Data from 1089 BRCA patients were downloaded from TCGA database. Pearson's correlation analysis and univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to assess the role of cell death-related genes (CDGs) in predicting BRCA prognosis. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were generated to compare the overall survival in the two subgroups. A nomogram was constructed using risk scores based on the five CDGs and other clinicopathological features. CCK-8, EdU incorporation, and colony formation assays were performed to verify the inhibitory effect of NFKBIA on BRCA cell proliferation. Transwell assay, flow cytometry, and immunohistochemistry analyses were performed to ascertain the biological function of NFKBIA.Five differentially expressed CDGs were detected among 156 CDGs. The risk score for each patient was then calculated based on the expression levels of the five CDGs. Distinct differences in immune in?ltration, expression of immune-oncological targets, mutation status, and half-maximal inhibitory concentration values of some targeted drugs were observed between the high- and low-risk groups. Finally, in vitro cell experiments verified that NFKBIA overexpression suppresses the proliferation and migration of BRCA cells.Our study revealed that some CDGs, especially NFKBIA, could serve as sensitive markers for predicting the prognosis of patients with BRCA and designing more personalized clinical therapies.© 2023 The Authors.",3.6E-58

The SET (Su(var), E, and Trithorax) domain-containing protein is of significant importance in plant development, growth, and response to abiotic stress by modifying the lysine methylation status of histone. However, the comprehensive identification of SET domain genes (SDG) have not been conducted in upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.).A total of 229 SDGs were identified in four Gossypium species, including G. arboretum, G. raimondii, G. hirsutum, and G. barbadense. These genes could distinctly be divided into eight groups. The analysis of gene structure and protein motif revealed a high degree of conservation among the SDGs within the same group. Collinearity analysis suggested that the SDGs of Gossypium species and most of the other selected plants were mainly expanded by dispersed duplication events and whole genome duplication (WGD) events. The allopolyploidization event also has a significant impact on the expansion of SDGs in tetraploid Gossypium species. Furthermore, the characteristics of these genes have been relatively conserved during the evolution. Cis-element analysis revealed that GhSDGs play a role in resistance to abiotic stresses and growth development. Furthermore, the qRT-PCR results have indicated the ability of GhSDGs to respond to salt stress. Co-expression analysis revealed that GhSDG51 might co-express with genes associated with salt stress. In addition, the silencing of GhSDG51 in cotton by the virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) method suggested a potential positive regulatory role of GhSDG51 in salt stress.The results of this study comprehensively analyze the SDGs in cotton and provide a basis for understanding the biological role of SDGs in the stress resistance in upland cotton.© 2023.

The C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) has shown abnormal expression associated with progression of multiple malignancies, however, its role in predicting the prognosis and immunotherapy response of GBM remains poorly understood.CCL2 was highly expressed in GBM as analyzed by integrating CGGA, GEPIA and UALCAN online platforms, and further verified by histologic examinations, qRT-PCR analysis, and independent GEO datasets. CCL2 could serve as an independent prognostic factor for both the poor overall survival and progression-free survival of GBM patients based on TCGA data, univariate and multivariate cox analyses. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that CCL2 mainly participated in the regulation of chemokine signaling pathway and inflammatory response. Further, CCL2 expression was positively correlated with CD4 T cells, macrophages, neutrophils and myeloid dendritic cells infiltrating GBM as calculated by the TIMER2.0 algorithm. Importantly, the tumor immune dysfunction and exclusion (TIDE) algorithm showed that in CCL2-high GBM group, the expression of CD274, CTLA4, HAVCR2 and other immune checkpoints were significantly increased, and the immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy was accordingly more responsive.CCL2 can be used as a predictor of prognosis as well as immunotherapy response in GBM, offering potential clinical implications.© 2023.

Mitochondrial ribosomal protein L48 (MRPL48) belongs to the mitochondrial ribosomal protein family, which participates in energy production. Studies have shown that MRPL48 can predict osteosarcoma incidence and prognosis, as well as promotes colorectal cancer progression. However, the role of MRPL48 in HCC remains unknown.TCGA, GEO, HCCDB, CPTAC, SMART, UALCAN, Kaplan-Meier plotter, cBioPortal, and MethSurv were performed for bioinformatics purposes. Quantitative RT-PCR, immunoblotting, and functional studies were conducted to validate the methodology in vitro.MRPL48 was greatly overexpressed in HCC tissues, compared with healthy tissue, which was subsequently demonstrated in vitro as well. The survival and regression analyses showed that MRPL48 expression is of significant clinical prognostic value in HCC. The ROC curve and nomogram analysis indicated that MRPL48 is a powerful predictor of HCC. MRPL48 methylation was adversely associated with the expression of MRPL48, and patients with a low level of methylation had poorer overall survival than those with a high level of methylation. GSEA showed that the expression of the MRPL48 was correlated with Resolution of Sister Chromatid Cohesion, Mitotic Prometaphase, Retinoblastoma Gene in Cancer, RHO Gtpases Activate Formins, Mitotic Metaphase and Anaphase, and Cell Cycle Checkpoints. An analysis of immune cell infiltration showed a significant association between MRPL48 and immune cell infiltration subsets, which impacted the survival of HCC patients. Additionally, MRPL48 knockdown reduced HCC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro.We demonstrated that MRPL48 expression may be associated with HCC development and prognosis.

,37943059,Human mRNA in saliva can correctly identify individuals harboring acute infection.,mBio,"The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated the poor ability of body temperature to reliably identify SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals, an observation that has been made before in the context of other infectious diseases. While acute infection does not always cause fever, it does reliably drive host transcriptional responses as the body responds at the site of infection. These transcriptional changes can occur both in cells that are directly harboring replicating pathogens and in cells elsewhere that receive a molecular signal that infection is occurring. Here, we identify a core set of approximately 70 human genes that are together upregulated in cultured human cells infected by a broad array of viral, bacterial, and fungal pathogens. We have named these ""core response"" genes. In theory, transcripts from these genes could serve as biomarkers of infection in the human body, in a way that is agnostic to the specific pathogen causing infection. As such, we perform human studies to show that these infection-induced human transcripts can be measured in the saliva of people harboring different types of infections. The number of these transcripts in saliva can correctly classify infection status (whether a person harbors an infection) 91% of the time. Furthermore, in the case of SARS-CoV-2 specifically, the number of core response transcripts in saliva correctly identifies infectious individuals even when enrollees, themselves, are asymptomatic and do not know they are infected.IMPORTANCEThere are a variety of clinical and laboratory criteria available to clinicians in controlled healthcare settings to help them identify whether an infectious disease is present. However, in situations such as a new epidemic caused by an unknown infectious agent, in health screening contexts performed within communities and outside of healthcare facilities or in battlefield or potential biowarfare situations, this gets more difficult. Pathogen-agnostic methods for rapid screening and triage of large numbers of people for infection status are needed, in particular methods that might work on an easily accessible biospecimen like saliva. Here, we identify a small, core set of approximately 70 human genes whose transcripts serve as saliva-based biomarkers of infection in the human body, in a way that is agnostic to the specific pathogen causing infection.",4.52E-59

In line with these inherent aggressive characteristics, only a subset of patients shows a clinical response to the standard of care therapies, thereby highlighting the need for a more personalized treatment approach. In this study, we comprehensively unraveled the intra-patient response heterogeneity and intrinsic aggressive nature of PDAC on bulk and single-organoid resolution. We leveraged a fully characterized PDAC organoid panel (N?=?8) and matched our artificial intelligence-driven, live-cell organoid image analysis with retrospective clinical patient response. In line with the clinical outcomes, we identified patient-specific sensitivities to the standard of care therapies (gemcitabine-paclitaxel and FOLFIRINOX) using a growth rate-based and normalized drug response metric. Moreover, the single-organoid analysis was able to detect resistant as well as invasive PDAC organoid clones, which was orchestrates on a patient, therapy, drug, concentration and time-specific level. Furthermore, our in vitro organoid analysis indicated a correlation with the matched patient progression-free survival (PFS) compared to the current, conventional drug response readouts. This work not only provides valuable insights on the response complexity in PDAC, but it also highlights the potential applications (extendable to other tumor types) and clinical translatability of our approach in drug discovery and the emerging era of personalized medicine.© 2023.

However, the molecular mechanism underlying lipid metabolism in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and its effect on patient prognosis are not well understood. The objective of our study was to construct a lipid metabolism-related prognostic model to improve prognosis prediction in ESCC.We downloaded the mRNA expression profiles and corresponding survival data of patients with ESCC from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) databases. We performed differential expression analysis to identify differentially expressed lipid metabolism-related genes (DELMGs). We used Univariate Cox regression and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) analyses to establish a risk model in the GEO cohort and used data of patients with ESCC from the TCGA cohort for validation. We also explored the relationship between the risk model and the immune microenvironment via infiltrated immune cells and immune checkpoints.The result showed that 132 unique DELMGs distinguished patients with ESCC from the controls. We identified four genes (ACAA1, ACOT11, B4GALNT1, and DDHD1) as prognostic gene expression signatures to construct a risk model. Patients were classified into high- and low-risk groups as per the signature-based risk score. We used the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival analysis to validate the predictive performance of the 4-gene signature in both the training and validation sets. Infiltrated immune cells and immune checkpoints indicated a difference in the immune status between the two risk groups.The results of our study indicated that a prognostic model based on the 4-gene signature related to lipid metabolism was useful for the prediction of prognosis in patients with ESCC.© 2023 Shen et al.",1.99E-59
,38062004,ALOX5 deficiency contributes to bladder cancer progression by mediating ferroptosis escape.,Cell Death Dis,"Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent form of regulated cell death driven by the lethal lipid peroxides. Previous studies have demonstrated that inducing ferroptosis holds great potential in cancer therapy, especially for patients with traditional therapy failure. However, cancer cells can acquire ferroptosis evasion during progression. To date, the therapeutic potential of inducing ferroptosis in bladder cancer (BCa) remains unclear, and whether a ferroptosis escape mechanism exists in BCa needs further investigation. This study verified that low pathological stage BCa cells were highly sensitive to RSL3-induced ferroptosis, whereas high pathological stage BCa cells exhibited obviously ferroptosis resistance. RNA-seq, RNAi-mediated loss-of-function, and CRISPR/Cas9 experiments demonstrated that ALOX5 deficiency was the crucial factor of BCa resistance to ferroptosis in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, we found that ALOX5 deficiency was regulated by EGR1 at the transcriptional level. Clinically, ALOX5 expression was decreased in BCa tissues, and its low expression was associated with poor survival. Collectively, this study uncovers a novel mechanism for BCa ferroptosis escape and proposes that ALOX5 may be a valuable therapeutic target and prognostic biomarker in BCa treatment.© 2023.

,37982970,Embryonic exposure to decitabine induces multiple neural tube defects in developing zebrafish.,Fish Physiol Biochem,"Neural tube defects are severe congenital disorders of the central nervous system that originate during embryonic development when the neural tube fails to close completely. It affects one to two infants per 1000 births. The aetiology is multifactorial with contributions from both genetic and environmental factors. Dysregulated epigenetic mechanisms, in particular the abnormal genome-wide methylation during embryogenesis, have been linked to developmental abnormalities including neural tube defects. The current study investigated the influence of decitabine (DCT), a DNA methylation inhibitor, on embryonic development in zebrafish, with a focus on neural tube formation. The developing zebrafish embryos were exposed to graded concentrations of decitabine (from 13.69 ?M to 1 mM) before the onset of neurulation. The developmental process was monitored at regular time intervals post fertilization. At 120 h post fertilization, the developing embryos were inspected individually to determine the incidence and severity of neural tube defects. Using alizarin red staining, the cranial and caudal neural tube morphology was examined in formaldehyde fixed larvae. Anomalies in neural tube and somite development, as well as a delay in hatching, were discovered at an early stage of development. As development continued, neural tube defects became increasingly evident, and there was a concentration-dependent rise in the prevalence and severity of various neural tube defects. 90% of growing embryos in the group exposed to decitabine 1 mM had multiple neural tube malformations, and 10% had isolated neural tube defects. With several abnormalities, the caudal region of the neural tube was seriously compromised. The histopathological studies supported the malformations in neural tube. Our study revealed the harmful impact of decitabine on the development of the neural tube in growing zebrafish. Moreover, these findings support the hypothesis that the hypomethylation during embryonic development causes neural tube defects.© 2023.

,37993704,DNA methylome analysis provides insights into gene regulatory mechanism for better performance of rice under fluctuating environmental conditions: epigenomics of adaptive plasticity.,Planta,"Roots play an important role in adaptive plasticity of rice under dry/direct-sown conditions. However, hypomethylation of genes in leaves (resulting in up-regulated expression) complements the adaptive plasticity of Nagina-22 under DSR conditions. Rice is generally cultivated by transplanting which requires plenty of water for irrigation. Such a practice makes rice cultivation a challenging task under global climate change and reducing water availability. However, dry-seeded/direct-sown rice (DSR) has emerged as a resource-saving alternative to transplanted rice (TPR). Though some of the well-adapted local cultivars are used for DSR, only limited success has been achieved in developing DSR varieties mainly because of a limited knowledge of adaptability of rice under fluctuating environmental conditions. Based on better morpho-physiological and agronomic performance of Nagina-22 (N-22) under DSR conditions, N-22 and IR-64 were grown by transplanting and direct-sowing and used for whole genome methylome analysis to unravel the epigenetic basis of adaptive plasticity of rice. Comparative methylome and transcriptome analyses indicated a large number (4078) of genes regulated through DNA methylation/demethylation in N-22 under DSR conditions. Gene?×?environment interactions play important roles in adaptive plasticity of rice under direct-sown conditions. While genes for pectinesterase, LRK10, C2H2 zinc-finger protein, splicing factor, transposable elements, and some of the unannotated proteins were hypermethylated, the genes for regulation of transcription, protein phosphorylation, etc. were hypomethylated in CG context in the root of N-22, which played important roles in providing adaptive plasticity to N-22 under DSR conditions. Hypomethylation leading to up-regulation of gene expression in the leaf complements the adaptive plasticity of N-22 under DSR conditions. Moreover, differential post-translational modification of proteins and chromatin assembly/disassembly through DNA methylation in CHG context modulate adaptive plasticity of N-22. These findings would help developing DSR cultivars for increased water-productivity and ecological efficiency.© 2023.

,37958531,Circular RNA circIGF2BP3 Promotes the Proliferation and Differentiation of Chicken Primary Myoblasts.,Int J Mol Sci,"The quality and quantity of animal meat are closely related to the development of skeletal muscle, which, in turn, is determined by myogenic cells, including myoblasts and skeletal muscle satellite cells (SMSCs). Circular RNA, an endogenous RNA derivative formed through specific reverse splicing in mRNA precursors, has the potential to influence muscle development by binding to miRNAs or regulating gene expression involved in muscular growth at the transcriptional level. Previous high-throughput sequencing of circRNA in chicken liver tissue revealed a circular transcript, circIGF2BP3, derived from the gene encoding insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA binding protein 3 (IGF2BP3). In this study, we confirmed the presence of the natural circular molecule of circIGF2BP3 through an RNase R enzyme tolerance assay. RT-qPCR results showed high circIGF2BP3 expression in the pectoral and thigh muscles ofYuexi frizzled feather chickensat embryonic ages 14 and 18, as well as at 7 weeks post-hatch. Notably, its expression increased during embryonic development, followed by a rapid decrease after birth. As well as using RT-qPCR, Edu, CCK-8, immunofluorescence, and Western blot techniques, we demonstrated that overexpressing circIGF2BP3 could promote the proliferation and differentiation of chicken primary myoblasts through upregulating genes such as proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), cyclin D1(CCND1), cyclin E1 (CCNE1), cyclin dependent kinase 2 (CDK2), myosin heavy chain (MyHC), myoblast-determining 1 (MyoD1), myogenin (MyoG), andMyomaker. In conclusion, circIGF2BP3 promotes the proliferation and differentiation of myoblasts in chickens. This study establishes a foundation for further investigation into the biological functions and mechanisms of circIGF2BP3 in myoblasts proliferation and differentiation.",2.4E-60
,37932771,A genomic perspective of the aging human and mouse lung with a focus on immune response and cellular senescence.,Immun Ageing,"The aging lung is a complex process and influenced by various stressors, especially airborne pathogens and xenobiotics. Additionally, a lifetime exposure to antigens results in structural and functional changes of the lung; yet an understanding of the cell type specific responses remains elusive. To gain insight into age-related changes in lung function and inflammaging, we evaluated 89 mouse and 414 individual human lung genomic data sets with a focus on genes mechanistically linked to extracellular matrix (ECM), cellular senescence, immune response and pulmonary surfactant, and we interrogated single cell RNAseq data to fingerprint cell type specific changes.We identified 117 and 68 mouse and human genes linked to ECM remodeling which accounted for 46% and 27%, respectively of all ECM coding genes. Furthermore, we identified 73 and 31 mouse and human genes linked to cellular senescence, and the majority code for the senescence associated secretory phenotype. These cytokines, chemokines and growth factors are primarily secreted by macrophages and fibroblasts. Single-cell RNAseq data confirmed age-related induced expression of marker genes of macrophages, neutrophil, eosinophil, dendritic, NK-, CD4+, CD8+-T and B cells in the lung of aged mice. This included the highly significant regulation of 20 genes coding for the CD3-T-cell receptor complex. Conversely, for the human lung we primarily observed macrophage and CD4+and CD8+marker genes as changed with age. Additionally, we noted an age-related induced expression of marker genes for mouse basal, ciliated, club and goblet cells, while for the human lung, fibroblasts and myofibroblasts marker genes increased with age. Therefore, we infer a change in cellular activity of these cell types with age. Furthermore, we identified predominantly repressed expression of surfactant coding genes, especially the surfactant transporter Abca3, thus highlighting remodeling of surfactant lipids with implications for the production of inflammatory lipids and immune response.We report the genomic landscape of the aging lung and provide a rationale for its growing stiffness and age-related inflammation. By comparing the mouse and human pulmonary genome, we identified important differences between the two species and highlight the complex interplay of inflammaging, senescence and the link to ECM remodeling in healthy but aged individuals.© 2023.

,37981008,Proteomic investigation reveals the role of bacterial laccase from Bacillus pumilus in oxidative stress defense.,J Proteomics,"The wide distribution of laccases in nature makes them involved in different biological processes. However, little information is known about how laccase participates in the defense machinery of bacteria against oxidative stress. The present study aimed to elucidate the oxidative stress response mechanism of Bacillus pumilus ZB1 and the functional role of bacterial laccase in stress defense. The oxidative stress caused by methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) significantly induced laccase activity and its transcript level. The morphological analysis revealed that the defense of B. pumilus ZB1 against oxidative stress was activated. Based on the proteomic study, 114 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were up-regulated and 79 DEPs were down-regulated. In COG analysis, 66.40% DEPs were classified into the category ""Metabolism"". We confirmed that laccase was up-regulated in response to MMS stress and its functional annotation was related to ""Secondary metabolites biosynthesis, transport and catabolism"". Based on protein-protein interaction prediction, two up-regulated DEPs (YcnJ and GabP) showed interaction with laccase and contributed to the formation of laccase stability and adaptability. The overexpressed laccase might improve the antioxidative property of B. pumilus ZB1. These findings provide an insight and the guidelines for better exploitation of bioremediation using bacterial laccase. SIGNIFICANCE: Bacillus pumilus is a gram-positive bacterium that has the potential for many applications, such as bioremediation. The expression of bacterial laccase is significantly influenced by oxidative stress, while the underlying mechanism of laccase overexpression in bacteria has not been fully studied. Elucidation of the biological process may benefit the bioremediation using bacteria in the future. In this study, the differentially expressed proteins were analyzed using a TMT-labeling proteomic approach when B. pumilus was treated with methyl methanesulfonate (MMS). Reactive oxygen species induced by MMS activated the secondary metabolites biosynthesis, transport, and catabolism in B. pumilus, including laccase overexpression. Moreover, the simultaneously up-regulated YcnJ and GabP may benefit the synthesis and the stability of laccase, then improve the antioxidative property of B. pumilus against environmental stress. Our findings advance the understanding of the adaptive mechanism of B. pumilus to environmental conditions.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",4.97E-61

Regulates Lipid Metabolism and Promotes Fat Browning in 3T3-L1 Adipocytes.,Pharmaceuticals (Basel),"Fat browning, which converts white adipose tissue to brown, has attracted attention as a promising strategy for the treatment of obesity. Betanin (BT) has been reported to have potential anti-obesity activity. 3T3-L1 cells were differentiated for 7 days during BT treatment. The BT concentration range for the study was determined using an MTT assay, and lipid accumulation was evaluated by Oil-Red-O staining. The expression of protein level was analyzed by Western blot. Immunofluorescence images were performed with confocal microscopy to visually show the amount and location of thermogenesis factor uncoupling protein1 (UCP1) and mitochondria. qRT-PCR was performed to evaluate mRNA expression. BT inhibited lipid accumulation and increased the expression of UCP1, peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR?), and PPAR? coactivator-1 alpha (PGC-1?). In addition, the increases in beige adipocyte-specific markers were observed, supporting BT-mediated browning of the fat tissue. The UCP1 was localized in the inner membrane of the mitochondria, and its expression was associated with mitochondrial activation. Consistent with this, the mRNA expression of mitochondrial biogenesis markers increased in 3T3-L1 cells after BT treatment. Immunofluorescence staining also indicated an increased number of mitochondria and UCP1, respectively. Moreover, BT inhibited lipogenesis and enhanced lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation. This mechanism has been suggested to be mediated by an adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway. BT induces fat browning and regulates lipid metabolism via the AMPK-mediated pathway in 3T3-L1 cells, suggesting that BT can be a promising candidate for controlling obesity.",4.43E-61
,38161736,Comprehensive pan-cancer analysis unveils the significant prognostic value and potential role in immune microenvironment modulation of TRIB3.,Comput Struct Biotechnol J,"TRIB3, a pseudokinase, was previously studied within only some specific cancer types, leaving its comprehensive functions in pan-cancer contexts largely unexplored. Here, we performed an integrated analysis ofTRIB3expression, prognosis, genetic alterations, functional enrichment and tumor immune-related characteristics in 33 cancer types. Our results showed thatTRIB3exhibits high expression levels across 24 different cancer types and correlates closely with unfavorable prognoses. Meanwhile,TRIB3shows mutations in a wide spectrum of 22 distinct cancer types, with the predominant mutation types being missense mutations and gene amplifications, and significant changes in DNA methylation levels in 14 types of cancer. We further discovered thatTRIB3expression is significantly associated with cancer immune-related genome mutations, such as tumor mutational burden (TMB), microsatellite instability (MSI) and DNA mismatch repair (MMR), and infiltration of immunosuppressive cells, such as CD4+Th2 cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), into the tumor microenvironment. These results indicated that the expression ofTRIB3might reshape the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) and lead to immunosuppressive ""cold"" tumors. In addition, our results confirmed that the loss of function ofTRIB3inhibits cell proliferation, promotes apoptosis, and leads to significant enrichment of ""hot"" tumor-related immune pathways, at least in breast cancer cells, which further supports the important role ofTRIB3in cancer prognosis and TIME regulation. Together, this pan-cancer investigation provided a comprehensive understanding of the critical role ofTRIB3in human cancers, and suggested thatTRIB3might be a promising prognostic biomarker and a potential target for cancer immunotherapy.© 2023 The Authors.",2.44E-61
,38110861,NA,NA,"Geminiviruses are DNA plant viruses that cause highly damaging diseases affecting crops worldwide. During the infection, geminiviruses hijack cellular processes, suppress plant defenses, and cause a massive reprogramming of the infected cells leading to major changes in the whole plant homeostasis. The advances in sequencing technologies allow the simultaneous analysis of multiple aspects of viral infection at a large scale, generating new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying plant-virus interactions. However, an integrative study of the changes in the host transcriptome, small RNA profile and methylome during a geminivirus infection has not been performed yet. Using a time-scale approach, we aim to decipher the gene regulation in tomato in response to the infection with the geminivirus, tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV).We showed that tomato undergoes substantial transcriptional and post-transcriptional changes upon TYLCV infection and identified the main altered regulatory pathways. Interestingly, although the principal plant defense-related processes, gene silencing and the immune response were induced, this cannot prevent the establishment of the infection. Moreover, we identified extra- and intracellular immune receptors as targets for the deregulated microRNAs (miRNAs) and established a network for those that also produced phased secondary small interfering RNAs (phasiRNAs). On the other hand, there were no significant genome-wide changes in tomato methylome at 14 days post infection, the time point at which the symptoms were general, and the amount of viral DNA had reached its maximum level, but we were able to identify differentially methylated regions that could be involved in the transcriptional regulation of some of the differentially expressed genes.We have conducted a comprehensive and reliable study on the changes at transcriptional, post-transcriptional and epigenetic levels in tomato throughout TYLCV infection. The generated genomic information is substantial for understanding the genetic, molecular and physiological changes caused by TYLCV infection in tomato.© 2023. The Author(s).",2.08E-61
,38033725,Unlocking the potential of platinum drugs: organelle-targeted small-molecule platinum complexes for improved anticancer performance.,RSC Chem Biol,"Platinum-based drugs have revolutionized cancer chemotherapy; however, their therapeutic efficacy has been limited by severe side effects and drug resistance. Recently, approaches that target specific organelles in cancer cells have emerged as attractive alternatives to overcome these challenges. Many studies have validated these strategies and highlighted that organelle-targeted platinum complexes demonstrate increased anticancer activity, the ability to overcome drug resistance, novel molecular mechanisms, or even lower toxicity. This review provides a brief summary of various organelle-targeting strategies that promote the accumulation of platinum complexes in certain intracellular areas, such as the nucleus, mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and lysosomes. Moreover, the mechanisms through which these strategies improve anticancer performance, overcome drug resistance, and alter the action mode of conventional platinum drugs are discussed. By providing an extensive account of platinum complexes targeting different organelles, this review aims to assist researchers in understanding the design principles, identifying potential targets, and fostering innovative ideas for the development of platinum complexes.This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",1.37E-61

The study aims to determine the role of early growth response protein (EGR) 3 in tamoxifen resistance (TamR) and elucidate its molecular mechanism.TamR cell models were established and NGS was used to screening signaling alternation. Western blot and qRT-PCR were used to analysis the expression of ER?, EGR3, MCL1 and factors associated with apoptosis. CCK8, colony formation and apoptosis assay were used to analysis resistance to Tam. Immunofluorescence, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and dual luciferase assays were used to investigate mechanism of regulation.We observed that EGR3, a deeply rooted ER? response factor, showed increased upregulation in response to both estrone (E1) and Tam in TamR cells with elevated level of E1 and ER? expression, indicating a potential connection between EGR3 and TamR. Mechanically, manipulating EGR3 expression revealed that it imparted resistance to Tam through increased expression of the downstream molecule MCL1 (apoptosis suppressor gene) that it regulated. Mechanismly, EGR3 directly binds to the promoter of the anti-apoptotic factor MCL1 gene, facilitating its transcription. Furthermore, apoptosis assays revealed that E1 reduces Tam induced apoptosis by upregulating EGR3 expression. Importantly, clinical public database confirmed the high expression of EGR3 in breast cancer tissue and in Tam-treated patients.These findings shed light on the novel estrogen/EGR3/MCL1 axis and its role in inducing TamR in ER positive breast cancer. EGR3 emerges as a promising target to overcome TamR. The elucidation of this mechanism holds potential for the development of new therapeutic modalities to overcome endocrine therapy resistance in clinical settings.© 2023.

The emergence of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology enables us to analyze the transcriptomes of individual immune cells and to assess the significance of each immune cell type in hypertension development.We aimed to investigate the hypothesis that B cells play a crucial role in the development of fructose-induced hypertension.Eight-week-old Dahl salt-sensitive (SS) male rats were divided into two groups and given either tap water (TW) or a 20% fructose solution (HFS) for 4 weeks. Systolic blood pressure was measured using the tail-cuff method. ScRNA-seq analysis was performed on lamina propria cells (LPs) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from SS rats subjected to either TW or HFS. The HFS treatment induced hypertension in the SS rats. The analysis revealed 27 clusters in LPs and 28 clusters in PBMCs, allowing for the identification and characterization of various immune cell types within each cluster. Specifically, B cells and follicular helper T (Tfh) cells were prominent in LPs, while B cells and M1 macrophages dominated PBMCs in the HFS group. Moreover, the HFS treatment triggered an increase in the number of B cells in both LPs and PBMCs, accompanied by activation of the interferon pathway.The significant involvement of B cells in intestinal and PBMC responses indicates their pivotal contribution to the development of hypertension. This finding suggests that targeting B cells could be a potential strategy to mitigate high blood pressure in fructose-induced hypertension. Moreover, the simultaneous increase in follicular B cells and Tfh cells in LPs, along with the upregulation of interferon pathway genes in B cells, underscores a potential autoimmune factor contributing to the pathogenesis of fructose-induced hypertension in the intestine.Copyright © 2023 Kim, Joo, Kim, Kim, Jang, Tzeng, Lee, Kim and Kim.",6.26E-62

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can self?renew and undergo multidirectional differentiation; they can differentiate into chondrocytes. Aging MSCs have a weakened ability to differentiate, and release various pro?inflammatory cytokines, which may contribute to OA progression; the other mechanism contributing to OA is epigenetic regulation (for instance, DNA methylation, histone modification and regulation of non?coding RNA). Owing to the self?renewal and differentiation ability of MSCs, various MSC?based exogenous cell therapies have been developed to treat OA. The efficacy of MSC?based therapy is mainly attributed to cytokines, growth factors and the paracrine effect of exosomes. Recently, extensive studies have been conducted on MSC?derived exosomes. Exosomes from MSCs can deliver a variety of DNA, RNA, proteins and lipids, thereby facilitating MSC migration and cartilage repair. Therefore, MSC?derived exosomes are considered a promising therapy for OA.

,38017056,"Comparative analysis identifies genetic and molecular factors associated with prognostic clusters of PANoptosis in glioma, kidney and melanoma cancer.",Sci Rep,"The importance of inflammatory cell death, PANoptosis, in cancer is increasingly being recognized. PANoptosis can promote or inhibit tumorigenesis in context-dependent manners, and a computational approach leveraging transcriptomic profiling of genes involved in PANoptosis has shown that patients can be stratified into PANoptosis High and PANoptosis Low clusters that have significant differences in overall survival for low grade glioma (LGG), kidney renal cell carcinoma (KIRC) and skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM). However, the molecular mechanisms that contribute to differential prognosis between PANoptosis clusters require further elucidation. Therefore, we performed a comprehensive comparison of genetic, genomic, tumor microenvironment, and pathway characteristics between the PANoptosis High and PANoptosis Low clusters to determine the relevance of each component in driving the differential associations with prognosis for LGG, KIRC and SKCM. Across these cancer types, we found that activation of the proliferation pathway was significantly different between PANoptosis High and Low clusters. In LGG and SKCM, we also found that aneuploidy and immune cell densities and activations contributed to differences in PANoptosis clusters. In individual cancers, we identified important roles for barrier gene pathway activation (in SKCM) and the somatic mutation profiles of driver oncogenes as well as hedgehog signaling pathway activation (in LGG). By identifying these genetic and molecular factors, we can possibly improve the prognosis for at risk-stratified patient populations based on the PANoptosis phenotype in LGG, KIRC and SKCM. This not only advances our mechanistic understanding of cancer but will allow for the selection of optimal treatment strategies.© 2023. The Author(s).",4.45E-62

The protein kinase mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a key regulator of cellular metabolism in the body. Inhibition of mTOR signaling in early embryo causes postimplantation development failure, yet the mechanisms are still poorly understood.Pregnancy mice and preimplantation mouse embryo were treated with mTOR inhibitor in vivo and in vitro respectively, and subsequently examined the blastocyst formation, implantation, and post-implantation development. We used immunofluorescence staining, RNA-Seq smart2, and genome-wide bisulfite sequencing technologies to investigate the impact of mTOR inhibitors on the quality, cell fate determination, and molecular alterations in developing embryos.We showed mTOR suppression during preimplantation decreases the rate of blastocyst formation and the competency of implantation, impairs the post implantation embryonic development. We discovered that blocking mTOR signaling negatively affected the transformation of 8-cell embryos into blastocysts and caused various deficiencies in blastocyst quality. These included problems with compromised trophectoderm cell differentiation, as well as disruptions in cell fate specification. mTOR suppression significantly affected the transcription and DNA methylation of embryos. Treatment with mTOR inhibitors increase lysosomal activation and disrupts the organization and dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton in blastocysts.These results demonstrate that mTOR plays a crucial role in 8-cell to blastocyst transition and safeguards embryo quality during early embryo development.© 2023.

Aging plays an essential role in the occurrence and development of AF. Herein, we aimed to identify the aging-related genes associated with AF using bioinformatics analysis. Transcriptome profiles of AF were obtained from the GEO database. Differential expression analysis was performed to identify AF-specific aging-related genes. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses were performed. Subsequently, the LASSO, SVM-RFE, and MCC algorithms were applied to screen aging-related genes. The mRNA expression of the screened genes was validated in the left atrial samples of aged rapid atrial pacing-induced AF canine models and their counterparts. The ROC curves of them were drawn to evaluate their diagnostic potential. Moreover, CIBERSORT was used to estimate immune infiltration. A correlation analysis between screened aging-related genes and infiltrating immune cells was performed. A total of 24 aging-related genes were identified, which were found to be mainly involved in the FoxO signaling pathway, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, longevity regulating pathway, and peroxisome according to functional enrichment analysis. LASSO, SVM-RFE, and MCC algorithms identified three genes (HSPA9, SOD2, TXN). Furthermore, the expression levels of HSPA9 and SOD2 were validated in aged rapid atrial pacing-induced AF canine models. HSPA9 and SOD2 could be potential diagnostic biomarkers for AF, as evidenced by the ROC curves. Immune infiltration and correlation analysis revealed that HSPA9 and SOD2 were related to immune cell infiltrates.

The molecular mechanisms leading to neuropathology after SARS-CoV-2 infection are sparsely explored. SARS-CoV-2 enters human cells via different receptors, including ACE-2, TMPRSS2, and TMEM106B. In this study, we used a human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neuronal model, which expresses ACE-2, TMPRSS2, TMEM106B, and other possible SARS-CoV-2 receptors, to evaluate its susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The neurons were exposed to SARS-CoV-2, followed by RT-qPCR, immunocytochemistry, and proteomic analyses of the infected neurons. Our findings showed that SARS-CoV-2 infects neurons at a lower rate than other human cells; however, the virus could not replicate or produce infectious virions in this neuronal model. Despite the aborted SARS-CoV-2 replication, the infected neuronal nuclei showed irregular morphology compared to other human cells. Since cytokine storm is a significant effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection in COVID-19 patients, in addition to the direct neuronal infection, the neurons were treated with pre-conditioned media from SARS-CoV-2-infected lung cells, and the neuroproteomic changes were investigated. The limited SARS-CoV-2 infection in the neurons and the neurons treated with the pre-conditioned media showed changes in the neuroproteomic profile, particularly affecting mitochondrial proteins and apoptotic and metabolic pathways, which may lead to the development of neurological complications. The findings from our study uncover a possible mechanism behind SARS-CoV-2-mediated neuropathology that might contribute to the lingering effects of the virus on the human brain.",4.52E-63

The lack of existing data on SARS-CoV-2 hampered early attempts to treat severe forms of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) during the pandemic. This study coupled existing transcriptomic data from severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1) lung infection animal studies with crowdsourcing statistical approaches to derive temporal meta-signatures of host responses during early viral accumulation and subsequent clearance stages. Unsupervised and supervised machine learning approaches identified top dysregulated genes and potential biomarkers (e.g. CXCL10, BEX2, and ADM). Temporal meta-signatures revealed distinct gene expression programs with biological implications to a series of host responses underlying sustained Cxcl10 expression and Stat signaling. Cell cycle switched from G1/G0 phase genes, early in infection, to a G2/M gene signature during late infection that correlated with the enrichment of DNA damage response and repair genes. The SARS-CoV-1 meta-signatures were shown to closely emulate human SARS-CoV-2 host responses from emerging RNAseq, single cell, and proteomics data with early monocyte-macrophage activation followed by lymphocyte proliferation. The circulatory hormone adrenomedullin was observed as maximally elevated in elderly patients who died from COVID-19.

Gene ontology functional enrichment analysis, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis, and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) were used to analyze the relevant action pathways of the FRDEGs. The Encyclopedia of RNA Interactomes, CHIPBase, and comparative toxicogenomics databases were used to build mRNA-miRNA, mRNA-transcription factor (TF), and mRNA-drug interaction networks, respectively. A diagnostic model was constructed and bioinformatics analysis methods, such as least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression analysis, Cox regression analysis, nomogram-based analysis, consensus clustering analysis, and single-sample GSEA, were used to systematically investigate the prognostic values and immunologic characteristics.Results: A total of 13 FRDEGs were obtained and eight were used to construct a diagnostic model and perform a prognostic analysis. Hub genes were also used to construct mRNA-miRNA and mRNA-TF interaction networks and potential drug or molecular compounds. Two MAFLD subtypes were identified: cluster2, which represents an ""immunoactive"" type, and cluster1, which represents an ""immunosuppressive"" type; a significant correlation was observed between the immune cell contents and the expression of three FRDEGs (NR4A1,FADS2, andSCD).Conclusion: A ferroptosis-related gene signature was constructed to diagnose MAFLD-associated steatohepatitis, predict the prognosis of MAFLD patients, and analyze the immunologic characteristics of MAFLD. Our findings may provide insights into developing innovative MAFLD treatment techniques.Copyright © 2023 Lian and Tang.",2.75E-63
,38023180,Integrative analysis reveals a four-gene signature for predicting survival and immunotherapy response in colon cancer patients using bulk and single-cell RNA-seq data.,Front Oncol,"Colon cancer (CC) ranks as one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality globally. Single-cell transcriptome sequencing (scRNA-seq) offers precise gene expression data for distinct cell types. This study aimed to utilize scRNA-seq and bulk transcriptome sequencing (bulk RNA-seq) data from CC samples to develop a novel prognostic model.scRNA-seq data was downloaded from the GSE161277 database. R packages including ""Seurat"", ""Harmony"", and ""singleR"" were employed to categorize eight major cell types within normal and tumor tissues. By comparing tumor and normal samples, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) across these major cell types were identified. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analyses of DEGs for each cell type were conducted using ""Metascape"". DEGs-based signature construction involved Cox regression and least absolute shrinkage operator (LASSO) analyses, performed on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) training cohort. Validation occurred in the GSE39582 and GSE33382 datasets. The expression pattern of prognostic genes was verified using spatial transcriptome sequencing (ST-seq) data. Ultimately, an established prognostic nomogram based on the gene signature and age was established and calibrated. Sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs was predicted with the ""oncoPredict"" R package.Using scRNA-Seq data, we examined 33,213 cells, categorizing them into eight cell types within normal and tumor samples. GO enrichment analysis revealed various cancer-related pathways across DEGs in these cell types. Among the 55 DEGs identified via univariate Cox regression, four independent prognostic genes emerged: PTPN6, CXCL13, SPINK4, and NPDC1. Expression validation through ST-seq confirmed PTPN6 and CXCL13 predominance in immune cells, while SPINK4 and NPDC1 were relatively epithelial cell-specific. Creating a four-gene prognostic signature, Kaplan-Meier survival analyses emphasized higher risk scores correlating with unfavorable prognoses, confirmed across training and validation cohorts. The risk score emerged as an independent prognostic factor, supported by a reliable nomogram. Intriguingly, drug sensitivity analysis unveiled contrasting anti-cancer drug responses in the two risk groups, suggesting significant clinical implications.We developed a novel prognostic four-gene risk model, and these genes may act as potential therapeutic targets for CC.Copyright © 2023 Chai, Zhao, Su and Liang.",2.55E-63
,38051288,Integrative analyses of N6-methyladenosine-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (m6A-SNPs) identify tumor suppressor gene AK9 in lung cancer.,Mol Carcinog,"N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification has been identified as one of the most important epigenetic regulation mechanisms in the development of human cancers. However, the association between m6A-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (m6A-SNPs) and lung cancer risk remains largely unknown. Here, we identified m6A-SNPs and examined the association of these m6A-SNPs with lung cancer risk in 13,793 lung cancer cases and 14,027 controls. In silico functional annotation was used to identify causal m6A-SNPs and target genes. Furthermore, methylated RNA immunoprecipitation and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (MeRIP-qPCR) assay was performed to assess the m6A modification level of different genotypes of the causal SNP. In vitro assays were performed to validate the potential role of the target gene in lung cancer. A total of 8794 m6A-SNPs were detected, among which 397 SNPs in nine susceptibility loci were associated with lung cancer risk, including six novel loci. Bioinformatics analyses indicated that rs1321328 in 6q21 was located around the m6A modification site of AK9 and significantly reduced AK9 expression (??=?-0.15, p?=?2.78?×?10-8). Moreover, AK9 was significantly downregulated in lung cancer tissues than that in adjacent normal tissues of samples from the Cancer Genome Atlas and Nanjing Lung Cancer Cohort. MeRIP-qPCR assay suggested that C allele of rs1321328 could significantly decrease the m6A modification level of AK9 compared with G allele. In vitro assays verified the tumor-suppressing role of AK9 in lung cancer. These findings shed light on the pathogenic mechanism of lung cancer susceptibility loci linked with m6A modification.© 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",7.79E-64
,38152652,The role of circRNAs in regulation of drug resistance in ovarian cancer.,Front Genet,"Ovarian cancer is one of the female reproductive system tumors. Chemotherapy is used for advanced ovarian cancer patients; however, drug resistance is a pivotal cause of chemotherapeutic failure. Hence, it is critical to explore the molecular mechanisms of drug resistance of ovarian cancer cells and to ameliorate chemoresistance. Noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) have been identified to critically participate in drug sensitivity in a variety of human cancers, including ovarian cancer. Among ncRNAs, circRNAs sponge miRNAs and prevent miRNAs from regulation of their target mRNAs. CircRNAs can interact with DNA or proteins to modulate gene expression. In this review, we briefly describe the biological functions of circRNAs in the development and progression of ovarian cancer. Moreover, we discuss the underneath regulatory molecular mechanisms of circRNAs on governing drug resistance in ovarian cancer. Furthermore, we mention the novel strategies to overcome drug resistance via targeting circRNAs in ovarian cancer. Due to that circRNAs play a key role in modulation of drug resistance in ovarian cancer, targeting circRNAs could be a novel approach for attenuation of chemoresistance in ovarian cancer.Copyright © 2023 Zhan, Li, Lin, Wang, Yu and Xiao.",3.77E-64
,38011564,Epigenetic switch reshapes epithelial progenitor cell signatures and drives inflammatory pathogenesis in hidradenitis suppurativa.,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,"Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a complex inflammatory skin disease with undefined mechanistic underpinnings. Here, we investigated HS epithelial cells and demonstrated that HS basal progenitors modulate their lineage restriction and give rise to pathogenic keratinocyte clones, resulting in epidermal hyperproliferation and dysregulated inflammation in HS. When comparing to healthy epithelial stem/progenitor cells, in HS, we identified changes in gene signatures that revolve around the mitotic cell cycle, DNA damage response and repair, as well as cell-cell adhesion and chromatin remodeling. By reconstructing cell differentiation trajectory and CellChat modeling, we identified a keratinocyte population specific to HS. This population is marked byS100A7/8/9andKRT6family members, triggering IL1, IL10, and complement inflammatory cascades. These signals, along with HS-specific proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, contribute to the recruitment of certain immune cells during the disease progression. Furthermore, we revealed a previously uncharacterized role of S100A8 in regulating the local chromatin environment of target loci in HS keratinocytes. Through the integration of genomic and epigenomic datasets, we identified genome-wide chromatin rewiring alongside the switch of transcription factors (TFs), which mediated HS transcriptional profiles. Importantly, we identified numerous clinically relevant inflammatory enhancers and their coordinated TFs in HS basal CD49fhighcells. The disruption of theS100Aenhancer using the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated approach or the pharmacological inhibition of the interferon regulatory transcription factor 3 (IRF3) efficiently reduced the production of HS-associated inflammatory regulators. Our study not only uncovers the plasticity of epidermal progenitor cells in HS but also elucidates the epigenetic mechanisms underlying HS pathogenesis.",1.31E-64
,38137354,Role of rs873601 Polymorphisms in Prognosis of Lung Cancer Patients Treated with Platinum-Based Chemotherapy.,Biomedicines,"Lung cancer is still the most lethal malignancy in the world, according to the report of Cancer Statistics in 2021. Platinum-based chemotherapy combined with immunotherapy is the first-line treatment in lung cancer patients. However, the 5-year survival rate is always affected by the adverse reactions and drug resistance caused by platinum-based chemotherapy. DNA damage and repair system is one of the important mechanisms that can affect the response to chemotherapy and clinical outcomes in lung cancer patients.The objective of this study is to find the relationship between the polymorphisms of DNA repair genes with the prognosis of platinum-based chemotherapy in lung cancer patients.We performed genotyping in 17 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of Excision Repair Cross-Complementation group (ERCC) genes and X-ray Repair Cross-Complementing (XRCC) genes of 345 lung cancer patients via Sequenom MassARRAY. We used Cox proportional hazard models, state, and plink to analyze the associations between SNPs and the prognosis of lung cancer patients.We found that theERCC5rs873601 was associated with the overall survival time in lung cancer patients treated with platinum-based chemotherapy (p= 0.031). There were some polymorphisms that were related to the prognosis in specific subgroups of lung cancer. Rs873601 showed a great influence on the prognosis of patients more than 55 years, Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC), and smoking patients. Rs2444933 was associated with prognosis in age less than 55 years, SCLC, metastasis, and stage III/IV/ED patients. Rs3740051 played an important role in the prognosis of SCLC and metastasis patients. Rs1869641 was involved in the prognosis of SCLC patients. Rs1051685 was related to the prognosis in non-metastasis patients.TheERCC5rs873601 (G>A) was a valuable biomarker for predicting the prognosis in lung cancer patients treated with platinum-based chemotherapy.",1.22E-64
,37993930,Targeting oncogenic TERT promoter variants by allele-specific epigenome editing.,Clin Epigenetics,"Activation of dominant oncogenes by small or structural genomic alterations is a common driver mechanism in many cancers. Silencing of such dominantly activated oncogenic alleles, thus, is a promising strategy to treat cancer. Recently, allele-specific epigenome editing (ASEE) has been described as a means to reduce transcription of genes in an allele-specific manner. In cancer, specificity to an oncogenic allele can be reached by either targeting directly a pathogenic single-nucleotide variant or a polymorphic single-nucleotide variant linked to the oncogenic allele. To investigate the potential of ASEE in cancer, we here explored this approach by targeting variants at the TERT promoter region. The TERT promoter region has been described as one of the most frequently mutated non-coding cancer drivers.Sequencing of the TERT promoter in cancer cell lines showed 53% (41/77) to contain at least one heterozygous sequence variant allowing allele distinction. We chose the hepatoblastoma cell line Hep-G2 and the lung cancer cell line A-549 for this proof-of-principle study, as they contained two different kinds of variants, namely the activating mutation C228T in the TERT core promoter and the common SNP rs2853669 in the THOR region, respectively. These variants were targeted in an allele-specific manner using sgRNA-guided dCas9-DNMT3A-3L complexes. In both cell lines, we successfully introduced DNA methylation specifically to the on-target allele of the TERT promoter with limited background methylation on the off-target allele or an off-target locus (VEGFA), respectively. We observed a maximum CpG methylation gain of 39% and 76% on the target allele when targeting the activating mutation and the common SNP, respectively. The epigenome editing translated into reduced TERT RNA expression in Hep-G2.We applied an ASEE-mediated approach to silence TERT allele specifically. Our results show that the concept of dominant oncogene inactivation by allele-specific epigenome editing can be successfully translated into cancer models. This new strategy may have important advantages in comparison with existing therapeutic approaches, e.g., targeting telomerase, especially with regard to reducing adverse side effects.© 2023.

,37935658,DUSP1 protects against ischemic acute kidney injury through stabilizing mtDNA via interaction with JNK.,Cell Death Dis,"The mechanism underlying acute kidney injury (AKI) and AKI-to-Chronic kidney disease (CKD) transition remains unclear, but mitochondrial dysfunction may be a key driving factor. Literature reports suggest that dual-specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1) plays a critical role in maintaining mitochondrial function and structural integrity. In this study, ischemic Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) and post-ischemic fibrosis models were established by clamping the renal pedicle with different reperfusion times. To investigate the role of DUSP1, constitutional Dusp1 knockout mice and tubular-specific Sting knockout mice were used. Mitochondrial damage was assessed through electron microscopy observation, measurements of mitochondrial membrane potential, mtDNA release, and BAX translocation. We found that Dusp1 expression was significantly upregulated in human transplant kidney tissue and mouse AKI tissue. Dusp1 gene deletion exacerbated acute ischemic injury, post-ischemic renal fibrosis, and tubular mitochondrial dysfunction in mice. Mechanistically, DUSP1 could directly bind to JNK, and DUSP1 deficiency could lead to aberrant phosphorylation of JNK and BAX mitochondria translocation. BAX translocation promoted mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) leakage and activated the cGAS-STING pathway. Inhibition of JNK or BAX could inhibit mtDNA leakage. Furthermore, STING knockout or JNK inhibition could significantly mitigate the adverse effects of DUSP1 deficiency in ischemic AKI model. Collectively, our findings suggest that DUSP1 is a regulator for the protective response during AKI. DUSP1 protects against AKI by preventing BAX-induced mtDNA leakage and blocking excessive activation of the cGAS-STING signaling axis through JNK dephosphorylation.© 2023. The Author(s).",2.08E-66
,38041202,Personalized tumor combination therapy optimization using the single-cell transcriptome.,Genome Med,"The precise characterization of individual tumors and immune microenvironments using transcriptome sequencing has provided a great opportunity for successful personalized cancer treatment. However, the cancer treatment response is often characterized by in vitro assays or bulk transcriptomes that neglect the heterogeneity of malignant tumors in vivo and the immune microenvironment, motivating the need to use single-cell transcriptomes for personalized cancer treatment.Here, we present comboSC, a computational proof-of-concept study to explore the feasibility of personalized cancer combination therapy optimization using single-cell transcriptomes. ComboSC provides a workable solution to stratify individual patient samples based on quantitative evaluation of their personalized immune microenvironment with single-cell RNA sequencing and maximize the translational potential of in vitro cellular response to unify the identification of synergistic drug/small molecule combinations or small molecules that can be paired with immune checkpoint inhibitors to boost immunotherapy from a large collection of small molecules and drugs, and finally prioritize them for personalized clinical use based on bipartition graph optimization.We apply comboSC to publicly available 119 single-cell transcriptome data from a comprehensive set of 119 tumor samples from 15 cancer types and validate the predicted drug combination with literature evidence, mining clinical trial data, perturbation of patient-derived cell line data, and finally in-vivo samples.Overall, comboSC provides a feasible and one-stop computational prototype and a proof-of-concept study to predict potential drug combinations for further experimental validation and clinical usage using the single-cell transcriptome, which will facilitate and accelerate personalized tumor treatment by reducing screening time from a large drug combination space and saving valuable treatment time for individual patients.

,38130488,Genome-wide identification and expression analysis of WRKY gene family members in red clover (Trifolium pratense L.).,Front Plant Sci,"Trifolium pratenseis an important legume forage grass and a key component of sustainable livestock development. Serving as an essential component, theWRKYgene family, a crucial group of regulatory transcription factors in plants, holds significant importance in their response to abiotic stresses. However, there has been no systematic analysis conducted on theWRKYgene family inTrifolium pratense. This study conducted a comprehensive genomic characterization of theWRKYgene family inTrifolium pratense, utilizing the latest genomic data, resulting in the identification of 59TpWRKYgenes. Based on their structural features, phylogenetic characteristics, and conserved motif composition, the WRKY proteins were classified into three groups, with group II further subdivided into five subgroups (II-a, II-b, II-c, II-d, and II-e). The majority of the TpWRKYs in a group share a similar structure and motif composition. Intra-group syntenic analysis revealed eight pairs of duplicate segments. The expression patterns of 59TpWRKYgenes in roots, stems, leaves, and flowers were examined by analyzing RNA-seq data. The expression of 12TpWRKYgenes under drought, low-temperature (4°C), methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and abscisic acid (ABA) stresses was analyzed by RT-qPCR. The findings indicated thatTpWRKY46was highly induced by drought stress, andTpWRKY26andTpWRKY41were significantly induced by low temperature stress. In addition,TpWRKY29andTpWRKY36were greatly induced by MeJA stress treatment, andTpWRKY17was significantly upregulated by ABA stress treatment. In this research, we identified and comprehensively analyzed the structural features of theWRKYgene family inT.pratense, along with determined the possible roles ofWRKYcandidate genes in abiotic stress. These discoveries deepen our understandings of how WRKY transcription factors contribute to species evolution and functional divergence, laying a solid molecular foundation for future exploration and study of stress resistance mechanisms inT.pratense.Copyright © 2023 Yuan, Zhang, Zou, Hao, Pan, Liu, Zhang and Li.",1.4E-66
,38066393,Comprehensive pan-cancer analysis reveals CCDC58 as a carcinogenic factor related to immune infiltration.,Apoptosis,"CCDC58, a member of the CCDC protein family, has been primarily associated with the malignant progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and breast cancer, with limited research conducted on its involvement in other tumor types. We aimed to assess the significance of CCDC58 in pan-cancer. We utilized the TCGA, GTEx, and UALCAN databases to perform the differential expression of CCDC58 at both mRNA and protein levels. Prognostic value was evaluated through univariate Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier methods. Mutation and methylation analyses were conducted using the cBioPortal and SMART databases. We identified genes interacting with and correlated to CCDC58 through STRING and GEPIA2, respectively. Subsequently, we performed GO and KEGG enrichment analyses. To gain insights into the functional status of CCDC58 at the single-cell level, we utilized CancerSEA. We explored the correlation between CCDC58 and immune infiltration as well as immunotherapy using the ESTIMATE package, TIMER2.0, TISIDB, TIDE, TIMSO, and TCIA. We examined the relationship between CCDC58 and tumor heterogeneity, stemness, DNA methyltransferases, and MMR genes. Lastly, we constructed a nomogram based on CCDC58 in HCC and investigated its association with drug sensitivity. CCDC58 expression was significantly upregulated and correlated with poor prognosis across various tumor types. The mutation frequency of CCDC58 was found to be increased in 25 tumors. We observed a negative correlation between CCDC58 expression and the methylation sites in the majority of tumors. CCDC58 showed negative correlations with immune and stromal scores, as well as with NK T cells, Tregs, CAFs, endothelial cells, and immunomodulators. Its value in immunotherapy was comparable to that of tumor mutational burden. CCDC58 exhibited positive correlations with tumor heterogeneity, stemness, DNA methyltransferase genes, and MMR genes. In HCC, CCDC58 was identified as an independent risk factor and demonstrated potential associations with multiple drugs. CCDC58 demonstrates significant clinical value as a prognostic marker and indicator of immune response across various tumor types. Its comprehensive analysis provides insights into its potential implications in pan-cancer research.© 2023.

,38033504,The combination of baseline neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio and dynamic changes during treatment can better predict the survival of osteosarcoma patients.,Front Oncol,"Osteosarcoma is a primary malignant bone tumor with a high metastatic potential that accounts for a significant proportion of all bone tumors. The prognosis for patients with metastatic or recurrence disease remains poor. The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) has become a potential prognostic biomarker for cancer. Recent evidence suggests that the dynamic changes in neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) during treatment may be more informative in predicting patient prognosis, but the value of dynamic NLR in osteosarcoma has not yet been determined.This retrospective study retrospectively analyzed the clinical information of 251 osteosarcoma patients diagnosed and treated in West China Hospital of Sichuan University, explored the impact of baseline NLR and changes in NLR during treatment on the prognosis of osteosarcoma patients, and further combined baseline NLR with Delta NLR to build an NLR staging system.The results showed that both baseline NLR and delta NLR had some predictive ability for the prognosis of osteosarcoma patients (P = 6.90e-4, P = 0.022). Patients with high baseline NLR were more likely to have a decrease in delta NLR (P = 1.24e-10). The NLR stage had a better predictive ability than baseline NLR and delta NLR, and was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival in osteosarcoma patients HR: 2.456 (1.625-3.710) (P = 1.97e-05).NLR has value in continuous monitoring, and continuous monitoring of NLR can better predict the survival of osteosarcoma patients compared to baseline NLR.Copyright © 2023 Li, Li, Lu, Wang, Li, Hu, He, Gong, Luo, Zhou, Min and Tu.",2.24E-67
,37961596,XX sex chromosome complement modulates immune responses to heat-killed Streptococcus pneumoniae immunization in a microbiome-dependent manner.,Res Sq,"Differences in male vs. female immune responses are well-documented and have significant clinical implications. While the immunomodulatory effects of sex hormones are well established, the contributions of sex chromosome complement (XX vs. XY) and gut microbiome diversity on immune sexual dimorphisms have only recently become appreciated. Here we investigate the individual and collaborative influences of sex chromosome complements and gut microbiome bacteria on humoral immune activation.Sham-operated and gonadectomized male and female Four Core Genotype (FCG) mice were immunized with heat-killedStreptococcus pneumoniae(HKSP). Humoral immune responses were assessed, and X-linked immune-related gene expression was evaluated to explain the identified XX-dependent phenotypes.Ex vivostudies investigated the functional role ofKdm6a, an X-linked epigenetic regulatory gene of interest, in mitogenic B cell activation. Additionally, we examined whether gut microbiome communities, or their metabolites, differentially influence immune cell activation in a sex chromosome-dependent manner. Endogenous gut microbiomes were antibiotically depleted and reconstituted with select short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria prior to HKSP immunization and immune responses assessed.XX mice exhibited higher HKSP-specific IgM-secreting B cells and plasma cell frequencies than XY mice, regardless of gonadal sex. AlthoughKdm6awas identified as an X-linked gene overexpressed in XX B cells, inhibition of its enzymatic activity did not affect mitogen-induced plasma cell differentiation or antibody production in a sex chromosome-dependent mannerex vivo. Enhanced humoral responses in XX vs. XY immunized FCG mice were eliminated after microbiome depletion, indicating that the microbiome contributes to the identified XX-dependent immune enhancement. Reconstituting microbiota-depleted mice with select SCFA-producing bacteria increased humoral responses in XX, but not XY, FCG mice. This XX-dependent enhancement appears to be independent of SCFA production in males, while female XX-dependent responses relied on SCFAs.FCG mice have been used to assess the influence of sex hormones and sex chromosome complements on various sexually dimorphic traits. The current study indicates that the gut microbiome impacts humoral responses in an XX-dependent manner, suggesting that the collaborative influence of gut bacteria and other sex-specific factors should be considered when interpreting data aimed at delineating the mechanisms that promote sexual dimorphism.",5.25E-68
,38002344,"LEO1 Is Required for Efficient Entry into Quiescence, Control of H3K9 Methylation and Gene Expression in Human Fibroblasts.",Biomolecules,"(1) Background: The LEO1 (Left open reading frame 1) protein is a conserved subunit of the PAF1C complex (RNA polymerase II-associated factor 1 complex). PAF1C has well-established mechanistic functions in elongation of transcription and RNA processing. We previously showed, in fission yeast, that LEO1 controls histone H3K9 methylation levels by affecting the turnover of histone H3 in chromatin, and that it is essential for the proper regulation of gene expression during cellular quiescence. Human fibroblasts enter a reversible quiescence state upon serum deprivation in the growth media. Here we investigate the function of LEO1 in human fibroblasts. (2) Methods: We knocked out theLEO1gene using CRISPR/Cas9 methodology in human fibroblasts and verified that the LEO1 protein was undetectable by Western blot. We characterized the phenotype of the?LEO1knockout cells with FACS analysis and cell growth assays. We used RNA-sequencing using spike-in controls to measure gene expression and spike-in controlled ChIP-sequencing experiments to measure the histone modification H3K9me2 genome-wide. (3) Results: Gene expression levels are altered in quiescent cells, however factors controlling chromatin and gene expression changes in quiescent human cells are largely unknown. The?LEO1knockout fibroblasts are viable but have reduced metabolic activity compared to wild-type cells.?LEO1cells showed a slower entry into quiescence and a different morphology compared to wild-type cells. Gene expression was generally reduced in quiescent wild-type cells. The downregulated genes included genes involved in cell proliferation. A small number of genes were upregulated in quiescent wild-type cells including several genes involved in ERK1/ERK2 and Wnt signaling. In quiescent?LEO1cells, many genes were mis-regulated compared to wild-type cells. This included genes involved in Calcium ion transport and cell morphogenesis. Finally, spike-in controlled ChIP-sequencing experiments demonstrated that the histone modification H3K9me2 levels are globally increased in quiescent?LEO1cells. (4) Conclusions: Thus, LEO1 is important for proper entry into cellular quiescence, control of H3K9me2 levels, and gene expression in human fibroblasts.",3.52E-68
,37992039,Rice requires a chromatin remodeler for Polymerase IV-small interfering RNA production and genomic immunity.,Plant Physiol,"Transgenes are often spontaneously silenced, which hinders the application of genetic modifications to crop breeding. While gene silencing has been extensively studied in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), the molecular mechanism of transgene silencing remains elusive in crop plants. We used rice (Oryza sativa) plants silenced for a 35S::OsGA2ox1 (Gibberellin 2-oxidase 1) transgene to isolate five elements mountain (fem) mutants showing restoration of transgene expression. In this study, we isolated multiple fem2 mutants defective in a homolog of Required to Maintain Repression 1 (RMR1) of maize (Zea mays) and CLASSY (CLSY) of Arabidopsis. In addition to failing to maintain transgene silencing, as occurs in fem3, in which mutation occurs in NUCLEAR RNA POLYMERASE E1 (OsNRPE1), the fem2 mutant failed to establish transgene silencing of 35S::OsGA2ox1. Mutation in FEM2 eliminated all RNA POLYMERASE IV (Pol-IV)-FEM1/OsRDR2 (RNA-DEPENDENT RNA POLYMERASE 2) dependent small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), reduced DNA methylation on genome-wide scale in rice seedlings, caused pleiotropic developmental defects, and increased disease resistance. Simultaneously mutation in two FEM2 homologous genes, FEM2-Like 1 (FEL1) and FEL2, however, did not affect DNA methylation and rice development and disease resistance. The predominant expression of FEM2 over FEL1 and FEL2 in various tissues was likely caused by epigenetic states. Overexpression of FEL1 but not FEL2 partially rescued hypomethylation of fem2, indicating that FEL1 maintains the cryptic function. In summary, FEM2 is essential for establishing and maintaining gene silencing; moreover, FEM2 is solely required for Pol IV-FEM1 siRNAs biosynthesis and de novo DNA methylation.© The Author(s) 2023.

,37964984,Establishing and Validating an Aging-Related Prognostic Signature in Osteosarcoma.,Stem Cells Int,"Aging is an inevitable process that biological changes accumulate with time and results in increased susceptibility to different tumors. But currently, aging-related genes (ARGs) in osteosarcoma were not clear. We investigated the potential prognostic role of ARGs and established an ARG-based prognostic signature for osteosarcoma. The transcriptome data and corresponding clinicopathological information of patients with osteosarcoma were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases. Molecular subtypes were generated based on prognosis-related ARGs obtained from univariate Cox analysis. With ARGs, a risk signature was built by univariate, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and multivariate Cox regression analyses. Differences in clinicopathological features, immune infiltration, immune checkpoints, responsiveness to immunotherapy and chemotherapy, and biological pathways were assessed according to molecular subtypes and the risk signature. Based on risk signature and clinicopathological variables, a nomogram was established and validated. Three molecular subtypes with distinct clinical outcomes were classified based on 36 prognostic ARGs for osteosarcoma. A nine-ARG-based signature in the TCGA cohort, includingBMP8A,CORT,SLC17A9,VEGFA,GAL,SSX1,RASGRP2,SDC3, andEVI2B, has been created and developed and could well perform patient stratification into the high- and low-risk groups. There were significant differences in clinicopathological features, immune checkpoints and infiltration, responsiveness to immunotherapy and chemotherapy, cancer stem cell, and biological pathways among the molecular subtypes. The risk signature and metastatic status were identified as independent prognostic factors for osteosarcoma. A nomogram combining ARG-based risk signature and metastatic status was established, showing great prediction accuracy and clinical benefit for osteosarcoma OS. We characterized three ARG-based molecular subtypes with distinct characteristics and built an ARG-based risk signature for osteosarcoma prognosis, which could facilitate prognosis prediction and making personalized treatment in osteosarcoma.Copyright © 2023 Yibo Ma et al.",1.27E-68
,38115130,Bioinformatics analysis of ferroptosis-related genes and immune cell infiltration in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.,Eur J Med Res,"The morbidity and mortality rates of patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) have been steadily increasing in recent years. Previous studies have confirmed the important role of ferroptosis in NAFLD development; however, the precise mechanism through which ferroptosis influences NAFLD occurrence remains unclear. The present study aimed to identify and validate ferroptosis-related genes involved in NAFLD pathogenesis and to investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms of NAFLD.We downloaded microarray datasets GSE72756 and GSE24807 to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between samples from healthy individuals and patients with NAFLD. From these DEGs, we extracted ferroptosis-related DEGs. GSE89632, another microarray dataset, was used to validate the expression of ferroptosis-related genes. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of ferroptosis-related genes was then constructed. The target genes were also subjected to Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses. Finally, competing endogenous RNA networks were constructed. We used the CIBERSORT package to evaluate the infiltration of immune cells infiltration in NAFLD.Five ferroptosis-related genes (SCP2, MUC1, DPP4, SLC1A4, and TF) were identified as promising diagnostic biomarkers for NAFLD. Enrichment analyses revealed that these genes are mainly involved in metabolic processes.

,37927478,A molecular classification system for estimating radiotherapy response and anticancer immunity for individual breast cancer patients.,Front Oncol,"Radiotherapy is a cornerstone of breast cancer therapy, but radiotherapy resistance is a major clinical challenge. Herein, we show a molecular classification approach for estimating individual responses to radiotherapy.Consensus clustering was adopted to classify radiotherapy-sensitive and -resistant clusters in the TCGA-BRCA cohort based upon prognostic differentially expressed radiotherapy response-related genes (DERRGs). The stability of the classification was proven in the GSE58812 cohort via NTP method and the reliability was further verified by quantitative RT-PCR analyses of DERRGs. A Riskscore system was generated through Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) analysis, and verified in the GSE58812 and GSE17705. Treatment response and anticancer immunity were evaluated via multiple well-established computational approaches.We classified breast cancer patients as radiotherapy-sensitive and -resistant clusters, namely C1 and C2, also verified by quantitative RT-PCR analyses of DERRGs. Two clusters presented heterogeneous clinical traits, with poorer prognosis, older age, more advanced T, and more dead status in the C2. The C1 tumors had higher activity of reactive oxygen species and response to X-ray, proving better radiotherapeutic response. Stronger anticancer immunity was found in the C1 tumors that had rich immune cell infiltration, similar expression profiling to patients who responded to anti-PD-1, and activated immunogenic cell death and ferroptosis. The Riskscore was proposed for improving patient prognosis. High Riskscore samples had lower radiotherapeutic response and stronger DNA damage repair as well as poor anticancer immunity, while low Riskscore samples were more sensitive to docetaxel, doxorubicin, and paclitaxel.Our findings propose a novel radiotherapy response classification system based upon molecular profiles for estimating radiosensitivity for individual breast cancer patients, and elucidate a methodological advancement for synergy of radiotherapy with ICB.Copyright © 2023 Zhang, Li, Shang, Feng and Chao.",1.09E-68
,38077322,Construction of an acute myeloid leukemia prognostic model based on m6A-related efferocytosis-related genes.,Front Immunol,"One of the most prevalent hematological system cancers is acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Efferocytosis-related genes (ERGs) and N6-methyladenosine (m6A) have an important significance in the progression of cancer, and the metastasis of tumors.The AML-related data were collected from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA; TCGA-AML) database and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO; GSE9476, GSE71014, and GSE13159) database. The ""limma"" R package and Venn diagram were adopted to identify differentially expressed ERGs (DE-ERGs). The m6A related-DE-ERGs were obtained by Spearman analysis. Subsequently, univariate Cox and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) were used to construct an m6A related-ERGs risk signature for AML patients. The possibility of immunotherapy for AML was explored. The pRRophetic package was adopted to calculate the IC50 of drugs for the treatment of AML. Finally, the expression of characterized genes was validated by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR).Based on m6A related-DE-ERGs, a prognostic model with four characteristic genes (UCP2, DOCK1, SLC14A1, and SLC25A1) was constructed. The risk score of model was significantly associated with the immune microenvironment of AML, with four immune cell types, 14 immune checkpoints, 20 HLA family genes and, immunophenoscore (IPS) all showing differences between the high- and low-risk groups. A total of 56 drugs were predicted to differ between the two groups, of which Erlotinib, Dasatinib, BI.2536, and bortezomib have been reported to be associated with AML treatment. The qRT-PCR results showed that the expression trends of DOCK1, SLC14A1 and SLC25A1 were consistent with the bioinformatics analysis.In summary, 4 m6A related- ERGs were identified and the corresponding prognostic model was constructed for AML patients. This prognostic model effectively stratified the risk of AML patients.Copyright © 2023 Wang, Bin, Tang, Xu, Lin, Lu and Sun.",7.76E-69

However, a comprehensive analysis of the Fringe family members lunatic fringe (LFNG), manic fringe (MFNG), radical fringe (RFNG) in human cancers is lacking.In this study, we performed a pan-cancer analysis of Fringe family members in 33 cancer types with transcriptomic, genomic, methylation data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project. The correlation between Fringe family member expression and patient overall survival, copy number variation, methylation, Gene Ontology enrichment, and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) was investigated by using multiple databases, such as cBioPortal, Human Protein Atlas, GeneCards, STRING, MSigDB, TISIDB, and TIMER2. In vitro experiments and immunohistochemical assays were performed to validate our findings.High expression levels of LFNG, MFNG, RFNG were closely associated with poor overall survival in multiple cancers, particularly in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD), uveal melanoma (UVM), and brain lower-grade glioma (LGG). Copy number variation analysis revealed that diploid and gain mutations of LFNG was significantly increased in PAAD and stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD), and significantly associated with the methylation levels in promoter regions. Significant differential genes between high and low expression groups of these Fringe family members were found to be consistently enriched in immune response and T cell activation pathway, extracellular matrix adhesion pathway, RNA splicing and ion transport pathways. Correlation between the abundance of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and LFNG, MFNG, and RFNG expression showed that high LFNG expression was associated with lower TIL levels, particularly in PAAD. In vitro experiment by using pancreatic cancer PANC1 cells showed that LFNG overexpression promoted cell proliferation and invasion. Immunohistochemical assay in 90 PAAD patients verified the expression level of LFNG and its relationship with the prognosis.Our study provides a relatively comprehensive understanding of the expression, mutation, copy number, promoter methylation level changes along with prognosis values of LFNG, MFNG, and RFNG in different tumors. High LFNG expression may serve as a poor prognosis molecular marker for PAAD.© 2023. The Author(s).",3.86E-69
,38020105,Organotypic heterogeneity in microvascular endothelial cell responses in sepsis-a molecular treasure trove and pharmacological Gordian knot.,Front Med (Lausanne),"In the last decades, it has become evident that endothelial cells (ECs) in the microvasculature play an important role in the pathophysiology of sepsis-associated multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). Studies on how ECs orchestrate leukocyte recruitment, control microvascular integrity and permeability, and regulate the haemostatic balance have provided a wealth of knowledge and potential molecular targets that could be considered for pharmacological intervention in sepsis. Yet, this information has not been translated into effective treatments. As MODS affects specific vascular beds, (organotypic) endothelial heterogeneity may be an important contributing factor to this lack of success. On the other hand, given the involvement of ECs in sepsis, this heterogeneity could also be leveraged for therapeutic gain to target specific sites of the vasculature given its full accessibility to drugs. In this review, we describe current knowledge that defines heterogeneity of organ-specific microvascular ECs at the molecular level and elaborate on studies that have reported EC responses across organ systems in sepsis patients and animal models of sepsis. We discuss hypothesis-driven, single-molecule studies that have formed the basis of our understanding of endothelial cell engagement in sepsis pathophysiology, and include recent studies employing high-throughput technologies. The latter deliver comprehensive data sets to describe molecular signatures for organotypic ECs that could lead to new hypotheses and form the foundation for rational pharmacological intervention and biomarker panel development. Particularly results from single cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics studies are eagerly awaited as they are expected to unveil the full spatiotemporal signature of EC responses to sepsis. With increasing awareness of the existence of distinct sepsis subphenotypes, and the need to develop new drug regimen and companion diagnostics, a better understanding of the molecular pathways exploited by ECs in sepsis pathophysiology will be a cornerstone to halt the detrimental processes that lead to MODS.Copyright © 2023 Cleuren and Molema.",1.81E-69
,38098473,Advances in transposable elements: from mechanisms to applications in mammalian genomics.,Front Genet,"It has been 70 years since Barbara McClintock discovered transposable elements (TE), and the mechanistic studies and functional applications of transposable elements have been at the forefront of life science research. As an essential part of the genome, TEs have been discovered in most species of prokaryotes and eukaryotes, and the relative proportion of the total genetic sequence they comprise gradually increases with the expansion of the genome. In humans, TEs account for about 40% of the genome and are deeply involved in gene regulation, chromosome structure maintenance, inflammatory response, and the etiology of genetic and non-genetic diseases. In-depth functional studies of TEs in mammalian cells and the human body have led to a greater understanding of these fundamental biological processes. At the same time, as a potent mutagen and efficient genome editing tool, TEs have been transformed into biological tools critical for developing new techniques. By controlling the random insertion of TEs into the genome to change the phenotype in cells and model organisms, critical proteins of many diseases have been systematically identified. Exploiting the TE's highly efficientin vitroinsertion activity has driven the development of cutting-edge sequencing technologies. Recently, a new technology combining CRISPR with TEs was reported, which provides a novel targeted insertion system to both academia and industry. We suggest that interrogating biological processes that generally depend on the actions of TEs with TEs-derived genetic tools is a very efficient strategy. For example, excessive activation of TEs is an essential factor in the occurrence of cancer in humans. As potent mutagens, TEs have also been used to unravel the key regulatory elements and mechanisms of carcinogenesis. Through this review, we aim to effectively combine the traditional views of TEs with recent research progress, systematically link the mechanistic discoveries of TEs with the technological developments of TE-based tools, and provide a comprehensive approach and understanding for researchers in different fields.Copyright © 2023 Han, Perkins, Novaes, Xu and Chang.",1.52E-69
,37957639,"PCDH1, a poor prognostic biomarker and potential target for pancreatic adenocarcinoma metastatic therapy.",BMC Cancer,"Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) is an aggressive solid tumour characterised by few early symptoms, high mortality, and lack of effective treatment. Therefore, it is important to identify new potential therapeutic targets and prognostic biomarkers of PAAD.The Cancer Genome Atlas and Genotype-Tissue Expression databases were used to identify the expression and prognostic model of protocadherin 1 (PCDH1). The prognostic performance of risk factors and diagnosis of patients with PAAD were evaluated by regression analysis, nomogram, and receiver operating characteristic curve. Paraffin sections were collected from patients for immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis. The expression of PCDH1 in cells obtained from primary tumours or metastatic biopsies was identified using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and western blotting were used to verify PCDH1 expression levels and the inhibitory effects of the compounds.The RNA and protein levels of PCDH1 were significantly higher in PAAD cells than in normal pancreatic ductal cells, similar to those observed in tissue sections from patients with PAAD. Aberrant methylation of the CpG site cg19767205 and micro-RNA (miRNA) hsa-miR-124-1 may be important reasons for the high PCDH1 expression in PAAD. Up-regulated PCDH1 promotes pancreatic cancer cell metastasis. The RNA levels of PCDH1 were significantly down-regulated following flutamide treatment. Flutamide reduced the percentage of PCDH1 RNA level in PAAD cells Panc-0813 to <?50%. In addition, the PCDH1 protein was significantly down-regulated after Panc-0813 cells were incubated with 20 µM flutamide and proves to be a potential therapeutic intervention for PAAD.PCDH1 is a key prognostic biomarker and promoter of PAAD metastasis. Additionally, flutamide may serve as a novel compound that down-regulates PCDH1 expression as a potential treatment for combating PAAD progression and metastasis.© 2023. The Author(s).",1.09E-69

However, due to the poor treatment efficacy of COPD, exploring novel treatment has become the hotpot of study on COPD. Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) aging is a possible molecular way for COPD development. We aimed to explore the effector whether intravenous administration of EPCs has therapeutic effects in COPD mice.COPD mice model was induced by cigarette smoke exposure and EPCs were injected intravenously to investigate their effects on COPD mice. At day 127, heart, liver, spleen, lung and kidney tissues of mice were harvested. The histological effects of EPCs intervention on multiple organs of COPD mice were detected by morphology assay. Quantitative real-time PCR and Western blotting were used to detect the effect of EPCs intervention on the expression of multi-organ senescence-related indicators. And we explored the effect of EPCs systematically intervening on senescence-related USP7/p300 pathway.Compared with COPD group, senescence-associated ?-galactosidase activity was decreased, protein and mRNA expression of p16 was down-regulated, while protein and mRNA expression of cyclin D1 and TERT were up-regulated of multiple organs, including lung, heart, liver, spleen and kidney in COPD mice after EPCs system intervention. But the morphological alterations of the tissues described above in COPD mice failed to be reversed. Mechanistically, EPCs systemic administration inhibited the expression of mRNA and protein of USP7 and p300 in multiple organs of COPD mice, exerting therapeutic effects.EPCs administration significantly inhibited the senescence of multiple organs in COPD mice via down-regulating USP7/p300 pathway, which presents a possibility of EPCs therapy for COPD.© 2023.

,37942552,Identification and development of TP53 mutation-associated Long non-coding RNAs signature for optimized prognosis assessment and treatment selection in hepatocellular carcinoma.,Int J Immunopathol Pharmacol,"The TP53 gene is estimated to be mutated in over 50% of tumors, with the majority of tumors exhibiting abnormal TP53 signaling pathways. However, the exploration of TP53 mutation-related LncRNAs in Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains incomplete. This study aims to identify such LncRNAs and enhance the prognostic accuracy for Hepatoma patients.Differential gene expression was identified using the ""limma"" package in R. Prognosis-related LncRNAs were identified via univariate Cox regression analysis, while a prognostic model was crafted using multivariate Cox regression analysis. Survival analysis was conducted using Kaplan-Meier curves. The precision of the prognostic model was assessed through ROC analysis. Subsequently, the Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE) algorithm were executed on the TCGA dataset via the TIDE database. Fractions of 24 types of immune cell infiltration were obtained from NCI Cancer Research Data Commons using deconvolution techniques. The protein expression levels encoded by specific genes were obtained through the TPCA database.In this research, we have identified 85 LncRNAs associated with TP53 mutations and developed a corresponding signature referred to as TP53MLncSig. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a lower 3-year survival rate in high-risk patients (46.9%) compared to low-risk patients (74.2%). The accuracy of the prognostic TP53MLncSig was further evaluated by calculating the area under the ROC curve. The analysis yielded a 5-year ROC score of 0.793, confirming its effectiveness. Furthermore, a higher score for TP53MLncSig was found to be associated with an increased response rate to immune checkpoint blocker (ICB) therapy (p= .005). Patients possessing high-risk classification exhibited lower levels of P53 protein expression and higher levels of genomic instability.The present study aimed to identify and validate LncRNAs associated with TP53 mutations. We constructed a prognostic model that can predict chemosensitivity and response to ICB therapy in HCC patients. This novel approach sheds light on the role of LncRNAs in TP53 mutation and provides valuable resources for analyzing patient prognosis and treatment selection.",1.11E-70

In various types of cancers, the expression of GRM4 has been found to be correlated with a poor prognosis. However, research on the role of GRM4 in glioma is confined. The relationship between the expression profile of GRM4 and the prognosis of glioma patients has been systematically evaluated using RNA-sequencing datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), and China Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) repositories. The value of clinical prognostic (GRM4) was assessed using clinical survival data from CGGA and TCGA. The GEPIA database was used to select genes similar to GRM4. PPI network was constructed by the database of (STRING), GO and KEGG analyses were performed. TargetScan, TarBase, miRDB, and starBase were used to explore miRNAs that could regulate GRM4 expression. EWAS Data Hub, MethSurv, and MEXPRESS were used for the analysis and relationship between DNA methylation and GRM4 expression and prognosis in glioma. TIMER2.0 and CAMOIP databases were used to assess the association between immune cell infiltration and GRM4. Human GBM cell lines were used to validate the function of GRM4. Our study shows that GRM4 is underexpressed among gliomas and accompanied by poorer OS. Multivariate analysis showed that low mRNA expression of (GRM4) was an independent factor of prognostic for shorter OS in all glioma patients. MiR-1262 affects the malignant phenotype of gliomas through GRM4. Methylation of (DNA) plays an important role in the instruction of GRM4 expression, the methylation level of GRM4 in glioma tissue is higher in comparison to normal tissue, and the higher the methylation level, the worse the prognosis. Further analysis showed that GRM4 mRNA expression in GBM linked negatively with Common lymphoid progenitor, Macrophage M1, Macrophage, and T cell CD4+ Th2, but not with the tumor purity. Overexpression of GRM4 prevents the migration of human GBM cell lines in vitro. In conclusion, it is evident that GRM4 may have a substantial impact on the infiltration of immune cells and also serve as a valuable prognostic biomarker in gliomas.",7.15E-71
,37968259,Single cell dynamics of tumor specificity vs bystander activity in CD8(+) T cells define the diverse immune landscapes in colorectal cancer.,Cell Discov,"CD8+T cell activation via immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) is successful in microsatellite instable (MSI) colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. By comparison, the success of immunotherapy against microsatellite stable (MSS) CRC is limited. Little is known about the most critical features of CRC CD8+T cells that together determine the diverse immune landscapes and contrasting ICB responses. Hence, we pursued a deep single cell mapping of CRC CD8+T cells on transcriptomic and T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire levels in a diverse patient cohort, with additional surface proteome validation. This revealed that CRC CD8+T cell dynamics are underscored by complex interactions between interferon-? signaling, tumor reactivity, TCR repertoire, (predicted) TCR antigen-specificities, and environmental cues like gut microbiome or colon tissue-specific 'self-like' features. MSI CRC CD8+T cells showed tumor-specific activation reminiscent of canonical 'T cell hot' tumors, whereas the MSS CRC CD8+T cells exhibited tumor unspecific or bystander-like features. This was accompanied by inflammation reminiscent of 'pseudo-T cell hot' tumors. Consequently, MSI and MSS CRC CD8+T cells showed overlapping phenotypic features that differed dramatically in their TCR antigen-specificities. Given their high discriminating potential for CD8+T cell features/specificities, we used the single cell tumor-reactive signaling modules in CD8+T cells to build a bulk tumor transcriptome classification for CRC patients. This ""Immune Subtype Classification"" (ISC) successfully distinguished various tumoral immune landscapes that showed prognostic value and predicted immunotherapy responses in CRC patients. Thus, we deliver a unique map of CRC CD8+T cells that drives a novel tumor immune landscape classification, with relevance for immunotherapy decision-making.© 2023. The Author(s).",4.18E-71

Biomarkers contributing to the development of COAD stem cells remained to be discovered.To develop and validate an mRNAsi-based risk model for estimating the prognostic outcomes of patients suffering from COAD.Samples were collected from Rectal Adenocarcinoma (TCGA-READ) PanCancer Atlas datasets, The Cancer Genome Atlas Colon Adenocarcinoma (TCGA-COAD), and the GSE87211 dataset. MRNAsi was calculated by one-class logistic regression (OCLR) algorithm. Under the criterion of correlation greater than 0.4, genes related to mRNAsi were screened and clustered. Meanwhile, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between molecular subtypes were identified to establish a risk model. According to the median risk score value for immunotherapy and results from immune cell infiltration and clinicopathological analyses, clusters and patients were divided into high-RiskScore and low-RiskScore groups. Cell apoptosis and viability were detected by flow cytometer and Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, respectively.A negative correlation between mRNAsi and clinical stages was observed. Three clusters of patients (C1, C2, and C3) were defined based on a total of 165 survival-related mRNAsi genes. Specifically, C1 patients had greater immune cell infiltration and a poorer prognosis. A 5-mRNAsi-gene signature (HEYL, FSTL3, FABP4, ADAM8, and EBF4) served as a prediction index for COAD prognosis. High-RiskScore patients had a poorer prognosis and higher level of immune cell infiltration. In addition, the five genes in the signature all showed a high expression in COAD cells. Knocking down HEYL promoted COAD cell apoptosis and inhibited viability.Our mRNAsi risk model could better predict the prognosis of COAD patients.©2023 Huang et al.",2.01E-71

CRC has been steadily increasing in developing countries owing to factors such as aging and epidemics. Despite extensive research, the exact pathogenesis of CRC remains unclear, and its causes are complex and variable. Numerous in vitro, animal, and clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of probiotics such asLactobacillus plantarumin reversing the adverse outcomes of CRC. These findings suggest that probiotics play vital roles in the prevention, adjuvant treatment, and prognosis of CRC. In this study, we constructed a mouse model of CRC using an intraperitoneal injection of azomethane combined with dextran sodium sulfate, while administering 5-fluorouracil as well as high- and low-doses ofL. plantarumZhang-LL live or heat-killed strains. Weight changes and disease activity indices were recorded during feeding, and the number of polyps and colon length were measured after euthanasia. HE staining was used to observe the histopathological changes in the colons of mice, and ELISA was used to detect the expression levels of IL-1?, TNF-?, and IFN-? in serum. To investigate the specific mechanisms involved in alleviating CRC progression, gut microbial alterations were investigated using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and non-targeted metabolomics, and changes in genes related to CRC were assessed using eukaryotic transcriptomics. The results showed that both viable and heat-killed strains ofL. plantarumZhang-LL in high doses significantly inhibited tumorigenesis, colon shortening, adverse inflammatory reactions, intestinal tissue damage, and pro-inflammatory factor expression upregulation. Specifically, in the gut microbiota, the abundance of the dominant floraAcutalibacter murisandLactobacillus johnsoniiwas regulated, PGE2 expression was significantly reduced, the arachidonic acid metabolism pathway was inhibited, and CD22-mediated B-cell receptor regulation-related gene expression was upregulated.

,37982888,Deciphering the molecular mechanistic paths describing the chemotherapeutic potential and epigenetic regulation of curcumin in lung cancer: a mini review.,Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch Pharmacol,"In an uncontrolled inflammatory environment, the complex process of lung carcinogenesis occurs. Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. The average 5-year survival rate is still low despite significant advancements in our knowledge of lung carcinogenesis and the development of innovative therapies in recent decades. Research on adjuvant treatment, lung carcinogenesis pathways, and possible prognostic indicators has to be refocused using an innovative approach. The majority of lung cancers are discovered at an advanced stage when there is little chance of recovery. It has grown in popularity in recent years to supplement already available chemotherapeutic therapies with adjuvant herbal medications, which may lessen toxicity and adverse effects without sacrificing therapeutic efficiency. One such prospective contender is curcumin. In-depth research has been done on curcumin as a multi-target anti-tumor and anti-inflammatory molecule. A pharmacologically active polyphenol produced from turmeric is called curcumin. Over the past few decades, curcumin's therapeutic potential has been thoroughly studied, and data indicate that curcumin may play a part in a variety of biological processes, most notably its potent anticancer activity. Being a pleiotropic chemical, curcumin regulates a variety of molecules that are key players in many cell signaling pathways. It has been shown to stifle transformation, restrain proliferation, and trigger apoptosis. Curcumin can reduce the development of non-small cell LC by downregulating Circular RNA hsa_circ_0007580, which in turn controls the expression of integrin subunit beta 1 by adsorbing miR-384. Nevertheless, despite all these advantages, curcumin's effectiveness is still restricted because of its weak bioavailability, poor absorption within the systemic circulation, and quick removal from the body. In an effort to overcome these constraints, scientists from all around the world are working to develop a synthetic and improved curcuminoid by appropriately altering the parent skeleton structurally. These curcuminoids will simultaneously improve the physicochemical properties and efficacy.

Aberrant epigenetic modifications and posttranslational modifications (PTMs) promote anticancer drug resistance, cancer progression, and metastasis. Accumulating studies indicate that epigenetic modifications can transcriptionally and translationally determine cancer cell vulnerability to ferroptosis and that ferroptosis functions as a driver in nervous system diseases (NSDs), cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), liver diseases, lung diseases, and kidney diseases. In this review, we first summarize the core molecular mechanisms of ferroptosis. Then, the roles of epigenetic processes, including histone PTMs, DNA methylation, and noncoding RNA regulation and PTMs, such as phosphorylation, ubiquitination, SUMOylation, acetylation, methylation, and ADP-ribosylation, are concisely discussed. The roles of epigenetic modifications and PTMs in ferroptosis regulation in the genesis of diseases, including cancers, NSD, CVDs, liver diseases, lung diseases, and kidney diseases, as well as the application of epigenetic and PTM modulators in the therapy of these diseases, are then discussed in detail. Elucidating the mechanisms of ferroptosis regulation mediated by epigenetic modifications and PTMs in cancer and other diseases will facilitate the development of promising combination therapeutic regimens containing epigenetic or PTM-targeting agents and ferroptosis inducers that can be used to overcome chemotherapeutic resistance in cancer and could be used to prevent other diseases. In addition, these mechanisms highlight potential therapeutic approaches to overcome chemoresistance in cancer or halt the genesis of other diseases.© 2023. The Author(s).",1.32E-72

(b) SARS-CoV-1 (SCOV1) vs. SCOV2: do they differ? (c) does and how SCOV2 differs from Influenza/INFL infection? (d) does low viral-load and (e) does COVID-19 early host response relate to the two-stage SCOV2 infection profile? We provide positive answers to the above questions by analyzing the time-series gene-expression profiles of preserved cell-lines infected with SCOV1/2 or, the gene-expression profiles of infected individuals with different viral-loads levels and different host-response phenotypes.Our analytical methodology follows an in-silico quest organized around an elaborate multi-step analysis pipeline including: (a) utilization of fifteen gene-expression datasets from NCBI's gene expression omnibus/GEO repository; (b) thorough designation of SCOV1/2 and INFL progression stages and COVID-19 phenotypes; (c) identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and enriched biological processes and pathways that contrast and differentiate between different infection stages and phenotypes; (d) employment of a graph-based clustering process for the induction of coherent groups of networked genes as the representative core molecular fingerprints that characterize the different SCOV2 progression stages and the different COVID-19 phenotypes. In addition, relying on a sensibly selected set of induced fingerprint genes and following a Machine Learning approach, we devised and assessed the performance of different classifier models for the differentiation of acute respiratory illness/ARI caused by SCOV2 or other infections (diagnostic classifiers), as well as for the prediction of COVID-19 disease severity (prognostic classifiers), with quite encouraging results.The central finding of our experiments demonstrates the down-regulation of type-I interferon genes (IFN-1), interferon induced genes (ISGs) and fundamental innate immune and defense biological processes and molecular pathways during the early SCOV2 infection stages, with the inverse to hold during the later ones. It is highlighted that upregulation of these genes and pathways early after infection may prove beneficial in preventing subsequent uncontrolled hyperinflammatory and potentially lethal events.The basic aim of our study was to utilize in an intuitive, efficient and productive way the most relevant and state-of-the-art bioinformatics methods to reveal the core molecular mechanisms which govern the progression of SCOV2 infection and the different COVID-19 phenotypes.Copyright © 2023 Potamias, Gkoublia and Kanterakis.",6.17E-73

This study aims to investigate IPF-to-LC pathogenesis and to develop a predictor for detecting IPF predisposing patients to LC. We conducted unsupervised clustering to detect high-risk subtypes from IPF to LC. Subsequently, we performed single-cell RNA-seq analysis to characterize high-risk IPF by examining the immune microenvironment. We identified 42 common immune function-related pathogenic genes between IPF and LC. We developed an LC risk classifier for IPF patients, comprising five genes:SPP1,MMP9,MMP12,FABP4, andIL1B. The five-gene classifier can successfully distinguish the high-risk population from IPF patients. High-risk IPF patients exhibited an immunosuppressive microenvironment with higher oncogene expression than low-risk patients. Single-cell analysis revealed thatSPP1+macrophages at the terminal of macrophages' developmental trajectory may promote the progression from IPF to LC. The strong crosstalk betweenSPP1+macrophages and inflammation-related cancer-associated fibroblasts promoted the tumorigenic process in IPF. In vitro, assays showed that co-culturing macrophages overexpressingSPP1with MRC-5 cells induced the transition of fibroblasts into cancer-associated fibroblasts.SPP1produced by macrophages promoted epithelial-mesenchymal transition in alveolar epithelial cells via stimulating the upregulation of N-cadherin and Vimentin in MLE-12 cells.

,37993750,"Nucleoporin 93, a new substrate of the E3 ubiquitin protein ligase HECTD1, promotes esophageal squamous cell carcinoma progression.",Hum Cell,"Nucleoporin 93 (NUP93) is an important component of the nuclear pore complex, exhibiting pro-tumorigenic properties in some cancers. However, its function in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) has not been elucidated. This study aimed to investigate the effects of NUP93 in ESCC and the underlying mechanisms involved. Through analysis of public human cancer datasets, we observed higher expression of NUP93 in esophageal cancer tissues than in normal tissues. Stable ESCC cell lines with NUP93 overexpression or knockdown were established by lentiviral vector transduction and puromycin selection. NUP93 knockdown suppressed the proliferation, colony formation, cell cycle transition, migration, and invasion of ESCC cells, while the overexpression of NUP93 displayed opposite effects. NUP93 positively regulated epithelial-mesenchymal transition and AKT signaling transduction in ESCC cells. In addition, NUP93 increased the expression of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) in ESCC cells and attenuated NK cell-mediated lysis of ESCC cells. In vivo experiments demonstrated that NUP93 promotes the growth of ESCC in nude mice, enhances Ki67 and PD-L1 expression, and promotes AKT signaling transduction in xenografts. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that the HECT domain E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1 (HECTD1) contributes to the ubiquitination and degradation of NUP93 and acts as a tumor suppressor in ESCC. To conclude, this study has shown that NUP93 has pro-tumor properties in ESCC and that HECTD1 functions as an upstream regulator of NUP93 in ESCC. These findings may contribute to the investigation of potential therapeutic targets in ESCC.© 2023. The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Japan Human Cell Society.",1.42E-73

The therapy for most GI cancers is difficult and is associated with a poor prognosis. In China, upper GI cancers, mainly gastric cancer (GC) and oesophageal cancer (EC), are very common due to Chinese people's characteristics, and more than half of patients are diagnosed with distant metastatic or locally advanced disease. Compared to other solid cancers, such as lung cancer and breast cancer, personalized therapies, especially targeted therapy and immunotherapy, in GC and EC are relatively lacking, leading to poor prognosis. For a long time, most studies were carried out by using in vitro cancer cell lines or in vivo cell line-derived xenograft models, which are unable to reproduce the characteristics of tumours derived from patients, leading to the possible misguidance of subsequent clinical validation. The patient-derived models represented by patient-derived organoid (PDO) and xenograft (PDX) models, known for their high preservation of patient tumour features, have emerged as a very popular platform that has been widely used in numerous studies, especially in the research and development of antitumour drugs and personalized medicine. Herein, based on some of the available published literature, we review the research and application status of PDO and PDX models in GC and EC, as well as detail their future challenges and prospects, to promote their use in basic and translational studies or personalized therapy.© 2023.

,37928907,Epigenetic roles in clonal hematopoiesis and aging kidney-related chronic kidney disease.,Front Cell Dev Biol,"Accumulation of somatic hematopoietic stem cell mutations with aging has been revealed by the recent genome-wide analysis. Clonal expansion, known as clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP), is a premalignant condition of hematological cancers. It is defined as the absence of definitive morphological evidence of a hematological neoplasm and occurrence of ?2% of mutant allele fraction in the peripheral blood. In CHIP, the most frequently mutated genes are epigenetic regulators such asDNMT3A, TET2,andASXL1.CHIP induces inflammation. CHIP is shown to be associated with not only hematological malignancy but also non-malignant disorders such as atherosclerosis, cardiovascular diseases and chronic liver disease. In addition, recent several large clinical trials have shown that CHIP is also the risk factor for developing chronic kidney disease (CKD). In this review article, we proposed novel findings about CHIP and CHIP related kidney disease based on the recent basic and clinical research. The possible mechanism of the kidney injury in CHIP is supposed to be due to the clonal expansion in both myeloid and lymphoid cell lines. In myeloid cell lines, the mutated macrophages increase the inflammatory cytokine level and induce chronic inflammation. It leads to epigenetic downregulation of kidney and macrophage klotho level. In lymphoid cell lines, CHIP might be related to monoclonal gammopathy of renal significance (MGRS). It describes any B cell or plasma cell clonal disorder that does not fulfill the criteria for cancer yet produces a nephrotoxic monoclonal immunoglobulin that leads to kidney injury or disease. MGRS causes M-protein related nephropathy frequently observed among aged CKD patients. It is important to consider the CHIP-related complications such as hematological malignancy, cardiovascular diseases and metabolic disorders in managing the elderly CKD patients. There are no established therapies for CHIP and CHIP-related CKD yet. However, recent studies have supported the development of effective CHIP therapies, such as blocking the expansion of aberrant HSCs and inhibiting chronic inflammation. In addition, drugs targeting the epigenetic regulation of Klotho in the kidney and macrophages might be therapeutic targets of CHIP in the kidney.Copyright © 2023 Ogura and Mimura.",9.64E-74

Histone modifications have been known to regulate various abiotic stress responses. However, the role of histone methyltransferases and demethylases remain unexplored in potato under heat stress.Potato genome database was used for genome-wide analysis of StPRMT and StHDMA gene families, which were further characterized by analyzing gene structure, conserved motif, domain organization, sub-cellular localization, promoter region and phylogenetic relationships. Additionally, expression profiling under high-temperature stress in leaf and stolon tissue of heat contrasting potato genotypes was done to study their role in response to high temperature stress.The genome-wide analysis led to identification of nine StPRMT and eleven StHDMA genes. Structural analysis, including conserved motifs, exon/intron structure and phylogenetic relationships classified StPRMT and StHDMA gene families into two classes viz. Class I and Class II. A variety of cis-regulatory elements were explored in the promoter region associated with light, developmental, hormonal and stress responses. Prediction of sub-cellular localization of StPRMT proteins revealed their occurrence in nucleus and cytoplasm, whereas StHDMA proteins were observed in different sub-cellular compartments. Furthermore, expression profiling of StPRMT and StHDMA gene family members revealed genes responding to heat stress. Heat-inducible expression of StPRMT1, StPRMT3, StPRMT4 and StPRMT5 in leaf and stolon tissues of HS and HT cultivar indicated them as probable candidates for enhancing thermotolerance in potato. However, StHDMAs responded dynamically in leaf and stolon tissue of heat contrasting genotypes under high temperature.The current study presents a detailed analysis of histone modifiers in potato and indicates their role as an important epigenetic regulators modulating heat tolerance.Understanding epigenetic mechanisms underlying heat tolerance in potato will contribute towards breeding of thermotolerant potato varieties.Copyright © 2023.

,37925795,Hsa_circ_0020134 promotes liver metastasis of colorectal cancer through the miR-183-5p-PFN2-TGF-Î²/Smad axis.,Transl Oncol,"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a distinct class of non-coding RNAs that play regulatory roles in the initiation and progression of tumors. With advancements in transcriptome sequencing technology, numerous circRNAs that play significant roles in tumor-related genes have been identified. In this study, we used transcriptome sequencing to analyze the expression levels of circRNAs in normal adjacent tissues, primary colorectal cancer (CRC) tissues, and CRC tissues with liver metastasis. We successfully identified the circRNA hsa_circ_0020134 (circ0020134), which exhibited significantly elevated expression specifically in CRC with liver metastasis. Importantly, high levels of circ0020134 were associated with a poor prognosis among patients. Functional experiments demonstrated that circ0020134 promotes the proliferation and metastasis of CRC cells both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, upregulation of circ0020134 was induced by the transcription factor, PAX5, while miR-183-5p acted as a sponge for circ0020134, leading to partial upregulation of PFN2 mRNA and protein levels, thereby further activating the downstream TGF-?/Smad pathway. Additionally, downregulation of circ0020134 inhibited epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in CRC cells, which could be reversed by miR-183-5p inhibitor treatment. Collectively, our findings confirm that the circ0020134-miR-183-5p-PFN2-TGF-?/Smad axis induces EMT transformation within tumor cells, promoting CRC proliferation and metastasis, thus highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for patients with CRC liver metastasis.Copyright © 2023.

,38116240,miR-9 utilizes precursor pathways in adaptation to alcohol in mouse striatal neurons.,Adv Drug Alcohol Res,"microRNA-9 (miR-9) is one of the most abundant microRNAs in the mammalian brain, essential for its development and normal function. In neurons, it regulates the expression of several key molecules, ranging from ion channels to enzymes, to transcription factors broadly affecting the expression of many genes. The neuronal effects of alcohol, one of the most abused drugs in the world, seem to be at least partially dependent on regulating the expression of miR-9. We previously observed that molecular mechanisms of the development of alcohol tolerance are miR-9 dependent. Since a critical feature of alcohol action is temporal exposure to the drug, we decided to better understand the time dependence of alcohol regulation of miR-9 biogenesis and expression. We measured the effect of intoxicating concentration of alcohol (20 mM ethanol) on the expression of all major elements of miR-9 biogenesis: three pri-precursors (pri-mir-9-1, pri-mir-9-2, pri-mir-9-3), three pre-precursors (pre-mir-9-1, pre-mir-9-2, pre-mir-9-3), and two mature microRNAs: miR-9-5p and miR-9-3p, using digital PCR and RT-qPCR, and murine primary medium spiny neurons (MSN) cultures. We subjected the neurons to alcohol based on an exposure/withdrawal matrix of different exposure times (from 15 min to 24 h) followed by different withdrawal times (from 0 h to 24 h). We observed that a short exposure increased mature miR-9-5p expression, which was followed by a gradual decrease and subsequent increase of the expression, returning to pre-exposure levels within 24 h. Temporal changes of miR-9-3p expression were complementing miR-9-5p changes. Interestingly, an extended, continuous presence of the drug caused a similar pattern. These results suggest the presence of the adaptive mechanisms of miR-9 expression in the presence and absence of alcohol. Measurement of miR-9 pre- and pri-precursors showed further that the primary effect of alcohol on miR-9 is through the mir-9-2 precursor pathway with a smaller contribution of mir-9-1 and mir-9-3 precursors. Our results provide new insight into the adaptive mechanisms of neurons to alcohol exposure. It would be of interest to determine next which microRNA-based mechanisms are involved in a transition from the acute, intoxicating effects of alcohol to the chronic, addictive effects of the drug.",2.96E-77
,38104307,Potential of Nano-Engineered Stem Cells in the Treatment of Multiple Sclerosis: A Comprehensive Review.,Cell Mol Neurobiol,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic and degrading autoimmune disorder mainly targeting the central nervous system, leading to progressive neurodegeneration, demyelination, and axonal damage. Current treatment options for MS are limited in efficacy, generally linked to adverse side effects, and do not offer a cure. Stem cell therapies have emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for MS, potentially promoting remyelination, exerting immunomodulatory effects and protecting against neurodegeneration. Therefore, this review article focussed on the potential of nano-engineering in stem cells as a therapeutic approach for MS, focusing on the synergistic effects of combining stem cell biology with nanotechnology to stimulate the proliferation of oligodendrocytes (OLs) from neural stem cells and OL precursor cells, by manipulating neural signalling pathways-PDGF, BMP, Wnt, Notch and their essential genes such as Sox, bHLH, Nkx. Here we discuss the pathophysiology of MS, the use of various types of stem cells in MS treatment and their mechanisms of action. In the context of nanotechnology, we present an overview of its applications in the medical and research field and discuss different methods and materials used to nano-engineer stem cells, including surface modification, biomaterials and scaffolds, and nanoparticle-based delivery systems. We further elaborate on nano-engineered stem cell techniques, such as nano script, nano-exosome hybrid, nano-topography and their potentials in MS. The article also highlights enhanced homing, engraftment, and survival of nano-engineered stem cells, targeted and controlled release of therapeutic agents, and immunomodulatory and tissue repair effects with their challenges and limitations. This visual illustration depicts the process of utilizing nano-engineering in stem cells and exosomes for the purpose of delivering more accurate and improved treatments for Multiple Sclerosis (MS). This approach targets specifically the creation of oligodendrocytes, the breakdown of which is the primary pathological factor in MS.© 2023.

The impact of POU5F1 on the proliferation and metastasis of GC was examined, along with the potential of ATRA as a specific therapeutic agent for GC. The dysregulation of POU5F1 expression in GC tissues was analyzed using public databases and bioinformatics techniques, and the disparity in POU5F1 expression between normal gastric tissues and GC tissues was further assessed through western blot, RT-qPCR, and immunohistochemistry. The present study aimed to investigate the impact of POU5F1 on the proliferation, migration, and invasion of GC cells through both in vivo and in vitro experiments. Additionally, the effects of ATRA on the proliferation, migration, and invasion of GC cells were examined using in vivo and in vitro approaches. Our findings revealed a significant upregulation of POU5F1 in GC tissues, which was found to be associated with a poorer prognosis in patients with GC. Moreover, POU5F1 was observed to enhance the proliferation, migration, and invasion of GC cells in vitro, as well as promote subcutaneous tumor growth and lung metastasis of GC cells in vivo. The overexpression of POU5F1 mechanistically triggers the process of Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by down-regulating E-Cadherin and up-regulating N-Cadherin and VIM. POU5F1 hinders the ubiquitination of TRAF6 through negative regulation of TRIM59, thereby facilitating the activation of the NF-?B pathway. Furthermore, the administration of ATRA effectively impedes the proliferation, migration, and invasion of GC cells by suppressing the expression of POU5F1. The upregulation of POU5F1 elicits EMT, fosters the initiation of the NF-?B signaling pathway in GC cells, and stimulates the proliferation, invasion, and metastasis of GC cells. All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) can impede these POU5F1-induced effects, thereby potentially serving as an adjunctive therapeutic approach for GC.© 2023. The Author(s).",1.06E-78
,37978566,Extracellular vesicle-based liquid biopsy biomarkers and their application in precision immuno-oncology.,Biomark Res,"While the field of precision oncology is rapidly expanding and more targeted options are revolutionizing cancer treatment paradigms, therapeutic resistance particularly to immunotherapy remains a pressing challenge. This can be largely attributed to the dynamic tumor-stroma interactions that continuously alter the microenvironment. While to date most advancements have been made through examining the clinical utility of tissue-based biomarkers, their invasive nature and lack of a holistic representation of the evolving disease in a real-time manner could result in suboptimal treatment decisions. Thus, using minimally-invasive approaches to identify biomarkers that predict and monitor treatment response as well as alert to the emergence of recurrences is of a critical need. Currently, research efforts are shifting towards developing liquid biopsy-based biomarkers obtained from patients over the course of disease. Liquid biopsy represents a unique opportunity to monitor intercellular communication within the tumor microenvironment which could occur through the exchange of extracellular vesicles (EVs). EVs are lipid bilayer membrane nanoscale vesicles which transfer a plethora of biomolecules that mediate intercellular crosstalk, shape the tumor microenvironment, and modify drug response. The capture of EVs using innovative approaches, such as microfluidics, magnetic beads, and aptamers, allow their analysis via high throughput multi-omics techniques and facilitate their use for biomarker discovery. Artificial intelligence, using machine and deep learning algorithms, is advancing multi-omics analyses to uncover candidate biomarkers and predictive signatures that are key for translation into clinical trials. With the increasing recognition of the role of EVs in mediating immune evasion and as a valuable biomarker source, these real-time snapshots of cellular communication are promising to become an important tool in the field of precision oncology and spur the recognition of strategies to block resistance to immunotherapy. In this review, we discuss the emerging role of EVs in biomarker research describing current advances in their isolation and analysis techniques as well as their function as mediators in the tumor microenvironment. We also highlight recent lung cancer and melanoma studies that point towards their application as predictive biomarkers for immunotherapy and their potential clinical use in precision immuno-oncology.© 2023.

,38069267,Lipopolysaccharide Impedes Bone Repair in FcÎ³RIIB-Deficient Mice.,Int J Mol Sci,"Chronic inflammation contributes to the development of skeletal disorders in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Activation of the host immune response stimulates osteoclast activity, which in turn leads to bone loss. Regenerating bone in the inflammatory microenvironments of SLE patients with critical bone defects remains a great challenge. In this study, we utilized lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to imitate locally and systemically pathogenic bacterial infection and examined the bone regeneration performance of LPS-associated mandibular and tibial bone regeneration impairment inFc?RIIB-/-mice. Our results indicated that a loss ofFc?RIIBalleviates bone regeneration in both mandibles and tibiae. After LPS induction,Fc?RIIB-/-mice were susceptible to impaired fracture healing in tibial and mandibular bones. LPS decreased the mineralization to collagen ratio inFc?RIIB-/-mice, indicating a mineralization defect during bone repair. An osteoblast-associated gene (Col1a1) was attenuated inFc?RIIB-deficient mice, whereasBglap, Hhip,andCreb5were further downregulated with LPS treatment inFc?RIIB-/-mice compared toFc?RIIB-/-mice.Alpl and Bglapexpression was dcreased in osteoblasts derived from bone chips. An osteoclast-associated gene,Tnfsf11/Tnfrsf11ratio, ewas increased in LPS-inducedFc?RIIB-/-mice and in vitro. Furthermore, systemic LPS was relatively potent in stimulating production of pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF-?, IL-6, and MCP-1 inFc?RIIB-/-mice compared toFc?RIIB-/-mice. The levels of TNF-?, IFN-?, IL-1?, and IL-17A were increased, whereas IL-10 and IL-23 were decreased inFc?RIIB-/-mice treated locally with LPS. These findings suggest that both local and systemic LPS burden can exacerbate bone regeneration impairment, delay mineralization and skeletal repair, and induce inflammation in SLE patients.",3.05E-80
,37936934,Candidate regulators of drought stress in tomato revealed by comparative transcriptomic and proteomic analyses.,Front Plant Sci,"Drought is among the most common abiotic constraints of crop growth, development, and productivity. Integrating different omics approaches offers a possibility for deciphering the metabolic pathways and fundamental mechanisms involved in abiotic stress tolerance. Here, we explored the transcriptional and post-transcriptional changes in drought-stressed tomato plants using transcriptomic and proteomic profiles to determine the molecular dynamics of tomato drought stress responses. We identified 22467 genes and 5507 proteins, among which the expression of 3765 genes and 294 proteins was significantly changed under drought stress. Furthermore, the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) showed a good correlation (0.743). The results indicated that integrating different omics approaches is promising in exploring the multilayered regulatory mechanisms of plant drought resistance. Gene ontology (GO) and pathway analysis identified several GO terms and pathways related to stress resistance, including response to stress, abiotic stimulus, and oxidative stress. The plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) plays pivotal roles in response to drought stress,ABA-response element binding factor(AREB) is a key positive regulator of ABA signaling. Moreover, our analysis indicated that drought stress increased the abscisic acid (ABA) content, which activatedAREB1expression to regulate the expression ofTAS14,GSH-Px-1, andHsp, ultimately improving tomato drought resistance. In addition, the yeast one-hybrid assay demonstrated that the AREB1 could bind the Hsp promoter to activate Hsp expression. Thus, this study involved a full-scale analysis of gene and protein expression in drought-stressed tomato, deepening the understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of the essential drought-tolerance genes in tomato.Copyright © 2023 Liu, Zhao, Huang, Pan, Chen, Qu, Ouyang, Yu and Shabala.",7.15E-81

However, the specific link between m6A alteration and CHD warrants further investigation.Gene expression profiles from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases. We began by constructing a Random Forest model followed by a Nomogram model, both aimed at enhancing our predictive capabilities on specific m6A markers. We then shifted our focus to identify distinct molecular subtypes based on the key m6A regulators and to discern differentially expressed genes between the unique m6A clusters. Following this molecular exploration, we embarked on an in-depth analysis of the biological characteristics associated with each m6A cluster, revealing profound differences between them. Finally, we delved into the identification and correlation analysis of immune cell infiltration across these clusters, emphasizing the potential interplay between m6A modification and the immune system.In this research, 37 important m6Aregulators were identified by comparing non-CHD and CHD patients from the GSE20680, GSE20681, and GSE71226 datasets. To predict the risk of CHD, seven candidate m6A regulators (CBLL1, HNRNPC, YTHDC2, YTHDF1, YTHDF2, YTHDF3, ZC3H13) were screened using the logistic regression model. Based on the seven possible m6A regulators, a nomogram model was constructed. An examination of decision curves revealed that CHD patients could benefit from the nomogram model. On the basis of the selected relevant m6A regulators, patients with CHD were separated into two m6A clusters (cluster1 and cluster2) using the consensus clustering approach. The Single Sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (ssGSEA) and CIBERSORT methods were used to estimate the immunological characteristics of two separate m6A Gene Clusters; the results indicated a close association between seven candidate genes and immune cell composition. The drug sensitivity of seven candidate regulators was predicted, and these seven regulators appeared in numerous diseases as pharmacological targets while displaying strong drug sensitivity.m6A regulators play crucial roles in the development of CHD.

While they represent targetable germ tissue antigens and play important functional roles in tumorigenesis, there is currently no standardized approach for identifying clinically relevant CT genes. Optimized algorithms and validated methods for accurate prediction of reliable CT antigens (CTAs) with high immunogenicity are also lacking.Sequencing data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) and The Genomic Data Commons (GDC) databases was used for the development of a bioinformatic pipeline to identify CT exclusive genes. A CT germness score was calculated based on the number of CT genes expressed within a tumor type and their degree of expression. The impact of tumor germness on clinical outcome was evaluated using healthy GTEx and GDC tumor samples. We then used a triple-negative breast cancer mouse model to develop and test an algorithm that predicts epitope immunogenicity based on the identification of germline sequences with strong major histocompatibility complex class I (MHCI) and MHCII binding affinities. Germline sequences for CT genes were synthesized as long synthetic peptide vaccines and tested in the 4T1 triple-negative model of invasive breast cancer with Poly(I:C) adjuvant. Vaccine immunogenicity was determined by flow cytometric analysis of in vitro and in vivo T-cell responses. Primary tumor growth and lung metastasis was evaluated by histopathology, flow cytometry and colony formation assay.We developed a new bioinformatic pipeline to reliably identify CT exclusive genes as immunogenic targets for immunotherapy. We identified CT genes that are exclusively expressed within the testis, lack detectable thymic expression, and are significantly expressed in multiple tumor types. High tumor germness correlated with tumor progression but not with tumor mutation burden, supporting CTAs as appealing targets in low mutation burden tumors. Importantly, tumor germness also correlated with markers of antitumor immunity. Vaccination of 4T1 tumor-bearing mice with Siglece and Lin28a antigens resulted in increased T-cell antitumor immunity and reduced primary tumor growth and lung metastases.Our results present a novel strategy for the identification of highly immunogenic CTAs for the development of targeted vaccines that induce antitumor immunity and inhibit metastasis.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023.

However, the alteration of DNA methylation in LGs and its role in the pathogenesis of SS-related dry eye is still unknown. Here, we performed an integrated analysis of DNA methylation and RNA-Seq data in LGs to identify novel DNA methylation-regulated differentially expressed genes (MeDEGs) in the pathogenesis of SS-related dry eye.The DNA methylation and transcription profiles of LGs in NOD mice at different stages of SS-related dry eye (4-, 8-, 12- and 16 weeks old) were generated by reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) and RNA-Seq. The differentially methylated genes (DMGs) and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were analyzed by MethylKit R package and edgeR. Correlation analysis between methylation level and mRNA expression was conducted with R software. The functional correlation of DMGs and DEGs was analyzed by Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). Finally, LG tissues from another litter of NOD mice were collected for methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) to validate the methylation and expression levels of key genes. CD4+cell infiltration of LGs was detected by immunofluorescence staining.Hypermethylation of LGs was identified in NOD mice with the progression of SS-related dry eye and the DMGs were mainly enriched in the GTPases activation and Ras signaling pathway. RNA-seq analysis revealed 1321, 2549, and 3712 DEGs in the 8-, 12- and 16-week-old NOD mice compared with 4-week-old normal control mice. For GO analysis, the DEGs were mainly enriched in T cell immune responses. Further, a total of 140 MeDEGs were obtained by integrated analysis of methylome and transcriptome, which were primarily enriched in T cell activation, proliferation and differentiation. Based on the main GO terms and KEGG pathways of MeDEGs, 8 genes were screened out. The expression levels of these key genes, especiallyItgal, Vav1, Irf4andIcosl, were verified to elevate after the onset of SS-related dry eye in NOD mice and positively correlated with the extent of inflammatory cell infiltration in LGs. Immunofluorescence assay revealed that CD4+cell infiltration dramatically increased in LGs of SS-related dry eye mice compared with the control mice. And the expression levels of four genes showed significantly positive correlation with the extent of CD4+cell infiltration in LGs. MSP showed the hypomethylation of theIrf4 andItgalpromoters in NOD mice with SS-related dry eye compared to control group.Our study revealed the critical role of epigenetic regulation of T cell immunity-related genes in the progression of SS-related dry eye and reminded us that DNA methylation-regulated genes such asItgal, Vav1, Irf4andIcoslmay be used as new targets for SS-related dry eye therapy.© 2023 Sun et al.",3.39E-87

As OA progresses, chondrocytes experience heightened catabolic activity, often accompanied by alterations in the extracellular environment's osmolarity and acidity. Nevertheless, the precise mechanism by which chondrocytes perceive and respond to acidic stress remains unknown. Recently, there has been growing interest in pH-sensing G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as GPR68, within musculoskeletal tissues. However, function of GPR68 in cartilage during OA progression remains unknown. This study aims to identify the role of GPR68 in regulation of catabolic gene expression utilizing anin vitromodel that simulates catabolic processes in OA.We examined the expression of GPCR by analyzing high throughput RNA-Seq data in human cartilage isolated from healthy donors and OA patients. De-identified and discarded OA cartilage was obtained from joint arthroplasty and chondrocytes were prepared by enzymatic digestion. Chondrocytes were treated with GPR68 agonist, Ogerin and then stimulated IL1? and RNA isolation was performed using Trizol method. Reverse transcription was done using the cDNA synthesis kit and the expression ofGPR68and OA related catabolic genes was quantified using SYBR® green assays.The transcriptome analysis revealed that pH sensing GPCR were expressed in human cartilage with a notable increase in the expression of GPR68 in OA cartilage which suggest a potential role for GPR68 in the pathogenesis of OA. Immunohistochemical (IHC) and qPCR analyses in human cartilage representing various stages of OA indicated a progressive increase inGPR68expression in cartilage associated with higher OA grades, underscoring a correlation between GPR68 expression and the severity of OA. Furthermore, IHC analysis of Gpr68 in murine cartilage subjected to surgically induced OA demonstrated elevated levels of GPR68 in knee cartilage and meniscus. Using IL1? stimulatedin vitromodel of OA catabolism, our qPCR analysis unveiled a time-dependent increase in GPR68 expression in response to IL1? stimulation, which correlates with the expression of matrix degrading proteases suggesting the role of GPR68 in chondrocytes catabolism and matrix degeneration. Using pharmacological activator of GPR68, our results further showed that GPR68 activation repressed the expression of MMPs in human chondrocytes.Our results demonstrated thatGPR68was robustly expressed in human cartilage and mice and its expression correlates with matrix degeneration and severity of OA progression in human and surgical model.

Whether such alterations of H3K36me can be exploited for therapeutic interventions is still unknown. Here, we show that HNSCC models expressing H3K36M can be divided into two groups: those that display aberrant accumulation of H3K27me3 and those that maintain steady levels of H3K27me3. The first group shows decreased proliferation, genome instability, and increased sensitivity to genotoxic agents, such as PARP1/2 inhibitors. In contrast, the H3K36M HNSCC models with steady H3K27me3 levels do not exhibit these characteristics unless H3K27me3 levels are elevated, either by DNA hypomethylating agents or by inhibiting the H3K27me3 demethylases KDM6A/B. Mechanistically, we found that H3K36M reduces H3K36me by directly impeding the activities of the histone methyltransferase NSD3 and the histone demethylase LSD2. Notably, we found that aberrant H3K27me3 levels induced by H3K36M expression is not a bona fide epigenetic mark in HNSCC since it requires continuous expression of H3K36M to be inherited. Moreover, increased sensitivity of H3K36M HNSCC models to PARP1/2 inhibitors solely depends on the increased H3K27me3 levels. Indeed, aberrantly high H3K27me3 levels decrease BRCA1 and FANCD2-dependent DNA repair, resulting in higher sensitivity to DNA breaks and replication stress. Finally, in support of our in vitro findings, a PARP1/2 inhibitor alone reduce tumor burden in a H3K36M HNSCC xenograft model with elevated H3K27me3, whereas in a H3K36M HNSCC xenograft model with consistent H3K27me3 levels, a combination of PARP1/2 inhibitors and agents that upregulate H3K27me3 proves to be successful. In conclusion, our findings underscore a delicate balance between H3K36 and H3K27 methylation, essential for maintaining genome stability. This equilibrium presents promising therapeutic opportunities for patients with H3K36me-deficient tumors.",1.68E-91
,38023145,Tumor suppressive miR-99b-5p as an epigenomic regulator mediating mTOR/AR/SMARCD1 signaling axis in aggressive prostate cancer.,Front Oncol,"African American (AA) men exhibited 2.3-fold higher PCa incidence and 1.7-fold higher PCa mortality rates when compared to the European American (EA) men. Besides the socioeconomic factors, emerging evidence has highlighted that biological risk factors may play critical roles in the AA PCa disparities. Previously, we have shown that downregulated miR-99b-5p and upregulated mTOR cooperatively promotes the AA PCa aggressiveness and drug resistance.In this study, we aimed to explore the miR-99b-5p/mTOR/AR/SMARCD1 signaling axis in AA PCa aggressiveness. The analyses used in the study included immunofluorescence, western blot,in-vitrofunctional assays (TUNEL, colony forming, and MTT), and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-qPCR assays in 2D and/or 3D culture model of EA PCa and AA PCa cell lines.Specifically, the immunofluorescence staining, and western blot analysis has revealed that nuclear mTOR, AR, and SMARCD1 were highly expressed in AA PCa (MDA PCa 2b) compared to EA PCa (LNCaP) cell line. Western blot analysis further revealed that miR-99b-5p inhibited protein levels of mTOR, AR/AR-V7 and SMARCD1 in cytoplasm and nuclei of EA and AA PCa. The in-vitro functional (MTT, TUNEL, and clonogenic) assays have demonstrated that miR-99b-5p effectively inhibited cell proliferation/survival and induced cell apoptosis in EA and AA PCa cells. Moreover, combination of miR-99b-5p and enzalutamide (Enz) synergistically enhances the cytotoxicity against aggressive AA PCa and castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). mTOR ChIP-qPCR assays further demonstrated that miR-99b-5p or miR-99b-5p/Enz significantly reduces the recruitment of mTOR to the genes involved in the metabolic reprogramming in CRPC.Taken together, miR-99b-5p may function as an epigenomic driver to modulate the mTOR/AR/SMARCD1 signaling axis in AA PCa and resistant CRPC.Copyright © 2023 Waseem, Gujrati and Wang.",5.65E-92
,38097926,Transcriptome-wide N(6)-methyladenosine methylation profile of atherosclerosis in mice.,BMC Genomics,"Atherosclerosis (AS) is a critical pathological event during the progression of cardiovascular diseases. It exhibits fibrofatty lesions on the arterial wall and lacks effective treatment. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most common modification of eukaryotic RNA and plays an important role in regulating the development and progression of cardiovascular diseases. However, the role of m6A modification in AS remains largely unknown. Therefore, in this study, we explored the transcriptome distribution of m6A modification in AS and its potential mechanism.Methylation Quantification Kit was used to detect the global m6A levels in the aorta of AS mice. Western blot was used to analyze the protein level of methyltransferases. Methylated RNA immunoprecipitation with next-generation sequencing (MeRIP-seq) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) were used to obtain the first transcriptome range analysis of the m6A methylene map in the aorta of AS mice, followed by bioinformatics analysis. qRT-PCR and MeRIP-qRT-PCR were used to measure the mRNA and m6A levels in target genes.The global m6A and protein levels of methyltransferase METTL3 were significantly increased in the aorta of AS mice. However, the protein level of demethylase ALKBH5 was significantly decreased. Through MeRIP-seq, we obtained m6A methylation maps in AS and control mice. In total, 26,918 m6A peaks associated with 13,744 genes were detected in AS group, whereas 26,157 m6A peaks associated with 13,283 genes were detected in the control group. Peaks mainly appeared in the coding sequence (CDS) regions close to the stop codon with the RRACH motif. Moreover, functional enrichment analysis demonstrated that m6A-containing genes were significantly enriched in AS-relevant pathways. Interestingly, a negative correlation between m6A methylation abundance and gene expression level was found through the integrated analysis of MeRIP-seq and RNA-seq data. Among the m6A-modified genes, a hypo-methylated but up-regulated (hypo-up) gene Fabp5 may be a potential biomarker of AS.Our study provides transcriptome-wide m6A methylation for the first time to determine the association between m6A modification and AS progression. Our study lays a foundation for further exploring the pathogenesis of AS and provides a new direction for the treatment of AS.© 2023. The Author(s).",2.11E-92
,38132140,Integrated Analysis of lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA Regulatory Network in Rapamycin-Induced Cardioprotection against Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury in Diabetic Rabbits.,Cells,"The inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) with rapamycin (RAPA) provides protection against myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in diabetes. Since interactions between transcripts, including long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), microRNA(miRNA) and mRNA, regulate the pathophysiology of disease, we performed unbiased miRarray profiling in the heart of diabetic rabbits following I/R injury with/without RAPA treatment to identify differentially expressed (DE) miRNAs and their predicted targets of lncRNAs/mRNAs. Results showed that among the total of 806 unique miRNAs targets, 194 miRNAs were DE after I/R in diabetic rabbits. Specifically, eight miRNAs, including miR-199a-5p, miR-154-5p, miR-543-3p, miR-379-3p, miR-379-5p, miR-299-5p, miR-140-3p, and miR-497-5p, were upregulated and 10 miRNAs, including miR-1-3p, miR-1b, miR-29b-3p, miR-29c-3p, miR-30e-3p, miR-133c, miR-196c-3p, miR-322-5p, miR-499-5p, and miR-672-5p, were significantly downregulated after I/R injury. Interestingly, RAPA treatment significantly reversed these changes in miRNAs. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis indicated the participation of miRNAs in the regulation of several signaling pathways related to I/R injury, including MAPK signaling and apoptosis. Furthermore, in diabetic hearts, the expression of lncRNAs, HOTAIR, and GAS5 were induced after I/R injury, but RAPA suppressed these lncRNAs. In contrast, MALAT1 was significantly reduced following I/R injury, with the increased expression of miR-199a-5p and suppression of its target, the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. RAPA recovered MALAT1 expression with its sponging effect on miR-199-5p and restoration of Bcl-2 expression. The identification of novel targets from the transcriptome analysis in RAPA-treated diabetic hearts could potentially lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies for diabetic patients with myocardial infarction.",1.23E-100
,38004113,Plant-Derived Epi-Nutraceuticals as Potential Broad-Spectrum Anti-Viral Agents.,Nutrients,"Although the COVID-19 pandemic appears to be diminishing, the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants represents a threat to humans due to their inherent transmissibility, immunological evasion, virulence, and invulnerability to existing therapies. The COVID-19 pandemic affected more than 500 million people and caused over 6 million deaths. Vaccines are essential, but in circumstances in which vaccination is not accessible or in individuals with compromised immune systems, drugs can provide additional protection. Targeting host signaling pathways is recommended due to their genomic stability and resistance barriers. Moreover, targeting host factors allows us to develop compounds that are effective against different viral variants as well as against newly emerging virus strains. In recent years, the globe has experienced climate change, which may contribute to the emergence and spread of infectious diseases through a variety of factors. Warmer temperatures and changing precipitation patterns can increase the geographic range of disease-carrying vectors, increasing the risk of diseases spreading to new areas. Climate change may also affect vector behavior, leading to a longer breeding season and more breeding sites for disease vectors. Climate change may also disrupt ecosystems, bringing humans closer to wildlife that transmits zoonotic diseases. All the above factors may accelerate the emergence of new viral epidemics. Plant-derived products, which have been used in traditional medicine for treating pathological conditions, offer structurally novel therapeutic compounds, including those with anti-viral activity. In addition, plant-derived bioactive substances might serve as the ideal basis for developing sustainable/efficient/cost-effective anti-viral alternatives. Interest in herbal antiviral products has increased. More than 50% of approved drugs originate from herbal sources. Plant-derived compounds offer diverse structures and bioactive molecules that are candidates for new drug development. Combining these therapies with conventional drugs could improve patient outcomes. Epigenetics modifications in the genome can affect gene expression without altering DNA sequences. Host cells can use epigenetic gene regulation as a mechanism to silence incoming viral DNA molecules, while viruses recruit cellular epitranscriptomic (covalent modifications of RNAs) modifiers to increase the translational efficiency and transcript stability of viral transcripts to enhance viral gene expression and replication. Moreover, viruses manipulate host cells' epigenetic machinery to ensure productive viral infections. Environmental factors, such as natural products, may influence epigenetic modifications. In this review, we explore the potential of plant-derived substances as epigenetic modifiers for broad-spectrum anti-viral activity, reviewing their modulation processes and anti-viral effects on DNA and RNA viruses, as well as addressing future research objectives in this rapidly emerging field.",2.69E-110
,38037549,The suppressive efficacy of THZ1 depends on KRAS mutation subtype and is associated with super-enhancer activity and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalling in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma: A hypothesis-generating study.,Clin Transl Med,"Inhibition of CDK7, a potent transcription regulator, may bring new hope for treating pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), which is featured by large genetic heterogeneity and abundant KRAS mutations. This investigation aimed at exploring the discrepant efficacies of THZ1, a small-molecule covalent CDK7 inhibitor, on PDACs with different KRAS mutations and the underlying mechanisms.Associations of CDK7 expression with survival by KRAS mutations were first assessed. Effects of THZ1 on PDAC by different KRAS mutations were then investigated in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, the effects of THZ1 on gene transcription and phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II (RNAPOLII) in different KRAS mutant PDACs were assessed, and the effect of THZ1 on super-enhancer activity was evaluated using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing. Lastly, the effects of THZ1 on the binding of H3K27ac to PIK3CA and on the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalling were analysed.High CDK7 expression was significantly linked to worse survival within PDAC patients carrying KRAS-G12V mutation but not in those with KRAS-G12D mutation. The apoptosis-inducing effect of THZ1 was markedly stronger in KRAS-G12V PDAC than KRAS-G12D cancer. THZ1 significantly inhibited the growth of xenograft tumour with KRAS-G12V mutation, and the inhibition was markedly stronger than for KRAS-G12D tumour. In mini-cell-derived xenograft (CDX) models, THZ1 significantly suppressed KRAS-G12V PDAC but not KRAS-G12D cancer. THZ1 significantly suppressed the phosphorylation of RNAPOLII, and this effect was stronger in KRAS-G12V PDAC (especially at ser5). KRAS-G12V PDAC had more H3K27ac-binding super-enhancers, and the inhibition of THZ1 on super-enhancer activity was also stronger in KRAS-G12V PDAC. Furthermore, THZ1 significantly weakened the binding of H3K27ac to PIK3CA in KRAS-G12V PDAC. THZ1 significantly suppressed the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and its downstream markers, and this effect was stronger in KRAS-G12V cells.In this hypothesis-generating study, THZ1 might selectively inhibit certain PDACs with KRAS-G12V mutation more potently compared with some other PDACs with KRAS-G12D mutation, which might be associated with its effect on super-enhancer activity and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalling. Our findings might offer novel key clues for the precise management of PDAC and important evidence for future targeted trial design.THZ1 had a stronger effect on PDAC-bearing KRAS-G12V mutation than G12D mutation. Suppressive effect of THZ1 on phosphorylation of RNAPOLII was stronger in KRAS-G12V than KRAS-G12D PDAC. Inhibition of THZ1 on super-enhancer activity and H3K27ac binding to PIK3CA was stronger in KRAS-G12V PDAC. Suppressive effect of THZ1 on PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway was stronger in KRAS-G12V PDAC.© 2023 The Authors.
