,38113735,DNA methylation aging signatures of multiple metals exposure and their mediation effects in metal-associated mortality: Evidence from the Dongfeng-Tongji cohort study.,J Hazard Mater,"Humans were exposed to multiple metals, but the impact of metals on DNA methylation-age (DNAm-age), a well-recognized aging measure, remains inconclusive. This study included 2942 participants from the Dongfeng-Tongji cohort. We detected their plasma concentrations of 23 metals and determined their genome-wide DNA methylation using the Illumina Human-MethylationEPIC BeadChip. Five DNAm-age acceleration indexes (DAIs), including HannumAge-Accel, HorvathAge-Accel, PhenoAge-Accel, GrimAge-Accel (residual from regressing corresponding DNAm-age on chronological age) and DNAm-mortality score (DNAm-MS), were separately calculated. We found that each 1-unit increase in ln-transformed copper (Cu) was associated with a separate 1.02-, 0.83- and 0.07-unit increase in PhenoAge-Accel, GrimAge-Accel, and DNAm-MS (all FDR<0.05). Each 1-unit increase in ln-transformed nickel (Ni) was associated with a 0.34-year increase in PhenoAge-Accel, while each 1-unit increase in ln-transformed strontium (Sr) was associated with a 0.05-unit increase in DNAm-MS. The Cu, Ni and Sr showed joint positive effects on above three DAIs. PhenoAge-Accel, GrimAge-Accel, and DNAm-MS mediated a separate 6.5%, 12.3%, 6.0% of the positive association between Cu and all-cause mortality; GrimAge-Accel mediated 14.3% of the inverse association of selenium with all-cause mortality. Our findings revealed the effects of Cu, Ni, Sr and their co-exposure on accelerated aging and highlighted mediation roles of DNAm-age on metal-associated mortality.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

*,38105971,"An epigenome-wide analysis of DNA methylation, racialized and economic inequities, and air pollution.",bioRxiv,"DNA methylation (DNAm) provides a plausible mechanism by which adverse exposures become embodied and contribute to health inequities, due to its role in genome regulation and responsiveness to social and biophysical exposures tied to societal context. However, scant epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) have included structural and lifecourse measures of exposure, especially in relation to structural discrimination.Our study tests the hypothesis that DNAm is a mechanism by which racial discrimination, economic adversity, and air pollution become biologically embodied.A series of cross-sectional EWAS, conducted in My Body My Story (MBMS, biological specimens collected 2008-2010, DNAm assayed in 2021); and the Multi Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA; biological specimens collected 2010-2012, DNAm assayed in 2012-2013); using new georeferenced social exposure data for both studies (generated in 2022).MBMS was recruited from four community health centers in Boston; MESA was recruited from four field sites in: Baltimore, MD; Forsyth County, NC; New York City, NY; and St. Paul, MN.Two population-based samples of US-born Black non-Hispanic (Black NH), white non-Hispanic (white NH), and Hispanic individuals (MBMS; n=224 Black NH and 69 white NH) and (MESA; n=229 Black NH, n=555 white NH and n=191 Hispanic).Eight social exposures encompassing racial discrimination, economic adversity, and air pollution.Genome-wide changes in DNAm, as measured using the Illumina EPIC BeadChip (MBMS; using frozen blood spots) and Illumina 450k BeadChip (MESA; using purified monocytes). Our hypothesis was formulated after data collection.We observed the strongest associations with traffic-related air pollution (measured via black carbon and nitrogen oxides exposure), with evidence from both studies suggesting that air pollution exposure may induce epigenetic changes related to inflammatory processes. We also found suggestive associations of DNAm variation with measures of structural racial discrimination (e.g., for Black NH participants, born in a Jim Crow state; adult exposure to racialized economic residential segregation) situated in genes with plausible links to effects on health.Overall, this work suggests that DNAm is a biological mechanism through which structural racism and air pollution become embodied and may lead to health inequities."

Differential DNA methylation may provide a mechanistic understanding of these long-term associations. We aimed to quantify the associations of MEA with offspring DNA methylation levels at birth, in childhood and in adolescence. Using 37 studies from high-income countries, we performed meta-analysis of epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) to quantify the associations of completed years of MEA at the time of pregnancy with offspring DNA methylation levels at birth (n = 9 881), in childhood (n = 2 017), and adolescence (n = 2 740), adjusting for relevant covariates. MEA was found to be associated with DNA methylation at 473 cytosine-phosphate-guanine sites at birth, one in childhood, and four in adolescence. We observed enrichment for findings from previous EWAS on maternal folate, vitamin-B12concentrations, maternal smoking, and pre-pregnancy BMI. The associations were directionally consistent with MEA being inversely associated with behaviours including smoking and BMI. Our findings form a bridge between socio-economic factors and biology and highlight potential pathways underlying effects of maternal education. The results broaden our understanding of bio-social associations linked to differential DNA methylation in multiple early stages of life. The data generated also offers an important resource to help a more precise understanding of the social determinants of health.© 2023. The Author(s)."
,37935791,Trans-ancestry epigenome-wide association meta-analysis of DNA methylation with lifetime cannabis use.,Mol Psychiatry,"Cannabis is widely used worldwide, yet its links to health outcomes are not fully understood. DNA methylation can serve as a mediator to link environmental exposures to health outcomes. We conducted an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of peripheral blood-based DNA methylation and lifetime cannabis use (ever vs. never) in a meta-analysis including 9436 participants (7795 European and 1641 African ancestry) from seven cohorts. Accounting for effects of cigarette smoking, our trans-ancestry EWAS meta-analysis revealed four CpG sites significantly associated with lifetime cannabis use at a false discovery rate of 0.05 [Formula: see text]: cg22572071 near gene ADGRF1, cg15280358 in ADAM12, cg00813162 in ACTN1, and cg01101459 near LINC01132. Additionally, our EWAS analysis in participants who never smoked cigarettes identified another epigenome-wide significant CpG site, cg14237301 annotated to APOBR. We used a leave-one-out approach to evaluate methylation scores constructed as a weighted sum of the significant CpGs. The best model can explain 3.79% of the variance in lifetime cannabis use. These findings unravel the DNA methylation changes associated with lifetime cannabis use that are independent of cigarette smoking and may serve as a starting point for further research on the mechanisms through which cannabis exposure impacts health outcomes.© 2023.

We conducted an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of CpG methylation and progression to high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN2 +) following an abnormal screening test.A prospective US cohort of 289 colposcopy patients with normal or CIN1 enrollment histology was assessed. Baseline cervical sample DNA was analyzed using Illumina HumanMethylation 450K (n = 76) or EPIC 850K (n = 213) arrays. Participants returned at provider-recommended intervals and were followed up to 5 years via medical records. We assessed continuous CpG M values for 9 cervical cancer-associated genes and time-to-progression to CIN2+. We estimated CpG-specific time-to-event ratios (TTER) and hazard ratios using adjusted, interval-censored Weibull accelerated failure time models. We also conducted an exploratory EWAS to identify novel CpGs with false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05.At enrollment, median age was 29.2 years; 64.0% were high-risk HPV-positive, and 54.3% were non-white. During follow-up (median 24.4 months), 15 participants progressed to CIN2+. Greater methylation levels were associated with a shorter time-to-CIN2+ for CADM1 cg03505501 (TTER = 0.28; 95%CI 0.12, 0.63; FDR = 0.03) and RARB Cluster 1 (TTER = 0.46; 95% CI 0.29, 0.71; FDR = 0.01). There was evidence of similar trends for DAPK1 cg14286732, PAX1 cg07213060, and PAX1 Cluster 1. The EWAS detected 336 novel progression-associated CpGs, including those located in CpG islands associated with genes FGF22, TOX, COL18A1, GPM6A, XAB2, TIMP2, GSPT1, NR4A2, and APBB1IP.Using prospective time-to-event data, we detected associations between CADM1-, DAPK1-, PAX1-, and RARB-related CpGs and cervical disease progression, and we identified novel progression-associated CpGs.Methylation levels at novel CpG sites may help identify individuals with ≤CIN1 histology at higher risk of progression to CIN2+ and inform risk-based cervical cancer screening guidelines.© 2023.

,38133959,Arsenic Exposure and Epigenetic Aging: The Association with Cardiovascular Disease and All-Cause Mortality in the Strong Heart Study.,Environ Health Perspect,"Inorganic arsenic (As) may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and all-cause mortality through accelerated aging, which can be estimated using epigenetic-based measures.We evaluated three DNA methylation-based aging measures (PhenoAge, GrimAge, DunedinPACE) (epigenetic aging measures) as potential mediators of the previously reported association of As exposure with CVD incidence, CVD mortality, and all-cause mortality in the Strong Heart Study (SHS), an epidemiological cohort of American Indian adults.Blood DNA methylation and urinary As levels were measured in 2,323 SHS participants (41.5% men, mean age of 55 years old). PhenoAge and GrimAge values were calculated using a residual-based method. We tested the association of urinary As with epigenetic aging measures using linear regression, the association of epigenetic aging measures with the three health outcomes using additive hazards models, and the mediation of As-related CVD incidence, CVD mortality, and all-cause mortality by epigenetic aging measures using the product of coefficients method.SHS participants with higher vs. lower urinary As levels had similar PhenoAge age, older GrimAge age, and faster DunedinPACE. An interquartile range increase in urinary As was associated with higher of PhenoAge age acceleration [mean difference (95% confidence interval)=0.48(0.17, 0.80) years], GrimAge age acceleration [0.80 (0.60, 1.00) years], and DunedinPACE [0.011 (0.005, 0.018)], after adjusting for age, sex, center location, genetic components, smoking status, and body mass index. Of the 347 incident CVD events per 100,000 person-years associated with a doubling in As exposure, 21.3% (9.1, 57.1) and 22.6% (9.5, 56.9), were attributable to differences in GrimAge and DunedinPACE, respectively.Arsenic exposure was associated with older GrimAge and faster DunedinPACE measures of biological age. Furthermore, accelerated biological aging measured from DNA methylation accounted for a relevant fraction of As-associated risk for CVD, CVD mortality, and all-cause mortality in the SHS, supporting the role of As in accelerated aging. Research of the biological underpinnings can contribute to a better understanding of the role of aging in arsenic-related disease. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP11981."
*,38019517,Racial and Ethnic Residential Segregation and Monocyte DNA Methylation Age Acceleration.,JAMA Netw Open,"Neighborhood segregation and poverty may be important drivers of health inequities. Epigenomic factors, including DNA methylation clocks that may mark underlying biological aging, have been implicated in the link between social factors and health.To examine the associations of neighborhood segregation and poverty with 4 DNA methylation clocks trained to capture either chronological age or physiological dysregulation.This cohort study uses data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), a longitudinal study that started in 2000 to 2002, with follow-up in 2002 to 2004, 2004 to 2005, 2005 to 2007, and 2010 to 2012. In 2000 to 2002, adults who identified as White or Black race or Hispanic or Chinese ethnicity in 6 US sites (Baltimore, Maryland; Chicago, Illinois; Forsyth County, North Carolina; Los Angeles County, California; Northern Manhattan, New York; and St. Paul, Minnesota) were sampled for recruitment. A random subsample of 4 sites (Maryland, North Carolina, New York, and Minnesota) were selected for inclusion in the MESA epigenomics ancillary study at examination 5 (2010-2012). Participants who identified as White or Black race or Hispanic ethnicity, were aged 45 to 84 years, and did not have clinical cardiovascular disease were included in this analysis. Data were analyzed from May 2021 to October 2023.Information on 2000 census tract poverty and Getis-Ord G statistic segregation of Hispanic residents, non-Hispanic Black residents, or non-Hispanic White residents were linked to participant addresses at examination 1 (2000-2002).At examination 5, DNA methylation was measured in purified monocytes. DNA methylation age acceleration was calculated using 4 clocks trained on either chronological age or physiological dysregulation. Linear regressions were used to test associations.A total of 1102 participants (mean [SD] age, 69.7 [9.4] years; 562 [51%] women) were included, with 348 Hispanic participants, 222 non-Hispanic Black participants, and 533 non-Hispanic White participants. For non-Hispanic Black participants, living in tracts with greater segregation of Black residents was associated with GrimAge DNA methylation age acceleration, a clock designed to capture physiological dysregulation. A 1-SD increase in segregation was associated with 0.42 (95% CI, 0.20-0.64) years age acceleration (P < .001); this association was not observed with other clocks. This association was particularly pronounced for participants living in high poverty tracts (interaction term, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.07-0.42; P = .006). In the overall sample, census tract poverty level was associated with GrimAge DNA methylation age acceleration (β = 0.45; 95% CI, 0.20-0.71; adjusted P = .005).These findings suggest that epigenomic mechanisms may play a role in the associations of segregated and poor neighborhoods with chronic conditions."
,37968697,Circulating metabolites may illustrate relationship of alcohol consumption with cardiovascular disease.,BMC Med,"Metabolite signatures of long-term alcohol consumption are lacking. To better understand the molecular basis linking alcohol drinking and cardiovascular disease (CVD), we investigated circulating metabolites associated with long-term alcohol consumption and examined whether these metabolites were associated with incident CVD.Cumulative average alcohol consumption (g/day) was derived from the total consumption of beer, wine, and liquor on average of 19 years in 2428 Framingham Heart Study Offspring participants (mean age 56 years, 52% women). We used linear mixed models to investigate the associations of alcohol consumption with 211 log-transformed plasma metabolites, adjusting for age, sex, batch, smoking, diet, physical activity, BMI, and familial relationship. Cox models were used to test the association of alcohol-related metabolite scores with fatal and nonfatal incident CVD (myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease, stroke, and heart failure).We identified 60 metabolites associated with cumulative average alcohol consumption (p < 0.05/211 ≈ 0.00024). For example, 1 g/day increase of alcohol consumption was associated with higher levels of cholesteryl esters (e.g., CE 16:1, beta = 0.023 ± 0.002, p = 6.3e - 45) and phosphatidylcholine (e.g., PC 32:1, beta = 0.021 ± 0.002, p = 3.1e - 38). Survival analysis identified that 10 alcohol-associated metabolites were also associated with a differential CVD risk after adjusting for age, sex, and batch. Further, we built two alcohol consumption weighted metabolite scores using these 10 metabolites and showed that, with adjustment age, sex, batch, and common CVD risk factors, the two scores had comparable but opposite associations with incident CVD, hazard ratio 1.11 (95% CI = [1.02, 1.21], p = 0.02) vs 0.88 (95% CI = [0.78, 0.98], p = 0.02).We identified 60 long-term alcohol consumption-associated metabolites. The association analysis with incident CVD suggests a complex metabolic basis between alcohol consumption and CVD.© 2023. The Author(s)."
,37950287,DNA methylation sites in early adulthood characterised by pubertal timing and development: a twin study.,Clin Epigenetics,"Puberty is a highly heritable and variable trait, with environmental factors having a role in its eventual timing and development. Early and late pubertal onset are both associated with various diseases developing later in life, and epigenetic characterisation of pubertal timing and development could lead to important insights. Blood DNA methylation, reacting to both genotype and environment, has been associated with puberty; however, such studies are relatively scarce. We investigated peripheral blood DNA methylation profiles (using Illumina 450 K and EPIC platforms) of 1539 young adult Finnish twins associated with pubertal development scale (PDS) at ages 12 and 14 as well as pubertal age (PA).Fixed effect meta-analysis of the two platforms on 347,521 CpGs in common identified 58 CpG sites associated (p < 1 × 10-5) with either PDS or PA. All four CpGs associated with PA and 45 CpGs associated with PDS were sex-specific. Thirteen CpGs had a high heritability (h2: 0.51-0.98), while one CpG site (mapped to GET4) had a high shared environmental component accounting for 68% of the overall variance in methylation at the site. Utilising twin discordance analysis, we found 6 CpG sites (5 associated with PDS and 1 with PA) that had an environmentally driven association with puberty. Furthermore, genes with PDS- or PA-associated CpGs were consistently linked to various developmental processes and diseases such as breast, prostate and ovarian cancer, while methylation quantitative trait loci of associated CpG sites were enriched in immune pathways developing during puberty.By identifying puberty-associated DNA methylation sites and examining the effects of sex, environment and genetics, we shed light on the intricate interplay between environment and genetics in the context of puberty. Through our comprehensive analysis, we not only deepen the understanding of the significance of both genetic and environmental factors in the complex processes of puberty and its timing, but also gain insights into potential links with disease risks.© 2023.

,38041176,DNA methylation profiles reveal sex-specific associations between gestational exposure to ambient air pollution and placenta cell-type composition in the PRISM cohort study.,Clin Epigenetics,"Gestational exposure to ambient air pollution has been associated with adverse health outcomes for mothers and newborns. The placenta is a central regulator of the in utero environment that orchestrates development and postnatal life via fetal programming. Ambient air pollution contaminants can reach the placenta and have been shown to alter bulk placental tissue DNA methylation patterns. Yet the effect of air pollution on placental cell-type composition has not been examined. We aimed to investigate whether the exposure to ambient air pollution during gestation is associated with placental cell types inferred from DNA methylation profiles.We leveraged data from 226 mother-infant pairs in the Programming of Intergenerational Stress Mechanisms (PRISM) longitudinal cohort in the Northeastern US. Daily concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) at 1 km spatial resolution were estimated from a spatiotemporal model developed with satellite data and linked to womens' addresses during pregnancy and infants' date of birth. The proportions of six cell types [syncytiotrophoblasts, trophoblasts, stromal, endothelial, Hofbauer and nucleated red blood cells (nRBCs)] were derived from placental tissue 450K DNA methylation array. We applied compositional regression to examine overall changes in placenta cell-type composition related to PM2.5average by pregnancy trimester. We also investigated the association between PM2.5and individual cell types using beta regression. All analyses were performed in the overall sample and stratified by infant sex adjusted for covariates.In male infants, first trimester (T1) PM2.5was associated with changes in placental cell composition (p = 0.03), driven by a decrease [per one PM2.5interquartile range (IQR)] of 0.037 in the syncytiotrophoblasts proportion (95% confidence interval (CI) [- 0.066, - 0.012]), accompanied by an increase in trophoblasts of 0.033 (95% CI: [0.009, 0.064]). In females, second and third trimester PM2.5were associated with overall changes in placental cell-type composition (T2: p = 0.040; T3: p = 0.049), with a decrease in the nRBC proportion. Individual cell-type analysis with beta regression showed similar results with an additional association found for third trimester PM2.5and stromal cells in females (decrease of 0.054, p = 0.024).Gestational exposure to air pollution was associated with placenta cell composition. Further research is needed to corroborate these findings and evaluate their role in PM2.5-related impact in the placenta and consequent fetal programming.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Peripheral blood DNA methylation may be associated with liver cancer and could be used as a biomarker for cancer risk. We evaluated the association of blood DNA methylation with risk of liver cancer.We conducted a prospective cohort study in 2324 American Indians, between age 45 and 75 years, from Arizona, Oklahoma, North Dakota and South Dakota who participated in the Strong Heart Study between 1989 and 1991. Liver cancer deaths (n = 21) were ascertained using death certificates obtained through 2017. The mean follow-up duration (SD) for non-cases was 25.1 (5.6) years and for cases, 11.0 (8.8) years. DNA methylation was assessed from blood samples collected at baseline using MethylationEPIC BeadChip 850 K arrays. We used Cox regression models adjusted for age, sex, center, body mass index, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, smoking, alcohol consumption, and immune cell proportions to examine the associations.We identified 9 CpG sites associated with liver cancer. cg16057201 annotated to MRFAP1) was hypermethylated among cases vs. non-cases (hazard ratio (HR) for one standard deviation increase in methylation was 1.25 (95% CI 1.14, 1.37).

*,38053194,Integration of datasets for individual prediction of DNA methylation-based biomarkers.,Genome Biol,"Epigenetic scores (EpiScores) can provide biomarkers of lifestyle and disease risk. Projecting new datasets onto a reference panel is challenging due to separation of technical and biological variation with array data. Normalisation can standardise data distributions but may also remove population-level biological variation.We compare two birth cohorts (Lothian Birth Cohorts of 1921 and 1936 - nLBC1921= 387 and nLBC1936= 498) with blood-based DNA methylation assessed at the same chronological age (79 years) and processed in the same lab but in different years and experimental batches. We examine the effect of 16 normalisation methods on a novel BMI EpiScore (trained in an external cohort, n = 18,413), and Horvath's pan-tissue DNA methylation age, when the cohorts are normalised separately and together. The BMI EpiScore explains a maximum variance of R2=24.5% in BMI in LBC1936 (SWAN normalisation). Although there are cross-cohort R2differences, the normalisation method makes a minimal difference to within-cohort estimates. Conversely, a range of absolute differences are seen for individual-level EpiScore estimates for BMI and age when cohorts are normalised separately versus together. While within-array methods result in identical EpiScores whether a cohort is normalised on its own or together with the second dataset, a range of differences is observed for between-array methods.Normalisation methods returning similar EpiScores, whether cohorts are analysed separately or together, will minimise technical variation when projecting new data onto a reference panel. These methods are important for cases where raw data is unavailable and joint normalisation of cohorts is computationally expensive.© 2023. The Author(s)."

In this study, we explored the epigenetic landscape of diabetes using data from the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study (KoGES), specifically the Ansung-Ansan (AS-AS) cohort. Using epigenome-wide association studies, we investigated DNA methylation patterns in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and those with normal glucose regulation. Differential methylation analysis revealed 106 differentially methylated probes (DMPs), with the 10 top DMPs prominently associated with TXNIP, PDK4, NBPF20, ARRDC4, UFM1, PFKFB2, C7orf50, and ABCG1, indicating significant changes in methylation. Correlation analysis highlighted the association between the leading DMPs (e.g., cg19693031 and cg26974062 for TXNIP and cg26823705 for NBPF20) and key glycemic markers (fasting plasma glucose and hemoglobin A1c), confirming their relevance in T2DM. Moreover, we identified 62 significantly differentially methylated regions (DMRs) spanning 61 genes. A DMR associated with PDE1C showed hypermethylation, whereas DMRs associated with DIP2C, FLJ90757, PRSS50, and TDRD9 showed hypomethylation. PDE1C and TDRD9 showed a strong positive correlation between the CpG sites included in each DMR, which have previously been implicated in T2DM-related processes. This study contributes to the understanding of epigenetic modifications in T2DM. These valuable insights can be utilized in identifying potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for effective management and prevention of diabetes."
,38048101,Linking Prenatal Environmental Exposures to Lifetime Health with Epigenome-Wide Association Studies: State-of-the-Science Review and Future Recommendations.,Environ Health Perspect,"The prenatal environment influences lifetime health; epigenetic mechanisms likely predominate. In 2016, the first international consortium paper on cigarette smoking during pregnancy and offspring DNA methylation identified extensive, reproducible exposure signals. This finding raised expectations for epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) of other exposures.We review the current state-of-the-science for DNA methylation associations across prenatal exposures in humans and provide future recommendations.We reviewed 134 prenatal environmental EWAS of DNA methylation in newborns, focusing on 51 epidemiological studies with meta-analysis or replication testing. Exposures spanned cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, air pollution, dietary factors, psychosocial stress, metals, other chemicals, and other exogenous factors. Of the reproducible DNA methylation signatures, we examined implementation as exposure biomarkers.Only 19 (14%) of these prenatal EWAS were conducted in cohorts of 1,000 or more individuals, reflecting the still early stage of the field. To date, the largest perinatal EWAS sample size was 6,685 participants. For comparison, the most recent genome-wide association study for birth weight included more than 300,000 individuals. Replication, at some level, was successful with exposures to cigarette smoking, folate, dietary glycemic index, particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter<10μmand<2.5μm, nitrogen dioxide, mercury, cadmium, arsenic, electronic waste, PFAS, and DDT. Reproducible effects of a more limited set of prenatal exposures (smoking, folate) enabled robust methylation biomarker creation.Current evidence demonstrates the scientific premise for reproducible DNA methylation exposure signatures. Better powered EWAS could identify signatures across many exposures and enable comprehensive biomarker development. Whether methylation biomarkers of exposures themselves cause health effects remains unclear. We expect that larger EWAS with enhanced coverage of epigenome and exposome, along with improved single-cell technologies and evolving methods for integrative multi-omics analyses and causal inference, will expand mechanistic understanding of causal links between environmental exposures, the epigenome, and health outcomes throughout the life course. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP12956."
,37992405,Examination of newborn DNA methylation among women with polycystic ovary syndrome/hirsutism.,Epigenetics,"Research suggests that polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) traits (e.g., hyperandrogenism) may create a suboptimal intrauterine environment and induce epigenetic modifications. Therefore, we assessed the associations of PCOS traits with neonatal DNA methylation (DNAm) using two independent cohorts. DNAm was measured in both cohorts using the Infinium MethylationEPIC array. Multivariable robust linear regression was used to determine associations of maternal PCOS exposure or preconception testosterone with methylation β-values at each CpG probe and corrected for multiple testing by false-discovery rate (FDR). In the birth cohort, 12% (102/849) had a PCOS diagnosis (8.1% PCOS without hirsutism; 3.9% PCOS with hirsutism). Infants exposed to maternal PCOS with hirsutism compared to no PCOS had differential DNAm at cg02372539 [β(SE): -0.080 (0.010); FDRp = 0.009], cg08471713 [β(SE):0.077 (0.014); FDRp = 0.016] and cg17897916 [β(SE):0.050 (0.009); FDRp = 0.009] with adjustment for maternal characteristics including pre-pregnancy BMI. PCOS with hirsutism was also associated with 8 differentially methylated regions (DMRs). PCOS without hirsutism was not associated with individual CpGs. In an independent preconception cohort, total testosterone concentrations were associated with 3 DMRs but not with individual CpGs, though the top quartile of testosterone compared to the lowest was marginally associated with increased DNAm at cg21472377 near an uncharacterized locus (FDRp = 0.09). Examination of these probes and DMRs indicate they may be under foetal genetic control. Overall, we found several associations among newborns exposed to PCOS, specifically when hirsutism was reported, and among newborns of women with relatively higher testosterone around conception."
,37995466,Cord blood DNA methylation signatures associated with preeclampsia are enriched for cardiovascular pathways: insights from the VDAART trial.,EBioMedicine,"Preeclampsia has been associated with maternal epigenetic changes, in particular DNA methylation changes in the placenta. It has been suggested that preeclampsia could also cause DNA methylation changes in the neonate. We examined DNA methylation in relation to gene expression in the cord blood of offspring born to mothers with preeclampsia.This study included 128 mother-child pairs who participated in the Vitamin D Antenatal Asthma Reduction Trial (VDAART), where assessment of preeclampsia served as secondary outcome. We performed an epigenome-wide association study of preeclampsia and cord blood DNA methylation (Illumina 450 K chip). We then examined gene expression of the same subjects for validation and replicated the gene signatures in independent DNA methylation datasets. Lastly, we applied functional enrichment and network analyses to identify biological pathways that could potentially be involved in preeclampsia.In the cord blood samples (n = 128), 263 CpGs were differentially methylated (FDR <0.10) in preeclampsia (n = 16), of which 217 were annotated. Top pathways in the functional enrichment analysis included apelin signaling pathway and other endothelial and cardiovascular pathways. Of the 217 genes, 13 showed differential expression (p's < 0.001) in preeclampsia and 11 had been previously related to preeclampsia (p's < 0.0001). These genes were linked to apelin, cGMP and Notch signaling pathways, all having a role in angiogenic process and cardiovascular function.Preeclampsia is related to differential cord blood DNA methylation signatures of cardiovascular pathways, including the apelin signaling pathway. The association of these cord blood DNA methylation signatures with offspring's long-term morbidities due to preeclampsia should be further investigated.VDAART is funded by National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute grants of R01HL091528 and UH3OD023268.

,38012757,A novel approach to risk exposure and epigenetics-the use of multidimensional context to gain insights into the early origins of cardiometabolic and neurocognitive health.,BMC Med,"Each mother-child dyad represents a unique combination of genetic and environmental factors. This constellation of variables impacts the expression of countless genes. Numerous studies have uncovered changes in DNA methylation (DNAm), a form of epigenetic regulation, in offspring related to maternal risk factors. How these changes work together to link maternal-child risks to childhood cardiometabolic and neurocognitive traits remains unknown. This question is a key research priority as such traits predispose to future non-communicable diseases (NCDs). We propose viewing risk and the genome through a multidimensional lens to identify common DNAm patterns shared among diverse risk profiles.We identified multifactorial Maternal Risk Profiles (MRPs) generated from population-based data (n = 15,454, Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC)). Using cord blood HumanMethylation450 BeadChip data, we identified genome-wide patterns of DNAm that co-vary with these MRPs. We tested the prospective relation of these DNAm patterns (n = 914) to future outcomes using decision tree analysis. We then tested the reproducibility of these patterns in (1) DNAm data at age 7 and 17 years within the same cohort (n = 973 and 974, respectively) and (2) cord DNAm in an independent cohort, the Generation R Study (n = 686).We identified twenty MRP-related DNAm patterns at birth in ALSPAC. Four were prospectively related to cardiometabolic and/or neurocognitive childhood outcomes. These patterns were replicated in DNAm data from blood collected at later ages. Three of these patterns were externally validated in cord DNAm data in Generation R. Compared to previous literature, DNAm patterns exhibited novel spatial distribution across the genome that intersects with chromatin functional and tissue-specific signatures.To our knowledge, we are the first to leverage multifactorial population-wide data to detect patterns of variability in DNAm. This context-based approach decreases biases stemming from overreliance on specific samples or variables. We discovered molecular patterns demonstrating prospective and replicable relations to complex traits. Moreover, results suggest that patterns harbour a genome-wide organisation specific to chromatin regulation and target tissues. These preliminary findings warrant further investigation to better reflect the reality of human context in molecular studies of NCDs.© 2023. The Author(s)."

We characterized protein-BMI trajectory associations in adolescents and adults and how these connect to other omics layers.Our study included two cohorts of longitudinally followed twins: FinnTwin12 (N = 651) and the Netherlands Twin Register (NTR) (N = 665). Follow-up comprised 4 BMI measurements over approximately 6 (NTR: 23-27 years old) to 10 years (FinnTwin12: 12-22 years old), with omics data collected at the last BMI measurement. BMI changes were calculated in latent growth curve models. Mixed-effects models were used to quantify the associations between the abundance of 439 plasma proteins with BMI at blood sampling and changes in BMI. In FinnTwin12, the sources of genetic and environmental variation underlying the protein abundances were quantified by twin models, as were the associations of proteins with BMI and BMI changes. In NTR, we investigated the association of gene expression of genes encoding proteins identified in FinnTwin12 with BMI and changes in BMI. We linked identified proteins and their coding genes to plasma metabolites and polygenic risk scores (PRS) applying mixed-effects models and correlation networks.We identified 66 and 14 proteins associated with BMI at blood sampling and changes in BMI, respectively. The average heritability of these proteins was 35%. Of the 66 BMI-protein associations, 43 and 12 showed genetic and environmental correlations, respectively, including 8 proteins showing both. Similarly, we observed 7 and 3 genetic and environmental correlations between changes in BMI and protein abundance, respectively. S100A8 gene expression was associated with BMI at blood sampling, and the PRG4 and CFI genes were associated with BMI changes. Proteins showed strong connections with metabolites and PRSs, but we observed no multi-omics connections among gene expression and other omics layers.Associations between the proteome and BMI trajectories are characterized by shared genetic, environmental, and metabolic etiologies. We observed few gene-protein pairs associated with BMI or changes in BMI at the proteome and transcriptome levels.© 2023. The Author(s)."
,37986811,NMR metabolomic modelling of age and lifespan: a multi-cohort analysis.,medRxiv,"Metabolomic age models have been proposed for the study of biological aging, however they have not been widely validated. We aimed to assess the performance of newly developed and existing nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) metabolomic age models for prediction of chronological age (CA), mortality, and age-related disease. 98 metabolic variables were measured in blood from nine UK and Finnish cohort studies (N ≈ 31,000 individuals, age range 24-86 years). We used non-linear and penalised regression to model CA and time to all-cause mortality. We examined associations of four new and two previously published metabolomic age models, with ageing risk factors and phenotypes. Within the UK Biobank (N≈ 102,000), we tested prediction of CA, incident disease (cardiovascular disease (CVD), type-2 diabetes mellitus, cancer, dementia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and all-cause mortality. Cross-validated Pearson'srbetween metabolomic age models and CA ranged between 0.47-0.65 in the training set (mean absolute error: 8-9 years). Metabolomic age models, adjusted for CA, were associated with C-reactive protein, and inversely associated with glomerular filtration rate. Positively associated risk factors included obesity, diabetes, smoking, and physical inactivity. In UK Biobank, correlations of metabolomic age with chronological age were modest (r= 0.29-0.33), yet all metabolomic model scores predicted mortality (hazard ratios of 1.01 to 1.06 / metabolomic age year) and CVD, after adjustment for CA. While metabolomic age models were only moderately associated with CA in an independent population, they provided additional prediction of morbidity and mortality over CA itself, suggesting their wider applicability."
,38044700,Associations between epigenome-wide DNA methylation and height-related traits among Sub-Saharan Africans: the RODAM study.,J Dev Orig Health Dis,"Human height and related traits are highly complex, and extensively research has shown that these traits are determined by both genetic and environmental factors. Such factors may partially affect these traits through epigenetic programing. Epigenetic programing is dynamic and plays an important role in controlling gene expression and cell differentiation during (early) development. DNA methylation (DNAm) is the most commonly studied epigenetic feature. In this study we conducted an epigenome-wide DNAm association analysis on height-related traits in a Sub-Saharan African population, in order to detect DNAm biomarkers across four height-related traits. DNAm profiles were acquired in whole blood samples of 704 Ghanaians, sourced from the Research on Obesity and Diabetes among African Migrants study, using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. Linear models were fitted to detect differentially methylated positions (DMPs) and regions (DMRs) associated with height, leg-to-height ratio (LHR), leg length, and sitting height. No epigenome-wide significant DMPs were recorded. However we did observe among our top DMPs five informative probes associated with the height-related traits: cg26905768 (leg length), cg13268132 (leg length), cg19776793 (height), cg23072383 (LHR), and cg24625894 (sitting height). All five DMPs are annotated to genes whose functions were linked to bone cell regulation and development. DMR analysis identified overlapping DMRs within the gene body ofHLA-DPB1gene, and theHOXAgene cluster. In this first epigenome-wide association studies of these traits, our findings suggest DNAm associations with height-related heights, and might influence development and maintenance of these traits. Further studies are needed to replicate our findings, and to elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying human height-related traits."
,37932858,Alterations to DNA methylation patterns induced by chemotherapy treatment are associated with negative impacts on the olfactory pathway.,Breast Cancer Res,"Exposure to cytotoxic chemotherapy treatment may alter DNA methylation (DNAm) in breast cancer patients.We performed DNAm analysis in 125 breast cancer patients with blood drawn before and after chemotherapy, using the Illumina MethylationEPIC array. DNAm changes of 588,798 individual CpGs (including 41,207 promoter regions) were evaluated using linear regression models adjusted for monocyte proportion. Gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA) were conducted to identify key Gene Ontology (GO) biological processes or Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways associated with chemotherapy. Results were validated in a separate cohort of breast cancer patients who were treated (n = 1273) and not treated (n = 872) by chemotherapy (1808 blood, 337 saliva).A total of 141 differentially methylated CpGs and 11 promoters were significantly associated with chemotherapy after multiple testing corrections in both the paired sample and single time point analyses. GSEA of promoter regions (pre-ranked by test statistics) identified six suppressed biological processes (p < 4.67e-8) related to sensory perception and detection of chemical stimuli, including smell perception (GO:0007606, GO:0007608, GO:0009593, GO:0050906, GO:0050907, and GO:0050911). The same six biological processes were significantly suppressed in the validation dataset (p < 9.02e-14). The KEGG pathway olfactory transduction (hsa04740) was also found to be significantly suppressed (ppaired-samples = 1.72e-9, psingle-timepoint-blood = 2.03e-15 and psingle-timepoint-saliva = 7.52e-56).The enrichment of imprinted genes within biological processes and pathways suggests a biological mechanism by which chemotherapy could affect the perception of smell.© 2023.

,38062110,Integrated omics analysis of coronary artery calcifications and myocardial infarction: the Framingham Heart Study.,Sci Rep,"Gene function can be described using various measures. We integrated association studies of three types of omics data to provide insights into the pathophysiology of subclinical coronary disease and myocardial infarction (MI). Using multivariable regression models, we associated: (1) single nucleotide polymorphism, (2) DNA methylation, and (3) gene expression with coronary artery calcification (CAC) scores and MI. Among 3106 participants of the Framingham Heart Study, 65 (2.1%) had prevalent MI and 60 (1.9%) had incident MI, median CAC value was 67.8 [IQR 10.8, 274.9], and 1403 (45.2%) had CAC scores > 0 (prevalent CAC). Prevalent CAC was associated with AHRR (linked to smoking) and EXOC3 (affecting platelet function and promoting hemostasis). CAC score was associated with VWA1 (extracellular matrix protein associated with cartilage structure in endomysium). For prevalent MI we identified FYTTD1 (down-regulated in familial hypercholesterolemia) and PINK1 (linked to cardiac tissue homeostasis and ischemia-reperfusion injury). Incident MI was associated with IRX3 (enhancing browning of white adipose tissue) and STXBP3 (controlling trafficking of glucose transporter type 4 to plasma). Using an integrative trans-omics approach, we identified both putatively novel and known candidate genes associated with CAC and MI. Replication of findings is warranted.© 2023. The Author(s)."
,38106096,Somatic mutation as an explanation for epigenetic aging.,bioRxiv,"DNA methylation marks have recently been used to build models known as ""epigenetic clocks"" which predict calendar age. As methylation of cytosine promotes C-to-T mutations, we hypothesized that the methylation changes observed with age should reflect the accrual of somatic mutations, and the two should yield analogous aging estimates. In analysis of multimodal data from 9,331 human individuals, we find that CpG mutations indeed coincide with changes in methylation, not only at the mutated site but also with pervasive remodeling of the methylome out to ±10 kilobases. This one-to-many mapping enables mutation-based predictions of age that agree with epigenetic clocks, including which individuals are aging faster or slower than expected. Moreover, genomic loci where mutations accumulate with age also tend to have methylation patterns that are especially predictive of age. These results suggest a close coupling between the accumulation of sporadic somatic mutations and the widespread changes in methylation observed over the course of life."
*,37925521,A non-invasive method for concurrent detection of multiple early-stage cancers in women.,Sci Rep,"Untargeted serum metabolomics was combined with machine learning-powered data analytics to develop a test for the concurrent detection of multiple cancers in women. A total of fifteen cancers were tested where the resulting metabolome data was sequentially analysed using two separate algorithms. The first algorithm successfully identified all the cancer-positive samples with an overall accuracy of > 99%. This result was particularly significant given that the samples tested were predominantly from early-stage cancers. Samples identified as cancer-positive were next analysed using a multi-class algorithm, which then enabled accurate discernment of the tissue of origin for the individual samples. Integration of serum metabolomics with appropriate data analytical tools, therefore, provides a powerful screening platform for early-stage cancers.© 2023. The Author(s)."
*,38095720,Unraveling phenotypic variance in metabolic syndrome through multi-omics.,Hum Genet,"Complex multi-omics effects drive the clustering of cardiometabolic risk factors, underscoring the imperative to comprehend how individual and combined omics shape phenotypic variation. Our study partitions phenotypic variance in metabolic syndrome (MetS), blood glucose (GLU), triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and blood pressure through genome, transcriptome, metabolome, and exposome (i.e., lifestyle exposome) analyses. Our analysis included a cohort of 62,822 unrelated individuals with white British ancestry, sourced from the UK biobank. We employed linear mixed models to partition phenotypic variance using the restricted maximum likelihood (REML) method, implemented in MTG2 (v2.22). We initiated the analysis by individually modeling omics, followed by subsequent integration of pairwise omics in a joint model that also accounted for the covariance and interaction between omics layers. Finally, we estimated the correlations of various omics effects between the phenotypes using bivariate REML. Significant proportions of the MetS variance were attributed to distinct data sources: genome (9.47%), transcriptome (4.24%), metabolome (14.34%), and exposome (3.77%). The phenotypic variances explained by the genome, transcriptome, metabolome, and exposome ranged from 3.28% for GLU to 25.35% for HDL-C, 0% for GLU to 19.34% for HDL-C, 4.29% for systolic blood pressure (SBP) to 35.75% for TG, and 0.89% for GLU to 10.17% for HDL-C, respectively. Significant correlations were found between genomic and transcriptomic effects for TG and HDL-C. Furthermore, significant interaction effects between omics data were detected for both MetS and its components. Interestingly, significant correlation of omics effect between the phenotypes was found. This study underscores omics' roles, interaction effects, and random-effects covariance in unveiling phenotypic variation in multi-omics domains.© 2023.

,38066556,DNA methylation modulated genetic variant effect on gene transcriptional regulation.,Genome Biol,"Expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis has emerged as an important tool in elucidating the link between genetic variants and gene expression, thereby bridging the gap between risk SNPs and associated diseases. We recently identified and validated a specific case where the methylation of a CpG site influences the relationship between the genetic variant and gene expression.Here, to systematically evaluate this regulatory mechanism, we develop an extended eQTL mapping method, termed DNA methylation modulated eQTL (memo-eQTL). Applying this memo-eQTL mapping method to 128 normal prostate samples enables identification of 1063 memo-eQTLs, the majority of which are not recognized as conventional eQTLs in the same cohort. We observe that the methylation of the memo-eQTL CpG sites can either enhance or insulate the interaction between SNP and gene expression by altering CTCF-based chromatin 3D structure.This study demonstrates the prevalence of memo-eQTLs paving the way to identify novel causal genes for traits or diseases associated with genetic variations.© 2023.

*,37985455,Application of deep learning in cancer epigenetics through DNA methylation analysis.,Brief Bioinform,"DNA methylation is a fundamental epigenetic modification involved in various biological processes and diseases. Analysis of DNA methylation data at a genome-wide and high-throughput level can provide insights into diseases influenced by epigenetics, such as cancer. Recent technological advances have led to the development of high-throughput approaches, such as genome-scale profiling, that allow for computational analysis of epigenetics. Deep learning (DL) methods are essential in facilitating computational studies in epigenetics for DNA methylation analysis. In this systematic review, we assessed the various applications of DL applied to DNA methylation data or multi-omics data to discover cancer biomarkers, perform classification, imputation and survival analysis. The review first introduces state-of-the-art DL architectures and highlights their usefulness in addressing challenges related to cancer epigenetics.

,37967346,A proteomic analysis of atrial fibrillation in a prospective longitudinal cohort (AGES-Reykjavik study).,Europace,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with high risk of comorbidities and mortality. Our aim was to examine causal and predictive relationships between 4137 serum proteins and incident AF in the prospective population-based Age, Gene/Environment Susceptibility-Reykjavik (AGES-Reykjavik) study.The study included 4765 participants, of whom 1172 developed AF. Cox proportional hazards regression models were fitted for 4137 baseline protein measurements adjusting for known risk factors. Protein associations were tested for replication in the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS). Causal relationships were examined in a bidirectional, two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis. The time-dependent area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC)-statistic was examined as protein levels and an AF-polygenic risk score (PRS) were added to clinical risk models. The proteomic signature of incident AF consisted of 76 proteins, of which 63 (83%) were novel and 29 (38%) were replicated in CHS. The signature included both N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP)-dependent (e.g. CHST15, ATP1B1, and SVEP1) and independent components (e.g. ASPN, AKR1B, and LAMA1/LAMB1/LAMC1). Nine causal candidates were identified (TAGLN, WARS, CHST15, CHMP3, COL15A1, DUSP13, MANBA, QSOX2, and SRL). The reverse causal analysis suggested that most AF-associated proteins were affected by the genetic liability to AF. N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide improved the prediction of incident AF events close to baseline with further improvements gained by the AF-PRS at all time points.The AF proteomic signature includes biologically relevant proteins, some of which may be causal. It mainly reflects an NT-proBNP-dependent consequence of the genetic liability to AF. N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide is a promising marker for incident AF in the short term, but risk assessment incorporating a PRS may improve long-term risk assessment.© The Author(s) 2023.

*,37982274,Validation of an Integrated Genetic-Epigenetic Test for the Assessment of Coronary Heart Disease.,J Am Heart Assoc,"Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of death in the world. Unfortunately, many of the key diagnostic tools for CHD are insensitive, invasive, and costly; require significant specialized infrastructure investments; and do not provide information to guide postdiagnosis therapy. In prior work using data from the Framingham Heart Study, we provided in silico evidence that integrated genetic-epigenetic tools may provide a new avenue for assessing CHD.In this communication, we use an improved machine learning approach and data from 2 additional cohorts, totaling 449 cases and 2067 controls, to develop a better model for ascertaining symptomatic CHD. Using the DNA from the 2 new cohorts, we translate and validate the in silico findings into an artificial intelligence-guided, clinically implementable method that uses input from 6 methylation-sensitive digital polymerase chain reaction and 10 genotyping assays. Using this method, the overall average area under the curve, sensitivity, and specificity in the 3 test cohorts is 82%, 79%, and 76%, respectively. Analysis of targeted cytosine-phospho-guanine loci shows that they map to key risk pathways involved in atherosclerosis that suggest specific therapeutic approaches.We conclude that this scalable integrated genetic-epigenetic approach is useful for the diagnosis of symptomatic CHD, performs favorably as compared with many existing methods, and may provide personalized insight to CHD therapy. Furthermore, given the dynamic nature of DNA methylation and the ease of methylation-sensitive digital polymerase chain reaction methodologies, these findings may pave a pathway for precision epigenetic approaches for monitoring CHD treatment response."

Here, we present a bisulfite-free single-cell whole-genome 5mC and 5hmC profiling technique, named Cabernet, which can characterize 5mC and 5hmC at single-base resolution with high genomic coverage. Cabernet utilizes Tn5 transposome for DNA fragmentation, which enables the discrimination between different alleles for measuring hemi-methylation status. Using Cabernet, we revealed the 5mC, hemi-5mC and 5hmC dynamics during early mouse embryo development, uncovering genomic regions exclusively governed by active or passive demethylation. We show that hemi-methylation status can be used to distinguish between pre- and post-replication cells, enabling more efficient cell grouping when integrated with 5mC profiles. The property of Tn5 naturally enables Cabernet to achieve high-throughput single-cell methylome profiling, where we probed mouse cortical neurons and embryonic day 7.5 (E7.5) embryos, and constructed the library for thousands of single cells at high efficiency, demonstrating its potential for analyzing complex tissues at substantially low cost. Together, we present a way of high-throughput methylome and hydroxymethylome detection at single-cell resolution, enabling efficient analysis of the epigenetic status of biological systems with complicated nature such as neurons and cancer cells."
*,38016990,Plasma proteomic profiles predict individual future health risk.,Nat Commun,"Developing a single-domain assay to identify individuals at high risk of future events is a priority for multi-disease and mortality prevention. By training a neural network, we developed a disease/mortality-specific proteomic risk score (ProRS) based on 1461 Olink plasma proteins measured in 52,006 UK Biobank participants. This integrative score markedly stratified the risk for 45 common conditions, including infectious, hematological, endocrine, psychiatric, neurological, sensory, circulatory, respiratory, digestive, cutaneous, musculoskeletal, and genitourinary diseases, cancers, and mortality. The discriminations witnessed high accuracies achieved by ProRS for 10 endpoints (e.g., cancer, dementia, and death), with C-indexes exceeding 0.80. Notably, ProRS produced much better or equivalent predictive performance than established clinical indicators for almost all endpoints. Incorporating clinical predictors with ProRS enhanced predictive power for most endpoints, but this combination only exhibited limited improvement when compared to ProRS alone. Some proteins, e.g., GDF15, exhibited important discriminative values for various diseases. We also showed that the good discriminative performance observed could be largely translated into practical clinical utility. Taken together, proteomic profiles may serve as a replacement for complex laboratory tests or clinical measures to refine the comprehensive risk assessments of multiple diseases and mortalities simultaneously. Our models were internally validated in the UK Biobank; thus, further independent external validations are necessary to confirm our findings before application in clinical settings.© 2023.

*,38014125,Methyl-TWAS: A powerful method for in silico transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) using long-range DNA methylation.,bioRxiv,"In silicotranscriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) are commonly used to test whether expression of specific genes is linked to a complex trait. However, genotype-basedin silicoTWAS such as PrediXcan, exhibit low prediction accuracy for a majority of genes because genotypic data lack tissue- and disease-specificity and are not affected by the environment. Because methylation is tissue-specific and, like gene expression, can be modified by environment or disease status, methylation should predict gene expression with more accuracy than SNPs. Therefore, we propose Methyl-TWAS, the first approach that utilizes long-range methylation markers to impute gene expression forin silicoTWAS through penalized regression. Methyl-TWAS 1) predicts epigenetically regulated/associated expression (eGReX), which incorporates tissue-specific expression and both genetically- (GReX) and environmentally-regulated expression to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that could not be identified by genotype-based methods; and 2) incorporates bothcis-andtrans-CpGs, including various regulatory regions to identify DEGs that would be missed usingcis- methylation only. Methyl-TWAS outperforms PrediXcan and two other methods in imputing gene expression in the nasal epithelium, particularly for immunity-related genes and DEGs in atopic asthma. Methyl-TWAS identified 3,681 (85.2%) of the 4,316 DEGs identified in a previous TWAS of atopic asthma using measured expression, while PrediXcan could not identify any gene. Methyl-TWAS also outperforms PrediXcan for expression imputation as well asin silicoTWAS in white blood cells. Methyl-TWAS is a valuable tool forin silicoTWAS, leveraging a growing body of publicly available genome-wide DNA methylation data for a variety of human tissues."
,38087366,Alterations in DNA methylation associate with reduced migraine and headache days after medication withdrawal treatment in chronic migraine patients: a longitudinal study.,Clin Epigenetics,"Chronic migraine, a highly disabling migraine subtype, affects nearly 2% of the general population. Understanding migraine chronification is vital for developing better treatment and prevention strategies. An important factor in the chronification of migraine is the overuse of acute headache medication. However, the mechanisms behind the transformation of episodic migraine to chronic migraine and vice versa have not yet been elucidated. We performed a longitudinal epigenome-wide association study to identify DNA methylation (DNAm) changes associated with treatment response in patients with chronic migraine and medication overuse as part of the Chronification and Reversibility of Migraine clinical trial. Blood was taken from patients with chronic migraine (n = 98) at baseline and after a 12-week medication withdrawal period. Treatment responders, patients with ≥ 50% reduction in monthly headache days (MHD), were compared with non-responders to identify DNAm changes associated with treatment response. Similarly, patients with ≥ 50% versus < 50% reduction in monthly migraine days (MMD) were compared.At the epigenome-wide significant level (p < 9.42 × 10-8), a longitudinal reduction in DNAm at an intronic CpG site (cg14377273) within the HDAC4 gene was associated with MHD response following the withdrawal of acute medication. HDAC4 is highly expressed in the brain, plays a major role in synaptic plasticity, and modulates the expression and release of several neuroinflammation markers which have been implicated in migraine pathophysiology. Investigating whether baseline DNAm associated with treatment response, we identified lower baseline DNAm at a CpG site (cg15205829) within MARK3 that was significantly associated with MMD response at 12 weeks.Our findings of a longitudinal reduction in HDAC4 DNAm status associated with treatment response and baseline MARK3 DNAm status as an early biomarker for treatment response, provide support for a role of pathways related to chromatin structure and synaptic plasticity in headache chronification and introduce HDAC4 and MARK3 as novel therapeutic targets.© 2023.

Many cell types mediate their functions through targeted long-distance projections allowing interactions between specific cell types. Here we used epi-retro-seq2to link single-cell epigenomes and cell types to long-distance projections for 33,034 neurons dissected from 32 different regions projecting to 24 different targets (225 source-to-target combinations) across the whole mouse brain. We highlight uses of these data for interrogating principles relating projection types to transcriptomics and epigenomics, and for addressing hypotheses about cell types and connections related to genetics. We provide an overall synthesis with 926 statistical comparisons of discriminability of neurons projecting to each target for every source. We integrate this dataset into the larger BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network atlas, composed of millions of neurons, to link projection cell types to consensus clusters. Integration with spatial transcriptomics further assigns projection-enriched clusters to smaller source regions than the original dissections. We exemplify this by presenting in-depth analyses of projection neurons from the hypothalamus, thalamus, hindbrain, amygdala and midbrain to provide insights into properties of those cell types, including differentially expressed genes, their associated cis-regulatory elements and transcription-factor-binding motifs, and neurotransmitter use.© 2023.

,37956172,scapGNN: A graph neural network-based framework for active pathway and gene module inference from single-cell multi-omics data.,PLoS Biol,"Although advances in single-cell technologies have enabled the characterization of multiple omics profiles in individual cells, extracting functional and mechanistic insights from such information remains a major challenge. Here, we present scapGNN, a graph neural network (GNN)-based framework that creatively transforms sparse single-cell profile data into the stable gene-cell association network for inferring single-cell pathway activity scores and identifying cell phenotype-associated gene modules from single-cell multi-omics data. Systematic benchmarking demonstrated that scapGNN was more accurate, robust, and scalable than state-of-the-art methods in various downstream single-cell analyses such as cell denoising, batch effect removal, cell clustering, cell trajectory inference, and pathway or gene module identification. scapGNN was developed as a systematic R package that can be flexibly extended and enhanced for existing analysis processes. It provides a new analytical platform for studying single cells at the pathway and network levels.Copyright: © 2023 Han et al.

*,38093018,Hold out the genome: a roadmap to solving the cis-regulatory code.,Nature,"Gene expression is regulated by transcription factors that work together to read cis-regulatory DNA sequences. The 'cis-regulatory code' - how cells interpret DNA sequences to determine when, where and how much genes should be expressed - has proven to be exceedingly complex. Recently, advances in the scale and resolution of functional genomics assays and machine learning have enabled substantial progress towards deciphering this code. However, the cis-regulatory code will probably never be solved if models are trained only on genomic sequences; regions of homology can easily lead to overestimation of predictive performance, and our genome is too short and has insufficient sequence diversity to learn all relevant parameters. Fortunately, randomly synthesized DNA sequences enable testing a far larger sequence space than exists in our genomes, and designed DNA sequences enable targeted queries to maximally improve the models. As the same biochemical principles are used to interpret DNA regardless of its source, models trained on these synthetic data can predict genomic activity, often better than genome-trained models. Here we provide an outlook on the field, and propose a roadmap towards solving the cis-regulatory code by a combination of machine learning and massively parallel assays using synthetic DNA.© 2023.

,38053165,Prenatal BRCA1 epimutations contribute significantly to triple-negative breast cancer development.,Genome Med,"Normal cell BRCA1 epimutations have been associated with increased risk of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). However, the fraction of TNBCs that may have BRCA1 epimutations as their underlying cause is unknown. Neither are the time of occurrence and the potential inheritance patterns of BRCA1 epimutations established.To address these questions, we analyzed BRCA1 methylation status in breast cancer tissue and matched white blood cells (WBC) from 408 patients with 411 primary breast cancers, including 66 TNBCs, applying a highly sensitive sequencing assay, allowing allele-resolved methylation assessment. Furthermore, to assess the time of origin and the characteristics of normal cell BRCA1 methylation, we analyzed umbilical cord blood of 1260 newborn girls and 200 newborn boys. Finally, we assessed BRCA1 methylation status among 575 mothers and 531 fathers of girls with (n = 102) and without (n = 473) BRCA1 methylation.We found concordant tumor and mosaic WBC BRCA1 epimutations in 10 out of 66 patients with TNBC and in four out of six patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-low expression (< 10%) tumors (combined: 14 out of 72; 19.4%; 95% CI 11.1-30.5). In contrast, we found concordant WBC and tumor methylation in only three out of 220 patients with 221 ER ≥ 10% tumors and zero out of 114 patients with 116 HER2-positive tumors. Intraindividually, BRCA1 epimutations affected the same allele in normal and tumor cells. Assessing BRCA1 methylation in umbilical WBCs from girls, we found mosaic, predominantly monoallelic BRCA1 epimutations, with qualitative features similar to those in adults, in 113/1260 (9.0%) of individuals, but no correlation to BRCA1 methylation status either in mothers or fathers. A significantly lower fraction of newborn boys carried BRCA1 methylation (9/200; 4.5%) as compared to girls (p = 0.038). Similarly, WBC BRCA1 methylation was found less common among fathers (16/531; 3.0%), as compared to mothers (46/575; 8.0%; p = 0.0003).Our findings suggest prenatal BRCA1 epimutations might be the underlying cause of around 20% of TNBC and low-ER expression breast cancers. Such constitutional mosaic BRCA1 methylation likely arise through gender-related mechanisms in utero, independent of Mendelian inheritance.© 2023. The Author(s)."
,38082312,Transition of allele-specific DNA hydroxymethylation at regulatory loci is associated with phenotypic variation in monozygotic twins discordant for psychiatric disorders.,BMC Med,"Major psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia (SCZ) and bipolar disorder (BPD) are complex genetic mental illnesses. Their non-Mendelian features, such as those observed in monozygotic twins discordant for SCZ or BPD, are likely complicated by environmental modifiers of genetic effects. 5-Hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) is an important epigenetic mark in gene regulation, and whether it is linked to genetic variants that contribute to non-Mendelian features remains largely unexplored.We combined the 5hmC-selective chemical labeling method (5hmC-seq) and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) analysis of peripheral blood DNA obtained from monozygotic (MZ) twins discordant for SCZ or BPD to identify allelic imbalances in hydroxymethylome maps, and examined association of allele-specific hydroxymethylation (AShM) transition with disease susceptibility based on Bayes factors (BF) derived from the Bayesian generalized additive linear mixed model. We then performed multi-omics integrative analysis to determine the molecular pathogenic basis of those AShM sites. We finally employed luciferase reporter, CRISPR/Cas9 technology, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), PCR, FM4-64 imaging analysis, and RNA sequencing to validate the function of interested AShM sites in the human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells and human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells.We identified thousands of genetic variants associated with AShM imbalances that exhibited phenotypic variation-associated AShM changes at regulatory loci. These AShM marks showed plausible associations with SCZ or BPD based on their effects on interactions among transcription factors (TFs), DNA methylation levels, or other epigenomic marks and thus contributed to dysregulated gene expression, which ultimately increased disease susceptibility. We then validated that competitive binding of POU3F2 on the alternative allele at the AShM site rs4558409 (G/T) in PLLP-enhanced PLLP expression, while the hydroxymethylated alternative allele, which alleviated the POU3F2 binding activity at the rs4558409 site, might be associated with the downregulated PLLP expression observed in BPD or SCZ. Moreover, disruption of rs4558409 promoted neural development and vesicle trafficking.Our study provides a powerful strategy for prioritizing regulatory risk variants and contributes to our understanding of the interplay between genetic and epigenetic factors in mediating SCZ or BPD susceptibility.© 2023.

,38057664,"A genomic mutational constraint map using variation in 76,156 human genomes.",Nature,"The depletion of disruptive variation caused by purifying natural selection (constraint) has been widely used to investigate protein-coding genes underlying human disorders1-4, but attempts to assess constraint for non-protein-coding regions have proved more difficult. Here we aggregate, process and release a dataset of 76,156 human genomes from the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD)-the largest public open-access human genome allele frequency reference dataset-and use it to build a genomic constraint map for the whole genome (genomic non-coding constraint of haploinsufficient variation (Gnocchi)). We present a refined mutational model that incorporates local sequence context and regional genomic features to detect depletions of variation. As expected, the average constraint for protein-coding sequences is stronger than that for non-coding regions. Within the non-coding genome, constrained regions are enriched for known regulatory elements and variants that are implicated in complex human diseases and traits, facilitating the triangulation of biological annotation, disease association and natural selection to non-coding DNA analysis. More constrained regulatory elements tend to regulate more constrained protein-coding genes, which in turn suggests that non-coding constraint can aid the identification of constrained genes that are as yet unrecognized by current gene constraint metrics. We demonstrate that this genome-wide constraint map improves the identification and interpretation of functional human genetic variation.© 2023.
