37550724,Global effects of identity and aging on the human sperm methylome.,Clin Epigenetics,"As the average age of fatherhood increases worldwide, so too does the need for understanding effects of aging in male germline cells. Molecular change, including epigenomic alterations, may impact offspring. Age-associated change to DNA cytosine methylation in the cytosine-guanine (CpG) context is a hallmark of aging tissues, including sperm. Prior studies have led to accurate models that predict a man's age based on specific methylation features in the DNA of sperm, but the relationship between aging and global DNA methylation in sperm remains opaque. Further clarification requires a more complete survey of the methylome with assessment of variability within and between individuals.We collected sperm methylome data in a longitudinal study of ten healthy fertile men. We used whole-genome bisulfite sequencing of samples collected 10 to 18 years apart from each donor. We found that, overall, variability between donors far exceeds age-associated variation. After controlling for donor identity, we see significant age-dependent genome-wide change to the methylome. Notably, trends of change with age depend on genomic location or annotation, with contrasting signatures that correlate with gene density and proximity to centromeres and promoter regions.We uncovered epigenetic signatures that reflect a stable process which begins in early adulthood, progressing steadily through most of the male lifespan, and warrants consideration in any future study of the aging sperm epigenome.© 2023.

37550674,Long-term exposure to ambient fine particulate components and leukocyte epigenome-wide DNA Methylation in older men: the Normative Aging Study.,Environ Health,"Epigenome-wide association studies of ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) have been reported. However, few have examined PM2.5components (PMCs) and sources or included repeated measures. The lack of high-resolution exposure measurements is the key limitation. We hypothesized that significant changes in DNA methylation might vary by PMCs and the sources.We predicted the annual average of 14 PMCs using novel high-resolution exposure models across the contiguous U.S., between 2000-2018. The resolution was 50 m × 50 m in the Greater Boston Area. We also identified PM2.5sources using positive matrix factorization. We repeatedly collected blood samples and measured leukocyte DNAm with the Illumina HumanMethylation450K BeadChip in the Normative Aging Study. We then used median regression with subject-specific intercepts to estimate the associations between long-term (one-year) exposure to PMCs / PM2.5sources and DNA methylation at individual cytosine-phosphate-guanine CpG sites. Significant probes were identified by the number of independent degrees of freedom approach, using the number of principal components explaining > 95% of the variation of the DNA methylation data. We also performed regional and pathway analyses to identify significant regions and pathways.We included 669 men with 1,178 visits between 2000-2013. The subjects had a mean age of 75 years. The identified probes, regions, and pathways varied by PMCs and their sources. For example, iron was associated with 6 probes and 6 regions, whereas nitrate was associated with 15 probes and 3 regions. The identified pathways from biomass burning, coal burning, and heavy fuel oil combustion sources were associated with cancer, inflammation, and cardiovascular diseases, whereas there were no pathways associated with all traffic.Our findings showed that the effects of PM2.5on DNAm varied by its PMCs and sources.© 2023.

37549439,Epigenetic modifications appear in the human placenta following anxiety and depression during pregnancy.,Placenta,"The future health of the offspring can be influenced by longstanding maternal anxiety and depression disorders during pregnancy. The present study aimed to explore the effect of psychiatric disorders during pregnancy on placental epigenetics.We measured DNA methylation patterns in term-placentas of women either suffering longstanding anxiety and depression symptoms (Index group, with overt symptoms), or a healthy population (Control, none/only mild symptoms). Whole genome DNA methylation profiling was performed using the TruSeq® Methyl Capture EPIC Library Prep Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) for library preparation and NGS technology for genomic DNA sequencing.The results of high-throughput DNA methylation analysis revealed that the Index group had differential DNA methylation at epigenome-wide significance (p < 0.05) in 226 genes in the placenta. Targeted enrichment analyses identified hypermethylation of genes associated with psychiatric disorders (BRINP1, PUM1), and ion homeostasis (COMMD1), among others. The ECM (extracellular matrix)-receptor interaction pathway was significantly dysregulated in the Index group compared to the Control. In addition, DNA methylation/mRNA integration analyses revealed that four genes with key roles in neurodevelopment and other important processes (EPB41L4B, BMPR2, KLHL18, and UBAP2) were dysregulated at both, DNA methylation and transcriptome levels in the Index group compared to Control.The presented results increase our understanding of how maternal psychiatric disorders may affect the newborn through placental differential epigenome, suggesting DNA methylation status as a biomarker when aiming to design new preventive techniques and interventions.Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).

37546994,Blood epigenome-wide association studies of suicide attempt in adults with bipolar disorder.,medRxiv,"Suicide attempt (SA) risk is elevated in individuals with bipolar disorder (BD), and DNA methylation patterns may serve as possible biomarkers of SA. We conducted epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) of blood DNA methylation associated with BD and SA. DNA methylation was measured at > 700,000 positions in a discovery cohort of n = 84 adults with BD with a history of SA (BD/SA), n = 79 adults with BD without history of SA (BD/non-SA), and n = 76 non-psychiatric controls (CON). EWAS revealed six differentially methylated positions (DMPs) and seven differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between BD/SA and BD/non-SA, with multiple immune-related genes implicated. There were no epigenome-wide significant differences when BD/SA and BD/non-SA were each compared to CON, and patterns suggested that epigenetics differentiating BD/SA from BD/non-SA do not differentiate BD/non-SA from CON. Weighted gene co-methylation network analysis and trait enrichment analysis of the BD/SA vs. BD/non-SA contrast further corroborated immune system involvement, while gene ontology analysis implicated calcium signalling. In an independent replication cohort of n = 48 BD/SA and n = 47 BD/non-SA, fold-changes at the discovery cohort's significant sites showed moderate correlation across cohorts and agreement on direction. In both cohorts, classification accuracy for SA history among individuals with BD was highest when methylation at the significant CpG sites as well as information from clinical interviews were combined, with an AUC of 88.8% (CI = 83.8-93.8%) and 82.1% (CI = 73.6-90.5%) for the combined epigenetic-clinical predictor in the discovery and replication cohorts, respectively. Our results provide novel insight to the role of immune system functioning in SA and BD and also suggest that integrating information from multiple levels of analysis holds promise to improve risk assessment for SA in adults with BD."
37546290,Offspring epigenetic markers at birth related to gestational BMI predict offspring BMI-trajectories from infancy to 26Â years.,Obes Sci Pract,"To date, epigenetic studies identified differential DNA methylation (DNAm) related to gestational-body mass index (BMI) in offspring at birth. This study investigated whether the identified DNAm in offspring were also associated with BMI trajectories from infancy to age 26 years.Data of 794 participants from Isle of Wight birth cohort in UK were investigated to study association between BMI trajectories and DNAm related to gestational-BMI at birth. Multinominal logistic regression models were applied to test the association between 1090 DNAm sites reported in three prior epigenome-wide association studies and BMI trajectories.DNAm site cg23089913 (NANOS1) and cg13217064 (SOX14) were associated with early persistent obesity (EPO) and delayed overweight (DOW) trajectories respectively. A higher methylation of cg23089913 showed low odds of being in EPO trajectory (OR: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.76-0.93) while higher methylation of cg13217064 resulted in 1.4-times the odds of being in DOW trajectory when compared to the normal trajectory [Correction added on 22 February 2023, after first online publication: Range of the DNAm site cg23089913 has been changed from 'lower' to 'higher' in the preceding sentence.]. In a gender-stratified analysis, the odds of developing into DOW was 1.8 times in female participants for cg13217064 while not such association was observed in males.Deviations in methylation of cg23089913 (NANOS1) and cg13217064 (SOX14) in newborns may change the risk of having excess body weight.© 2023 The Authors.

37542143,Identification of novel hypermethylated or hypomethylated CpG sites and genes associated with anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy.,Sci Rep,"Anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy is a leading cause of late morbidity in childhood cancer survivors. Aberrant DNA methylation plays a role in de novo cardiovascular disease. Epigenetic processes could play a role in anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy but remain unstudied. We sought to examine if genome-wide differential methylation at 'CpG' sites in peripheral blood DNA is associated with anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy. This report used participants from a matched case-control study; 52 non-Hispanic White, anthracycline-exposed childhood cancer survivors with cardiomyopathy were matched 1:1 with 52 survivors with no cardiomyopathy. Paired ChAMP (Chip Analysis Methylation Pipeline) with integrated reference-based deconvolution of adult peripheral blood DNA methylation was used to analyze data from Illumina HumanMethylation EPIC BeadChip arrays. An epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) was performed, and the model was adjusted for GrimAge, sex, interaction terms of age at enrollment, chest radiation, age at diagnosis squared, and cardiovascular risk factors (CVRFs: diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia). Prioritized genes were functionally validated by gene knockout in human induced pluripotent stem cell cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. DNA-methylation EPIC array analyses identified 32 differentially methylated probes (DMP: 15 hyper-methylated and 17 hypo-methylated probes) that overlap with 23 genes and 9 intergenic regions. Three hundred and fifty-four differential methylated regions (DMRs) were also identified. Several of these genes are associated with cardiac dysfunction. Knockout of genes EXO6CB, FCHSD2, NIPAL2, and SYNPO2 in hiPSC-CMs increased sensitivity to doxorubicin. In addition, EWAS analysis identified hypo-methylation of probe 'cg15939386' in gene RORA to be significantly associated with anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy. In this genome-wide DNA methylation profile study, we observed significant differences in DNA methylation at the CpG level between anthracycline-exposed childhood cancer survivors with and without cardiomyopathy, implicating differential DNA methylation of certain genes could play a role in pathogenesis of anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy.© 2023.

37537185,Droplet-based bisulfite sequencing for high-throughput profiling of single-cell DNA methylomes.,Nat Commun,"The genome-wide DNA methylation profile, or DNA methylome, is a critical component of the overall epigenomic landscape that modulates gene activities and cell fate. Single-cell DNA methylomic studies offer unprecedented resolution for detecting and profiling cell subsets based on methylomic features. However, existing single-cell methylomic technologies are based on use of tubes or well plates and these platforms are not easily scalable for handling a large number of single cells. Here we demonstrate a droplet-based microfluidic technology, Drop-BS, to construct single-cell bisulfite sequencing libraries for DNA methylome profiling. Drop-BS takes advantage of the ultrahigh throughput offered by droplet microfluidics to prepare bisulfite sequencing libraries of up to 10,000 single cells within 2 days. We apply the technology to profile mixed cell lines, mouse and human brain tissues to reveal cell type heterogeneity. Drop-BS offers a promising solution for single-cell methylomic studies requiring examination of a large cell population.© 2023. Springer Nature Limited."
37533639,EpiMix is an integrative tool for epigenomic subtyping using DNA methylation.,Cell Rep Methods,"DNA methylation (DNAme) is a major epigenetic factor influencing gene expression with alterations leading to cancer and immunological and cardiovascular diseases. Recent technological advances have enabled genome-wide profiling of DNAme in large human cohorts. There is a need for analytical methods that can more sensitively detect differential methylation profiles present in subsets of individuals from these heterogeneous, population-level datasets. We developed an end-to-end analytical framework named ""EpiMix"" for population-level analysis of DNAme and gene expression. Compared with existing methods, EpiMix showed higher sensitivity in detecting abnormal DNAme that was present in only small patient subsets. We extended the model-based analyses of EpiMix tocis-regulatory elements within protein-coding genes, distal enhancers, and genes encoding microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). Using cell-type-specific data from two separate studies, we discover epigenetic mechanisms underlying childhood food allergy and survival-associated, methylation-driven ncRNAs in non-small cell lung cancer.© 2023 The Author(s)."
37533055,DNA methylation and 28-year cardiovascular disease risk in type 1 diabetes: the Epidemiology of Diabetes Complications (EDC) cohort study.,Clin Epigenetics,"The potential for DNA methylation (DNAm) as an early marker for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and how such an association might differ by glycemic exposure has not been examined in type 1 diabetes, a population at increased CVD risk. We thus performed a prospective epigenome-wide association study of blood leukocyte DNAm (EPIC array) and time to CVD incidence over 28 years in a childhood-onset (< 17 years) type 1 diabetes cohort, the Pittsburgh Epidemiology of Diabetes Complications (EDC) study (n = 368 with DNA and no CVD at baseline), both overall and separately by glycemic exposure, as measured by HbA1c at baseline (split at the median: < 8.9% and ≥ 8.9%). We also assessed whether DNAm-CVD associations were independent of established cardiometabolic risk factors, including body mass index, estimated glucose disposal rate, cholesterol, triglycerides, blood pressure, pulse rate, albumin excretion rate, and estimated glomerular filtration rate.CVD (first instance of CVD death, myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, ischemic ECG, angina, or stroke) developed in 172 participants (46.7%) over 28 years. Overall, in Cox regression models for time to CVD, none of the 683,597 CpGs examined reached significance at a false discovery rate (FDR) ≤ 0.05. In participants with HbA1c < 8.9% (n = 180), again none reached FDR ≤ 0.05, but three were associated at the a priori nominal significance level FDR ≤ 0.10: cg07147033 in MIB2, cg12324048 (intergenic, chromosome 3), and cg15883830 (intergenic, chromosome 1). In participants with HbA1c ≥ 8.9% (n = 188), two CpGs in loci involved in calcium channel activity were significantly associated with CVD (FDR ≤ 0.05): cg21823999 in GPM6A and cg23621817 in CHRNA9; four additional CpGs were nominally associated (FDR ≤ 0.10). In participants with HbA1c ≥ 8.9%, DNAm-CVD associations were only modestly attenuated after cardiometabolic risk factor adjustment, while attenuation was greater in those with HbA1c < 8.9%. No pathways were enriched in those with HbA1c < 8.9%, while pathways for calcium channel activity and integral component of synaptic membrane were significantly enriched in those with HbA1c ≥ 8.9%.These results provide novel evidence that DNAm at loci involved in calcium channel activity and development may contribute to long-term CVD risk beyond known risk factors in type 1 diabetes, particularly in individuals with greater glycemic exposure, warranting further study.© 2023.

37529779,Epigenetic associations with adolescent grey matter maturation and cognitive development.,Front Genet,"Introduction:Adolescence, a critical phase of human neurodevelopment, is marked by a tremendous reorganization of the brain and accompanied by improved cognitive performance. This development is driven in part by gene expression, which in turn is partly regulated by DNA methylation (DNAm).Methods:We collected brain imaging, cognitive assessments, and DNAm in a longitudinal cohort of approximately 200 typically developing participants, aged 9-14. This data, from three time points roughly 1 year apart, was used to explore the relationships between seven cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites in genes highly expressed in brain tissues (GRIN2D,GABRB3,KCNC1,SLC12A9,CHD5,STXBP5, andNFASC), seven networks of grey matter (GM) volume change, and scores from seven cognitive tests.Results:The demethylation of the CpGs as well as the rates of change in DNAm were significantly related to improvements in total, crystalized, and fluid cognition scores, executive function, episodic memory, and processing speed, as well as several networks of GM volume increases and decreases that highlight typical patterns of brain maturation.Discussion:Our study provides a first look at the DNAm of genes involved in myelination, excitatory and inhibitory receptors, and connectivity, how they are related to the large-scale changes occurring in the brain structure as well as cognition during adolescence.Copyright © 2023 Jensen, Chen, Turner, Stephen, Wang, Wilson, Calhoun and Liu."
37550624,Proteomic analysis of 92 circulating proteins and their effects in cardiometabolic diseases.,Clin Proteomics,"Human plasma contains a wide variety of circulating proteins. These proteins can be important clinical biomarkers in disease and also possible drug targets. Large scale genomics studies of circulating proteins can identify genetic variants that lead to relative protein abundance.We conducted a meta-analysis on genome-wide association studies of autosomal chromosomes in 22,997 individuals of primarily European ancestry across 12 cohorts to identify protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) for 92 cardiometabolic associated plasma proteins.We identified 503 (337 cis and 166 trans) conditionally independent pQTLs, including several novel variants not reported in the literature. We conducted a sex-stratified analysis and found that 118 (23.5%) of pQTLs demonstrated heterogeneity between sexes. The direction of effect was preserved but there were differences in effect size and significance. Additionally, we annotate trans-pQTLs with nearest genes and report plausible biological relationships. Using Mendelian randomization, we identified causal associations for 18 proteins across 19 phenotypes, of which 10 have additional genetic colocalization evidence. We highlight proteins associated with a constellation of cardiometabolic traits including angiopoietin-related protein 7 (ANGPTL7) and Semaphorin 3F (SEMA3F).Through large-scale analysis of protein quantitative trait loci, we provide a comprehensive overview of common variants associated with plasma proteins. We highlight possible biological relationships which may serve as a basis for further investigation into possible causal roles in cardiometabolic diseases.© 2023.

37537391,Proteome-wide mendelian randomization identifies causal plasma proteins in venous thromboembolism development.,J Hum Genet,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous risk loci for venous thromboembolism (VTE), but it is challenging to decipher the underlying mechanisms. We employed an integrative analytical pipeline to transform genetic associations to identify novel plasma proteins for VTE. Proteome-wide association studies (PWAS) were determined by functional summary-based imputation leveraging data from a genome-wide association analysis (14,429 VTE patients, 267,037 controls), blood proteomes (1348 cases), followed by Mendelian randomization, Bayesian colocalization, protein-protein interaction, and pathway enrichment analysis. Twenty genetically regulated circulating protein abundances (F2, F11, ABO, PLCG2, LRP4, PLEK, KLKB1, PROC, KNG1, THBS2, SERPINA1, RARRES2, CEL, GP6, SERPINE2, SERPINA10, OBP2B, EFEMP1, F5, and MSR1) were associated with VTE. Of these 13 proteins demonstrated Mendelian randomized correlations. Six proteins (F2, F11, PLEK, SERPINA1, RARRES2, and SERPINE2) had strong support in colocalization analysis. Utilizing multidimensional data, this study suggests PLEK, SERPINA1, and SERPINE2 as compelling proteins that may provide key hints for future research and possible diagnostic and therapeutic targets for VTE.© 2023.

37542162,Methylome-wide association study of anxiety disorders.,Mol Psychiatry,"Anxiety Disorders (ANX) such as panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and phobias, are highly prevalent conditions that are moderately heritable. Evidence suggests that DNA methylation may play a role, as it is involved in critical adaptations to changing environments. Applying an enrichment-based sequencing approach covering nearly 28 million autosomal CpG sites, we conducted a methylome-wide association study (MWAS) of lifetime ANX in 1132 participants (618 cases/514 controls) from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety. Using epigenomic deconvolution, we performed MWAS for the main cell types in blood: granulocytes, T-cells, B-cells and monocytes. Cell-type specific analyses identified 280 and 82 methylome-wide significant associations (q-value < 0.1) in monocytes and granulocytes, respectively. Our top finding in monocytes was located in ZNF823 on chromosome 19 (p = 1.38 × 10-10) previously associated with schizophrenia. We observed significant overlap (p < 1 × 10-06) with the same direction of effect in monocytes (210 sites), T-cells (135 sites), and B-cells (727 sites) between this Discovery MWAS signal and a comparable replication dataset from the Great Smoky Mountains Study (N = 433). Overlapping Discovery-Replication MWAS signal was enriched for findings from published GWAS of ANX, major depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder. In monocytes, two specific sites in the FZR1 gene showed significant replication after Bonferroni correction with an additional 15 nominally replicated sites in monocytes and 4 in T-cells. FZR1 regulates neurogenesis in the hippocampus, and its knockout leads to impairments in associative fear memory and long-term potentiation in mice. In the largest and most extensive methylome-wide study of ANX, we identified replicable methylation sites located in genes of potential relevance for brain mechanisms of psychiatric conditions.© 2023.

37542161,Prenatal exposure to environmental air pollution and psychosocial stress jointly contribute to the epigenetic regulation of the serotonin transporter gene in newborns.,Mol Psychiatry,"Antenatal exposures to maternal stress and to particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of less than 2.5 μm (PM2.5) have been independently associated with developmental outcomes in early infancy and beyond. Knowledge about their joint impact, biological mechanisms of their effects and timing-effects, is still limited. Both PM2.5and maternal stress exposure during pregnancy might result in altered patterns of DNA methylation in specific stress-related genes, such as the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4 DNAm), that might, in turn, influence infant development across several domains, including bio-behavioral, cognitive and socio-emotional domains. Here, we investigated the independent and interactive influence of variations in antenatal exposures to maternal pandemic-related stress (PRS) and PM2.5on SLC6A4 DNAm levels in newborns. Mother-infant dyads (N = 307) were enrolled at delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic. Infants' methylation status was assessed in 13 CpG sites within the SLC6A4 gene's region (chr17:28562750-28562958) in buccal cells at birth and women retrospectively report on PRS. PM2.5exposure throughout the entire gestation and at each gestational trimester was estimated using a spatiotemporal model based on residential address. Among several potentially confounding socio-demographic and health-related factors, infant's sex was significantly associated with infants' SLC6A4 DNAm levels, thus hierarchical regression models were adjusted for infant's sex. Higher levels of SLC6A4 DNAm at 6 CpG sites were found in newborns born to mothers reporting higher levels of antenatal PRS and greater PM2.5 exposure across gestation, while adjusting for infant's sex. These effects were especially evident when exposure to elevated PM2.5occurred during the second trimester of pregnancy. Several important brain processes (e.g., synaptogenesis and myelination) occur during mid-pregnancy, potentially making the second trimester a sensitive time window for the effects of stress-related exposures. Understanding the interplay between environmental and individual-level stressors has important implications for the improvement of mother-infant health during and after the pandemic.© 2023.
