"37556549","Co-condensation with photoexcited cryptochromes facilitates MAC3A to positively control hypocotyl growth in Arabidopsis.","Sci Adv","Cryptochromes (CRYs) are blue light receptors that mediate plant photoresponses through regulating gene expressions. We recently reported thatArabidopsisCRY2 could form light-elicited liquid condensates to control RNA methylation. However, whether CRY2 condensation is involved in other gene expression-regulatory processes remains unclear. Here, we show that MOS4-associated complex subunits 3A and 3B (MAC3A/3B) are CRY-interacting proteins and assembled into nuclear CRY condensates.mac3a3bdouble mutants exhibit hypersensitive photoinhibition of hypocotyl elongation, suggesting that MAC3A/3B positively control hypocotyl growth. We demonstrate the noncanonical activity of MAC3A as a DNA binding protein that modulates transcription. Genome-wide mapping of MAC3A-binding sites reveals that blue light enhances the association of MAC3A with its DNA targets, which requires CRYs. Further evidence indicates that MAC3A and ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5 (HY5) occupy overlapping genomic regions and compete for the same targets. These results argue that photocondensation of CRYs fine-tunes light-responsive hypocotyl growth by balancing the opposed effects of HY5 and MAC3A."

At present, the recognized pathogenesis mainly includes four categories: excessive sebum secretion, excessiveCutibacterium acnesproliferation, excessive keratinization of sebaceous glands in hair follicles, and inflammatory mechanisms. Previous studies have found that DNA methylation is closely related to some chronic inflammatory skin diseases, and there is evidence that DNA methylation is controlled by genetic factors, making us want to know the relationship between DNA methylation, genetic variation and acne.In our previous study, we performed genome-wide DNA methylation analysis in peripheral blood samples from 44 patients with severe acne and 44 unaffected normal subjects, and identified 23 differentially methylated probes (DMPs). In this study, we identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with severe acne by genome-wide association analysis in these 88 samples. To test the association between SNPs and DMPs, we conducted DNA methylation quantitative trait loci (methQTL) analysis. Next, causal inference testing (CIT) was used to determine whether genetic variation influences DNA methylation, which impacts disease phenotypes.We found 38,269 SNPs associated with severe acne. By methQTL analysis, we obtained 24 SNP-CpG pairs that reached the threshold (FDR < 0.05), which included 7 unique CpGs and 22 unique methQTL SNPs. After CIT analysis, we found that 11 out of 24 pairs of SNP-CpG showed a weakened SNP effect after adjustment for methylation, indicating a methylation-mediated relationship between SNPs and severe acne. These 11 SNP-CpG pairs consist of four unique CpG sites and 11 SNPs, of which three CpG sites, cg03020863, cg20652636, and cg19964325, are located on the gene body of PDGFD, the intron of SH2D6, and the 5'UTR of the IL1R1 gene, respectively.During this study, the DNA methylation of certain genes was found to be influenced by genetic factors and mediated the risk of severe acne in a young Chinese male population, providing a new perspective on the pathogenesis of severe acne.Copyright © 2023 Wu, Chen, Chen, Wu and Yang."
"37554110","Genome-wide impact of cytosine methylation and DNA sequence context on UV-induced CPD formation.","Environ Mol Mutagen","Exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light is the primary etiological agent for skin cancers because UV damages cellular DNA. The most frequent form of UV damage is the cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD), which consists of covalent linkages between neighboring pyrimidine bases in DNA. In human cells, the 5' position of cytosine bases in CG dinucleotides is frequently methylated, and methylated cytosines in the TP53 tumor suppressor are often sites of mutation hotspots in skin cancers. It has been argued that this is because cytosine methylation promotes UV-induced CPD formation; however, the effects of cytosine methylation on CPD formation are controversial, with conflicting results from previous studies. Here, we use a genome-wide method known as CPD-seq to map UVB- and UVC-induced CPDs across the yeast genome in the presence or absence in vitro methylation by the CpG methyltransferase M.SssI. Our data indicate that cytosine methylation increases UVB-induced CPD formation nearly 2-fold relative to unmethylated DNA, but the magnitude of induction depends on the flanking sequence context. Sequence contexts with a 5' guanine base (e.g., GCCG and GTCG) show the strongest induction due to cytosine methylation, potentially because these sequence contexts are less efficient at forming CPD lesions in the absence of methylation. We show that cytosine methylation also modulates UVC-induced CPD formation, albeit to a lesser extent than UVB. These findings can potentially reconcile previous studies, and define the impact of cytosine methylation on UV damage across a eukaryotic genome. This article is protected by copyright.

"37553583","Identification of GRIN2D as a novel therapeutic target in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.","Biomark Res","Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a devastating disease with a dismal prognosis, and despite significant advances in our understanding of its genetic drivers, like KRAS, TP53, CDKN2A, and SMAD4, effective therapies remain limited. Here, we identified a new therapeutic target GRIN2D and then explored its functions and mechanisms in PDAC progression.We performed a genome-wide RNAi screen in a PDAC xenograft model and identified GRIN2D, which encodes the GluN2D subunit of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), as a potential oncogene. Western blot, immunohistochemistry, and analysis on Gene Expression Omnibus were used for detecting the expression of GRIN2D in PDAC. Cellular experiments were conducted for exploring the functions of GRIN2D in vitro while subcutaneous and orthotopic injections were used in in vivo study. To clarify the mechanism, we used RNA sequencing and cellular experiments to identify the related signaling pathway. Cellular assays, RT-qPCR, and western blot helped identify the impacts of the NMDAR antagonist memantine.We demonstrated that GRIN2D was highly expressed in PDAC cells, and further promoted oncogenic functions. Mechanistically, transcriptome profiling identified GRIN2D-regulated genes in PDAC cells. We found that GRIN2D promoted PDAC progression by activating the p38 MAPK signaling pathway and transcription factor CREB, which in turn promoted the expression of HMGA2 and IL20RB. The upregulated GRIN2D could effectively promote tumor growth and liver metastasis in PDAC. We also investigated the therapeutic potential of NMDAR antagonism in PDAC and found that memantine reduced the expression of GRIN2D and inhibited PDAC progression.Our results suggested that NMDA receptor GRIN2D plays important oncogenic roles in PDAC and represents a novel therapeutic target.© 2023.

"37551994","Whole blood DNA methylation changes are associated with anti-TNF drug concentration in patients with Crohn's disease.","J Crohns Colitis","Anti-TNF treatment failure in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is common and frequently related to low drug concentrations. In order to identify patients who may benefit from dose optimisation at the outset of anti-TNF therapy, we sought to define epigenetic biomarkers in whole blood at baseline associated with anti-TNF drug concentrations at week 14.DNA methylation from 1,104 whole blood samples from 385 patients in the Personalised Anti-TNF Therapy in Crohn's disease (PANTS) study were assessed using the Illumina EPIC Beadchip (v1.0) at baseline, weeks 14, 30 and 54. We compared DNA methylation profiles in anti-TNF-treated patients who experienced primary non-response at week 14 and if they were assessed at subsequent time points, were not in remission at week 30 or 54 (infliximab n = 99, adalimumab n = 94), with patients who responded at week 14 and when assessed at subsequent time points, were in remission at week 30 or 54 (infliximab n = 99, adalimumab n = 93).Overall, between baseline and week 14, we observed 4,999 differentially methylated probes (DMPs) annotated to 2376 genes following anti-TNF treatment. Pathway analysis identified 108 significant gene ontology terms enriched in biological processes related to immune system processes and responses.Epigenome-wide association (EWAS) analysis identified 323 DMPs annotated to 210 genes at baseline associated with higher anti-TNF drug concentrations at week 14. Of these, 125 DMPs demonstrated shared associations with other common traits (proportion of shared CpGs compared to DMPs) including body mass index (23.2%), followed by CRP (11.5%), smoking (7.4%), alcohol consumption per day (7.1%) and IBD type (6.8%). EWAS of primary non-response to anti-TNF identified 20 DMPs that were associated with both anti-TNF drug concentration and primary non-response to anti-TNF with a strong correlation of the coefficients (Spearman's rho = -0.94, p < 0.001).Baseline DNA methylation profiles may be used as a predictor for anti-TNF drug concentration at week 14 to identify patients who may benefit from dose optimisation at the outset of anti-TNF therapy.© The Author(s) 2023.

"37550724","Global effects of identity and aging on the human sperm methylome.","Clin Epigenetics","As the average age of fatherhood increases worldwide, so too does the need for understanding effects of aging in male germline cells. Molecular change, including epigenomic alterations, may impact offspring. Age-associated change to DNA cytosine methylation in the cytosine-guanine (CpG) context is a hallmark of aging tissues, including sperm. Prior studies have led to accurate models that predict a man's age based on specific methylation features in the DNA of sperm, but the relationship between aging and global DNA methylation in sperm remains opaque. Further clarification requires a more complete survey of the methylome with assessment of variability within and between individuals.We collected sperm methylome data in a longitudinal study of ten healthy fertile men. We used whole-genome bisulfite sequencing of samples collected 10 to 18 years apart from each donor. We found that, overall, variability between donors far exceeds age-associated variation. After controlling for donor identity, we see significant age-dependent genome-wide change to the methylome. Notably, trends of change with age depend on genomic location or annotation, with contrasting signatures that correlate with gene density and proximity to centromeres and promoter regions.We uncovered epigenetic signatures that reflect a stable process which begins in early adulthood, progressing steadily through most of the male lifespan, and warrants consideration in any future study of the aging sperm epigenome.© 2023.

"37550674","Long-term exposure to ambient fine particulate components and leukocyte epigenome-wide DNA Methylation in older men: the Normative Aging Study.","Environ Health","Epigenome-wide association studies of ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) have been reported. However, few have examined PM2.5components (PMCs) and sources or included repeated measures. The lack of high-resolution exposure measurements is the key limitation. We hypothesized that significant changes in DNA methylation might vary by PMCs and the sources.We predicted the annual average of 14 PMCs using novel high-resolution exposure models across the contiguous U.S., between 2000-2018. The resolution was 50 m × 50 m in the Greater Boston Area. We also identified PM2.5sources using positive matrix factorization. We repeatedly collected blood samples and measured leukocyte DNAm with the Illumina HumanMethylation450K BeadChip in the Normative Aging Study. We then used median regression with subject-specific intercepts to estimate the associations between long-term (one-year) exposure to PMCs / PM2.5sources and DNA methylation at individual cytosine-phosphate-guanine CpG sites. Significant probes were identified by the number of independent degrees of freedom approach, using the number of principal components explaining > 95% of the variation of the DNA methylation data. We also performed regional and pathway analyses to identify significant regions and pathways.We included 669 men with 1,178 visits between 2000-2013. The subjects had a mean age of 75 years. The identified probes, regions, and pathways varied by PMCs and their sources. For example, iron was associated with 6 probes and 6 regions, whereas nitrate was associated with 15 probes and 3 regions. The identified pathways from biomass burning, coal burning, and heavy fuel oil combustion sources were associated with cancer, inflammation, and cardiovascular diseases, whereas there were no pathways associated with all traffic.Our findings showed that the effects of PM2.5on DNAm varied by its PMCs and sources.© 2023.

"37550611","Genomic-wide identification and expression analysis of R2R3-MYB transcription factors related to flavonol biosynthesis in Morinda officinalis.","BMC Plant Biol","The R2R3-MYB transcription factors are a crucial and extensive gene family in plants, which participate in diverse processes, including development, metabolism, defense, differentiation, and stress response. In the Lingnan region of China, Morinda officinalis is extensively grown and is renowned for its use as both a medicinal herb and food source. However, there are relatively few reports on the R2R3-MYB transcription factor family in M.officinalis.In this study, we identified 97 R2R3-MYB genes in the genome of Morinda officinalis and classified them into 32 subgroups based on phylogenetic comparison with Arabidopsis thaliana. The lack of recent whole-genome duplication events in M.officinalis may be the reason for the relatively few members of the R2R3-MYB family. We also further analyzed the physical and chemical characteristics, conserved motifs, gene structure, and chromosomal location. Gene duplication events found 21 fragment duplication pairs and five tandem duplication event R2R3-MYB genes in M.officinalis may also affect gene family expansion. Based on phylogenetic analysis, cis-element analysis, co-expression analysis and RT-qPCR, we concluded that MoMYB33 might modulate flavonol levels by regulating the expression of 4-coumarate-CoA ligase Mo4CL2, chalcone isomerase MoCHI3, and flavonol synthase MoFLS4/11/12. MoMYB33 and AtMYB111 showed the highest similarity of 79% and may be involved in flavonol synthase networks by the STRING database. Moreover, we also identified MoMYB genes that respond to methyl Jasmonate (MeJA) and abscisic acid (ABA) stress by RT-qPCR.This study offers a thorough comprehension of R2R3-MYB in M.officinalis, which lays the foundation for the regulation of flavonol synthesis and the response of MoMYB genes to phytohormones in M.officinalis.© 2023.

"37549439","Epigenetic modifications appear in the human placenta following anxiety and depression during pregnancy.","Placenta","The future health of the offspring can be influenced by longstanding maternal anxiety and depression disorders during pregnancy. The present study aimed to explore the effect of psychiatric disorders during pregnancy on placental epigenetics.We measured DNA methylation patterns in term-placentas of women either suffering longstanding anxiety and depression symptoms (Index group, with overt symptoms), or a healthy population (Control, none/only mild symptoms). Whole genome DNA methylation profiling was performed using the TruSeq® Methyl Capture EPIC Library Prep Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) for library preparation and NGS technology for genomic DNA sequencing.The results of high-throughput DNA methylation analysis revealed that the Index group had differential DNA methylation at epigenome-wide significance (p < 0.05) in 226 genes in the placenta. Targeted enrichment analyses identified hypermethylation of genes associated with psychiatric disorders (BRINP1, PUM1), and ion homeostasis (COMMD1), among others. The ECM (extracellular matrix)-receptor interaction pathway was significantly dysregulated in the Index group compared to the Control. In addition, DNA methylation/mRNA integration analyses revealed that four genes with key roles in neurodevelopment and other important processes (EPB41L4B, BMPR2, KLHL18, and UBAP2) were dysregulated at both, DNA methylation and transcriptome levels in the Index group compared to Control.The presented results increase our understanding of how maternal psychiatric disorders may affect the newborn through placental differential epigenome, suggesting DNA methylation status as a biomarker when aiming to design new preventive techniques and interventions.Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).

"37549144","Influence of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification on cell phenotype in Alzheimer's disease.","PLoS One","Recent research has suggested that m6A modification takes on critical significance to Neurodegeneration. As indicated by the genome-wide map of m6A mRNA, genes in Alzheimer's disease model achieved significant m6A methylation. This study aimed to investigate the hub gene and pathway of m6A modification in the pathogenesis of AD. Moreover, possible brain regions with higher gene expression levels and compounds exerting potential therapeutic effects were identified. Thus, this study can provide a novel idea to explore the treatment of AD.Differential expression genes (DEGs) of GSE5281 and GSE48350 from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database were screened using the Limma package. Next, the enrichment analysis was conducted on the screened DEGs. Moreover, the functional annotation was given for N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification gene. The protein-protein interaction network (PPI) analysis and the visualization analysis were conducted using STRING and Cytoscape. The hub gene was identified using CytoHubba. The expression levels of Hub genes in different regions of brain tissue were analyzed based on Human Protein Atlas (HPA) database and Bgee database. Subsequently, the candidate drugs targeting hub genes were screened using cMAP.A total of 42 m6A modified genes were identified in AD (20 up-regulated and 22 down-regulated genes). The above-described genes played a certain role in biological processes (e.g., retinoic acid, DNA damage response and cysteine-type endopeptidase activity), cellular components (e.g., mitochondrial protein complex), and molecular functions (e.g., RNA methyltransferase activity and ubiquitin protein ligase). KEGG results suggested that the above-mentioned genes were primarily involved in the Hippo signaling pathway of neurodegeneration disease. A total of 10 hub genes were screened using the protein-protein interaction network, and the expression of hub genes in different regions of human brain was studied. Furthermore, 10 compounds with potential therapeutic effects on AD were predicted.This study revealed the potential role of the m6A modification gene in Alzheimer's disease through the bioinformatics analysis. The biological changes may be correlated with retinoic acid, DNA damage response and cysteine-type endopeptidase activity, which may occur through Hippo signaling pathway. The hub genes (SOX2, KLF4, ITGB4, CD44, MSX1, YAP1, AQP1, EGR2, YWHAZ and TFAP2C) and potential drugs may provide novel research directions for future prognosis and precise treatment.Copyright: © 2023 Ni et al.

"37546994","Blood epigenome-wide association studies of suicide attempt in adults with bipolar disorder.","medRxiv","Suicide attempt (SA) risk is elevated in individuals with bipolar disorder (BD), and DNA methylation patterns may serve as possible biomarkers of SA. We conducted epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) of blood DNA methylation associated with BD and SA. DNA methylation was measured at > 700,000 positions in a discovery cohort of n = 84 adults with BD with a history of SA (BD/SA), n = 79 adults with BD without history of SA (BD/non-SA), and n = 76 non-psychiatric controls (CON). EWAS revealed six differentially methylated positions (DMPs) and seven differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between BD/SA and BD/non-SA, with multiple immune-related genes implicated. There were no epigenome-wide significant differences when BD/SA and BD/non-SA were each compared to CON, and patterns suggested that epigenetics differentiating BD/SA from BD/non-SA do not differentiate BD/non-SA from CON. Weighted gene co-methylation network analysis and trait enrichment analysis of the BD/SA vs. BD/non-SA contrast further corroborated immune system involvement, while gene ontology analysis implicated calcium signalling. In an independent replication cohort of n = 48 BD/SA and n = 47 BD/non-SA, fold-changes at the discovery cohort's significant sites showed moderate correlation across cohorts and agreement on direction. In both cohorts, classification accuracy for SA history among individuals with BD was highest when methylation at the significant CpG sites as well as information from clinical interviews were combined, with an AUC of 88.8% (CI = 83.8-93.8%) and 82.1% (CI = 73.6-90.5%) for the combined epigenetic-clinical predictor in the discovery and replication cohorts, respectively. Our results provide novel insight to the role of immune system functioning in SA and BD and also suggest that integrating information from multiple levels of analysis holds promise to improve risk assessment for SA in adults with BD."

Multinominal logistic regression models were applied to test the association between 1090 DNAm sites reported in three prior epigenome-wide association studies and BMI trajectories.DNAm site cg23089913 (NANOS1) and cg13217064 (SOX14) were associated with early persistent obesity (EPO) and delayed overweight (DOW) trajectories respectively. A higher methylation of cg23089913 showed low odds of being in EPO trajectory (OR: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.76-0.93) while higher methylation of cg13217064 resulted in 1.4-times the odds of being in DOW trajectory when compared to the normal trajectory [Correction added on 22 February 2023, after first online publication: Range of the DNAm site cg23089913 has been changed from 'lower' to 'higher' in the preceding sentence.].

EZH is closely associated with B-cell development and pathogenesis of certain malignant lymphomas. In follicular lymphoma (FL), gain-of-function mutation and upregulation of EZH2 are observed in approximately 30% and 15% of cases, respectively. Moreover, one-third of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas carry an EZH2 mutation, mostly co-existing with translocation involving Bcl-2. Genome-wide trimethylation of H3K27 is a unique characteristic induced by upregulation of both EZH2 and EZH1, and is responsible for more than half of the gene suppression that occurs in adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL). Inhibition of EZH can reduce H3K27 methylation and subsequently restore epigenetically suppressed genes. Currently, an EZH2 inhibitor and dual EZH1/2 inhibitor have been clinically used to treat relapsed/refractory FL and ATL, respectively. EZH-targeted treatment for lymphoma has only just begun, and further development of these drugs for various other malignancies, both alone and in combination with other therapeutics, is ongoing."

Aberrant DNA methylation plays a role in de novo cardiovascular disease. Epigenetic processes could play a role in anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy but remain unstudied. We sought to examine if genome-wide differential methylation at 'CpG' sites in peripheral blood DNA is associated with anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy. This report used participants from a matched case-control study; 52 non-Hispanic White, anthracycline-exposed childhood cancer survivors with cardiomyopathy were matched 1:1 with 52 survivors with no cardiomyopathy. Paired ChAMP (Chip Analysis Methylation Pipeline) with integrated reference-based deconvolution of adult peripheral blood DNA methylation was used to analyze data from Illumina HumanMethylation EPIC BeadChip arrays. An epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) was performed, and the model was adjusted for GrimAge, sex, interaction terms of age at enrollment, chest radiation, age at diagnosis squared, and cardiovascular risk factors (CVRFs: diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia). Prioritized genes were functionally validated by gene knockout in human induced pluripotent stem cell cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. DNA-methylation EPIC array analyses identified 32 differentially methylated probes (DMP: 15 hyper-methylated and 17 hypo-methylated probes) that overlap with 23 genes and 9 intergenic regions. Three hundred and fifty-four differential methylated regions (DMRs) were also identified. Several of these genes are associated with cardiac dysfunction. Knockout of genes EXO6CB, FCHSD2, NIPAL2, and SYNPO2 in hiPSC-CMs increased sensitivity to doxorubicin. In addition, EWAS analysis identified hypo-methylation of probe 'cg15939386' in gene RORA to be significantly associated with anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy. In this genome-wide DNA methylation profile study, we observed significant differences in DNA methylation at the CpG level between anthracycline-exposed childhood cancer survivors with and without cardiomyopathy, implicating differential DNA methylation of certain genes could play a role in pathogenesis of anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy.© 2023.

However, the meaning of m6A mRNAs in the peripheral blood of IPAH patients remains largely unexplored. We aimed to construct a transcriptome-wide map of m6A mRNAs in the peripheral blood of IPAH patients. M6A RNA Methylation Quantification Kit was utilized to measure the total m6A levels in the peripheral blood of IPAH patients. A combination of MeRIP-seq, RNA-seq and bioinformatics analysis was utilized to select m6A-modified hub genes of IPAH. MeRIP-qPCR and RT-qPCR were used to measure the m6A levels and mRNA levels of TP53, RPS27A, SMAD3 and FoxO3 in IPAH patients. Western blot was performed to assess the protein levels of m6A related regulators and m6A related genes in experimental PH animal models, hypoxia-treated and PDGF-BB induced PASMCs. We found that the total m6A levels were increased in peripheral blood of IPAH patients and verified that m6A levels of RPS27A and SMAD3 were significantly elevated and m6A levels of TP53 and FoxO3 were significantly reduced. The mRNA or protein levels of RPS27A, SMAD3, TP53 and FoxO3 were changed in human blood samples, experimental PH animal models and PDGF-BB induced PASMCs. Moreover, METTL3 and YTHDF1 were increased in the hypoxia induced pulmonary hypertension rat model, hypoxia-treated and PDGF-BB induced PASMCs.

Recent technological advances have enabled genome-wide profiling of DNAme in large human cohorts. There is a need for analytical methods that can more sensitively detect differential methylation profiles present in subsets of individuals from these heterogeneous, population-level datasets. We developed an end-to-end analytical framework named ""EpiMix"" for population-level analysis of DNAme and gene expression. Compared with existing methods, EpiMix showed higher sensitivity in detecting abnormal DNAme that was present in only small patient subsets. We extended the model-based analyses of EpiMix tocis-regulatory elements within protein-coding genes, distal enhancers, and genes encoding microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs).

We thus performed a prospective epigenome-wide association study of blood leukocyte DNAm (EPIC array) and time to CVD incidence over 28 years in a childhood-onset (< 17 years) type 1 diabetes cohort, the Pittsburgh Epidemiology of Diabetes Complications (EDC) study (n = 368 with DNA and no CVD at baseline), both overall and separately by glycemic exposure, as measured by HbA1c at baseline (split at the median: < 8.9% and ≥ 8.9%). We also assessed whether DNAm-CVD associations were independent of established cardiometabolic risk factors, including body mass index, estimated glucose disposal rate, cholesterol, triglycerides, blood pressure, pulse rate, albumin excretion rate, and estimated glomerular filtration rate.CVD (first instance of CVD death, myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, ischemic ECG, angina, or stroke) developed in 172 participants (46.7%) over 28 years. Overall, in Cox regression models for time to CVD, none of the 683,597 CpGs examined reached significance at a false discovery rate (FDR) ≤ 0.05. In participants with HbA1c < 8.9% (n = 180), again none reached FDR ≤ 0.05, but three were associated at the a priori nominal significance level FDR ≤ 0.10: cg07147033 in MIB2, cg12324048 (intergenic, chromosome 3), and cg15883830 (intergenic, chromosome 1). In participants with HbA1c ≥ 8.9% (n = 188), two CpGs in loci involved in calcium channel activity were significantly associated with CVD (FDR ≤ 0.05): cg21823999 in GPM6A and cg23621817 in CHRNA9; four additional CpGs were nominally associated (FDR ≤ 0.10). In participants with HbA1c ≥ 8.9%, DNAm-CVD associations were only modestly attenuated after cardiometabolic risk factor adjustment, while attenuation was greater in those with HbA1c < 8.9%. No pathways were enriched in those with HbA1c < 8.9%, while pathways for calcium channel activity and integral component of synaptic membrane were significantly enriched in those with HbA1c ≥ 8.9%.These results provide novel evidence that DNAm at loci involved in calcium channel activity and development may contribute to long-term CVD risk beyond known risk factors in type 1 diabetes, particularly in individuals with greater glycemic exposure, warranting further study.© 2023.

Despite many studies have revealed that the most important Chinese indigenous species，Apis cerana, is presenting a high risk on exposure to neonicotinoids, the toxicology information on Apis cerana remain limited. This study was aimed to determine the acute and chronic toxic effects of thiacloprid (IUPAC name: {(2Z)-3-[(6-Chloro-3-pyridinyl)methyl]-1,3-thiazolidin-2-ylidene}cyanamide) on behavioral and physiological performance as well as genome-wide transcriptome in A. cerana. We found the 1/5 LC50of thiacloprid significantly impaired learning and memory abilities after both acute and chronic exposure, nevertheless, has no effects on the sucrose responsiveness and phototaxis climbing ability of A. cerana. Moreover, activities of detoxification enzyme P450 monooxygenases and CarE were increased by short-term exposure to thiacloprid, while prolonged exposure caused suppression of CarE activity. Neither acute nor chronic exposure to thiacloprid altered honey bee AChE activities. To further study the potential defense molecular mechanisms in Asian honey bee under pesticide stress, we analyzed the transcriptomes of honeybees in response to thiacloprid stress. The transcriptomic profiles revealed consistent upregulation of immune- and stress-related genes by both acute or chronic treatments. Our results suggest that the chronic exposure to thiacloprid produced greater toxic effects than a single administration to A. cerana. Altogether, our study deepens the understanding of the toxicological characteristic of A. cerana against thiacloprid, and could be used to further investigate the complex molecular mechanisms in Asian honey bee under pesticide stress.Copyright © 2023.

"37531610","DNA methylation signatures of functional somatic syndromes: Systematic review.","Psychosom Med","Functional somatic syndromes (FSS) are highly prevalent across all levels of healthcare. The fact that they are characterised by medically unexplained symptoms, such as fatigue and pain, raises the important question of their underlying pathophysiology. Psychosocial stress represents a significant factor in the development of FSS and can induce long-term modifications at the epigenetic level. The aim of this review was to systematically review, for the first time, whether individuals with FSS are characterised by specific alterations in DNA methylation.MEDLINE and PsycINFO were searched from the first available date until September 2022. The inclusion criteria were: 1) adults fulfilling research diagnostic criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia syndrome, and/or irritable bowel syndrome, 2) healthy control group, and 3) candidate-gene or genome-wide study of DNA methylation.Sixteen studies (N = 957) were included. In candidate-gene studies, specific sites within NR3C1 were identified, which were hypomethylated in individuals with chronic fatigue syndrome compared to healthy controls. In genome-wide studies in chronic fatigue syndrome, a hypomethylated site located to LY86 and hypermethylated sites within HLA-DQB1 were found. In genome-wide studies in fibromyalgia syndrome, differential methylation in sites related to HDAC4, TMEM44, KCNQ1, SLC17A9, PRKG1, ALPK3, TFAP2A, and LY6G5C was found.Individuals with chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia syndrome appear to be characterised by altered DNA methylation of genes regulating cellular signalling and immune functioning. In chronic fatigue syndrome, there is preliminary evidence for these to be implicated in key pathophysiological alterations, such as hypocortisolism and low-grade inflammation, and to contribute to the debilitating symptoms these individuals experience.Preregistration PROSPERO identifier: CRD42022364720.Copyright © 2023 by the American Psychosomatic Society."

"37529262","Modulation of DNA methylation by one-carbon metabolism: a milestone for healthy aging.","Nutr Res Pract","Healthy aging can be defined as an extended lifespan and health span. Nutrition has been regarded as an important factor in healthy aging, because nutrients, bioactive food components, and diets have demonstrated beneficial effects on aging hallmarks such as oxidative stress, mitochondrial function, apoptosis and autophagy, genomic stability, and immune function. Nutrition also plays a role in epigenetic regulation of gene expression, and DNA methylation is the most extensively investigated epigenetic phenomenon in aging. Interestingly, age-associated DNA methylation can be modulated by one-carbon metabolism or inhibition of DNA methyltransferases. One-carbon metabolism ultimately controls the balance between the universal methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine and the methyltransferase inhibitor S-adenosylhomocysteine. Water-soluble B-vitamins such as folate, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12 serve as coenzymes for multiple steps in one-carbon metabolism, whereas methionine, choline, betaine, and serine act as methyl donors. Thus, these one-carbon nutrients can modify age-associated DNA methylation and subsequently alter the age-associated physiologic and pathologic processes. We cannot elude agingper sebut we may at least change age-associated DNA methylation, which could mitigate age-associated diseases and disorders.©2023 The Korean Nutrition Society and the Korean Society of Community Nutrition."
"37339167","Subclinical atherosclerosis and accelerated epigenetic age mediated by inflammation: a multi-omics study.","Eur Heart J","Epigenetic age is emerging as a personalized and accurate predictor of biological age. The aim of this article is to assess the association of subclinical atherosclerosis with accelerated epigenetic age and to investigate the underlying mechanisms mediating this association.Whole blood methylomics, transcriptomics, and plasma proteomics were obtained for 391 participants of the Progression of Early Subclinical Atherosclerosis study. Epigenetic age was calculated from methylomics data for each participant. Its divergence from chronological age is termed epigenetic age acceleration. Subclinical atherosclerosis burden was estimated by multi-territory 2D/3D vascular ultrasound and by coronary artery calcification. In healthy individuals, the presence, extension, and progression of subclinical atherosclerosis were associated with a significant acceleration of the Grim epigenetic age, a predictor of health and lifespan, regardless of traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Individuals with an accelerated Grim epigenetic age were characterized by an increased systemic inflammation and associated with a score of low-grade, chronic inflammation. Mediation analysis using transcriptomics and proteomics data revealed key pro-inflammatory pathways (IL6, Inflammasome, and IL10) and genes (IL1B, OSM, TLR5, and CD14) mediating the association between subclinical atherosclerosis and epigenetic age acceleration.The presence, extension, and progression of subclinical atherosclerosis in middle-aged asymptomatic individuals are associated with an acceleration in the Grim epigenetic age. Mediation analysis using transcriptomics and proteomics data suggests a key role of systemic inflammation in this association, reinforcing the relevance of interventions on inflammation to prevent cardiovascular disease.© The Author(s) 2023.

"37528982","Predicting transcriptional responses to heat and drought stress from genomic features using a machine learning approach in rice.","Front Plant Sci","Plants have evolved various mechanisms to adapt to adverse environmental stresses, such as the modulation of gene expression. Expression of stress-responsive genes is controlled by specific regulators, including transcription factors (TFs), that bind to sequence-specific binding sites, representing key components of cis-regulatory elements and regulatory networks. Our understanding of the underlying regulatory code remains, however, incomplete. Recent studies have shown that, by training machine learning (ML) algorithms on genomic sequence features, it is possible to predict which genes will transcriptionally respond to a specific stress. By identifying the most important features for gene expression prediction, these trained ML models allow, in theory, to further elucidate the regulatory code underlying the transcriptional response to abiotic stress. Here, we trained random forest ML models to predict gene expression in rice (Oryza sativa) in response to heat or drought stress. Apart from thoroughly assessing model performance and robustness across various input training data, the importance of promoter and gene body sequence features to train ML models was evaluated. The use of enriched promoter oligomers, complementing known TF binding sites, allowed us to gain novel insights in DNA motifs contributing to the stress regulatory code. By comparing genomic feature importance scores for drought and heat stress over time, general and stress-specific genomic features contributing to the performance of the learned models and their temporal variation were identified. This study provides a solid foundation to build and interpret ML models accurately predicting transcriptional responses and enables novel insights in biological sequence features that are important for abiotic stress responses.Copyright © 2023 Smet, Opdebeeck and Vandepoele."

This development is driven in part by gene expression, which in turn is partly regulated by DNA methylation (DNAm).Methods:We collected brain imaging, cognitive assessments, and DNAm in a longitudinal cohort of approximately 200 typically developing participants, aged 9-14. This data, from three time points roughly 1 year apart, was used to explore the relationships between seven cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites in genes highly expressed in brain tissues (GRIN2D,GABRB3,KCNC1,SLC12A9,CHD5,STXBP5, andNFASC), seven networks of grey matter (GM) volume change, and scores from seven cognitive tests.Results:The demethylation of the CpGs as well as the rates of change in DNAm were significantly related to improvements in total, crystalized, and fluid cognition scores, executive function, episodic memory, and processing speed, as well as several networks of GM volume increases and decreases that highlight typical patterns of brain maturation.Discussion:Our study provides a first look at the DNAm of genes involved in myelination, excitatory and inhibitory receptors, and connectivity, how they are related to the large-scale changes occurring in the brain structure as well as cognition during adolescence.Copyright © 2023 Jensen, Chen, Turner, Stephen, Wang, Wilson, Calhoun and Liu."

Nevertheless, the molecular mechanism of the neuroprotective effect of FNS is still vague.In this study, we developed a rat model of ischemia/reperfusion that included 1 h FNS followed by reperfusion for 3, 6, 12, 24, and 72 h. The expression profile of molecular alterations in brain tissues was obtained by transcriptome sequencing at five different time points. The function and pathway of miRNA expression pattern and core genes were annotated by Allen Brain Atlas, STRING database and Cytoscape software, so as to explore the mechanism of FNS-mediated neuroprotection.The results indicated that FNS is associated with the neurotransmitter cycle pathway. FNS may regulate the release of monoamine neurotransmitters in synaptic vesicles by targeting the corresponding miRNAs through core Dlg4 gene, stimulate the Alternative polyadenylation (APA) incident's anti -apoptosis effect on the brain, and stimulate the interaction activation of neurons in cerebellum, cortex/thalamus and other brain regions, regulate neurovascular coupling, and reduce cerebral damage.FNS may activate neuronal and neurovascular coupling by regulating the release of neurotransmitters in synaptic vesicles through the methylation of core Dlg4 gene and the corresponding transcription factors and protein kinases, inducing the anti-apoptotic mechanism of APA events. The findings from our investigation offer a new perspective on the way brain tissue responds to FNS-driven neuroprotection.© 2023. The Author(s)."

However, the epigenetic mechanisms governing peanut seed development remain unclear. Herein, we generated DNA methylation profiles of developmental seeds of peanut H2014 and its smaller seed mutant H1314 at 15 and 60 days after pegging (DAP, S1, S4). Accompanying seed development, globally elevated methylation was observed in both lines. The mutant had a higher methylation level of 31.1% than wild type at S4, and 27.1-35.9% of the differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between the two lines were distributed in promoter or genic regions at both stages. Integrated methylome and transcriptome analysis revealed important methylation variations closely associated with seed development. Furthermore, some genes showed significantly negative correlation of expression with the methylation level within promoter or gene body.

These proteins can be important clinical biomarkers in disease and also possible drug targets. Large scale genomics studies of circulating proteins can identify genetic variants that lead to relative protein abundance.We conducted a meta-analysis on genome-wide association studies of autosomal chromosomes in 22,997 individuals of primarily European ancestry across 12 cohorts to identify protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) for 92 cardiometabolic associated plasma proteins.We identified 503 (337 cis and 166 trans) conditionally independent pQTLs, including several novel variants not reported in the literature. We conducted a sex-stratified analysis and found that 118 (23.5%) of pQTLs demonstrated heterogeneity between sexes. The direction of effect was preserved but there were differences in effect size and significance. Additionally, we annotate trans-pQTLs with nearest genes and report plausible biological relationships.

"37487074",NA,NA,"Mammalian infants depend on parental care for survival, with numerous consequences for their behavioral development. We investigated the epigenetic and neurodevelopmental mechanisms mediating the impact of early biparental care on development of alloparenting behavior, or caring for offspring that are not one's own. We find that receiving high parental care early in life leads to slower epigenetic aging of both sexes and widespread male-specific differential expression of genes related to synaptic transmission and autism in the nucleus accumbens. Examination of parental care composition indicates that high-care fathers promote a male-specific increase in excitatory synapses and increases in pup retrieval behavior as juveniles. Interestingly, females raised by high-care fathers have the opposite behavioral response and display fewer pup retrievals. These results support the concept that neurodevelopmental trajectories are programmed by different features of early-life parental care and reveal that male neurodevelopmental processes are uniquely sensitive to care by fathers."

We also examined the relationship between HOXB9 expression levels and several factors including prognosis, immune infiltration, immune checkpoint genes, tumor mutational burden, microsatellite instability, mismatch repair, and DNA methylation. TIMER2.0 tool was conducted to explore the immune cell infiltrations related to HOXB9 in this analysis.It was discovered through a comprehensive analysis of multiple public datasets that HOXB9 expression was highly expressed in most tumor tissues and cancer cell lines and that distinct associations exist between HOXB9 expression and tumor patient prognosis. Besides, HOXB9 expression was closely associated with immune cell infiltration and checkpoint genes in many cancers. Further, HOXB9 was associated with immune cell infiltration, TMB, MSI, MMR, and DNA methylation. It was also confirmed that HOXB9 was highly expressed in clinical GBM tissues. Experiments further revealed that knockdown of HOXB9 expression could suppress proliferation, migration, and invasion of glioma cells.The results revealed that HOXB9, a robust tumor biomarker, has a significant prognostic value. HOXB9 may act as a new predictor to assess cancer prognosis and therapeutic efficacy of the immune in various cancers."

Previously, we identified a neural-related DNA hypermethylation fingerprint in colon cancer, where most of the top hypermethylated and downregulated genes have known functions in the nervous system. To evaluate the presence of this signature and its relevance to carcinogenesis in general, we considered 16 solid cancer types available in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).All tested cancers showed significant enrichment for neural-related genes amongst hypermethylated genes. This signature was already present in two premalignant tissue types and could not be explained by potential confounders such as bivalency status or tumor purity. Further characterization of the neural-related DNA hypermethylation signature in colon cancer showed particular enrichment for genes that are overexpressed during neural differentiation. Lastly, an analysis of upstream regulators identified RE1-Silencing Transcription factor (REST) as a potential mediator of this DNA methylation signature.Our study confirms the presence of a neural-related DNA hypermethylation fingerprint in various cancers, of genes linked to neural differentiation, and points to REST as a possible regulator of this mechanism.

The aims of this study are to extend the number of resting heart rate associated genetic variants and to obtain further insights in resting heart rate biology and its clinical consequences. A genome-wide meta-analysis of 100 studies in up to 835,465 individuals reveals 493 independent genetic variants in 352 loci, including 68 genetic variants outside previously identified resting heart rate associated loci. We prioritize 670 genes and in silico annotations point to their enrichment in cardiomyocytes and provide insights in their ECG signature. Two-sample Mendelian randomization analyses indicate that higher genetically predicted resting heart rate increases risk of dilated cardiomyopathy, but decreases risk of developing atrial fibrillation, ischemic stroke, and cardio-embolic stroke. We do not find evidence for a linear or non-linear genetic association between resting heart rate and all-cause mortality in contrast to our previous Mendelian randomization study. Systematic alteration of key differences between the current and previous Mendelian randomization study indicates that the most likely cause of the discrepancy between these studies arises from false positive findings in previous one-sample MR analyses caused by weak-instrument bias at lower P-value thresholds. The results extend our understanding of resting heart rate biology and give additional insights in its role in cardiovascular disease development.© 2023. The Author(s)."

To elucidate the underlying biological mechanisms, we performed multi-ancestry genetic analyses in ∼800,000 women, identifying 1,080 independent signals associated with age at menarche. Collectively these loci explained 11% of the trait variance in an independent sample, with women at the top and bottom 1% of polygenic risk exhibiting a ∼11 and ∼14-fold higher risk of delayed and precocious pubertal development, respectively. These common variant analyses were supported by exome sequence analysis of ∼220,000 women, identifying several genes, including rare loss of function variants inZNF483which abolished the impact of polygenic risk. Next, we implicated 660 genes in pubertal development using a combination ofin silicovariant-to-gene mapping approaches and integration with dynamic gene expression data from mouse embryonic GnRH neurons. This included an uncharacterized G-protein coupled receptorGPR83, which we demonstrate amplifies signaling ofMC3R, a key sensor of nutritional status.

Famine exposure was classified as unexposed (individuals born in 1962-1978), fetal exposed (individuals born in 1959-1961), child exposed (individuals born in 1949-1958), and adolescent/adult exposed (born in 1931-1948). A logistic regression model was used to assess the relationship between famine exposure and diabetes after adjustment for potential covariates.During a three-year follow-up, the age-adjusted incidence rates of type 2 diabetes were 5.7%, 14.5%, 12.7%, and 17.8% in unexposed, fetal-exposed, child-exposed, and adolescent/adult-exposed groups, respectively (P< 0.01). Relative to the unexposed group, the relative risks (95% confidence interval) for diabetes were 2.15 (1.29-3.60), 1.53 (0.93-2.51), and 1.65 (0.75-3.63) in the fetal-exposed, child-exposed, and adolescent/adult-exposed groups, after controlling for potential covariates. The interactions between famine exposure and obesity, education level, and family history of diabetes were not observed, except for the urbanization type. Individuals living in rural areas with fetal and childhood famine exposure were at a higher risk of type 2 diabetes, with relative risks of 8.79 (1.82-42.54) and 2.33 (1.17-4.65), respectively.These findings indicate that famine exposure in early life is an independent predictor of type 2 diabetes, particularly in women.

Under normal conditions, copper ions are required for many key physiological processes. However, in excess, copper quickly results in cell and tissue damage that can range in severity from temporary injury to permanent neurological damage. Because of its biological relevance, and because many conserved copper-responsive genes also respond to other non-essential heavy metal pollutants, copper resistance inDrosophila melanogasteris a useful model system with which to investigate the genetic control of the response to heavy metal stress. Because heavy metal toxicity has the potential to differently impact specific tissues, we genetically characterized the control of the gene expression response to copper stress in a tissue- specific manner in this study. We assessed the copper stress response in head and gut tissue of 96 inbred strains from theDrosophilaSynthetic Population Resource (DSPR) using a combination of differential expression analysis and expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping. Differential expression analysis revealed clear patterns of tissue-specific expression, primarily driven by a more pronounced gene expression response in gut tissue. eQTL mapping of gene expression under control and copper conditions as well as for the change in gene expression following copper exposure (copper response eQTL) revealed hundreds of genes with tissue- specific localcis-eQTL and many distanttrans-eQTL. eQTL associated withMtnA,Mdr49,Mdr50, andSod3exhibited genotype by environment effects on gene expression under copper stress, illuminating several tissue- and treatment-specific patterns of gene expression control. Together, our data build a nuanced description of the roles and interactions between allelic and expression variation in copper-responsive genes, provide valuable insight into the genomic architecture of susceptibility to metal toxicity, and highlight many candidate genes for future functional characterization."

Nonetheless, the presence of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) in mitochondrial DNA remains controversial, as data ranging from the lack of 5mC to very extensive 5mC have been reported.By conducting comprehensive bioinformatic analyses of both published and our own data, we reveal that previous observations of extensive and strand-biased mtDNA-5mC are likely artifacts due to a combination of factors including inefficient bisulfite conversion, extremely low sequencing reads in the L strand, and interference from nuclear mitochondrial DNA sequences (NUMTs). To reduce false positive mtDNA-5mC signals, we establish an optimized procedure for library preparation and data analysis of bisulfite sequencing. Leveraging our modified workflow, we demonstrate an even distribution of 5mC signals across the mtDNA and an average methylation level ranging from 0.19% to 0.67% in both cell lines and primary cells, which is indistinguishable from the background noise.We have developed a framework for analyzing mtDNA-5mC through bisulfite sequencing, which enables us to present multiple lines of evidence for the lack of extensive 5mC in mammalian mtDNA.

"37552321","The genomic landscape of mammal domestication might be orchestrated by selected transcription factors regulating brain and craniofacial development.","Dev Genes Evol","Domestication transforms once wild animals into tamed animals that can be then exploited by humans. The process entails modifications in the body, cognition, and behavior that are essentially driven by differences in gene expression patterns. Although genetic and epigenetic mechanisms were shown to underlie such differences, less is known about the role exerted by trans-regulatory molecules, notably transcription factors (TFs) in domestication. In this paper, we conducted extensive in silico analyses aimed to clarify the TF landscape of mammal domestication. We first searched the literature, so as to establish a large list of genes selected with domestication in mammals. From this list, we selected genes experimentally demonstrated to exhibit TF functions. We also considered TFs displaying a statistically significant number of targets among the entire list of (domestication) selected genes. This workflow allowed us to identify 5 candidate TFs (SOX2, KLF4, MITF, NR3C1, NR3C2) that were further assessed in terms of biochemical and functional properties. We found that such TFs-of-interest related to mammal domestication are all significantly involved in the development of the brain and the craniofacial region, as well as the immune response and lipid metabolism. A ranking strategy, essentially based on a survey of protein-protein interactions datasets, allowed us to identify SOX2 as the main candidate TF involved in domestication-associated evolutionary changes. These findings should help to clarify the molecular mechanics of domestication and are of interest for future studies aimed to understand the behavioral and cognitive changes associated to domestication.© 2023.

In healthy cells, promoters of active genes are hypomethylated. A single CpG methylation within a TF response element (RE) may change the binding preferences of the protein, thus causing the dysregulation of transcription programs. Here, we investigate a molecular mechanism driving the downregulation of theNDUFA13gene, due to hypermethylation, which is associated with multiple cancers. Using bioinformatic analyses of breast cancer cell line MCF7, we identify a hypermethylated region containing the binding sites of two TFs dimers, CEBPB and E2F1-DP1, located 130 b.p. from the gene transcription start site. All-atom extended MD simulations of wild type and methylated DNA alone and in complex with either one or both TFs dimers provide mechanistic insights into the cooperative asymmetric binding order of the two dimers; the CEBPB binding should occur first to facilitate the E2F1-DP1-DNA association. The CpG methylation within the E2F1-DP1 RE and the linker decrease the cooperativity effects and renders the E2F1-DP1 binding site less recognizable by the TF dimer. Taken together, the identified CpG methylation site may contribute to the downregulation of theNDUFA13gene.© The Author(s) 2022."

The basis for the epigenetic subtypes, exemplified by varying degrees of promoter DNA hypermethylation, and its relation to the transcriptional subtypes is not well understood. We link cancer-specific transcription factor (TF) expression alterations to methylation alterations near TF-binding sites at promoter and enhancer regions in CRCs and their premalignant precursor lesions to provide mechanistic insights into the origins and evolution of the CRC molecular subtypes. A gradient of TF expression changes forms a basis for the subtypes of abnormal DNA methylation, termed CpG-island promoter DNA methylation phenotypes (CIMPs), in CRCs and other cancers. CIMP is tightly correlated with cancer-specific hypermethylation at enhancers, which we term CpG-enhancer methylation phenotype (CEMP). Coordinated promoter and enhancer methylation appears to be driven by downregulation of TFs with common binding sites at the hypermethylated enhancers and promoters. The altered expression of TFs related to hypermethylator subtypes occurs early during CRC development, detectable in premalignant adenomas. TF-based profiling further identifies patients with worse overall survival.

However, genetic variants that may affect DNA methylation (DNAm) pattern, called methylation quantitative loci (mQTL), are usually overlooked in these analyses. We investigated whether mQTL change the relationship between dietary nutrient intake and leukocyte DNAm levels with an example of estimated fatty acid intake and ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1).A cross-sectional study on 231 participants (108 men, mean age: 62.7 y) without clinical history of cancer and no prescriptions for dyslipidemia. We measured leukocyte DNAm levels of 8 CpG sites within ABCA1 gene by pyrosequencing method and used mean methylation levels for statistical analysis. TaqMan assay was used for genotyping a genetic variant of ABCA1 (rs1800976). Dietary fatty acid intake was estimated with a validated food frequency questionnaire and adjusted for total energy intake by using residual methods.Mean ABCA1 DNAm levels were 5% lower with the number of minor alleles in rs1800976 (CC, 40.6%; CG, 35.9%; GG, 30.6%). Higher dietary n-3 PUFA intake was associated with lower ABCA1 DNAm levels (1st (ref) vs. 4th, β [95% CI]: -2.52 [-4.77, -0.28]). After controlling for rs180076, the association between dietary n-3 PUFA intake and ABCA1 DNAm levels was attenuated, but still showed an independent association (1st (ref) vs. 4th, β [95% CI]: -2.00 [-3.84, -0.18]). The interaction of mQTL and dietary n-3 PUFA intake on DNAm levels was not significant.This result suggested that dietary n-3 PUFA intake would be an independent predictor of DNAm levels in ABCA1 gene after adjusting for individual genetic background. Considering mQTL need to broaden into other genes and nutrients for deeper understanding of DNA methylation, which can contribute to personalized nutritional intervention.© 2023.

"37550455","Multivariate genome-wide analysis of aging-related traits identifies novel loci and new drug targets for healthy aging.","Nat Aging","The concept of aging is complex, including many related phenotypes such as healthspan, lifespan, extreme longevity, frailty and epigenetic aging, suggesting shared biological underpinnings; however, aging-related endpoints have been primarily assessed individually. Using data from these traits and multivariate genome-wide association study methods, we modeled their underlying genetic factor ('mvAge'). mvAge (effective n = ~1.9 million participants of European ancestry) identified 52 independent variants in 38 genomic loci. Twenty variants were novel (not reported in input genome-wide association studies). Transcriptomic imputation identified age-relevant genes, including VEGFA and PHB1. Drug-target Mendelian randomization with metformin target genes showed a beneficial impact on mvAge (P value = 8.41 × 10-5). Similarly, genetically proxied thiazolidinediones (P value = 3.50 × 10-10), proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 inhibition (P value = 1.62 × 10-6), angiopoietin-like protein 4, beta blockers and calcium channel blockers also had beneficial Mendelian randomization estimates. Extending the drug-target Mendelian randomization framework to 3,947 protein-coding genes prioritized 122 targets. Together, these findings will inform future studies aimed at improving healthy aging.© 2023.

We employed an integrative analytical pipeline to transform genetic associations to identify novel plasma proteins for VTE. Proteome-wide association studies (PWAS) were determined by functional summary-based imputation leveraging data from a genome-wide association analysis (14,429 VTE patients, 267,037 controls), blood proteomes (1348 cases), followed by Mendelian randomization, Bayesian colocalization, protein-protein interaction, and pathway enrichment analysis. Twenty genetically regulated circulating protein abundances (F2, F11, ABO, PLCG2, LRP4, PLEK, KLKB1, PROC, KNG1, THBS2, SERPINA1, RARRES2, CEL, GP6, SERPINE2, SERPINA10, OBP2B, EFEMP1, F5, and MSR1) were associated with VTE. Of these 13 proteins demonstrated Mendelian randomized correlations. Six proteins (F2, F11, PLEK, SERPINA1, RARRES2, and SERPINE2) had strong support in colocalization analysis. Utilizing multidimensional data, this study suggests PLEK, SERPINA1, and SERPINE2 as compelling proteins that may provide key hints for future research and possible diagnostic and therapeutic targets for VTE.© 2023.

Investigating shared genetic components between metabolites and AMD can enhance our understanding of its pathogenesis. We conduct metabolite genome-wide association studies (mGWASs) using multi-ethnic genetic and metabolomic data from up to 28,000 participants. With bidirectional Mendelian randomization analysis involving 16,144 advanced AMD cases and 17,832 controls, we identify 108 putatively causal relationships between plasma metabolites and advanced AMD. These metabolites are enriched in glycerophospholipid metabolism, lysophospholipid, triradylcglycerol, and long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid pathways. Bayesian genetic colocalization analysis and a customized metabolome-wide association approach prioritize putative causal AMD-associated metabolites. We find limited evidence linking urine metabolites to AMD risk. Our study emphasizes the contribution of plasma metabolites, particularly lipid-related pathways and genes, to AMD risk and uncovers numerous putative causal associations between metabolites and AMD risk.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

Studying BED is challenging because it is often comorbid with obesity, a common and highly polygenic trait, and it is underdiagnosed in biobank data sets. To address this limitation, we apply a supervised machine-learning approach (using 822 cases of individuals diagnosed with BED) to estimate the probability of each individual having BED based on electronic medical records from the Million Veteran Program. We perform a genome-wide association study of individuals of African (n = 77,574) and European (n = 285,138) ancestry while controlling for body mass index to identify three independent loci near the HFE, MCHR2 and LRP11 genes and suggest APOE as a risk gene for BED. We identify shared heritability between BED and several neuropsychiatric traits, and implicate iron metabolism in the pathophysiology of BED. Overall, our findings provide insights into the genetics underlying BED and suggest directions for future translational research.© 2023.

"37503172","Common- and rare-variant genetic architecture of heart failure across the allele frequency spectrum.","medRxiv","Heart failure (HF) is a complex trait, influenced by environmental and genetic factors, that affects over 30 million individuals worldwide. Historically, the genetics of HF have been studied in Mendelian forms of disease, linking rare genetic variants to familial cardiomyopathies. More recently, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified common genetic variants associated with risk of HF. However, the relative importance of genetic variants across the allele-frequency spectrum remains incompletely characterized. Here, we report the results of common- and rare-variant association studies of all-cause heart failure, applying recently developed methods to quantify the heritability of HF attributable to different classes of genetic variation. We combine GWAS data across multi-ancestry populations including 207,346 individuals from HF and 2,151,210 without, identifying 176 risk loci at genome-wide significance (p < 5×10-8). Signals at newly identified common-variant loci include coding variants in Mendelian cardiomyopathy genes (MYBPC3, BAG3), as well as regulators of lipoprotein (LPL) and glucose metabolism (GIPR, GLP1R), and are enriched in cardiac, muscle, nerve, and vascular tissues, as well as myocyte and adipocyte cell types. Gene burden studies in the Penn Medicine BioBank uncover exome-wide significant (p < 3.03×10-6) associations for HF and rare predicted loss-of-function variants inTTNandMYBPC3. Although the total burden heritability of rare coding variants in HF (3.5%, 95% CI 0.94-6.0%) is comparable to common variant heritability (4.3%, 95% CI 3.9-4.7%), burden heritability is highly concentrated in a small set of Mendelian cardiomyopathy genes (30.4% explained byTTN, LMNA, FLNC, andMYBPC3), while common-variant heritability is more diffusely spread throughout the genome. Finally, we demonstrate that common-variant background, in the form of a polygenic risk score (PRS), significantly modifies the risk of HF among carriers of pathogenic truncating variants in the Mendelian cardiomyopathy gene TTN. These findings suggest a significant polygenic component to HF exists that is not captured by current clinical genetic testing."

Here we recapitulate the homologous human variant in mice with global and brown adipocyte-specific variant knock-in and reveal that mice carrying the C-allele show increased brown fat thermogenic capacity and resistance to high-fat diet-induced adiposity, whereas the obesity-related phenotypic changes are blunted at thermoneutrality. Both in vivo and in vitro data reveal that the C-allele in brown adipocytes enhances the transcription of the Fto gene, which is associated with stronger chromatin looping linking the enhancer region and Fto promoter. Moreover, FTO knockdown or inhibition effectively eliminates the increased thermogenic ability of brown adipocytes carrying the C-allele. Taken together, these findings identify rs1421085 T>C as a functional variant promoting brown fat thermogenesis.© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited."

"37543680","Multi-PGS enhances polygenic prediction by combining 937 polygenic scores.","Nat Commun","The predictive performance of polygenic scores (PGS) is largely dependent on the number of samples available to train the PGS. Increasing the sample size for a specific phenotype is expensive and takes time, but this sample size can be effectively increased by using genetically correlated phenotypes. We propose a framework to generate multi-PGS from thousands of publicly available genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with no need to individually select the most relevant ones. In this study, the multi-PGS framework increases prediction accuracy over single PGS for all included psychiatric disorders and other available outcomes, with prediction R2increases of up to 9-fold for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder compared to a single PGS. We also generate multi-PGS for phenotypes without an existing GWAS and for case-case predictions. We benchmark the multi-PGS framework against other methods and highlight its potential application to new emerging biobanks.© 2023. Springer Nature Limited."

However, the extent to which they share genetic influences remains unclear. Here, we performed a comprehensive analysis of GWAS data, involving nearly 1 million cases across ten neurological diseases and ten psychiatric disorders, to compare their common genetic risk and biological underpinnings. Using complementary statistical tools, we demonstrate extensive genetic overlap across the disorders, with varying degrees of genetic correlations. In particular, migraine, essential tremor, stroke and multiple sclerosis were genetically correlated with several psychiatric disorders. Biological interrogation indicated heterogenous biological processes associated with neurological diseases, while psychiatric disorders consistently implicated neuronal biology. Altogether, the study demonstrates that neurological and psychiatric disorders are not genetically disparate, but share key etiological aspects, which have important implications for disease classification, clinical practice, and genomic precision medicine."
"37502935","The Cardiovascular Impact and Genetics of Pericardial Adiposity.","medRxiv","While previous studies have reported associations of pericardial adipose tissue (PAT) with cardiovascular diseases such as atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease, they have been limited in sample size or drawn from selected populations. Additionally, the genetic determinants of PAT remain largely unknown. We aimed to evaluate the association of PAT with prevalent and incident cardiovascular disease and to elucidate the genetic basis of PAT in a large population cohort.A deep learning model was trained to quantify PAT area from four-chamber magnetic resonance images in the UK Biobank using semantic segmentation. Cross-sectional and prospective cardiovascular disease associations were evaluated, controlling for sex and age. A genome-wide association study was performed, and a polygenic score (PGS) for PAT was examined in 453,733 independent FinnGen study participants.A total of 44,725 UK Biobank participants (51.7% female, mean [SD] age 64.1 [7.7] years) were included. PAT was positively associated with male sex (β = +0.76 SD in PAT), age (r= 0.15), body mass index (BMI;r= 0.47) and waist-to-hip ratio (r= 0.55) (P < 1×10-230). PAT was more elevated in prevalent heart failure (β = +0.46 SD units) and type 2 diabetes (β = +0.56) than in coronary artery disease (β = +0.22) or AF (β = +0.18). PAT was associated with incident heart failure (HR = 1.29 per +1 SD in PAT [95% CI 1.17-1.43]) and type 2 diabetes (HR = 1.63 [1.51-1.76]) during a mean 3.2 (±1.5) years of follow-up; the associations remained significant when controlling for BMI. We identified 5 novel genetic loci for PAT and implicated transcriptional regulators of adipocyte morphology and brown adipogenesis (EBF1,EBF2andCEBPA) and regulators of visceral adiposity (WARS2andTRIB2). The PAT PGS was associated with T2D, heart failure, coronary artery disease and atrial fibrillation in FinnGen (ORs 1.03-1.06 per +1 SD in PGS, P < 2×10-10).PAT shares genetic determinants with abdominal adiposity and is an independent predictor of incident type 2 diabetes and heart failure.What is new? In a large, prospective and uniformly phenotyped cohort, pericardial adipose tissue was independently predictive of incident heart failure and type 2 diabetes when adjusted for body mass index.In contrast, pericardial adipose tissue was not independently predictive of atrial fibrillation.A genome-wide association study of pericardial adipose tissue identified five novel loci, implicating genes influencing adipocyte morphology, brown-like adipose tissue differentiation and abdominal adiposity. What are the clinical implications? Pericardial adipose tissue accumulation may reflect a metabolically unhealthy adiposity phenotype similarly to abdominal visceral adiposity."

We prove that ExM is applicable in analyzing highly compacted nuclear multiprotein complexes such as viral capsids and provide technical improvements to ExM method including three-dimensional-printed gel casting equipment. We show that in comparison with conventional immunostaining, IT-IF results in a higher signal-to-background ratio and a mean fluorescence intensity by improving the labeling density. Moreover, we present a signal-processing pipeline for noise estimation, denoising, and deblurring to aid in quantitative image analyses and provide this platform for the microscopy imaging community. Finally, we show the potential of signal-resolved IT-IF in quantitative superresolution ExM imaging of nuclear lamina and reveal nanoscopic details of the lamin network organization-a prerequisite for studying intranuclear structural coregulation of cell function and fate."

Reported risk factors include inherited and acquired hypercoagulable states or other predisposing factors. However, many patients have no identifiable etiology, and causes of BCS differ between the West and East. This study recruited 500 BCS patients and 696 normal individuals for whole-exome sequencing and developed a polygenic risk scoring (PRS) model using PLINK, LASSOSUM, BLUP, and BayesA methods. Risk factors for venous thromboembolism and vascular malformations were also assessed for BCS risk prediction. Ultimately, we discovered potential BCS risk mutations, such as rs1042331, and the optimal BayesA-generated PRS model presented an AUC >0.9 in the external replication cohort. This model provides particular insights into genetic risk differences between China and the West and suggests shared genetic risks among BCS, venous thromboembolism, and vascular malformations, offering different perspectives on BCS pathogenesis.© 2023 The Authors."
"37550323","Getting personal with epigenetics: towards individual-specific epigenomic imputation with machine learning.","Nat Commun","Epigenetic modifications are dynamic mechanisms involved in the regulation of gene expression. Unlike the DNA sequence, epigenetic patterns vary not only between individuals, but also between different cell types within an individual. Environmental factors, somatic mutations and ageing contribute to epigenetic changes that may constitute early hallmarks or causal factors of disease. Epigenetic modifications are reversible and thus promising therapeutic targets for precision medicine. However, mapping efforts to determine an individual's cell-type-specific epigenome are constrained by experimental costs and tissue accessibility. To address these challenges, we developed eDICE, an attention-based deep learning model that is trained to impute missing epigenomic tracks by conditioning on observed tracks. Using a recently published set of epigenomes from four individual donors, we show that transfer learning across individuals allows eDICE to successfully predict individual-specific epigenetic variation even in tissues that are unmapped in a given donor. These results highlight the potential of machine learning-based imputation methods to advance personalized epigenomics.© 2023. Springer Nature Limited."

We aimed to examine associations of 10-year exposures to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) with risks of breast, prostate, colorectal, and endometrial cancers.For each cancer, we constructed a separate cohort among the national Medicare beneficiaries during 2000 to 2016. We simultaneously examined the additive associations of six exposures, namely, moving average exposures to PM2.5and NO2over the year of diagnosis and previous 2 years, previous 3 to 5 years, and previous 6 to 10 years, with the risk of first cancer diagnosis after 10 years of follow-up, during which there was no cancer diagnosis.The cohorts included 2.2 to 6.5 million subjects for different cancers. Exposures to PM2.5and NO2were associated with increased risks of colorectal and prostate cancers but were not associated with endometrial cancer risk. NO2was associated with a decreased risk of breast cancer, while the association for PM2.5remained inconclusive. At exposure levels below the newly updated World Health Organization Air Quality Guideline, we observed substantially larger associations between most exposures and the risks of all cancers, which were translated to hundreds to thousands new cancer cases per year within the cohort per unit increase in each exposure.These findings suggested substantial cancer burden was associated with exposures to PM2.5and NO2, emphasizing the urgent need for strategies to mitigate air pollution levels.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

To fully understand how craniofacial disorders arise, it is essential to characterize gene expression during the patterning of the craniofacial region. To address this, we performed bulk and single-cell RNA-seq on human craniofacial tissue from 4-8 weeks post conception. Comparisons to dozens of other human tissues revealed 239 genes most strongly expressed during craniofacial development. Craniofacial-biased developmental enhancers were enriched +/- 400 kb surrounding these craniofacial-biased genes. Gene co-expression analysis revealed that regulatory hubs are enriched for known disease causing genes and are resistant to mutation in the normal healthy population. Combining transcriptomic and epigenomic data we identified 539 genes likely to contribute to craniofacial disorders. While most have not been previously implicated in craniofacial disorders, we demonstrate this set of genes has increased levels of de novo mutations in orofacial clefting patients warranting further study.© 2023.

Functional neuroimaging research, including functional connectivity (FC) using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI), has identified neural aberrations related to HIV infection. Yet little is known about the relationship between aging and resting-state FC in PWH. This study included 86 virally suppressed PWH and 99 demographically matched controls spanning 22-72 years old who underwent rs-fMRI. The independent and interactive effects of HIV and aging on FC were investigated both within- and between-network using a 7-network atlas. The relationship between HIV-related cognitive deficits and FC was also examined. We also conducted network-based statistical analyses using a brain anatomical atlas (n = 512 regions) to ensure similar results across independent approaches. We found independent effects of age and HIV in between-network FC. The age-related increases in FC were widespread, while PWH displayed further increases above and beyond aging, particularly between-network FC of the default-mode and executive control networks. The results were overall similar using the regional approach. Since both HIV infection and aging are associated with independent increases in between-network FC, HIV infection may be associated with a reorganization of the major brain networks and their functional interactions in a manner similar to aging.© 2023 The Authors.

Evidence suggests that DNA methylation may play a role, as it is involved in critical adaptations to changing environments. Applying an enrichment-based sequencing approach covering nearly 28 million autosomal CpG sites, we conducted a methylome-wide association study (MWAS) of lifetime ANX in 1132 participants (618 cases/514 controls) from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety. Using epigenomic deconvolution, we performed MWAS for the main cell types in blood: granulocytes, T-cells, B-cells and monocytes. Cell-type specific analyses identified 280 and 82 methylome-wide significant associations (q-value < 0.1) in monocytes and granulocytes, respectively. Our top finding in monocytes was located in ZNF823 on chromosome 19 (p = 1.38 × 10-10) previously associated with schizophrenia. We observed significant overlap (p < 1 × 10-06) with the same direction of effect in monocytes (210 sites), T-cells (135 sites), and B-cells (727 sites) between this Discovery MWAS signal and a comparable replication dataset from the Great Smoky Mountains Study (N = 433). Overlapping Discovery-Replication MWAS signal was enriched for findings from published GWAS of ANX, major depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder. In monocytes, two specific sites in the FZR1 gene showed significant replication after Bonferroni correction with an additional 15 nominally replicated sites in monocytes and 4 in T-cells. FZR1 regulates neurogenesis in the hippocampus, and its knockout leads to impairments in associative fear memory and long-term potentiation in mice. In the largest and most extensive methylome-wide study of ANX, we identified replicable methylation sites located in genes of potential relevance for brain mechanisms of psychiatric conditions.© 2023.

"37532932","cGAS-STING drives ageing-related inflammation and neurodegeneration.","Nature","Low-grade inflammation is a hallmark of old age and a central driver of ageing-associated impairment and disease1. Multiple factors can contribute to ageing-associated inflammation2; however, the molecular pathways that transduce aberrant inflammatory signalling and their impact in natural ageing remain unclear. Here we show that the cGAS-STING signalling pathway, which mediates immune sensing of DNA3, is a critical driver of chronic inflammation and functional decline during ageing. Blockade of STING suppresses the inflammatory phenotypes of senescent human cells and tissues, attenuates ageing-related inflammation in multiple peripheral organs and the brain in mice, and leads to an improvement in tissue function. Focusing on the ageing brain, we reveal that activation of STING triggers reactive microglial transcriptional states, neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. Cytosolic DNA released from perturbed mitochondria elicits cGAS activity in old microglia, defining a mechanism by which cGAS-STING signalling is engaged in the ageing brain. Single-nucleus RNA-sequencing analysis of microglia and hippocampi of a cGAS gain-of-function mouse model demonstrates that engagement of cGAS in microglia is sufficient to direct ageing-associated transcriptional microglial states leading to bystander cell inflammation, neurotoxicity and impaired memory capacity. Our findings establish the cGAS-STING pathway as a driver of ageing-related inflammation in peripheral organs and the brain, and reveal blockade of cGAS-STING signalling as a potential strategy to halt neurodegenerative processes during old age.© 2023.

However, it was recently proposed that latent virus is also present in immune cells recovered from ganglia in a mouse model used for studying latency. Here, we reanalyzed the single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) data that formed the basis for this conclusion. Unexpectedly, off-target priming in 3' scRNA-Seq experiments enabled the detection of non-polyadenylated HSV-1latency-associated transcript(LAT) intronic RNAs. However,LATreads were near-exclusively detected in a mixed population of cells undergoing cell death. Specific loss of HSV-1LATand neuronal transcripts during quality control filtering indicated widespread destruction of neurons, supporting the presence of contaminating cell-free RNA in other cells following tissue processing. In conclusion, the reported detection of latent HSV-1 in non-neuronal cells is best explained by inaccuracies in the data analyses."
"37537674","Biomarkers of obesity-mediated insulin resistance: focus on microRNAs.","Diabetol Metab Syndr","Obesity and metabolic syndromes are becoming increasingly prevalent worldwide. Insulin resistance (IR) is a common complication of obesity. However, IR occurrence varies across individuals with obesity and may involve epigenetic factors. To rationalize the allocation of healthcare resources, biomarkers for the early risk stratification of individuals with obesity should be identified. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are closely associated with metabolic diseases and involved in epigenetic regulation. In this review, we have summarized the changes in miRNA expression in the peripheral circulation and tissues of patients and animals with obesity-associated IR over the last 5 years and identified several candidate biomarkers that predict obesity-related IR. There are areas for improvement in existing studies. First, more than the predictive validity of a single biomarker is required, and a biomarker panel needs to be formed. Second, miRNAs are often studied in isolation and do not form a network of signaling pathways. We believe that early biomarkers can help clinicians accurately predict individuals prone to obesity-related IR at an early stage. Epigenetic regulation may be one of the underlying causes of different clinical outcomes in individuals with obesity. Future studies should focus on objectively reflecting the differences in miRNA profile expression in individuals with obesity-related IR, which may help identify more reliable biomarkers.

"37533767","Applications of multi-omics analysis in human diseases.","MedComm (2020)","Multi-omics usually refers to the crossover application of multiple high-throughput screening technologies represented by genomics, transcriptomics, single-cell transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics, spatial transcriptomics, and so on, which play a great role in promoting the study of human diseases. Most of the current reviews focus on describing the development of multi-omics technologies, data integration, and application to a particular disease; however, few of them provide a comprehensive and systematic introduction of multi-omics. This review outlines the existing technical categories of multi-omics, cautions for experimental design, focuses on the integrated analysis methods of multi-omics, especially the approach of machine learning and deep learning in multi-omics data integration and the corresponding tools, and the application of multi-omics in medical researches (e.g., cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, aging, and drug target discovery) as well as the corresponding open-source analysis tools and databases, and finally, discusses the challenges and future directions of multi-omics integration and application in precision medicine. With the development of high-throughput technologies and data integration algorithms, as important directions of multi-omics for future disease research, single-cell multi-omics and spatial multi-omics also provided a detailed introduction. This review will provide important guidance for researchers, especially who are just entering into multi-omics medical research.© 2023 The Authors.

"37524737","Paving the way to better understand the effects of prolonged spaceflight on operational performance and its neural bases.","NPJ Microgravity","Space exploration objectives will soon move from low Earth orbit to distant destinations like Moon and Mars. The present work provides an up-to-date roadmap that identifies critical research gaps related to human behavior and performance in altered gravity and space. The roadmap summarizes (1) key neurobehavioral challenges associated with spaceflight, (2) the need to consider sex as a biological variable, (3) the use of integrative omics technologies to elucidate mechanisms underlying changes in the brain and behavior, and (4) the importance of understanding the neural representation of gravity throughout the brain and its multisensory processing. We then highlight the need for a variety of target-specific countermeasures, and a personalized administration schedule as two critical strategies for mitigating potentially adverse effects of spaceflight on the central nervous system and performance. We conclude with a summary of key priorities for the roadmaps of current and future space programs and stress the importance of new collaborative strategies across agencies and researchers for fostering an integrative cross- and transdisciplinary approach from cells, molecules to neural circuits and cognitive performance. Finally, we highlight that space research in neurocognitive science goes beyond monitoring and mitigating risks in astronauts but could also have significant benefits for the population on Earth.© 2023.

"37543823","A novel cuproptosis-related genes model in breast cancer prognosis.","Medicine (Baltimore)","Breast cancer (BRCA) is a highly heterogeneous malignancy with an urgent need to build a proper model to predict its prognosis. Cuproptosis is a recently discovered form of cell death, mediated by protein fatty acylation and tightly associated with mitochondrial metabolism. The role of cuproptosis-related genes (CRGs) in BRCA remains to be explored. We aimed to investigate the applications of CRGs in BRCA prognosis in different clinical contexts, including chemotherapy and immunotherapy, via bioinformatics analysis of the messenger RNA profiles and clinical data obtained from public databases. Molecular subtyping of CRGs was performed through consistent clustering analysis. Differentially expressed genes between different CRG clusters were identified. The differentially expressed genes were then used to build a risk assessment model using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression to predict patient survival with BRCA. The model was then validated with the data from the Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium, GSE96058, and GSE20685. Differences in somatic mutations, copy number variations, hallmark pathways, drug responses, and prognosis of immunotherapy and chemotherapy were analyzed by comparing the high-risk and low-risk groups. Patients with high-risk scores showed worse overall survival than those with low-risk scores. The results indicated significant differences between the 2 groups immune-related biological pathways and the variable immune status. It also suggests the differential sensitivity to chemotherapy between the 2 groups. The CRGs model showed the promise to predict the prognosis of BRCA patients and shed light on their treatment.Copyright © 2023 the Author(s). Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc."
"37553321","TEQUILA-seq: a versatile and low-cost method for targeted long-read RNA sequencing.","Nat Commun","Long-read RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is a powerful technology for transcriptome analysis, but the relatively low throughput of current long-read sequencing platforms limits transcript coverage. One strategy for overcoming this bottleneck is targeted long-read RNA-seq for preselected gene panels. We present TEQUILA-seq, a versatile, easy-to-implement, and low-cost method for targeted long-read RNA-seq utilizing isothermally linear-amplified capture probes. When performed on the Oxford nanopore platform with multiple gene panels of varying sizes, TEQUILA-seq consistently and substantially enriches transcript coverage while preserving transcript quantification. We profile full-length transcript isoforms of 468 actionable cancer genes across 40 representative breast cancer cell lines. We identify transcript isoforms enriched in specific subtypes and discover novel transcript isoforms in extensively studied cancer genes such as TP53. Among cancer genes, tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) are significantly enriched for aberrant transcript isoforms targeted for degradation via mRNA nonsense-mediated decay, revealing a common RNA-associated mechanism for TSG inactivation. TEQUILA-seq reduces the per-reaction cost of targeted capture by 2-3 orders of magnitude, as compared to a standard commercial solution. TEQUILA-seq can be broadly used for targeted sequencing of full-length transcripts in diverse biomedical research settings.© 2023. Springer Nature Limited."

However, it is increasingly challenging for experimental biologists, especially those without a bioinformatic background, to integrate, explore, and analyse these tremendous pharmacogenomics. To address this gap, IMOPAC, an interactive and easy-to-use web-based tool, was introduced to provide rapid visualizations and customizable functionalities on the basis of these three publicly available databases, which may reduce pharmacogenomic profiles from cell lines into readily understandable genetic, epigenetic, transcriptionomic, proteomic, metabolomic, and pharmacological events. The user-friendly query interface together with customized data storage enables users to interactively investigate and visualize multiomics alterations across genes and pathways and to link these alterations with drug responses across cell lines from diverse cancer types. The analyses in our portal include pancancer expression, drug-omics/pathway correlation, cancer subtypes, omics-omics (cis-/trans-regulation) correlation, fusion query analysis, and drug response prediction analysis. The comprehensive multiomics and pharmacogenomic analyses with simple clicking through IMOPAC will significantly benefit cancer precision medicine, contribute to the discoveries of potential biological mechanisms and facilitate pharmacogenomics mining in the identification of clinically actionable biomarkers for both basic researchers and clinical practitioners.

"37503057","Proteome-wide copy-number estimation from transcriptomics.","bioRxiv","Protein copy numbers constrain systems-level properties of regulatory networks, but absolute proteomic data remain scarce compared to transcriptomics obtained by RNA sequencing. We addressed this persistent gap by relating mRNA to protein statistically using best-available data from quantitative proteomics-transcriptomics for 4366 genes in 369 cell lines. The approach starts with a central estimate of protein copy number and hierarchically appends mRNA-protein and mRNA-mRNA dependencies to define an optimal gene-specific model that links mRNAs to protein. For dozens of independent cell lines and primary prostate samples, these protein inferences from mRNA outmatch stringent null models, a count-based protein-abundance repository, and empirical protein-to-mRNA ratios. The optimal mRNA-to-protein relationships capture biological processes along with hundreds of known protein-protein interaction complexes, suggesting mechanistic relationships are embedded. We use the method to estimate viral-receptor abundances of CD55-CXADR from human heart transcriptomes and build 1489 systems-biology models of coxsackievirus B3 infection susceptibility. When applied to 796 RNA sequencing profiles of breast cancer from The Cancer Genome Atlas, inferred copy-number estimates collectively reclassify 26% of Luminal A and 29% of Luminal B tumors. Protein-based reassignments strongly involve a pharmacologic target for luminal breast cancer (CDK4) and an α-catenin that is often undetectable at the mRNA level (CTTNA2). Thus, by adopting a gene-centered perspective of mRNA-protein covariation across different biological contexts, we achieve accuracies comparable to the technical reproducibility limits of contemporary proteomics. The collection of gene-specific models is assembled as a web tool for users seeking mRNA-guided predictions of absolute protein abundance ( http://janeslab.shinyapps.io/Pinferna ).It is easier to quantify mRNA in cells than it is to quantify protein, but proteins are what execute most cellular functions. Even though protein is synthesized from mRNA in cells, relating a cellular quantity of mRNA to a quantity of protein is challenging. Here, we bring together quantitative measures of mRNA and protein for 4366 genes in 369 different cultured cell types to build equations that predict protein abundance from the abundance of mRNAs expressed. These equations capture facets of biological regulation and work better than existing alternatives that rely on consensus values or ratios. Since mRNA measurements are more widespread than protein, this study makes new analyses possible by protein estimation from mRNA."

Here, we develop a novel pooled prime editing screen method, PRIME, which can be applied to characterize thousands of coding and non-coding variants in a single experiment with high reproducibility. To showcase its applications, we first identified essential nucleotides for a 716 bpMYCenhancer via PRIME-mediated saturation mutagenesis. Next, we applied PRIME to functionally characterize 1,304 non-coding variants associated with breast cancer and 3,699 variants from ClinVar. We discovered that 103 non-coding variants and 156 variants of uncertain significance are functional via affecting cell fitness. Collectively, we demonstrate PRIME capable of characterizing genetic variants at base-pair resolution and scale, advancing accurate genome annotation for disease risk prediction, diagnosis, and therapeutic target identification."
"37533239","Epigenetic aging in cows is accelerated by milk production.","Epigenetics","DNA methylation has proven to be the most promising age-predictive biomarker in mammals resulting in the emergence of 'epigenetic clocks' that describe the relationship between methylation levels and age. Using Targeted bisulfite Sequencing, we evaluated blood DNA-methylation data from 96 domesticated cows (Bos Taurus) of which 88 were adults and 8 were calves. This allowed us to measure DNA methylation across three thousand regions in the genome that were conserved across mammals. The significant association of age with the changes in DNA methylation enabled us to construct an epigenetic clock that predicts the age of cows to within nine months. We also investigated whether factors exist that moderate the association between epigenetic age and actual age and found that milk production levels significantly increase the rate of epigenetic ageing, suggesting that the stress of excessive milk production might be accelerating epigenetic ageing in cows."
"37542161","Prenatal exposure to environmental air pollution and psychosocial stress jointly contribute to the epigenetic regulation of the serotonin transporter gene in newborns.","Mol Psychiatry","Antenatal exposures to maternal stress and to particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of less than 2.5 μm (PM2.5) have been independently associated with developmental outcomes in early infancy and beyond. Knowledge about their joint impact, biological mechanisms of their effects and timing-effects, is still limited. Both PM2.5and maternal stress exposure during pregnancy might result in altered patterns of DNA methylation in specific stress-related genes, such as the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4 DNAm), that might, in turn, influence infant development across several domains, including bio-behavioral, cognitive and socio-emotional domains. Here, we investigated the independent and interactive influence of variations in antenatal exposures to maternal pandemic-related stress (PRS) and PM2.5on SLC6A4 DNAm levels in newborns. Mother-infant dyads (N = 307) were enrolled at delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic. Infants' methylation status was assessed in 13 CpG sites within the SLC6A4 gene's region (chr17:28562750-28562958) in buccal cells at birth and women retrospectively report on PRS. PM2.5exposure throughout the entire gestation and at each gestational trimester was estimated using a spatiotemporal model based on residential address. Among several potentially confounding socio-demographic and health-related factors, infant's sex was significantly associated with infants' SLC6A4 DNAm levels, thus hierarchical regression models were adjusted for infant's sex. Higher levels of SLC6A4 DNAm at 6 CpG sites were found in newborns born to mothers reporting higher levels of antenatal PRS and greater PM2.5 exposure across gestation, while adjusting for infant's sex. These effects were especially evident when exposure to elevated PM2.5occurred during the second trimester of pregnancy. Several important brain processes (e.g., synaptogenesis and myelination) occur during mid-pregnancy, potentially making the second trimester a sensitive time window for the effects of stress-related exposures. Understanding the interplay between environmental and individual-level stressors has important implications for the improvement of mother-infant health during and after the pandemic.© 2023.

In recent years, numerous studies have shown that LINE-1 is involved in the development of various diseases and also plays an important role in the immune regulation of the organism. The expression of LINE-1 in gynecologic tumors suggests that it is expected to be an independent indicator for early diagnosis and prognosis, and also, as a therapeutic target, LINE-1 is closely associated with gynecologic tumor prognosis. This article discusses the function of LINE-1 in the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of ovarian, cervical, and endometrial malignancies, as well as other gynecologic malignancies.

"37540378","A Hands-On Guide to Generate Spatial Gene Expression Profiles by Integrating scRNA-seq and 3D-Reconstructed Microscope-Based Plant Structures.","Methods Mol Biol","Transcriptome profiles of individual cells in the plant are strongly dependent on their relative position. Cell differentiation is associated with tissue-specific transcriptomic changes. For that reason, it is important to study gene expression changes in a spatial context, and therefore to link those to potential morphological changes over developmental time. Even though great experimental advances have been made in recording spatial gene expression profiles, those attempts are limited in the plant field. New computational approaches attempt to solve this problem by integrating spatial expression profiles of few marker genes with single-cell/single-nuclei RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) methodologies. In this chapter, we provide a practical guide on how to predict gene expression patterns in a 3D plant structure by combining scRNA-seq data and 3D microscope-based reconstructed expression profiles of a small set of reference genes. We also show how to visualize these results.© 2023. Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
"37537242","Unique functional responses differentially map onto genetic subtypes of dopamine neurons.","Nat Neurosci","Dopamine neurons are characterized by their response to unexpected rewards, but they also fire during movement and aversive stimuli. Dopamine neuron diversity has been observed based on molecular expression profiles; however, whether different functions map onto such genetic subtypes remains unclear. In this study, we established that three genetic dopamine subtypes within the substantia nigra pars compacta, characterized by the expression of Slc17a6 (Vglut2), Calb1 and Anxa1, each have a unique set of responses to rewards, aversive stimuli and accelerations and decelerations, and these signaling patterns are highly correlated between somas and axons within subtypes. Remarkably, reward responses were almost entirely absent in the Anxa1+subtype, which instead displayed acceleration-correlated signaling. Our findings establish a connection between functional and genetic dopamine subtypes and demonstrate that molecular expression patterns can serve as a common framework to dissect dopaminergic functions.© 2023.

However, existing approaches for hPSC-astrocyte generation are typically lengthy or require intermediate purification steps. Here, we establish a rapid and highly scalable method for generating functional human induced astrocytes (hiAs). These hiAs express canonical astrocyte markers, respond to pro-inflammatory stimuli, exhibit ATP-induced calcium transients and support neuronal network development. Moreover, single-cell transcriptomic analyses reveal the generation of highly reproducible cell populations across individual donors, mostly resembling human fetal astrocytes. Finally, hiAs generated from a trisomy 21 disease model identify expected alterations in cell-cell adhesion and synaptic signaling, supporting their utility for disease modeling applications. Thus, hiAs provide a valuable and practical resource for the study of basic human astrocyte function and dysfunction in disease.© 2023 The Authors."
"37429993","Significance analysis for clustering with single-cell RNA-sequencing data.","Nat Methods","Unsupervised clustering of single-cell RNA-sequencing data enables the identification of distinct cell populations. However, the most widely used clustering algorithms are heuristic and do not formally account for statistical uncertainty. We find that not addressing known sources of variability in a statistically rigorous manner can lead to overconfidence in the discovery of novel cell types. Here we extend a previous method, significance of hierarchical clustering, to propose a model-based hypothesis testing approach that incorporates significance analysis into the clustering algorithm and permits statistical evaluation of clusters as distinct cell populations. We also adapt this approach to permit statistical assessment on the clusters reported by any algorithm. Finally, we extend these approaches to account for batch structure. We benchmarked our approach against popular clustering workflows, demonstrating improved performance. To show practical utility, we applied our approach to the Human Lung Cell Atlas and an atlas of the mouse cerebellar cortex, identifying several cases of over-clustering and recapitulating experimentally validated cell type definitions.© 2023.

Expanding studies of gene regulation to underexplored populations and to medically relevant tissues offers potential to reveal yet unknown regulatory variants and to better understand disease mechanisms. Here, we performed eQTL mapping in subcutaneous (S) and visceral (V) adipose tissue from 106 Greek individuals (Greek Metabolic study, GM) and compared our findings to those from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) resource.We identified 1,930 and 1,515 eGenes in S and V respectively, over 13% of which are not observed in GTEx adipose tissue, and that do not arise due to different ancestry. We report additional context-specific regulatory effects in genes of clinical interest (e.g. oncogene ST7) and in genes regulating responses to environmental stimuli (e.g. MIR21, SNX33). We suggest that a fraction of the reported differences across populations is due to environmental effects on gene expression, driving context-specific eQTLs, and suggest that environmental effects can determine the penetrance of disease variants thus shaping disease risk. We report that over half of GM eQTLs colocalize with GWAS SNPs and of these colocalizations 41% are not detected in GTEx. We also highlight the clinical relevance of S adipose tissue by revealing that inflammatory processes are upregulated in individuals with obesity, not only in V, but also in S tissue.By focusing on an understudied population, our results provide further candidate genes for investigation regarding their role in adipose tissue biology and their contribution to disease risk and pathogenesis.© 2023.

"37503158","Estimation of indirect genetic effects and heritability under assortative mating.","bioRxiv","Both direct genetic effects (effects of alleles in an individual on that individual) and indirect genetic effects - effects of alleles in an individual (e.g. parents) on another individual (e.g. offspring) - can contribute to phenotypic variation and genotype-phenotype associations. Here, we consider a phenotype affected by direct and parental indirect genetic effects under assortative mating at equilibrium. We generalize classical theory to derive a decomposition of the equilibrium phenotypic variance in terms of direct and indirect genetic effect components. We extend this theory to show that popular methods for estimating indirect genetic effects or 'genetic nurture' through analysis of parental and offspring polygenic predictors (called polygenic indices or scores - PGIs or PGSs) are substantially biased by assortative mating. We propose an improved method for estimating indirect genetic effects while accounting for assortative mating that can also correct heritability estimates for bias due to assortative mating. We validate our method in simulations and apply it to PGIs for height and educational attainment (EA), estimating that the equilibrium heritability of height is 0.699 (S.E. = 0.075) and finding no evidence for indirect genetic effects on height. We estimate a very high correlation between parents' underlying genetic components for EA, 0.755 (S.E. = 0.035), which is inconsistent with twin based estimates of the heritability of EA, possibly due to confounding in the EA PGI and/or in twin studies. We implement our method in the software packagesnipar, enabling researchers to apply the method to data including observed and/or imputed parental genotypes. We provide a theoretical framework for understanding the results of PGI analyses and a practical methodology for estimating heritability and indirect genetic effects while accounting for assortative mating."

Males hemizygous for aRPGRmutation often are affected by Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP), whereas female mutation carriers only occasionally present with severe RP phenotypes. The underlying pathomechanism leading to RP in female carriers is not well understood. Here, we analyzed a three-generation family in which two of three female carriers of a nonsenseRPGRmutation presented with RP. Among two cell lines derived from the same female family members, differences were detected inRPGRtranscript expression, in localization of RPGR along cilia, as well as in primary cilium length. Significantly, these differences correlated with alterations in X-chromosomal inactivation patterns found in the patient-derived cell lines from females. In summary, our data suggest that skewed X-chromosomal inactivation is an important factor that determines the disease manifestation of RP among female carriers of pathogenic sequence alterations in theRPGRgene.© 2023 Usman et al."

By reconstructing the course of cancer evolution, we can understand the acquisition of the malignant properties that drive tumor progression. Unfortunately, recovering the evolutionary relationships of individual cancer cells linked to their phenotypes remains a difficult challenge. To address this need, we have developed PhylinSic, a method that reconstructs the phylogenetic relationships among cells linked to their gene expression profiles from single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-Seq) data. This method calls nucleotide bases using a probabilistic smoothing approach and then estimates a phylogenetic tree using a Bayesian modeling algorithm. We showed that PhylinSic identified evolutionary relationships underpinning drug selection and metastasis and was sensitive enough to identify subclones from genetic drift. We found that breast cancer tumors resistant to chemotherapies harbored multiple genetic lineages that independently acquired high K-Ras and β-catenin, suggesting that therapeutic strategies may need to control multiple lineages to be durable. These results demonstrated that PhylinSic can reconstruct evolution and link the genotypes and phenotypes of cells across monophyletic tumors using scRNA-Seq.© 2023. Springer Nature Limited."

Based on bulk gene expression and survival data, TimiGP infers cell-cell interactions that reveal the association between immune cell relative abundance and prognosis. As demonstrated in metastatic melanoma, TimiGP prioritizes immune cells critical in prognosis based on the identified cell-cell interactions. Highly consistent results are obtained by TimiGP when applied to seven independent melanoma datasets and when different cell-type marker sets are used as inputs. Additionally, TimiGP can leverage single-cell RNA sequencing data to delineate the tumor immune microenvironment at high resolutions across a wide range of cancer types.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

Neuronal apoptosis, necrosis, and ferroptosis are widely identified to involve the progress of stroke, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. A growing body of evidence has pointed out that neuronal death is tightly associated with expression of related genes and alteration of signaling molecules. In addition, recently, epigenetics has been increasingly focused on as a vital regulatory mechanism for neuronal apoptosis, necrosis, and ferroptosis, providing a new direction for treating nervous system diseases. Moreover, growing researches suggest that histone methylation or demethylation is involved in the processes of neuronal apoptosis, necrosis, and ferroptosis. These researches may imply that studying the potential roles of histone methylation is essential for treating the nervous system diseases. Here, we review potential roles of histone methylation and demethylation in neuronal death, which may give us a new direction in treating the nervous system diseases.© 2023.

"37502858","VprBP/DCAF1 triggers melanomagenic gene silencing through histone H2A phosphorylation.","Res Sq","Background Melanoma is the most aggressive form of skin cancer arising from pigment-producing melanocytes and is often associated with dysregulation of epigenetic factors targeting histones. VprBP, also known as DCAF1, is a recently identified kinase and plays an important role in downregulating the transcription of tumor suppressor genes as well as increasing the risk for colon and prostate cancers. However, it remains unknown whether VprBP is also involved in triggering the pathogenesis of other types of cancer. Results We demonstrate that VprBP is highly expressed and phosphorylates threonine 120 (T120) on histone H2A to drive transcriptional inactivation of growth regulatory genes in melanoma cells. As is the case for its epigenetic function in colon and prostate cancers, VprBP acts to induce gene silencing program dependently of H2AT120 phosphorylation (H2AT120p). The significance of VprBP-mediated H2AT120p is further underscored by the fact that VprBP knockdown- or VprBP inhibitor-induced lockage of H2AT120p mitigates melanoma tumor growth in xenograft models. Moreover, artificial tethering of VprBP wild type, but not VprBP kinase-dead mutant, to its responsive genes is sufficient for achieving an inactive transcriptional state in VprBP-depleted cells, indicating that VprBP drives gene silencing program in an H2AT120p-dependent manner. Conclusions Our results establish VprBP-mediated H2AT120p as a key epigenetic signal for melanomagenesis and suggest the therapeutic potential of targeting VprBP kinase activity for effective melanoma treatment."

Extensive investigations have been conducted on the clinical implementation of circulating free DNA (cfDNA) in PCa. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the present state of cfDNA as a biomarker for PCa and to examine its merits and obstacles for future clinical utilization.Relevant peer-reviewed manuscripts on cfDNA as a PCa marker were evaluated by PubMed search (2010-2022) to evaluate the roles of cfDNA in PCa diagnosis, prognosis, and prediction, respectively.cfDNA is primarily released from cells undergoing necrosis and apoptosis, allowing for non-invasive insight into the genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenomic alterations within various PCa disease states. Next-generation sequencing, among other detection methods, enables the assessment of cfDNA abundance, mutation status, fragment characteristics, and epigenetic modifications. Multidimensional analysis based on cfDNA can facilitate early detection of PCa, risk stratification, and treatment monitoring. However, standardization of cfDNA detection methods is still required to expedite its clinical application.cfDNA provides a non-invasive, rapid, and repeatable means of acquiring multidimensional information from PCa patients, which can aid in guiding clinical decisions and enhancing patient management. Overcoming the application barriers of cfDNA necessitates increased data sharing and international collaboration.© 2023 Editorial Office of Asian Journal of Urology.

MiRNAs play critical roles in regulating gene expression and serve as therapeutic targets in cancer. This study sought to disclose key miRNAs and target genes responsible for NPC prognosis and endocrine metabolism.Three datasets (GSE32960, GSE70970, and GSE102349) of NPC samples came from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Limma and WGCNA were applied to identify key prognostic miRNAs. There were 12 types of miRNA tools implemented to study potential target genes (mRNAs) of miRNAs. Univariate Cox regression and stepAIC were introduced to construct risk models. Pearson analysis was conducted to analyze the correlation between endocrine metabolism and RiskScore. Single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA), MCP-counter, and ESTIMATE were performed for immune analysis. The response to immunotherapy was predicted by TIDE and SubMap analyses.Two key miRNAs (miR-142-3p and miR-93) were closely involved in NPC prognosis. The expression of the two miRNAs was dysregulated in NPC cell lines. A total of 125 potential target genes of the key miRNAs were screened, and they were enriched in autophagy and mitophagy pathways. Five target genes (E2F1, KCNJ8, SUCO, HECTD1, and KIF23) were identified to construct a prognostic model, which was used to divide patients into high group and low group. RiskScore was negatively correlated with most endocrine-related genes and pathways. The low-risk group manifested higher immune infiltration, anticancer response, more activated immune-related pathways, and higher response to immunotherapy than the high-risk group.This study revealed two key miRNAs that were highly contributable to NPC prognosis. We delineated the specific links between key miRNAs and prognostic mRNAs with miRNA-mRNA networks. The effectiveness of the five-gene model in predicting NPC prognosis as well as endocrine metabolism provided a guidance for personalized immunotherapy in NPC patients.Copyright © 2023 Zhang, Li, Wang, Wang, Zhuang, Liu and Lian."

However, no unified framework that investigates both facial data and other phenotypic data directly from individuals exists. We developed PhenoScore: an open-source, artificial intelligence-based phenomics framework, combining facial recognition technology with Human Phenotype Ontology data analysis to quantify phenotypic similarity. Here we show PhenoScore's ability to recognize distinct phenotypic entities by establishing recognizable phenotypes for 37 of 40 investigated syndromes against clinical features observed in individuals with other neurodevelopmental disorders and show it is an improvement on existing approaches. PhenoScore provides predictions for individuals with variants of unknown significance and enables sophisticated genotype-phenotype studies by testing hypotheses on possible phenotypic (sub)groups. PhenoScore confirmed previously known phenotypic subgroups caused by variants in the same gene for SATB1, SETBP1 and DEAF1 and provides objective clinical evidence for two distinct ADNP-related phenotypes, already established functionally.© 2023.

The connection between these two processes remains unknown. Using Hi-C for zebrafish embryos, we found that chromosome folding starts by establishing ""fountains"", novel elements of chromosome organization, emerging selectively at enhancers upon ZGA. Using polymer simulations, we demonstrate that fountains can emerge as sites of targeted cohesin loading and require two-sided, yet desynchronized, loop extrusion. Specific loss of fountains upon loss of pioneer transcription factors that drive ZGA reveals a causal connection between enhancer activity and fountain formation. Finally, we show that fountains emerge in early Medaka andXenopusembryos; moreover, we found cohesin-dependent fountain pattern on enhancers of mouse embryonic stem cells. Taken together, fountains are the first enhancer-specific elements of chromosome organization; they constitute starting points of chromosome folding during early development, likely serving as sites of targeted cohesin loading."

Then the embryonic development is monitored and regulated precisely from the transition of oocyte to the embryo at the early stage of embryogenesis, and this process is termed maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT). MZT involves two major events that are maternal components degradation and zygotic genome activation. The epigenetic reprogramming plays crucial roles in regulating the process of MZT and supervising the normal development of early development of embryos. In recent years, benefited from the rapid development of low-input epigenome profiling technologies, new epigenetic modifications are found to be reprogrammed dramatically and may play different roles during MZT whose dysregulation will cause an abnormal development of embryos even abortion at various stages. In this review, we summarized and discussed the important novel findings on epigenetic reprogramming and the underlying molecular mechanisms regulating MZT in mammalian embryos.

Such systematic background noise can lead to batch effects and spurious differential gene expression results. Here we develop a deep generative model based on the phenomenology of noise generation in droplet-based assays. The proposed model accurately distinguishes cell-containing droplets from cell-free droplets, learns the background noise profile and provides noise-free quantification in an end-to-end fashion. We implement this approach in the scalable and robust open-source software package CellBender. Analysis of simulated data demonstrates that CellBender operates near the theoretically optimal denoising limit. Extensive evaluations using real datasets and experimental benchmarks highlight enhanced concordance between droplet-based single-cell data and established gene expression patterns, while the learned background noise profile provides evidence of degraded or uncaptured cell types.© 2023.

Despite decades of advancement, challenges remain in GRN inference, including dynamic rewiring, causal inference, feedback loop modeling and context specificity. To address these challenges, we develop Dictys, a dynamic GRN inference and analysis method that leverages multiomic single-cell assays of chromatin accessibility and gene expression, context-specific transcription factor footprinting, stochastic process network and efficient probabilistic modeling of single-cell RNA-sequencing read counts. Dictys improves GRN reconstruction accuracy and reproducibility and enables the inference and comparative analysis of context-specific and dynamic GRNs across developmental contexts.

"37550515","A fast chemical reprogramming system promotes cell identity transition through a diapause-like state.","Nat Cell Biol","Cellular reprogramming by only small molecules holds enormous potentials for regenerative medicine. However, chemical reprogramming remains a slow process and labour intensive, hindering its broad applications and the investigation of underlying molecular mechanisms. Here, through screening of over 21,000 conditions, we develop a fast chemical reprogramming (FCR) system, which significantly improves the kinetics of cell identity rewiring. We find that FCR rapidly goes through an interesting route for pluripotent reprogramming, uniquely transitioning through a developmentally diapause-like state. Furthermore, FCR critically enables comprehensive characterizations using multi-omics technologies, and has revealed unexpected important features including key regulatory factors and epigenetic dynamics. Particularly, activation of pluripotency-related endogenous retroviruses via inhibition of heterochromatin significantly enhances reprogramming. Our studies provide critical insights into how only environmental cues are sufficient to rapidly reinstate pluripotency in somatic cells, and make notable technical and conceptual advances for solving the puzzle of regeneration.© 2023.

We previously profiled genomic landscapes of prostate cancer (PCa), yet the underlying causal genes with prognostic potential has not been defined. It remains unclear how a somatic genomic event cooperates with inherited germline variants contribute to cancer predisposition and progression.We applied integrated genomic and clinical data, experimental models and bioinformatic analysis to identify GATA2 as a highly prevalent metastasis-associated genomic amplification in PCa. Biological roles of GATA2 in PCa metastasis was determined in vitro and in vivo. Global chromatin co-occupancy and co-regulation of GATA2 and SMAD4 was investigated by coimmunoprecipitation, ChIP-seq and RNA-seq assays. Tumor cellular assays, qRT-PCR, western blot, ChIP, luciferase assays and CRISPR-Cas9 editing methods were performed to mechanistically understand the cooperation of GATA2 with SMAD4 in promoting TGFβ1 and AR signaling and mediating inherited PCa risk and progression.In this study, by integrated genomics and experimental analysis, we identified GATA2 as a prevalent metastasis-associated genomic amplification to transcriptionally augment its own expression in PCa. Functional experiments demonstrated that GATA2 physically interacted and cooperated with SMAD4 for genome-wide chromatin co-occupancy and co-regulation of PCa genes and metastasis pathways like TGFβ signaling. Mechanistically, GATA2 was cooperative with SMAD4 to enhance TGFβ and AR signaling pathways, and activated the expression of TGFβ1 via directly binding to a distal enhancer of TGFβ1. Strinkingly, GATA2 and SMAD4 globally mediated inherited PCa risk and formed a transcriptional complex with HOXB13 at the PCa risk-associated rs339331/6q22 enhancer, leading to increased expression of the PCa susceptibility gene RFX6.Our study prioritizes causal genomic amplification genes with prognostic values in PCa and reveals the pivotal roles of GATA2 in transcriptionally activating the expression of its own and TGFβ1, thereby co-opting to TGFβ1/SMAD4 signaling and RFX6 at 6q22 to modulate PCa predisposition and progression.© 2023.

The lead variant, rs13266634, encodes an amino acid change, Arg325Trp (R325W), at the C-terminus of the secretory granule-enriched zinc transporter, ZnT8. Although this protein-coding variant was previously thought to be the sole driver of altered disease risk, recent studies have provided evidence for lowered expression ofSLC30A8mRNA in protective allele carriers. In the present study, combined allele-specific expression (cASE) analysis in human islets revealed that multiple variants affect the expressionSLC30A8. Chromatin accessibility and epigenomic analyses imply the existence at theSLC30A8locus of an islet-selective super-enhancer cluster hosting multiple diabetes-associated variants. The variant region is spatially associated with both theSLC30A8promoter and with the regulatory regions of the neighbouringRAD21, RAD21-AS1, UTP23and other genes. Deletion of variant-bearing regions from human-derived EndoC-βH3 cells using CRISPR-Cas9 lowered the expression ofSLC30A8and several neighbouring genes, suggesting their co-regulation by this enhancer cluster. Whilst deletion ofSLC30A8had no effect on beta cell survival under the conditions examined, loss ofRAD21 or UTP23markedly reduced cell viability. Thus, the protective effects of variants that lowerSLC30A8activity may be modulated by the altered expression of nearby genes. Direct evidence for this possibility was not, however, obtained by cASE or eQTL analysis of human islet samples."

Aerobic exercise training can increase V̇o2max, but inter-individual variability is marked and unexplained physiologically. The mechanisms underlying this variability have major clinical implications for extending human healthspan. Here, we report a novel transcriptome signature related to ΔV̇o2maxwith exercise training detected in whole blood RNA. We used RNA-Seq to characterize transcriptomic signatures of ΔV̇o2maxin healthy women who completed a 16-wk randomized controlled trial comparing supervised, higher versus lower aerobic exercise training volume and intensity (4 training groups, fully crossed). We found significant baseline gene expression differences in subjects who responded to aerobic exercise training with robust versus little/no ΔV̇o2max, and differentially expressed genes/transcripts were mostly related to inflammatory signaling and mitochondrial function/protein translation. Baseline gene expression signatures associated with robust versus little/no ΔV̇o2maxwere also modulated by exercise training in a dose-dependent manner, and they predicted ΔV̇o2maxin this and a separate dataset. Collectively, our data demonstrate the potential utility of using whole blood transcriptomics to study the biology of inter-individual variability in responsiveness to the same exercise training stimulus."

Here, we performed large-scale comparative genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenomic analyses to investigate the evolutionary alterations acquired by brain genes and provide comprehensive listings of innovatory genetic elements along the evolutionary path from ancestral primates to human. The regulatory sequences associated with brain-expressed genes experienced rapid change, particularly in the ancestor of the Simiiformes. Extensive comparisons of single-cell and bulk transcriptomic data between primate and nonprimate brains revealed that these regulatory sequences may drive the high expression of certain genes in primate brains. Employing in utero electroporation into mouse embryonic cortex, we show that the primate-specific brain-biased gene BMP7 was recruited, probably in the ancestor of the Simiiformes, to regulate neuronal proliferation in the primate ventricular zone. Our study provides a comprehensive listing of genes and regulatory changes along the brain evolution lineage of ancestral primates leading to human.

Massive repressive compartmentalization, concomitant with the emergence of hundreds of neuron-specific multi-valent chromatin architectural stripes, occurs during neuronal differentiation, with genes interconnected to genetic risk loci through these long-range chromatin structures differing in their biological roles from genes more proximal to sequences conferring heritable risk.

Our gene regulatory network modeling identified that nonlinear enhancer gene regulation during cell state transitions can be leveraged to improve the sensitivity of enhancer discovery. Using human embryonic stem cell definitive endoderm differentiation as a dynamic transition system, we conducted a mid-transition CRISPRi-based enhancer screen. We discovered a comprehensive set of enhancers for each of the core endoderm-specifying transcription factors. Many enhancers had strong effects mid-transition but weak effects post-transition, consistent with the nonlinear temporal responses to enhancer perturbation predicted by the modeling. Integrating three-dimensional genomic information, we were able to develop a CTCF-loop-constrained Interaction Activity model that can better predict functional enhancers compared to models that rely on Hi-C-based enhancer-promoter contact frequency.

We examine tradeoffs between mating effort and parenting effort in male olive baboons,Papio anubis, a species in which males compete for mating opportunities, but also form ties to lactating females (primary associations) that represent a form of parenting effort. Males that are involved in more primary associations invest less in mating effort than males who are involved in fewer primary associations. Males that are involved in more primary associations play a smaller role in establishing proximity to their primary associates than other males, suggesting that males operate under temporal constraints. There is also some evidence that involvement in primary associations negatively affects paternity success. Taken together, the data suggest that males face tradeoffs between mating effort and parenting effort.© 2023 The Author(s)."

However, there is minimal research on systemic cell-mediated inflammation in AMD. Interleukin-4 (IL-4) is an immunoregulatory cytokine with an important role in modulating inflammation in chronic immune mediated disease. The purpose of this study was to: (1) investigate the role of systemic IL-4 in patients with intermediate AMD (iAMD) and in geographic atrophy (GA), an advanced form of AMD, compared to controls without AMD, and (2) determine if IL-4 levels are moderated by sex.We examined plasma levels of IL-4 in patients with iAMD, GA, and controls without AMD included in the University of Colorado AMD registry (August 2014 to June 2021). Cases and controls were defined by multimodal imaging. IL-4 was measured by multiplex immunoassay. Data were analyzed using a nonparametric rank based linear regression model fit to IL-4.There were 199 patients with iAMD, 97 patients with GA, and 139 controls, with a percentage of female patients 61%, 55%, and 66%, respectively. We demonstrated significantly higher median IL-4 levels in GA (35.3; interquartile range [IQR] = 22.8-50.5) compared to iAMD (6.1; IQR = 2.2-11.3, P < 0.01) and controls (10.7; IQR = 5.0-16.8, P < 0.01). There were no significant differences in levels of IL-4 for cases and controls when stratified by sex.These findings demonstrate a systemic immunological difference between iAMD and GA, indicating IL-4 may be a systemic biomarker for GA development.The plasma biomarker IL-4 is significantly elevated in patients with GA."

The development of type 1 diabetes is thought to be an autoimmune process, in which an environmental (unknown) trigger initiates a T cell-mediated immune response in genetically susceptible individuals. The presence of islet autoantibodies in the blood are signs of type 1 diabetes development, and risk of progressing to clinical type 1 diabetes is correlated with the presence of multiple islet autoantibodies. Currently, a ""staging"" model of type 1 diabetes proposes discrete components consisting of normal blood glucose but at least two islet autoantibodies (Stage 1), abnormal blood glucose with at least two islet autoantibodies (Stage 2), and clinical diagnosis (Stage 3). While these stages may, in fact, not be discrete and vary by individual, the format suggests important applications of precision medicine to diagnosis, prevention, prognosis, treatment and monitoring. In this paper, applications of precision medicine in type 1 diabetes are discussed, with both opportunities and barriers to global implementation highlighted. Several groups have implemented components of precision medicine, yet the integration of the necessary steps to achieve both short- and long-term solutions will need to involve researchers, patients, families, and healthcare providers to fully impact and reduce the burden of type 1 diabetes.© The Author(s) 2023."

Massive stabilization of mutant p53 (mutp53) proteins is a cancer-specific event that could potentially mark precancerous cells, yet in vivo protein-level mutp53 reporters are lacking. Here we developed two transgenic protein-level mutp53 reporters, p53R172H-Akaluc and p53-mCherry, that faithfully mimic the dynamics and function of mutp53 proteins in vivo. Using these reporters, we identified and traced rare precancerous clones in deep noncancerous tissues in various cancer models. In classic mutp53-driven thymic lymphoma models, we found that precancerous clones exhibit broad chromosome number variations, upregulate precancerous stage-specific genes such as Ybx3 and enhance amino acid transport and metabolism. Inhibiting amino acid transporters downstream of Ybx3 at the early but not late stage effectively suppresses tumorigenesis and prolongs survival. Together, these protein-level mutp53 reporters reveal undercharacterized features and vulnerabilities of precancerous cells during early tumorigenesis, paving the way for precision cancer prevention.© 2023.

A personal view on aspects of oocyte maturation and the development of monozygotic twins.","Anim Reprod","The present review addresses the oocyte and the preimplantation embryo, and is intended to highlight the underlying principle of the ""nature versus/and nurture"" question. Given the diversity in mammalian oocyte maturation, this review will not be comprehensive but instead will focus on the porcine oocyte. Historically, oogenesis was seen as the development of a passive cell nursed and determined by its somatic compartment. Currently, the advanced analysis of the cross-talk between the maternal environment and the oocyte shows a more balanced relationship: Granulosa cells nurse the oocyte, whereas the latter secretes diffusible factors that regulate proliferation and differentiation of the granulosa cells. Signal molecules of the granulosa cells either prevent the precocious initiation of meiotic maturation or enable oocyte maturation following hormonal stimulation. A similar question emerges in research on monozygotic twins or multiples: In Greek and medieval times, twins were not seen as the result of the common course of nature but were classified as faults. This seems still valid today for the rare and until now mainly unknown genesis of facultative monozygotic twins in mammals. Monozygotic twins are unique subjects for studies of the conceptus-maternal dialogue, the intra-pair similarity and dissimilarity, and the elucidation of the interplay between nature and nurture. In the course of in vivo collections of preimplantation sheep embryos and experiments on embryo splitting and other microsurgical interventions we recorded observations on double blastocysts within a single zona pellucida, double inner cell masses in zona-enclosed blastocysts and double germinal discs in elongating embryos. On the basis of these observations we add some pieces to the puzzle of the post-zygotic genesis of monozygotic twins and on maternal influences on the developing conceptus."

This has the potential to bring important insights as researchers can bypass cultivation and analyze genomes sourced directly from environmental samples. There are, however, technical challenges associated with this process, most notably the complexity of computational workflows required to process metagenomic data, which include dozens of bioinformatics software tools, each with their own set of customizable parameters that affect the final output of the workflow. At the core of these workflows are the processes of assembly-combining the short-input reads into longer, contiguous fragments (contigs)-and binning, clustering these contigs into individual genome bins. The limitations of assembly and binning algorithms also pose different challenges depending on the selected strategy to execute them. Both of these processes can be done for each sample separately or by pooling together multiple samples to leverage information from a combination of samples. Here we present Metaphor, a fully automated workflow for genome-resolved metagenomics (GRM). Metaphor differs from existing GRM workflows by offering flexible approaches for the assembly and binning of the input data and by combining multiple binning algorithms with a bin refinement step to achieve high-quality genome bins. Moreover, Metaphor generates reports to evaluate the performance of the workflow. We showcase the functionality of Metaphor on different synthetic datasets and the impact of available assembly and binning strategies on the final results.© The Author(s) 2023.

However, the Bangladeshi locus defined by rs946528 (chr1:46019890) did not associate with PLT in the Pakistani analysis but was in the same linkage disequilibrium block (r2≥ 0.5) as PLT-associated variants in prior East Asian GWAS. The single independent association signal was refined to a 95% credible set of 343 variants spanning 8 coding genes. Functional annotation, mapping to megakaryocyte regulatory regions, and colocalization with blood expression quantitative trait loci identified the likely mediator of the PLT phenotype to bePIK3R3encoding a regulator of phosphoinositol 3-kinase (PI3K).Abnormal PI3K activity in the vessel wall is already implicated in the pathogenesis of atherothrombosis. Our identification of a new association betweenPIK3R3and PLT provides further mechanistic insights into the contribution of the PI3K pathway to platelet biology.© 2023 The Authors."
"37542343","Network approach in liquidomics landscape.","J Exp Clin Cancer Res","Tissue-based biopsy is the present main tool to explore the molecular landscape of cancer, but it also has many limits to be frequently executed, being too invasive with the risk of side effects. These limits and the ability of cancer to constantly evolve its genomic profile, have recently led to the need of a less invasive and more accurate alternative, such as liquid biopsy. By searching Circulating Tumor Cells and residues of their nucleic acids or other tumor products in body fluids, especially in blood, but also in urine, stools and saliva, liquid biopsy is becoming the future of clinical oncology. Despite the current lack of a standardization for its workflows, that makes it hard to be reproduced, liquid biopsy has already obtained promising results for cancer screening, diagnosis, prognosis, and risk of recurrence.Through a more accessible molecular profiling of tumors, it could become easier to identify biomarkers predictive of response to treatment, such as EGFR mutations in non-small cell lung cancer and KRAS mutations in colorectal cancer, or Microsatellite Instability and Mismatch Repair as predictive markers of pembrolizumab response.By monitoring circulating tumor DNA in longitudinal repeated sampling of blood we could also predict Minimal Residual Disease and the risk of recurrence in already radically resected patients.In this review we will discuss about the current knowledge of limitations and strengths of the different forms of liquid biopsies for its inclusion in normal cancer management, with a brief nod to their newest biomarkers and its future implications.© 2023.

Exposure to air pollutants is associated with cardiorespiratory disease; however, immune and epithelial barrier alterations require further investigation.We sought to determine the impact of wildfire smoke exposure on the immune system and epithelial barriers by using proteomics and immune cell phenotyping.A San Francisco Bay area cohort (n = 15; age 30 ± 10 years) provided blood samples before (October 2019 to March 2020; air quality index = 37) and during (August 2020; air quality index = 80) a major wildfire. Exposure samples were collected 11 days (range, 10-12 days) after continuous exposure to wildfire smoke. We determined alterations in 506 proteins, including zonulin family peptide (ZFP); immune cell phenotypes by cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF); and their interrelationship using a correlation matrix.Targeted proteomic analyses (n = 15) revealed a decrease of spondin-2 and an increase of granzymes A, B, and H, killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor 3DL1, IL-16, nibrin, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1, C1q TNF-related protein, fibroblast growth factor 19, and von Willebrand factor after 11 days' average continuous exposure to smoke from a large wildfire (P< .05). We also observed a large correlation cluster between immune regulation pathways (IL-16, granzymes A, B, and H, and killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor 3DL1), DNA repair [poly(ADP-ribose) 1, nibrin], and natural killer cells. We did not observe changes in ZFP levels suggesting a change in epithelial barriers. However, ZFP was associated with immune cell phenotypes (naive CD4+, TH2 cells).We observed functional changes in critical immune cells and their proteins during wildfire smoke exposure. Future studies in larger cohorts or in firefighters exposed to wildfire smoke should further assess immune changes and intervention targets."

Alpha-ketoglutarate (AKG) is a key metabolite in the tricarboxylic acid cycle and has been widely used as a dietary and anti-ageing supplement. In this study, we found that treating esophageal squamous carcinoma cells with a high dose of AKG can induce cell pyroptosis. Furthermore, our research confirms that HPV18 E6 inhibits AKG-induced pyroptosis of esophageal squamous carcinoma cells by lowering P53 expression. P53 downregulates malate dehydrogenase 1 (MDH1) expression; however, MDH1 downregulates L-2-hydroxyglutarate (L-2HG) expression, which inhibits a rise in reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels-as L-2HG is responsible for excessive ROS. This study reveals the actuating mechanism behind cell pyroptosis of esophageal squamous carcinoma cells induced by high concentrations of AKG, and we posit the molecular pathway via which the HPV E6 oncoprotein inhibits cell pyroptosis.© 2023 The Authors.

"37547566","The impact of microplastics on female reproduction and early life.","Anim Reprod","Plastic pollution in our environment is one of the most important global health concerns right now. Micro- and nanoplastics (MNPs) are taken up by both humans and animals, mainly via food and water, and can pass important epithelial barriers. Indications of plastics in the blood circulation have recently been shown in both humans and farm animals, but standardized methods to quantify the exact levels of MNPs to which we are exposed are currently lacking. Potential hazards of MNPs are being investigated very recently, including the impact that MNPs may have on reproduction. However, studies on mammalian reproduction are scarce, but a wealth of data from aquatic species indicates reproductive effects of MNPs. The first studies in rodent models demonstrate that MNPs reach the gonads after oral exposure and may impact offspring after maternal exposure during the gestational period. These effects may arise from the particles themselves or the presence of plastic contaminants that leach from plastics. Plastic contamination has been detected in human placentas, fetal fluid and the meconium of newborns, indicating the presence of plastics from the very first start of life. Currently there is a lack of studies that investigate the impact of MNP exposure during the periconception and embryonic period, whereas this is an extremely sensitive period that needs considerable attention with the growing amount of plastics in our environment."

We examined associations between maternal PFAS concentrations during pregnancy and breastfeeding cessation. We investigated potential effect modification by parity status.Among 555 women enrolled in the Healthy Start study (2009-2014), we quantified maternal serum concentrations of 5 PFAS during mid- to late-pregnancy (mean 27 weeks of gestation). Participants self-reported their breastfeeding practices through 18-24 months postnatally. Among all participants and stratified by parity, we estimated associations between maternal PFAS concentrations and breastfeeding discontinuation by 3 and 6 months, using Poisson regression, and breastfeeding duration, using Cox regression.Median PFAS concentrations were similar to those in the general US population. Associations between PFAS and breastfeeding duration differed by parity status. After adjusting for covariates, among primiparous women, associations between PFAS and breastfeeding cessation by 3 and 6 months were generally null, with some inverse associations. Among multiparous women, there were positive associations between perfluorohexane sulfonate, perfluorooctane sulfonate, perfluorooctanoate (PFOA), and perfluorononanoate and breastfeeding cessation by 3 and 6 months. For example, per ln-ng/mL increase in PFOA, the risk ratio for breastfeeding discontinuation by 6 months was 1.45 (95% confidence interval, 1.18, 1.78). Hazard ratios reflected similar patterns between PFAS and breastfeeding duration.Among primiparous women, we did not find evidence for associations between PFAS concentrations and breastfeeding duration. In contrast, among multiparous women, PFAS serum concentrations were generally inversely associated with breastfeeding duration, though estimates may be biased due to confounding by unmeasured previous breastfeeding.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

HATCHet2 introduces a novel statistic, the mirrored haplotype B-allele frequency (mhBAF), to identify mirrored-subclonal CNAs having different numbers of copies of parental haplotypes in different tumor clones. HATCHet2 also has high accuracy in identifying focal CNAs and extends the earlier HATCHet method in several directions.

However, we have limited understanding of the comprehensive transcriptional and phenotypical landscape of the cells within these lesions.To characterize the landscape of human carotid atherosclerosis in greater detail, we combined cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing (CITE-seq) and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to classify all cell types within lesions (n=21; 13 symptomatic) to achieve a comprehensive multimodal understanding of the cellular identities of atherosclerosis and their association with clinical pathophysiology.We identified 25 distinct cell populations each having a unique multi-omic signature, including macrophages, T cells, NK cells, mast cells, B cells, plasma cells, neutrophils, dendritic cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and smooth muscle cells (SMCs). Within the macrophage populations, we identified 2 proinflammatory subsets that were enriched in IL1B or C1Q expression, 2 distinct TREM2 positive foam cell subsets, one of which also expressed inflammatory genes, as well as subpopulations displaying a proliferative gene expression signature and one expressing SMC-specific genes and upregulation of fibrotic pathways. An in-depth characterization uncovered several subsets of SMCs and fibroblasts, including a SMC-derived foam cell. We localized this foamy SMC to the deep intima of coronary atherosclerotic lesions. Using CITE-seq data, we also developed the first flow cytometry panel, using cell surface proteins CD29, CD142, and CD90, to isolate SMC-derived cells from lesions. Last, we found that the proportion of efferocytotic macrophages, classically activated endothelial cells, contractile and modulated SMC-derived cell types were reduced, and inflammatory SMCs were enriched in plaques of clinically symptomatic vs. asymptomatic patients.Our multimodal atlas of cell populations within atherosclerosis provides novel insights into the diversity, phenotype, location, isolation, and clinical relevance of the unique cellular composition of human carotid atherosclerosis. This facilitates both the mapping of cardiovascular disease susceptibility loci to specific cell types as well as the identification of novel molecular and cellular therapeutic targets for treatment of the disease."

To address this task, we introduce the Medical Action Ontology (MAxO), the first ontology specifically designed to organize medical procedures, therapies, and interventions in a structured way. Currently, MAxO contains 1757 medical action terms added through a combination of manual and semi-automated processes. MAxO was developed with logical structures that make it compatible with several other ontologies within the Open Biological and Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) Foundry. These cover a wide range of biomedical domains, from human anatomy and investigations to the chemical and protein entities involved in biological processes. We have created a database of over 16000 annotations that describe diagnostic modalities for specific phenotypic abnormalities as defined by the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO). Additionally, 413 annotations are provided for medical actions for 189 rare diseases. We have developed a web application called POET ( https://poet.jax.org/ ) for the community to use to contribute MAxO annotations. MAxO provides a computational representation of treatments and other actions taken for the clinical management of patients. The development of MAxO is closely coupled to the Mondo Disease Ontology (Mondo) and the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) and expands the scope of our computational modeling of diseases and phenotypic features to include diagnostics and therapeutic actions.

We sought to identify additional genetic loci associated with SSNS in children of Sri Lankan and European ancestry.We conducted a GWAS in a cohort of Sri Lankan individuals comprising 420 pediatric patients with SSNS and 2339 genetic ancestry matched controls obtained from the UK Biobank. We then performed a transethnic meta-analysis with a previously reported European cohort of 422 pediatric patients and 5642 controls.Our GWAS confirmed the previously reported association of SSNS withHLA-DR/DQ(rs9271602,P = 1.12 × 10-27, odds ratio [OR] = 2.75). Transethnic meta-analysis replicated these findings and identified a novel association atAHI1(rs2746432,P = 2.79 × 10-8, OR = 1.37), which was also replicated in an independent South Asian cohort.AHI1is implicated in ciliary protein transport and immune dysregulation, with rare variation in this gene contributing to Joubert syndrome type 3.Common variation inAHI1confers risk of the development of SSNS in both Sri Lankan and European populations. The association with common variation inAHI1further supports the role of immune dysregulation in the pathogenesis of SSNS and demonstrates that variation across the allele frequency spectrum in a gene can contribute to disparate monogenic and polygenic diseases.© 2023 International Society of Nephrology.

"37529046","Kidney function and cardiovascular diseases: a large-scale observational and Mendelian randomization study.","Front Immunol","Prior observational studies have found an association between kidney function and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). However, these studies did not investigate causality. Therefore, the aim of this study is to examine the causal relationship between kidney function and CVDs.We utilized data from the eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD) from the years 2014-2015 to evaluate the observational association between renal failure (RF) and CVDs. To investigate the causal effects of kidney function (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] and chronic kidney disease [CKD]) and CVDs (including atrial fibrillation [AF], coronary artery disease [CAD], heart failure [HF], any stroke [AS], and any ischemic stroke [AIS]), we conducted a two-sample bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis.In the observational analysis, a total of 157,883 patients were included. After adjusting for potential confounding factors, there was no significant association between baseline RF and an increased risk of developing CVDs during hospitalization [adjusted odds ratio (OR): 1.056, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.993 to 1.123,P= 0.083]. Conversely, baseline CVDs was significantly associated with an increased risk of developing RF during hospitalization (adjusted OR: 1.189, 95% CI: 1.139 to 1.240,P< 0.001). In the MR analysis, genetically predicted AF was associated with an increased risk of CKD (OR: 1.050, 95% CI: 1.016 to 1.085,P= 0.004). HF was correlated with lower eGFR (β: -0.056, 95% CI: -0.090 to -0.022,P= 0.001). A genetic susceptibility for AS and AIS was linked to lower eGFR (β: -0.057, 95% CI: -0.079 to -0.036,P< 0.001; β: -0.029, 95% CI: -0.050 to -0.009,P= 0.005; respectively) and a higher risk of CKD (OR: 1.332, 95% CI: 1.162 to 1.528,P< 0.001; OR: 1.197, 95% CI: 1.023 to 1.400,P= 0.025; respectively). Regarding the reverse direction analysis, there was insufficient evidence to prove the causal effects of kidney function on CVDs. Outcomes remained consistent in sensitivity analyses.Our study provides evidence for causal effects of CVDs on kidney function. However, the evidence to support the causal effects of kidney function on CVDs is currently insufficient.

Our understanding of systemic protein biomarkers associated with COPD remains incomplete.Objectives:To determine what proteins and pathways are associated with impaired pulmonary function in a diverse population.Methods:We studied 6,722 participants across six cohort studies with both aptamer-based proteomic and spirometry data (4,566 predominantly White participants in a discovery analysis and 2,156 African American cohort participants in a validation). In linear regression models, we examined protein associations with baseline forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC). In linear mixed effects models, we investigated the associations of baseline protein levels with rate of FEV1decline (ml/yr) in 2,777 participants with up to 7 years of follow-up spirometry.Results:We identified 254 proteins associated with FEV1in our discovery analyses, with 80 proteins validated in the Jackson Heart Study. Novel validated protein associations include kallistatin serine protease inhibitor, growth differentiation factor 2, and tumor necrosis factor-like weak inducer of apoptosis (discovery β = 0.0561,Q = 4.05 × 10-10; β  = 0.0421,Q = 1.12 × 10-3; and β = 0.0358,Q = 1.67 × 10-3, respectively). In longitudinal analyses within cohorts with follow-up spirometry, we identified 15 proteins associated with FEV1decline (Q < 0.05), including elafin leukocyte elastase inhibitor and mucin-associated TFF2 (trefoil factor 2; β = -4.3 ml/yr,Q = 0.049; β = -6.1 ml/yr,Q = 0.032, respectively). Pathways and processes highlighted by our study include aberrant extracellular matrix remodeling, enhanced innate immune response, dysregulation of angiogenesis, and coagulation.Conclusions:In this study, we identify and validate novel biomarkers and pathways associated with lung function traits in a racially diverse population. In addition, we identify novel protein markers associated with FEV1decline. Several protein findings are supported by previously reported genetic signals, highlighting the plausibility of certain biologic pathways. These novel proteins might represent markers for risk stratification, as well as novel molecular targets for treatment of COPD."

However, the drivers and mechanisms that underpin this fundamental switch are not understood. HSCs produce genotoxic formaldehyde that requires protection by the detoxification enzymes ALDH2 and ADH5 and the Fanconi anemia (FA) DNA repair pathway. We find that the HSCs in young Aldh2-/-Fancd2-/-mice harbor a transcriptomic signature equivalent to aged wild-type HSCs, along with increased epigenetic age, telomere attrition, and myeloid-biased differentiation quantified by single HSC transplantation. In addition, the p53 response is vigorously activated in Aldh2-/-Fancd2-/-HSCs, while p53 deletion rescued this aged HSC phenotype. To further define the origins of the myeloid differentiation bias, we use a GFP genetic reporter to find a striking enrichment of Vwf+ myeloid and megakaryocyte-lineage-biased HSCs. These results indicate that metabolism-derived formaldehyde-DNA damage stimulates the p53 response in HSCs to drive accelerated aging.Copyright © 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

However, limited by spatial resolution, the measured expressions at each spot are often from a mixture of multiple cells. Computational deconvolution methods designed for spatial transcriptomic data rarely make use of the valuable spatial information as well as the neighboring similarity information. Here, we propose SONAR, a Spatially weighted pOissoN-gAmma Regression model for cell-type deconvolution with spatial transcriptomic data. SONAR directly models the raw counts of spatial transcriptomic data and applies a geographically weighted regression framework that incorporates neighboring information to enhance local estimation of regional cell type composition. In addition, SONAR applies an additional elastic weighting step to adaptively filter dissimilar neighbors, which effectively prevents the introduction of local estimation bias in transition regions with sharp boundaries. We demonstrate the performance of SONAR over other state-of-the-art methods on synthetic data with various spatial patterns. We find that SONAR can accurately map region-specific cell types in real spatial transcriptomic data including mouse brain, human heart and human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. We further show that SONAR can reveal the detailed distributions and fine-grained co-localization of immune cells within the microenvironment at the tumor-normal tissue margin in human liver cancer.© 2023.

Inddm1mutants, DNA methylation can be restored by loss of the H3.3 chaperone HIRA, while the H3.1 chaperone CAF-1 becomes essential. The single-particle cryo-EM structure at 3.2 Å of DDM1 with a variant nucleosome reveals direct engagement at SHL2 with histone H3.3 at or near variant residues required for assembly, as well as with the deacetylated H4 tail. An N-terminal autoinhibitory domain binds H2A variants to allow remodeling, while a disulfide bond in the helicase domain is essential for activityin vivoandin vitro. We show that differential remodeling of H3 and H2A variantsin vitroreflects preferential depositionin vivo.

"37533101","Human Alzheimer's disease reactive astrocytes exhibit a loss of homeostastic gene expression.","Acta Neuropathol Commun","Astrocytes are one of the brain's major cell types and are responsible for maintaining neuronal homeostasis via regulating the extracellular environment, providing metabolic support, and modulating synaptic activity. In neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, astrocytes can take on a hypertrophic appearance. These reactive astrocytes are canonically associated with increases in cytoskeletal proteins, such as glial fibrillary acidic protein and vimentin. However, the molecular alterations that characterize astrocytes in human disease tissues have not been extensively studied with single cell resolution. Using single nucleus RNA sequencing data from normal, pathologic aging, and Alzheimer's disease brains, we identified the transcriptomic changes associated with reactive astrocytes. Deep learning-based clustering algorithms denoised expression data for 17,012 genes and clustered 15,529 astrocyte nuclei, identifying protoplasmic, gray matter and fibrous, white matter astrocyte clusters. RNA trajectory analyses revealed a spectrum of reactivity within protoplasmic astrocytes characterized by a modest increase of reactive genes and a marked decrease in homeostatic genes. Amyloid but not tau pathology correlated with astrocyte reactivity. To identify reactivity-associated genes, linear regressions of gene expression versus reactivity were used to identify the top 52 upregulated and 144 downregulated genes. Gene Ontology analysis revealed that upregulated genes were associated with cellular growth, responses to metal ions, inflammation, and proteostasis. Downregulated genes were involved in cellular interactions, neuronal development, ERBB signaling, and synapse regulation. Transcription factors were significantly enriched among the downregulated genes. Using co-immunofluorescence staining of Alzheimer's disease brain tissues, we confirmed pathologic downregulation of ERBB4 and transcription factor NFIA in reactive astrocytes. Our findings reveal that protoplasmic, gray matter astrocytes in Alzheimer's disease exist within a spectrum of reactivity that is marked by a strong loss of normal function.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Higher mtDNAfb was associated with an increased risk of NHL (median OR, 2.89; 95% CI, 1.40-5.93) in a dose-dependent manner (quartile 2 vs 1 OR, 1.24; 95% CI, 0.43-3.40; quartile 3 vs 1 OR, 3.58; 95% CI, 1.39-9.24; quartile 4 vs 1 OR, 3.42; 95% CI, 1.30- 8.99; P = .004 for trend).This study's findings suggest that increased mtDNAfb is associated with an increased future risk of NHL. Additional studies are needed to confirm these findings, particularly among women and nonsmokers."
"37343696","Proteomic Dynamics of Breast Cancer Cell Lines Identifies Potential Therapeutic Protein Targets.","Mol Cell Proteomics","Treatment and relevant targets for breast cancer (BC) remain limited, especially for triple-negative BC (TNBC). We identified 6091 proteins of 76 human BC cell lines using data-independent acquisition (DIA). Integrating our proteomic findings with prior multi-omics datasets, we found that including proteomics data improved drug sensitivity predictions and provided insights into the mechanisms of action. We subsequently profiled the proteomic changes in nine cell lines (five TNBC and four non-TNBC) treated with EGFR/AKT/mTOR inhibitors. In TNBC, metabolism pathways were dysregulated after EGFR/mTOR inhibitor treatment, while RNA modification and cell cycle pathways were affected by AKT inhibitor. This systematic multi-omics and in-depth analysis of the proteome of BC cells can help prioritize potential therapeutic targets and provide insights into adaptive resistance in TNBC.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

"37502878","X- vs. Y-Chromosome Influences on Human Behavior: A Deep Phenotypic Comparison of Psychopathology in XXY and XYY Syndromes.","medRxiv","Do different genetic disorders impart different psychiatric risk profiles? This question has major implications for biological and translational aspects of psychiatry, but has been difficult to tackle given limited access to shared batteries of fine-grained clinical data across genetic disorders. Using a new suite of generalizable analytic approaches, we examine gold-standard diagnostic ratings, scores on 66 dimensional measures of psychopathology, and measures of cognition and functioning in two different sex chromosome aneuploidies (SCAs) - Klinefelter (XXY/KS) and XYY syndrome (n=102 and 64 vs. n=74 and 60 matched XY controls, total n=300). We focus on SCAs for their high collective prevalence, informativeness regarding differential X- vs. Y-chromosome effects, and potential relevance for normative sex differences. We show that XXY/KS elevates rates for most psychiatric diagnoses as previously reported for XYY, but disproportionately so for anxiety disorders. Fine-mapping across all 66 traits provides a detailed profile of psychopathology in XXY/KS which is strongly correlated with that of XYY (r=.75 across traits) and robust to ascertainment biases, but reveals: (i) a greater penetrance of XYY than KS/XXY for most traits except mood/anxiety problems, and (ii) a disproportionate impact of XYY vs. XXY/KS on social problems. XXY/KS and XXY showed a similar coupling of psychopathology with adaptive function and caregiver strain, but not IQ. This work provides new tools for deep-phenotypic comparisons of genetic disorders in psychiatry and uses these to detail unique and shared effects of the X- and Y-chromosome on human behavior."

"37503053","Diallel panel reveals a significant impact of low-frequency genetic variants on gene expression variation in yeast.","bioRxiv","Unraveling the genetic sources of gene expression variation is essential to better understand the origins of phenotypic diversity in natural populations. Genome-wide association studies identified thousands of variants involved in gene expression variation, however, variants detected only explain part of the heritability. In fact, variants such as low-frequency and structural variants (SVs) are poorly captured in association studies. To assess the impact of these variants on gene expression variation, we explored a half-diallel panel composed of 323 hybrids originated from pairwise crosses of 26 naturalSaccharomyces cerevisiaeisolates. Using short- and long-read sequencing strategies, we established an exhaustive catalog of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and SVs for this panel. Combining this dataset with the transcriptomes of all hybrids, we comprehensively mapped SNPs and SVs associated with gene expression variation. While SVs impact gene expression variation, SNPs exhibit a higher effect size with an overrepresentation of low-frequency variants compared to common ones. These results reinforce the importance of dissecting the heritability of complex traits with a comprehensive catalog of genetic variants at the population level."

We sought to examine the effect of 5-ARi on new BCa diagnoses in a large US database.Men ≥ 50 y/o with a prescription for 5-ARi after BPH diagnosis were identified in the IBM® Marketscan® Research de-identified Databases between 2007 and 2016 and matched with paired controls. Incident BCa diagnoses were identified after BPH diagnosis and/or pharmacologic treatment. Multivariable regression modeling adjusting for relevant factors was implemented. Sub-group analyses by exposure risk were performed to explore the association between 5-ARi and BCa over time. Administration of alpha-blockers (α-B) w/o 5-ARi was also examined.In total, n = 24,036 men on 5-ARi, n = 107,086 on 5-ARi plus alpha-blockers, and n = 894,275 without medical therapy for BPH were identified. The percentage of men diagnosed with BCa was 0.8% for the 5-ARi, 1.4% for the 5-ARi + α-B, and 0.6% for the untreated BPH group of incident BCa (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.90, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.56 - 1.47), and 1.08, 95%CI 0.89 - 1.30, respectively). This was also true at both shorter (≤ 2 yr) and longer-term (> 2 yr) follow up. In addition, α-B alone had no change in BCa risk (HR 1.06, 0.86-1.30).We did not find any diminished risk of new BCa in men treated with 5-ARi (i.e., chemoprotective effect). The current report suggests that 5-ARi do not change a man's bladder cancer risk.© 2023. The Author(s)."

We present the setup and results of the Hacking the Human Body machine learning algorithm development competition hosted by the Human Biomolecular Atlas (HuBMAP) and the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) teams on the Kaggle platform. We create a dataset containing 880 histology images with 12,901 segmented structures, engaging 1175 teams from 78 countries in community-driven, open-science development of machine learning models. Tissue variations in the dataset pose a major challenge to the teams which they overcome by using color normalization techniques and combining vision transformers with convolutional models. The best model will be productized in the HuBMAP portal to process tissue image datasets at scale in support of Human Reference Atlas construction.© 2023. Springer Nature Limited."
