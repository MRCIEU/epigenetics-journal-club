"35146471","Epigenetic age acceleration in the emerging burden of cardiometabolic diseases among migrant and non-migrant African populations: the population based cross-sectional RODAM study.","Lancet Healthy Longev","African populations are experiencing health transitions due to rapid urbanization and international migration. However, the role of biological aging in this emerging burden of cardiometabolic diseases (CMD) among migrant and non-migrant Africans is unknown. We aimed to examine differences in epigenetic age acceleration (EAA) as measured by four clocks (Horvath, Hannum, PhenoAge and GrimAge) and their associations with cardiometabolic factors among migrant Ghanaians in Europe and non-migrant Ghanaians.Genome-wide DNA methylation (DNAm) data of 712 Ghanaians from cross-sectional RODAM study were used to quantify EAA. We assessed correlation of DNAmAge measures with chronological age, and then performed linear regressions to determine associations of body mass index (BMI), fasting blood glucose (FBG), blood pressure, alcohol consumption, smoking, physical activity, and one-carbon metabolism nutrients with EAA among migrant and non-migrants. We replicated our findings among 172 rural-urban sibling pairs from India migration study and among 120 native South Africans from PURE-SA-NW study.We found that Ghanaian migrants have lower EAA than non-migrants. Within migrants, higher FBG was positively associated with EAA measures. Within non-migrants, higher BMI, and Vitamin B9 (folate) intake were negatively associated with EAA measures. Our findings on FBG, BMI and folate were replicated in the independent cohorts.Our study shows that migration is negatively associated with EAA among Ghanaians. Moreover, cardiometabolic factors are differentially associated with EAA within migrant and non-migrant subgroups. Our results call for context-based interventions for CMD among transitioning populations that account for effects of biological aging.European Commission."
"35145228","Meta-analysis of epigenome-wide associations between DNA methylation at birth and childhood cognitive skills.","Mol Psychiatry","Cognitive skills are a strong predictor of a wide range of later life outcomes. Genetic and epigenetic associations across the genome explain some of the variation in general cognitive abilities in the general population and it is plausible that epigenetic associations might arise from prenatal environmental exposures and/or genetic variation early in life. We investigated the association between cord blood DNA methylation at birth and cognitive skills assessed in children from eight pregnancy cohorts within the Pregnancy And Childhood Epigenetics (PACE) Consortium across overall (total N = 2196), verbal (total N = 2206) and non-verbal cognitive scores (total N = 3300). The associations at single CpG sites were weak for all of the cognitive domains investigated. One region near DUSP22 on chromosome 6 was associated with non-verbal cognition in a model adjusted for maternal IQ. We conclude that there is little evidence to support the idea that variation in cord blood DNA methylation at single CpG sites is associated with cognitive skills and further studies are needed to confirm the association at DUSP22.© 2022.

The regulatory elements (15 chromatin states) and their coordinated activities in cattle were defined through genome-wide profiling of four histone modifications, CTCF-binding, DNA accessibility, DNA methylation, and transcriptome in rumen epithelial tissues. Each chromatin state presented specific enrichment for sequence ontology, methylation, trait-associated variants, transcription, gene expression-associated variants, selection signatures, and evolutionarily conserved elements. During weaning, weak enhancers and flanking active transcriptional start sites (TSS) were the most dynamic chromatin states and occurred in tandem with significant variations in gene expression and DNA methylation, significantly associated with stature, production, and reproduction economic traits. By comparing with in vitro cultured epithelial cells and in vivo rumen tissues, we showed the commonness and uniqueness of these results, especially the roles of cell interactions and mitochondrial activities in tissue development.Copyright © 2021.

"35142952","Prediction of transcription factors associated with DNA demethylation during human cellular development.","Chromosome Res","DNA methylation of CpG dinucleotides is an important epigenetic modification involved in the regulation of mammalian gene expression, with each type of cell developing a specific methylation profile during its differentiation. Recently, it has been shown that a small subgroup of transcription factors (TFs) might promote DNA demethylation at their binding sites. We developed a bioinformatics pipeline to predict from genome-wide DNA methylation data TFs that promote DNA demethylation at their binding site. We applied the pipeline to International Human Epigenome Consortium methylome data and selected 393 candidate transcription factor binding motifs and associated 383 TFs that are likely associated with DNA demethylation. Validation of a subset of the candidate TFs using an in vitro assay suggested that 28 of 49 TFs from various TF families had DNA-demethylation-promoting activity; TF families, such as bHLH and ETS, contained both TFs with and without the activity. The identified TFs showed large demethylated/methylated CpG ratios and their demethylated CpGs showed significant bias toward hypermethylation in original cells. Furthermore, the identified TFs promoted demethylation of distinct sets of CpGs, with slight overlap of the targeted CpGs among TF family members, which was consistent with the results of a gene ontology (GO) term analysis of the identified TFs. Gene expression analysis of the identified TFs revealed that multiple TFs from various families are specifically expressed in human cells and tissues. Together, our results suggest that a large number of TFs from various TF families are associated with cell-type-specific DNA demethylation during human cellular development.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35139887","Aberrant epigenetic and transcriptional events associated with breast cancer risk.","Clin Epigenetics","Genome-wide association studies have identified several breast cancer susceptibility loci. However, biomarkers for risk assessment are still missing. Here, we investigated cancer-related molecular changes detected in tissues from women at high risk for breast cancer prior to disease manifestation. Disease-free breast tissue cores donated by healthy women (N = 146, median age = 39 years) were processed for both methylome (MethylCap) and transcriptome (Illumina's HiSeq4000) sequencing. Analysis of tissue microarray and primary breast epithelial cells was used to confirm gene expression dysregulation.Transcriptomic analysis identified 69 differentially expressed genes between women at high and those at average risk of breast cancer (Tyrer-Cuzick model) at FDR < 0.05 and fold change ≥ 2. Majority of the identified genes were involved in DNA damage checkpoint, cell cycle, and cell adhesion. Two genes, FAM83A and NEK2, were overexpressed in tissue sections (FDR < 0.01) and primary epithelial cells (p < 0.05) from high-risk breasts. Moreover, 1698 DNA methylation changes were identified in high-risk breast tissues (FDR < 0.05), partially overlapped with cancer-related signatures, and correlated with transcriptional changes (p < 0.05, r ≤ 0.5). Finally, among the participants, 35 women donated breast biopsies at two time points, and age-related molecular alterations enhanced in high-risk subjects were identified.Normal breast tissue from women at high risk of breast cancer bears molecular aberrations that may contribute to breast cancer susceptibility. This study is the first molecular characterization of the true normal breast tissues, and provides an opportunity to investigate molecular markers of breast cancer risk, which may lead to new preventive approaches.© 2022.

"35139883","Small RNAs mediate transgenerational inheritance of genome-wide trans-acting epialleles in maize.","Genome Biol","Hybridization and backcrossing are commonly used in animal and plant breeding to induce heritable variation including epigenetic changes such as paramutation. However, the molecular basis for hybrid-induced epigenetic memory remains elusive.Here, we report that hybridization between the inbred parents B73 and Mo17 induces trans-acting hypermethylation and hypomethylation at thousands of loci; several hundreds (~ 3%) are transmitted through six backcrossing and three selfing generations. Notably, many transgenerational methylation patterns resemble epialleles of the nonrecurrent parent, despite > 99% of overall genomic loci are converted to the recurrent parent. These epialleles depend on 24-nt siRNAs, which are eliminated in the isogenic hybrid Mo17xB73:mop1-1 that is defective in siRNA biogenesis. This phenomenon resembles paramutation-like events and occurs in both intraspecific (Mo17xB73) and interspecific (W22xTeosinte) hybrid maize populations. Moreover, siRNA abundance and methylation levels of these epialleles can affect expression of their associated epigenes, many of which are related to stress responses.Divergent siRNAs between the hybridizing parents can induce trans-acting epialleles in the hybrids, while the induced epigenetic status is maintained for transgenerational inheritance during backcross and hybrid breeding, which alters epigene expression to enhance growth and adaptation. These genetic and epigenetic principles may apply broadly from plants to animals.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35137284","A pilot study that provides evidence of epigenetic changes among mother-child pairs living proximal to mining in the US.","Environ Geochem Health","Environmental exposures to chemicals can disrupt gene expression, and the effects could be mediated by methylation. This investigation focused on methylation of genes associated with exposure to metals. Mother-child pairs from three locations in Montana were recruited, and buccal cells were collected for genome-wide methylation assay. Four pairs were from Butte, where there is mining and a Superfund site, four pairs were from Anaconda with a Superfund site, and four pairs were from Missoula with neither a mine nor a Superfund site. Principal component analysis, linear mixed models, hierarchical clustering and heatmap, and gene set enrichment analysis were used to visualize the profiles, identify the top associated methylation loci, and investigate the involved pathways. Distinctly higher or lower methylation in samples from Butte were found at the top differentially methylated loci. The 200 genes harboring the most hypermethylated loci were significantly enriched in genes involved in actin cytoskeleton regulation, ABC transporters, leukocyte transendothelial migration, focal adhesion, and adherens junction, which plays a role in pathogenesis of disease, including autism spectrum disorders. This study lays a foundation for inquiry about genetic changes associated with environmental exposure to metals for people living in proximity to Superfund and open pit mining.© 2022.

"35137206","Transcriptome and Methylome Analysis of CNS Germ Cell Tumor Finds its Cell-of-Origin in Embryogenesis and Reveals Shared Similarities with Testicular Counterparts.","Neuro Oncol","CNS germ cell tumors (GCTs) predominantly develop in pediatric and young adult patients with variable responses to surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. This study aimed to examine the complex and largely unknown pathogenesis of CNS GCTs.We used a combined transcriptomic and methylomic approach in 84 cases and conducted an integrative analysis of the normal cells undergoing embryogenesis and testicular GCTs.Genome-wide transcriptome analysis in CNS GCTs indicated that germinoma had a transcriptomic profile representative of primitive cells during early embryogenesis with high meiosis/mitosis potentials, while non-germinomatous GCTs (NGGCTs) had differentiated phenotypes oriented toward tissue formation and organogenesis. Co-analysis with the transcriptome of human embryonic cells revealed that germinomas had expression profiles similar to those of primordial germ cells, while the expression profiles of NGGCTs were similar to those of embryonic stem cells. Some germinoma cases were characterized by extensive immune-cell infiltration and high expression of cancer-testis antigens. NGGCTs had significantly higher immune-cell infiltration, characterized by immune-suppression phenotype. CNS and testicular GCTs (TGCTs) had similar mutational profiles; TGCTs showed enhanced copy number alterations. Methylation analysis clustered germinoma/seminoma and non-germinoma/non-seminoma separately. Germinoma and seminoma were co-categorized based on the degree of the tumor microenvironment balance.These results suggested that the pathophysiology of GCTs was less dependent on their site of origin and more dependent on the state of differentiation as well as on the tumor microenvironment balance. This study revealed distinct biological properties of GCTs, which will hopefully lead to future treatment development.© The Author(s) 2022.

"35134240","Integrated DNA methylation, transcriptome and physiological analyses reveal new insights into superiority of poplars formed by interspecific grafting.","Tree Physiol","Plant grafting has a long history and it is extensively employed to improve plant performance. In our previous research, reciprocal grafts of Populus cathayana Rehder (C) and P. deltoides Bart. Ex Marsh (D) were generated. The results showed that interspecific grafting combinations (scion/rootstock: C/D and D/C) grew better than intraspecific grafting combinations (C/C and D/D). To further understand differences in molecular mechanisms between interspecific and intraspecific grafting, we performed an integrated analysis, including bisulfite sequencing, RNA sequencing and measurements of physiological indicators, to investigate leaves of different grafting combinations. We found that the difference at the genome-wide methylation level was greater in D/C vs D/D than in C/D vs C/C, but no difference was detected at the transcription level in D/C vs D/D. Furthermore, the grafting superiority of D/C vs D/D was not as strong as that of C/D vs C/C. These results may be associated with the different methylation forms, mCHH (71.76%) and mCG (57.16%), that accounted for the highest percentages in C/D vs C/C and D/C vs D/D, respectively. In addition, the interspecific grafting superiority was found mainly related to the process of photosynthesis, phytohormone signal transduction, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, cell wall and transcriptional regulation based on both physiological and molecular results. Overall, the results indicated that the physiological and molecular phenotypes of grafted plants are affected by the interaction between scion and rootstock. Thus, our study provides a theoretical basis for developing suitable scion-rootstock combinations for grafted plants.© The Author(s) 2022. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

"35131383","ARID1A loss-of-function induces CpG island methylator phenotype.","Cancer Lett","The CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) is associated with prognosis and drug sensitivity in multiple cancer types. In gastric cancer, the CIMP is closely associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection and AT-rich interactive domain 1A (ARID1A) mutations, a component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex. However, the involvement of SWI/SNF defects in CIMP induction has been unclear. In this study, we demonstrate a causal role of ARID1A loss-of-function in CIMP induction. Mutations of SWI/SNF components, especially ARID1A, was associated with the CIMP, as well as EBV infection, in gastric cancers, and also in uterine endometrial and colorectal cancers, which are not affected by EBV infection. Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis showed that ARID1A knockout (KO) in cultured 293FT cells and gastric epithelial cells, GES1, induced aberrant DNA methylation of a substantial number of CpG sites. DNA methylation was induced at genomic regions with high levels of pre-existing histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) and those with acquired H3K27me3 by ARID1A KO. These results showed that the ARID1A mutation induced aberrant DNA methylation, and this is likely to be one of the potential mechanisms of CIMP induction.Copyright © 2022.

"35128739","Temporal Changes in Transcripts of Miniature Inverted-Repeat Transposable Elements during Rice Endosperm Development.","Plant J","The repression of transcription from transposable elements (TEs) by DNA methylation is necessary to maintain genome integrity and prevent harmful mutations. However, under certain circumstances, TEs may escape from the host defense system and reactivate their transcription. In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and rice (Oryza sativa), DNA demethylases target the sequences derived from TEs in the central cell, the progenitor cell for the endosperm in the female gametophyte. Genome-wide DNA demethylation is also observed in the endosperm after fertilization. In this study, we used a custom microarray to survey the transcripts generated from TEs during rice endosperm development and at selected time points in the embryo as a control. The expression patterns of TE transcripts are dynamically up- and downregulated during endosperm development, especially those of miniature inverted-repeat TEs (MITEs). Some TE transcripts were directionally controlled, while the other DNA transposons and retrotransposons were not. We also discovered the NF-Y binding motif, CCAAT, in the region near the 5' terminal inverted repeat of Youren, one of the transcribed MITEs in the endosperm. Our results uncover dynamic changes in TE activity during endosperm development in rice.This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

It has a significant impact on morbidity and mortality globally and its prevalence increases exponentially with age. Therapies like catheter ablation or conventional antiarrhythmic drugs have not provided effective solution to the recurrence for AF over the past decades. Over 100 genetic loci have been discovered to be associated with AF by Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) but none has led to a therapy. Recently potential involvement of epigenetics (DNA methylation, histone modification, and non-coding RNAs) in the initiation and maintenance of AF has partly emerged as proof-of-concept in the mechanism and management of AF. Here we reviewed the epigenetic features involved in AF pathophysiology and provided an update of their implications in AF therapy.Copyright © 2022 Li, Nie, Han and Ni."
"35127488","Genome-Wide Methylation Profiling of lncRNAs Reveals a Novel Progression-Related and Prognostic Marker for Colorectal Cancer.","Front Oncol","Sporadic colorectal cancer (CRC) develops principally through the adenoma-carcinoma sequence. Previous studies revealed that DNA methylation alterations play a significant role in colorectal neoplastic transformation. On the other hand, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been identified to be associated with some critical tumorigenic processes of CRC. Accumulating evidence indicates more intricate regulatory relationships between DNA methylation and lncRNAs in CRC. Nevertheless, the methylation alterations of lncRNAs at different stages of colorectal carcinogenesis based on a genome-wide scale remain elusive. Therefore, in this study, we first used an Illumina MethylationEPIC BeadChip (850K array) to identify the methylation status of lncRNAs in 12 pairs of colorectal cancerous and adjacent normal tissues from cohort I, followed by cross-validation with The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Then, the abnormal hypermethylation of candidate genes in colorectal lesions was successfully confirmed by MassARRAY EpiTYPER in cohort II including 48 CRC patients, and cohort III including 286 CRC patients, 81 advanced adenoma (AA) patients and 81 nonadvanced adenoma (NAA) patients.DLX6-AS1hypermethylation was detected at all stages of colorectal neoplasms and occurred as early as the NAA stage during colorectal neoplastic progression. The methylation levels were significantly higher in the comparisons of CRC vs. NAA (P< 0.001) and AA vs. NAA (P= 0.004). Moreover, the hypermethylation ofDLX6-AS1promoter was also found in cell-free DNA samples collected from CRC patients as compared to healthy controls (Padj= 0.003). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis revealedDLX6-AS1promoter hypermethylation was independently associated with poorer disease-specific survival (HR = 2.52, 95% CI: 1.35-4.69,P= 0.004) and overall survival (HR = 1.64, 95% CI: 1.02-2.64,P= 0.042) in CRC patients. Finally, a nomogram was constructed and verified by a calibration curve to predict the survival probability of individual CRC patients (C-index: 0.789). Our findings indicateDLX6-AS1hypermethylation might be an early event during colorectal carcinogenesis and has the potential to be a novel biomarker for CRC progression and prognosis.Copyright © 2022 Lin, Gu, Qian, Liu, Sheng, Li, Yang, Ying, Li, Tang, Wang, Chen and Jin."
"35123963","Associations between plasma levels of brominated flame retardants and methylation of DNA from peripheral blood: A cross-sectional study in a cohort of French women.","Environ Res","Brominated flame retardants (BFRs) are organic compounds that are widespread in the environment. Because of their persistence, they are able to bioaccumulate with major impacts on human health. It has been hypothesized that the effect of BFRs on human health is mediated by alterations of DNA methylation.The aim of this study was to examine the association between methylation of DNA extracted from peripheral blood and circulating levels of BFRs measured in plasma.We conducted a methylation wide association study on 336 blood samples from a study within the E3N (Etude Epidémiologique auprès de femmes de l'Education Nationale) cohort, a long-term longitudinal cohort of French women. DNA methylation at more than 850 000 cytosine-guanine dinucleotide (CpG) sites was measured with the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation - EPIC BeadChip. Circulating levels of seven BFRs (BDE-28, BDE-47, BDE-99, BDE-100, BDE-153, BDE-154 and PBB-153) were measured by gas chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry in plasma samples. The association between DNA methylation and BFRs plasma levels was assessed through linear mixed-effects models followed by gene-set enrichment analyses (GSEA).We identified 253 CpG sites whose methylation levels were significantly associated with exposure to BFRs after Bonferroni correction. For 50 of these CpGs the p-values were less than 2.2x10-9with the strongest association being between BDE-154 and cg23619365 (4.32x10-13). GSEA of CpG sites associated with exposure to BFRs identified significant enrichment of genes involved in hypoxia, glycolysis and adipogenesis.Exposure to BFRs appears to be related to numerous alterations in DNA methylation. These findings, if replicated in independent studies, provide insights into the biological and health effects of BFRs.Copyright © 2022. Published by Elsevier Inc."
"35120798","Epigenetic regulation of bone mass.","Best Pract Res Clin Endocrinol Metab","Osteoporosis, characterised by low bone mass, poor bone structure, and an increased risk of fracture, is a major public health problem. There is increasing evidence that the influence of the environment on gene expression, through epigenetic processes, contributes to variation in BMD and fracture risk across the lifecourse. Such epigenetic processes include DNA methylation, histone and chromatin modifications and non-coding RNAs. Examples of associations with phenotype include DNA methylation in utero linked to maternal vitamin D status, and to methylation of target genes such as OPG and RANKL being associated with osteoporosis in later life. Epigenome-wide association studies and multi-omics technologies have further revealed susceptibility loci, and histone acetyltransferases, deacetylases and methylases are being considered as therapeutic targets. This review encompasses recent advances in our understanding of epigenetic mechanisms in the regulation of bone mass and osteoporosis development, and outlines possible diagnostic and prognostic biomarker applications.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

This study aimed to identify age-related DNA methylation changes on Y chromosome (ChrY). A two-stage study design was conducted in this study. The discovery stage contained 419 Chinese males, including 205 from the Wuhan-Zhuhai cohort panel, 107 from the coke oven workers panel, and 107 from the Shiyan panel. The validation stage contained 587 Chinese males from the Dongfeng-Tongji sub-cohort. We used the Illumina HumanMethylation BeadChip to determine genome-wide DNA methylation in peripheral blood of the study participants. The associations between age and methylation levels of ChrY CpGs were investigated by using linear regression models with adjustment for potential confounders. Further, associations of age-related ChrY CpGs with all-cause mortality were tested in the validation stage. We identified the significant associations of 41 ChrY CpGs with age at false discovery rate (FDR) <0.05 in the discovery stage, and 18 of them were validated in the validation stage (p < 0.05). Meta-analysis of both stages confirmed the robust positive associations of 14 CpGs and negative associations of 4 CpGs with age (FDR<0.05). Among them, cg03441493 and cg17816615 were significantly associated with all-cause mortality risk [HR(95% CI) = 1.37 (1.04, 1.79) and 0.70 (0.54, 0.93), respectively].

"35119793","DNA methylation in blood cells is associated with cortisol levels in offspring of mothers who had prenatal post-traumatic stress disorder.","Stress Health","Maternal stress during pregnancy is associated with differential DNA methylation in offspring and disrupted cortisol secretion. This study aimed to determine methylation signatures of cortisol levels in children, and whether associations differ based on maternal post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Blood epigenome-wide methylation and fasting cortisol levels were measured in 118 offspring of mothers recruited from the Kosovo Rehabilitation Centre for Torture Victims. Mothers underwent clinically administered assessment for PTSD using Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Correlations between offspring methylation and cortisol levels were examined using epigenome-wide analysis, adjusting for covariates. Subsequent analysis focussed on a priori selected genes involved in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis stress signalling. Methylation at four sites were correlated with cortisol levels (cg15321696, r = -0.33, cg18105800, r = +0.33, cg00986889, r = -0.25, and cg15920527, r = -0.27). In adjusted multivariable regression, when stratifying based on prenatal PTSD status, significant associations were only found for children born to mothers with prenatal PTSD (p < 0.001). Several sites within HPA axis genes were also associated with cortisol levels in the maternal PTSD group specifically. There is evidence that methylation is associated with cortisol levels, particularly in offspring born to mothers with prenatal PTSD. However, larger studies need to be carried out to independently validate these findings.© 2022 The Authors. Stress and Health published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd."
"35119365","Physiological TLR4 regulation in human fetal membranes as an explicative mechanism of a pathological preterm case.","Elife","The integrity of human fetal membranes is crucial for harmonious fetal development throughout pregnancy. Their premature rupture is often the consequence of a physiological phenomenon that has been exacerbated. Beyond all the implied biological processes, inflammation is of primary importance and is qualified as 'sterile' at the end of pregnancy. In this study, complementary methylomic and transcriptomic strategies on amnion and choriodecidua explants obtained from the altered (cervix zone) and intact fetal membranes at term and before labour were used. By cross-analysing genome-wide studies strengthened by in vitro experiments, we deciphered how the expression of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), an actor in pathological fetal membrane rupture, is controlled. Indeed, it is differentially regulated in the altered zone and between both layers by a dual mechanism: (1) the methylation of TLR4 and miRNA promoters and (2) targeting by miRNA (let-7a-2 and miR-125b-1) acting on the 3'-UTR of TLR4. Consequently, this study demonstrates that fine regulation of TLR4 is required for sterile inflammation establishment at the end of pregnancy and that it may be dysregulated in the pathological premature rupture of membranes.© 2022, Belville et al."
"35115040","A novel DNA methylation signature associated with lymph node metastasis status in early gastric cancer.","Clin Epigenetics","Lymph node metastasis (LNM) is an important factor for both treatment and prognosis of early gastric cancer (EGC). Current methods are insufficient to evaluate LNM in EGC due to suboptimal accuracy. Herein, we aim to identify methylation signatures for LNM of EGC, facilitate precision diagnosis, and guide treatment modalities.For marker discovery, genome-wide methylation sequencing was performed in a cohort (marker discovery) using 47 fresh frozen (FF) tissue samples. The identified signatures were subsequently characterized for model development using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples by qPCR assay in a second cohort (model development cohort, n = 302, training set: n = 151, test set: n = 151). The performance of the established model was further validated using FFPE samples in a third cohorts (validation cohort, n = 130) and compared with image-based diagnostics, conventional clinicopathology-based model (conventional model), and current standard workups.Fifty LNM-specific methylation signatures were identified de novo and technically validated. A derived 3-marker methylation model for LNM diagnosis was established that achieved an AUC of 0.87 and 0.88, corresponding to the specificity of 80.9% and 85.7%, sensitivity of 80.6% and 78.1%, and accuracy of 80.8% and 83.8% in the test set of model development cohort and validation cohort, respectively. Notably, this methylation model outperformed computed tomography (CT)-based imaging with a superior AUC (0.88 vs. 0.57, p < 0.0001) and individual clinicopathological features in the validation cohort. The model integrated with clinicopathological features demonstrated further enhanced AUCs of 0.89 in the same cohort. The 3-marker methylation model and integrated model reduced 39.4% and 41.5% overtreatment as compared to standard workups, respectively.A novel 3-marker methylation model was established and validated that shows diagnostic potential to identify LNM in EGC patients and thus reduce unnecessary gastrectomy in EGC.© 2022.

The aim of this study was to identify differentially expressed and differentially methylated genes, contributing to explore the molecular mechanism of CRC.Firstly, the data of gene transcriptome and genome-wide DNA methylation expression were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Secondly, functional analysis of differentially expressed and differentially methylated genes was performed, followed by protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis. Thirdly, the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset and in vitro experiment was used to validate the expression of selected differentially expressed and differentially methylated genes. Finally, diagnosis and prognosis analysis of selected differentially expressed and differentially methylated genes was performed.Up to 1958 differentially expressed (1025 up-regulated and 993 down-regulated) genes and 858 differentially methylated (800 hypermethylated and 58 hypomethylated) genes were identified. Interestingly, some genes, such as GFRA2 and MDFI, were differentially expressed-methylated genes. Purine metabolism (involved IMPDH1), cell adhesion molecules and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway were significantly enriched signaling pathways. GFRA2, FOXQ1, CDH3, CLDN1, SCGN, BEST4, CXCL12, CA7, SHMT2, TRIP13, MDFI and IMPDH1 had a diagnostic value for CRC. In addition, BEST4, SHMT2 and TRIP13 were significantly associated with patients' survival.The identified altered genes may be involved in tumorigenesis of CRC. In addition, BEST4, SHMT2 and TRIP13 may be considered as diagnosis and prognostic biomarkers for CRC patients.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35113965","Epigenetic clock analysis and increased plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 in high-functioning autism spectrum disorder.","PLoS One","Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by impaired social communication and behavioral problems. An increased risk of premature mortality has been observed in individuals with ASD. Therefore, we hypothesized that biological aging is accelerated in individuals with ASD. Recently, several studies have established genome-wide DNA methylation (DNAm) profiles as 'epigenetic clocks' that can estimate biological aging. In addition, ASD has been associated with differential DNAm patterns.We used two independent datasets from blood samples consisting of adult patients with high-functioning ASD and controls: the 1st cohort (38 ASD cases and 31 controls) and the 2nd cohort (6 ASD cases and 10 controls). We explored well-studied epigenetic clocks such as HorvathAge, HannumAge, SkinBloodAge, PhenoAge, GrimAge, and DNAm-based telomere length (DNAmTL). In addition, we investigated seven DNAm-based age-related plasma proteins, including plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), and smoking status, which are the components of GrimAge.Compared to controls, individuals with ASD in the 1st cohort, but not in the 2nd cohort, exhibited a trend for increased GrimAge acceleration and a significant increase of PAI-1 levels. A meta-analysis showed significantly increased PAI-1 levels in individuals with ASD compared to controls.Our findings suggest there is no epigenetic age acceleration in the blood of individuals with ASD. However, this study provides novel evidence regarding increased plasma PAI-1 levels in individuals with high-functioning ASD. These findings suggest PAI-1 may be a biomarker for high-functioning ASD, however, larger studies based on epigenetic clocks and PAI-1 will be necessary to confirm these findings."
"35113241","Reliability of a novel approach for reference-based cell type estimation in human placental DNA methylation studies.","Cell Mol Life Sci","The placenta is a central organ during early development, influencing trajectories of health and disease. DNA methylation (DNAm) studies of human placenta improve our understanding of how its function relates to disease risk. However, DNAm studies can be biased by cell type heterogeneity, so it is essential to control for this in order to reduce confounding and increase precision. Computational cell type deconvolution approaches have proven to be very useful for this purpose. For human placenta, however, an assessment of the performance of these estimation methods is still lacking. Here, we examine the performance of a newly available reference-based cell type estimation approach and compare it to an often-used reference-free cell type estimation approach, namely RefFreeEWAS, in placental genome-wide DNAm samples taken at birth and from chorionic villus biopsies early in pregnancy using three independent studies comprising over 1000 samples. We found both reference-free and reference-based estimated cell type proportions to have predictive value for DNAm, however, reference-based cell type estimation outperformed reference-free estimation for the majority of data sets. Reference-based cell type estimations mirror previous histological knowledge on changes in cell type proportions through gestation. Further, CpGs whose variation in DNAm was largely explained by reference-based estimated cell type proportions were in the proximity of genes that are highly tissue-specific for placenta. This was not the case for reference-free estimated cell type proportions. We provide a list of these CpGs as a resource to help researchers to interpret results of existing studies and improve future DNAm studies of human placenta.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35111672","A Genome-Wide Investigation of Effects of Aberrant DNA Methylation on the Usage of Alternative Promoters in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.","Front Oncol","The alternative usage of promoters provides a way to regulate gene expression, has a significant influence on the transcriptome, and contributes to the cellular transformation of cancer. However, the function of alternative promoters (APs) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not been systematically studied yet. In addition, the potential mechanism of regulation to the usage of APs remains unclear. DNA methylation, one of the most aberrant epigenetic modifications in cancers, is known to regulate transcriptional activity. Whether DNA methylation regulates the usage of APs needs to be explored. Here, we aim to investigate the effects of DNA methylation on usage of APs in HCC.Promoter activities were calculated based on RNA-seq data. Functional enrichment analysis was implemented to conduct GO terms. Correlation tests were used to detect the correlation between promoter activity and methylation status. The LASSO regression model was used to generate a diagnostic model. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to compare the overall survival between high and low methylation groups. RNA-seq and whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) in HCC samples were performed to validate the correlation of promoter activity and methylation.We identified 855 APs in total, which could be well used to distinguish cancer from normal samples. The correlation of promoter activity and DNA methylation in APs was observed, and the APs with negative correlation were defined as methylation-regulated APs (mrAPs). Six mrAPs were identified to generate a diagnostic model with good performance (AUC = 0.97). Notably, the majority of mrAPs had CpG sites that could be used to predict clinical outcomes by methylation status. Finally, we verified 85.6% of promoter activity variation and 92.3% of methylation changes in our paired RNA-seq and WGBS samples, respectively. The negative correlation between promoter activity and methylation status was further confirmed in our HCC samples.The aberrant methylation status plays a critical role in the precision usage of APs in HCC, which sheds light on the mechanism of cancer development and provides a new insight into cancer screening and treatment.Copyright © 2022 Dong, Liu, Jiang, Wei, Xiang, Liao, Wang and He."

However, evidence is just budding on the effects of aerobic exercise-induced adaptation on DNA methylation in older mild cognitively impaired (MCI) elderly African American (AAs). Therefore, we examined the effects of a 6-month aerobic exercise-intervention on genome-wide DNA methylation in elderly AA MCI volunteers.Elderly AA volunteers confirmed MCI assigned into a 6-month program of aerobic exercise (eleven participants) underwent a 40-min supervised-training 3-times/week and controls (eight participants) performed stretch training. Participants had maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) test and Genome-wide methylation levels at CpG sites using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip assay at baseline and after a 6-month exercise program. We computed false discovery rates (FDR) using Sidak to account for multiplicity of tests and performed quantitative real-time polymerase chain-reaction (qRT-PCR) to confirm the effects of DNA methylations on expression levels of the top 5 genes among the aerobic participants. CpG sites identified from aerobic-exercise participants were similarly analyzed by the stretch group to quantify the effects of exercise-induced methylation changes among the group of stretch participants.Eleven MCI participants (aerobic: 73% females; mean age 72.3 ± 6.6 years) and eight MCI participants (stretch: 75% female; mean age 70.6 ± 6.7 years) completed the training. Aerobic exercise-training was associated with increases in VO2max and with global hypo- and hypermethylation changes. The most notable finding was CpG hypomethylation within the body of theVPS52gene (P= 5.4 × 10-26), a Golgi-associated protein, involved in intracellular protein trafficking including amyloid precursor protein. qRT-PCR confirmed a nearly twofold increased expression ofVPS52. Other top findings with FDRq-value < 10-5, include hypomethylations ofSCARB1(8.8 × 10-25),ARTN(6.1 × 10-25),NR1H2(2.1 × 10-18) andPPP2R5D(9.8 × 10-18).We conclude that genome-wide DNA methylation patterns is associated with exercise training-induced methylation changes. Identification of methylation changes around genes previously shown to interact with amyloid biology, intracellular protein trafficking, and lipoprotein regulations provide further support to the likely protective effect of exercise in MCI. Future studies in larger samples are needed to confirm our findings.Copyright © 2022 Ngwa, Nwulia, Ntekim, Bedada, Kwabi-Addo, Nadarajah, Johnson, Southerland, Kwagyan and Obisesan."

From the viewpoint of public health and clinical care, an objective biomarker of long-term smoking behavior is sought.Methods and Results:This study assessed DNA methylation as a biomarker of smoking in a hospital setting through a combination of molecular approaches including genetic, DNA methylation and mRNA expression analyses. First, in an epigenome-wide association study involving Japanese individuals with chronic cardiovascular disease (n=94), genome-wide significant smoking association was identified at 2 CpG sites on chromosome 5, with the strongest signal at cg05575921 located in intron 3 of the aryl-hydrocarbon receptor repressor (AHRR) gene. Highly significant (P<1×10-27) smoking-cg05575921 association was validated in 2 additional panels (n=339 and n=300). For the relationship of cg05575921 methylation extent with time after smoking cessation and cumulative cigarette consumption among former smokers, smoking-related hypomethylation was found to remain for ≥20 years after smoking cessation and to be affected by multiple factors, such ascis-interaction of genetic variation. There was a significant inverse correlation (P=0.0005) between cg05575921 methylation extent andAHRRmRNA expression.The present study results support that reversion of AHRR hypomethylation can be a quantifiable biomarker for progress in and observance of smoking cessation, although some methodological points need to be considered."

This social epigenomics study included long-term childhood cancer survivors enrolled in the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort. DNA methylation (DNAm) data were generated using the Illumina EPIC BeadChip, and three social determinants of health (SDOH) factors were assessed: self-reported educational attainment, personal income, and an area deprivation index based on census track data. An epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) was performed to evaluate the relation between DNAm at each 5'-cytosine-phosphate-guanine-3' (CpG) site and each SDOH factor based on multivariable linear regression models stratified by ancestry (European ancestry, n = 1,618; African ancestry, n = 258). EWAS among survivors of European ancestry identified 130 epigenome-wide significant SDOH-CpG associations (P< 9 × 10-8), 25 of which were validated in survivors of African ancestry (P< 0.05). Thirteen CpGs were associated with all three SDOH factors and resided at pleiotropic loci in cigarette smoking-related genes (e.g.,CLDND1andCPOX). After accounting for smoking and body mass index, these associations remained significant with attenuated effect sizes. Seven of 13 CpGs were associated with gene expression level based on 57 subsamples with blood RNA sequencing data available. In conclusion, DNAm signatures, many resembling the effect of tobacco use, were associated with SDOH factors among survivors of childhood cancer, thereby suggesting that biologically distal SDOH factors influence health behaviours or related factors, the epigenome, and subsequently survivors' health."

Peripheral CD19(+)- and CD4(+)-cells were isolated.Global DNA methylation (5mC)/hydroxymethylation (5hmC) was studied by ELISAs. mRNA of DNA methylation (DNMT1/3A/3B) and their counteracting hydroxymethylation enzymes (TET1/2/3) was determined by quantitative RT-PCR. Epigenome wide association study (EWAS) was performed in CD4(+)-cells (Illumina HumanMethylation 850K array) in AIH and HC. Total 5mC/5hmC was also assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) on paraffin embedded liver sections.Reduced TET1 and increased DNMT3A mRNA levels characterized CD19(+) and CD4(+)-lymphocytes from AIH-tp1 compared to HC and PBC respectively, without affecting global DNA 5mC/5hmC. In AIH-tp1, CD4(+) DNMT3A expression was negatively correlated with serum IgG (p=0.03). In remission, DNMT3A decreased in both CD19(+) and CD4(+)-cells compared to AIH-tp1 (p=0.02, p=0.03, respectively). EWAS in CD4(+)-cells from AIH patients confirmed important modifications in genes implicated in immune responses (HLA-DP, TNF, lnRNAs and CD86). IHC showed increased 5hmC staining of periportal infiltrating lymphocytes in AIH-tp1 compared to HC and PBC.Altered TET1 and DNMT3A expressions, characterize peripheral lymphocytes in AIH.

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), including exposure interventions, belong to the most efficient treatments of PD although its biological mechanism of action remains unknown. For the first time, we explored the dynamics and magnitude of DNA-methylation and immune cell-type composition during CBT (n = 38) and the therapeutic exposure intervention (n = 21) to unravel their biological correlates and identify possible biomarkers of therapy success. We report transient regulation of the CD4 + T-Cells, Natural Killers cells, Granulocytes during exposure and a significant change in the proportions of CD4 + T cells, CD8 + T cells and B-Cells and Granulocytes during therapy. In an epigenome-wide association study we identified cg01586609 located in a CpG island and annotated to the serotonin receptor 3 A (HTR3A) to be differentially methylated during fear exposure and regulated at gene expression level with significant differences between remitters and non-remitters (p = 0.028). We moreover report cg01699630 annotated to ARG1 to undergo long lasting methylation changes during therapy (paired t test, genome-wide adj.p value = 0.02). This study reports the first data-driven biological candidates for epigenetically mediated effects of acute fear exposure and CBT in PD patients. Our results provide evidence of changes in the serotonin receptor 3 A methylation and expression during fear exposure associated with different long-term CBT trajectories and outcome, making it a possible candidate in the search of markers for therapy success.

It is hypothesized that changes in offspring DNA methylation (DNAm) underline these associations.To address this hypothesis, we conducted fixed-effects meta-analyses of epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) results from eight birth cohorts investigating relationships between cord blood DNAm and fetal exposure to maternal glucose (Nmaximum = 3,503), insulin (Nmaximum = 2,062), and area under the curve of glucose (AUCgluc) following oral glucose tolerance tests (Nmaximum = 1,505). We performed lookup analyses for identified cytosine-guanine dinucleotides (CpGs) in independent observational cohorts to examine associations between DNAm and cardiometabolic traits as well as tissue-specific gene expression.Greater maternal AUCgluc was associated with lower cord blood DNAm at neighboring CpGs cg26974062 (β [SE] = 0.013 [2.1 × 10-3], P value corrected for false discovery rate [PFDR] = 5.1 × 10-3) and cg02988288 (β [SE]-0.013 [2.3 × 10-3], PFDR = 0.031) in TXNIP. These associations were attenuated in women with GDM. Lower blood DNAm at these two CpGs near TXNIP was associated with multiple metabolic traits later in life, including type 2 diabetes. TXNIP DNAm in liver biopsies was associated with hepatic expression of TXNIP. We observed little evidence of associations between either maternal glucose or insulin and cord blood DNAm.Maternal hyperglycemia, as reflected by AUCgluc, was associated with lower cord blood DNAm at TXNIP. Associations between DNAm at these CpGs and metabolic traits in subsequent lookup analyses suggest that these may be candidate loci to investigate in future causal and mediation analyses.© 2022 by the American Diabetes Association."

However, the causality and mechanisms by which alcohol exerts its carcinogenic effect are unclear. We evaluated the association between alcohol consumption and CRC risk by analyzing data from 32 cohort studies and conducted two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to examine for casual relationship. To explore the effect of alcohol related DNA methylation on CRC risk, we performed an epigenetic MR analysis with data from an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS). We additionally performed gene-alcohol interaction analysis nested in the UK Biobank to assess effect modification between alcohol consumption and susceptibility genes. We discovered distinct effects of alcohol on CRC incidence and mortality from the meta-analyses, and genetic predisposition to alcohol drinking was causally associated with an increased CRC risk (OR = 1.79, 95% CI: 1.23-2.61) using two-sample MR approaches. In epigenetic MR analysis, two alcohol-related CpG sites (cg05593667 and cg10045354 mapped to COLCA1/COLCA2 gene) were identified causally associated with an increased CRC risk (P < 8.20 × 10-4). Gene-alcohol interaction analysis revealed that carriage of the risk allele of the eQTL (rs3087967) and mQTL (rs11213823) polymorphism of COLCA1/COLCA2 would interact with alcohol consumption to increase CRC risk (PInteraction = .027 and PInteraction = .016).

Recent studies demonstrated that CpG methylation-dependent transcriptional regulation is a widespread phenomenon. Here, we present MethReg, an R/Bioconductor package that analyzes matched DNA methylation and gene expression data, along with external transcription factor (TF) binding information, to evaluate, prioritize and annotate CpG sites with high regulatory potential. At these CpG sites, TF-target gene associations are often only present in a subset of samples with high (or low) methylation levels, so they can be missed by analyses that use all samples.

Due to the poor accessibility to the target organ, CNS-confined processes underpinning the later progressive form of MS remain elusive thereby limiting treatment options. We aimed to examine DNA methylation, a stable epigenetic mark of genome activity, in glial cells to capture relevant molecular changes underlying MS neuropathology. We profiled DNA methylation in nuclei of non-neuronal cells, isolated from 38 post-mortem normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) specimens of MS patients (n = 8) in comparison to white matter of control individuals (n = 14), using Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip. We identified 1,226 significant (genome-wide adjustedP-value < 0.05) differentially methylated positions (DMPs) between MS patients and controls. Functional annotation of the altered DMP-genes uncovered alterations of processes related to cellular motility, cytoskeleton dynamics, metabolic processes, synaptic support, neuroinflammation and signaling, such as Wnt and TGF-β pathways. A fraction of the affected genes displayed transcriptional differences in the brain of MS patients, as reported by publically available transcriptomic data. Cell type-restricted annotation of DMP-genes attributed alterations of cytoskeleton rearrangement and extracellular matrix remodelling to all glial cell types, while some processes, including ion transport, Wnt/TGF-β signaling and immune processes were more specifically linked to oligodendrocytes, astrocytes and microglial cells, respectively. Our findings strongly suggest that NAWM glial cells are highly altered, even in the absence of lesional insult, collectively exhibiting a multicellular reaction in response to diffuse inflammation."

Although cancer-related CDCA8 hyperactivation has been widely observed, its molecular mechanism remains elusive. Here, we report that CDCA8 overexpression maintains tumorigenicity and is associated with poor clinical outcome in patients with prostate cancer (PCa). Notably, enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) is identified to be responsible for CDCA8 activation in PCa. Genome-wide assays revealed that EZH2-induced H3K27 trimethylation represses let-7b expression and thus protects the let-7b-targeting CDCA8 transcripts. More importantly, EZH2 facilitates the self-activation of E2F1 by recruiting E2F1 to its own promoter region in a methylation-independent manner. The high level of E2F1 further promotes transcription of CDCA8 along with the other CPC subunits. Taken together, our study suggests that EZH2-mediated cell cycle regulation in PCa relies on both its methyltransferase and non-methyltransferase activities.© 2022.

Epigenetic drugs, aiming to reverse these aberrant transcriptional patterns and sensitize cancer cells to other therapies, provide a new treatment strategy for drug-resistant tumors. Here we investigated the ability of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor decitabine (DAC) to increase the sensitivity of BC cells to anthracycline antibiotic doxorubicin (DOX). Three cell lines representing different molecular BC subtypes, JIMT-1, MDA-MB-231 and T-47D, were used to evaluate the synergy of sequential DAC + DOX treatment in vitro. The cytotoxicity, genotoxicity, apoptosis, and migration capacity were tested in 2D and 3D cultures. Moreover, genome-wide DNA methylation and transcriptomic analyses were employed to understand the differences underlying DAC responsiveness. The ability of DAC to sensitize trastuzumab-resistant HER2-positive JIMT-1 cells to DOX was examined in vivo in an orthotopic xenograft mouse model. DAC and DOX synergistic effect was identified in all tested cell lines, with JIMT-1 cells being most sensitive to DAC. Based on the whole-genome data, we assume that the aggressive behavior of JIMT-1 cells can be related to the enrichment of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and stemness-associated pathways in this cell line. The four-week DAC + DOX sequential administration significantly reduced the tumor growth, DNMT1 expression, and global DNA methylation in xenograft tissues. The efficacy of combination therapy was comparable to effect of pegylated liposomal DOX, used exclusively for the treatment of metastatic BC.

Environmental factors such as maternal smoking during pregnancy, socio-economic status, trauma, or early life stress are associated with CD. Although the number of females with CD is rising in Western societies, CD is under-researched in female cohorts. We aimed at exploring the epigenetic signature of females with CD and its relation to psychosocial and environmental risk factors. We performed HpaII sensitive genome-wide methylation sequencing of 49 CD girls and 50 matched typically developing controls and linear regression models to identify differentially methylated CpG loci (tags) and regions. Significant tags and regions were mapped to the respective genes and tested for enrichment in pathways and brain developmental processes. Finally, epigenetic signatures were tested as mediators for CD-associated risk factors. We identified a 12% increased methylation 5' of the neurite modulator SLITRK5 (FDR = 0.0046) in cases within a glucocorticoid receptor binding site. Functionally, methylation positively correlated with gene expression in lymphoblastoid cell lines. At systems-level, genes (uncorr. P < 0.01) were associated with development of neurons, neurite outgrowth or neuronal developmental processes. At gene expression level, the associated gene-networks are activated perinatally and during early childhood in neocortical regions, thalamus and striatum, and expressed in amygdala and hippocampus. Specifically, the epigenetic signatures of the gene network activated in the thalamus during early childhood correlated with the effect of parental education on CD status possibly mediating its protective effect. The differential methylation patterns identified in females with CD are likely to affect genes that are expressed in brain regions previously indicated in CD. We provide suggestive evidence that protective effects are likely mediated by epigenetic mechanisms impairing specific brain developmental networks and therefore exerting a long-term effect on neural functions in CD. Our results are exploratory and thus, further replication is needed."

Here, we explored DNA methylation in bacteria of the genusEnsifer, including its potential role in regulating terminal differentiation during nitrogen-fixing symbiosis with legumes. Using single-molecule real-time sequencing, six genome-wide methylated motifs were identified across fourEnsiferstrains, five of which were strain-specific. Only the GANTC motif, recognized by the cell cycle-regulated CcrM methyltransferase, was methylated in all strains. In actively dividing cell cultures, methylation of GANTC motifs increased progressively from theoritoterregions in each replicon, in agreement with a cell cycle-dependent regulation of CcrM. In contrast, there was near full genome-wide GANTC methylation in the early stage of symbiotic differentiation. This was followed by a moderate decrease in the overall extent of methylation and a progressive decrease in chromosomal GANTC methylation from theoritoterregions in later stages of differentiation. Based on these observations, we suggest that CcrM activity is dysregulated and constitutive during terminal differentiation, which we hypothesize is a driving factor for endoreduplication of terminally differentiated bacteroids.IMPORTANCENitrogen fixation by rhizobia in symbiosis with legumes is economically and ecologically important. The symbiosis can involve a complex bacterial transformation-terminal differentiation-that includes major shifts in the transcriptome and cell cycle. Epigenetic regulation is an important regulatory mechanism in diverse bacteria; however, the roles of DNA methylation in rhizobia and symbiotic nitrogen fixation have been poorly investigated. We show that aside from cell cycle regulation, DNA methyltransferases are unlikely to have conserved roles in the biology of bacteria of the genusEnsifer. However, we present evidence consistent with an interpretation that the cell cycle methyltransferase CcrM is dysregulated during symbiosis, which we hypothesize may be a key factor driving the cell cycle switch in terminal differentiation required for effective symbioses."

However, the relationships of functional elements inside these loci with BP are not fully understood. This study represented an effort to determine if promoter DNA methylations inside BP-associated loci were associated with BP.We conducted a cross-sectional study investigating the association between promoter DNA methylations of 10 candidate genes and BP in 1,241 Chinese individuals. Twenty-one genomic fragments in the CpG Islands were sequenced. The associations of methylation levels with BP and hypertension were assessed in regression models. Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was then applied to find supporting evidence for the identified associations.A total of 413 DNA methylation sites were examined in an observational study. Methylation levels of 24 sites inPRDM6,IGFBP3,SYT7,PDE3A,TBX2andC17orf82were significantly associated with BP. Methylation levels ofPRDM6andSYT7were significantly associated with hypertension. Methylation levels of five sites (including cg06713098) inIGFBP3were significantly associated with DBP. MR analysis found associations between the methylation levels of six CpG sites (cg06713098, cg14228300, cg23193639, cg21268650, cg10677697 and cg04812164) around theIGFBP3promoter and DBP. Methylation levels of cg14228300 and cg04812164 were associated with SBP. By further applying several MR methods we showed that the associations may not be due to pleiotropy. Association betweenIGFBP3mRNA levels in blood cells and BP was also found in MR analysis. This study identified promoter methylation as potential functional element for BP. The identified methylations may be involved in the regulatory pathway linking genetic variants to BP.Copyright © 2022 Zhang, Wang, Xu, Mo and Zhang."
"35083470","Iron homeostasis pathway DNA methylation trajectories reveal a role for STEAP3 metalloreductase in patient outcomes after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.","Epigenetics Commun","Following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH), the brain is susceptible to ferroptosis, a type of iron-dependent cell death. Therapeutic intervention targeting the iron homeostasis pathway shows promise for mitigating ferroptosis and improving recovery in animal models, but little work has been conducted in humans. DNA methylation (DNAm) plays a key role in gene expression and brain function, plasticity, and injury recovery, making it a potentially useful biomarker of outcomes or therapeutic target for intervention. Therefore, in this longitudinal, observational study, we examined the relationships between trajectories of DNAm in candidate genes related to iron homeostasis and acute (cerebral vasospasm and delayed cerebral ischemia) and long-term (Glasgow Outcome Scale [GOS, unfavorable = 1-3] and death) patient outcomes after aSAH.Longitudinal, genome-wide DNAm data were generated from DNA extracted from post-aSAH cerebrospinal fluid (n= 260 participants). DNAm trajectories of 637 CpG sites in 36 candidate genes related to iron homeostasis were characterized over 13 days post-aSAH using group-based trajectory analysis, an unsupervised clustering method. Significant associations were identified between inferred DNAm trajectory groups at several CpG sites and acute and long-term outcomes. Among our results, cg25713625 in the STEAP3 metalloreductase gene (STEAP3) stood out. Specifically, in comparing the highest cg25713625 DNAm trajectory group with the lowest, we observed significant associations (i.e., based onp-values less than an empirical significance threshold) with unfavorable GOS at 3 and 12 months (OR= 11.7,p= 0.0006 andOR= 15.6,p= 0.0018, respectively) and death at 3 and 12 months (OR= 19.1,p= 0.0093 andOR= 12.8,p= 0.0041, respectively). These results were replicated in an independent sample (n= 100 participants) observing significant associations with GOS at 3 and 12 months (OR= 8.2,p= 0.001 andOR= 6.3,p= 0.0.0047, respectively) and death at 3 months (OR= 2.3,p= 0.008) and a suggestive association (i.e.,p-value < 0.05 not meeting an empirical significance threshold) with death at 12 months (OR= 2.0,p= 0.0272). In both samples, an additive effect of the DNAm trajectory group was observed as the percentage of participants with unfavorable long-term outcomes increased substantially with higher DNAm trajectory groups.Our results support a role for DNAm of cg25713625/STEAP3in recovery following aSAH. Additional research is needed to further explore the role of DNAm of cg25713625/STEAP3as a biomarker of unfavorable outcomes, or therapeutic target to improve outcomes, to translate these findings clinically."
"35083469","Characterization of cerebrospinal fluid DNA methylation age during the acute recovery period following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.","Epigenetics Commun","Biological aging may occur at different rates than chronological aging due to genetic, social, and environmental factors. DNA methylation (DNAm) age is thought to be a reliable measure of accelerated biological aging which has been linked to an array of poor health outcomes. Given the importance of chronological age in recovery following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH), a type of stroke, DNAm age may also be an important biomarker of outcomes, further improving predictive models. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a unique tissue representing the local central nervous system environment post-aSAH. However, the validity of CSF DNAm age is unknown, and it is unclear which epigenetic clock is ideal to compute CSF DNAm age, particularly given changes in cell type heterogeneity (CTH) during the acute recovery period. Further, the stability of DNAm age post-aSAH, specifically, has not been examined and may improve our understanding of patient recovery post-aSAH. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to characterize CSF DNAm age over 14 days post-aSAH using four epigenetic clocks.Genome-wide DNAm data were available for two tissues: (1) CSF forN= 273 participants with serial sampling over 14 days post-aSAH (N =850 samples) and (2) blood for a subset ofn= 72 participants at one time point post-aSAH. DNAm age was calculated using the Horvath, Hannum, Levine, and ""Improved Precision"" (Zhang) epigenetic clocks. ""Age acceleration"" was computed as the residuals of DNAm age regressed on chronological age both with and without correcting for CTH. Using scatterplots, Pearson correlations, and group-based trajectory analysis, we examined the relationships between CSF DNAm age and chronological age, the concordance between DNAm ages calculated from CSF versus blood, and the stability (i.e., trajectories) of CSF DNAm age acceleration over time during recovery from aSAH. We observed moderate to strong correlations between CSF DNAm age and chronological age (R= 0.66 [Levine] toR= 0.97 [Zhang]), moderate to strong correlations between DNAm age in CSF versus blood (R= 0.69 [Levine] toR= 0.98 [Zhang]), and stable CSF age acceleration trajectories over 14 days post-aSAH in the Horvath and Zhang clocks (unadjusted for CTH), as well as the Hannum clock (adjusted for CTH).CSF DNAm age was generally stable post-aSAH. Although correlated, CSF DNAm age differs from blood DNAm age in the Horvath, Hannum, and Levine clocks, but not in the Zhang clock. Taken together, our results suggest that, of the clocks examined here, the Zhang clock is the most robust to CTH and is recommended for use in complex tissues such as CSF."
"35077545","Mitochondrial genome-wide analysis of nuclear DNA methylation quantitative trait loci.","Hum Mol Genet","Mitochondria have a complex communication network with the surrounding cell and can alter nuclear DNA methylation (DNAm). Variation in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has also been linked to differential DNAm. Genome-wide association studies have identified numerous DNAm quantitative trait loci, but these studies have not examined the mitochondrial genome. Herein, we quantified nuclear DNAm from blood and conducted a mitochondrial genome-wide association study of DNAm, with an additional emphasis on sex- and prediabetes-specific heterogeneity. We used the Young Finns Study (n = 926) with sequenced mtDNA genotypes as a discovery sample and sought replication in the Ludwigshafen Risk and Cardiovascular Health study (n = 2317). We identified numerous significant associations in the discovery phase (P < 10-9), but they were not replicated when accounting for multiple testing. In total, 27 associations were nominally replicated with a P < 0.05. The replication analysis presented no evidence of sex- or prediabetes-specific heterogeneity. The 27 associations were included in a joint meta-analysis of the two cohorts, and 19 DNAm sites associated with mtDNA variants, while four other sites showed haplogroup associations. An expression quantitative trait methylation analysis was performed for the identified DNAm sites, pinpointing two statistically significant associations. This study provides evidence of a mitochondrial genetic control of nuclear DNAm with little evidence found for sex- and prediabetes-specific effects. The lack of a comparable mtDNA data set for replication is a limitation in our study and further studies are needed to validate our results.© The Author(s) 2021.

Recent treatment advances using checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy has not benefited platinum-resistant HGSOC. In ovarian cancer, DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi) block methylation and allow expression of silenced genes, primarily affecting immune reactivation pathways. We aimed to determine the epigenome and transcriptome response to sequential treatment with DNMTi and carboplatin in HGSOC.In vitro studies with azacitidine or carboplatin alone and in sequential combination. Response was determined by cell growth, death and apoptosis. Genome-wide DNA methylation levels and transcript expression were compared between untreated and azacitidine and carboplatin sequential treatment.Sequential azacitidine and carboplatin significantly slowed cell growth in 50% of cell lines compared to carboplatin alone. The combination resulted in significantly higher cell death in 25% of cell lines, and significantly higher cell apoptosis in 37.5% of cell lines, than carboplatin alone. Pathway analysis of upregulated transcripts showed that the majority of changes were in immune-related pathways, including those regulating response to checkpoint inhibitors.Sequential azacitidine and carboplatin treatment slows cell growth, and demethylate and upregulate pathways involved in immune response, suggesting that this combination may be used to increase HGSOC response to immune checkpoint inhibitors in platinum-resistant patients who have exhausted all currently-approved avenues of treatment.© 2022.

"35073254","Distinguishing between recruitment and spread of silent chromatin structures in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>.","Elife","The formation of heterochromatin atHML,HMR, and telomeres inSaccharomyces cerevisiaeinvolves two main steps: the recruitment of Sir proteins to silencers and their spread throughout the silenced domain. We developed a method to study these two processes at single basepair resolution. Using a fusion protein between the heterochromatin protein Sir3 and the nonsite-specific bacterial adenine methyltransferase M.EcoGII, we mapped sites of Sir3-chromatin interactions genome-wide using long-read Nanopore sequencing to detect adenines methylated by the fusion protein and by ChIP-seq to map the distribution of Sir3-M.EcoGII. A silencing-deficient mutant of Sir3 lacking its Bromo-Adjacent Homology (BAH) domain,sir3-bah∆, was still recruited toHML,HMR, and telomeres. However, in the absence of the BAH domain, it was unable to spread away from those recruitment sites. Overexpression of Sir3 did not lead to further spreading atHML,HMR, and most telomeres. A few exceptional telomeres, like 6R, exhibited a small amount of Sir3 spreading, suggesting that boundaries at telomeres responded variably to Sir3-M.EcoGII overexpression. Finally, by using a temperature-sensitive allele ofSIR3fused toM.ECOGII, we tracked the positions first methylated after induction and found that repression of genes atHMLandHMRbegan before Sir3 occupied the entire locus.© 2022, Brothers and Rine."

Host epigenome manipulation post coronavirus infection2-4suggests that DNA methylation signatures may differentiate patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection from uninfected individuals, and help predict COVID-19 disease severity, even at initial presentation.We customized Illumina's Infinium MethylationEPIC array to enhance immune response detection and profiled peripheral blood samples from 164 COVID-19 patients with longitudinal measurements of disease severity and 296 patient controls.Epigenome-wide association analysis revealed 13,033 genome-wide significant methylation sites for case-vs-control status. Genes and pathways involved in interferon signaling and viral response were significantly enriched among differentially methylated sites. We observe highly significant associations at genes previously reported in genetic association studies (e.g.IRF7,OAS1). Using machine learning techniques, models built using sparse regression yielded highly predictive findings: cross-validated best fit AUC was 93.6% for case-vs-control status, and 79.1%, 80.8%, and 84.4% for hospitalization, ICU admission, and progression to death, respectively.In summary, the strong COVID-19-specific epigenetic signature in peripheral blood driven by key immune-related pathways related to infection status, disease severity, and clinical deterioration provides insights useful for diagnosis and prognosis of patients with viral infections.© The Author(s) 2021."

"35069697","Pan-Cancer DNA Methylation Analysis and Tumor Origin Identification of Carcinoma of Unknown Primary Site Based on Multi-Omics.","Front Genet","The metastatic cancer of unknown primary (CUP) sites remains a leading cause of cancer death with few therapeutic options. The aberrant DNA methylation (DNAm) is the most important risk factor for cancer, which has certain tissue specificity. However, how DNAm alterations in tumors differ among the regulatory network of multi-omics remains largely unexplored. Therefore, there is room for improvement in our accuracy in the prediction of tumor origin sites and a need for better understanding of the underlying mechanisms. In our study, an integrative analysis based on multi-omics data and molecular regulatory network uncovered genome-wide methylation mechanism and identified 23 epi-driver genes. Apart from the promoter region, we also found that the aberrant methylation within the gene body or intergenic region was significantly associated with gene expression. Significant enrichment analysis of the epi-driver genes indicated that these genes were highly related to cellular mechanisms of tumorigenesis, including T-cell differentiation, cell proliferation, and signal transduction. Based on the ensemble algorithm, six CpG sites located in five epi-driver genes were selected to construct a tissue-specific classifier with a better accuracy (>95%) using TCGA datasets. In the independent datasets and the metastatic cancer datasets from GEO, the accuracy of distinguishing tumor subtypes or original sites was more than 90%, showing better robustness and stability. In summary, the integration analysis of large-scale omics data revealed complex regulation of DNAm across various cancer types and identified the epi-driver genes participating in tumorigenesis. Based on the aberrant methylation status located in epi-driver genes, a classifier that provided the highest accuracy in tracing back to the primary sites of metastatic cancer was established. Our study provides a comprehensive and multi-omics view of DNAm-associated changes across cancer types and has potential for clinical application.Copyright © 2022 Liu."
"35067084","Differential Histone Posttranslational Modifications Induced by DNA Hypomethylating Agents.","Cancer Control","The prototype DNA hypomethylating agents 5-azacytidine (5AC) and decitabine (DAC) are currently FDA-approved for treatment of blood and bone marrow disorders like myelodysplastic syndrome. 5AC and DAC are considered similar drugs and were shown to induce histone modifications that modulate gene expression. The aim of this study is to compare the effect of both drugs on histone acetylation and methylation at multiple histone amino acids residues.Mass spectrometry was used to compare the effect of both drugs on 95 different histone posttranslational modifications (PTMs) in leukemia cells. ChIP-Seq analysis was used to compare the impact of both drugs on the genome-wide acetylation of the H3K9 mark using primary leukemia cells from six de-identified AML patients.Both DAC and 5AC induced histone PTMs in different histone isoforms like H1.4, H2A, H3, H3.1, and H4. Changes in both histone methylation and acetylation were observed with both drugs; however, there were distinct differences in the histone modifications induced by the two drugs. Since both drugs were shown to increase the activity of the HDAC SIRT6 previously, we tested the effect of 5AC on the acetylation of H3K9, the physiological substrate SIRT6, using ChIP-Seq analysis and compared it to the previously published DAC-induced changes. Significant H3K9 acetylation changes (P< .05) were detected at 925 genes after 5AC treatment vs only 182 genes after DAC treatment. Nevertheless, the gene set modified by 5AC was different from that modified by DAC with only ten similar genes modulated by both drugs.Despite similarity in chemical structure and DNA hypomethylating activity, 5AC and DAC induced widely different histone PTMs and considering them interchangeable should be carefully evaluated. The mechanism of these histone PTM changes is not clear and may involve modulation of the activity or the expression of the enzymes inducing histone PTMs."

This study aimed to identify potential diagnostic biomarkers for colorectal cancer by genome-wide plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) methylation analysis.Peripheral blood from colorectal cancer patients and healthy controls was collected for cfDNA extraction. Genome-wide cfDNA methylation profiling, especially differential methylation profiling between colorectal cancer patients and healthy controls, was performed by methylated DNA immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing (MeDIP-seq). Logistic regression models were established, and the accuracy of this diagnostic model for colorectal cancer was verified using tissue-sourced data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) due to the lack of cfDNA methylation data in public datasets.Compared with the control group, 939 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) located in promoter regions were found in colorectal cancer patients; 16 of these DMRs were hypermethylated, and the remaining 923 were hypomethylated. In addition, these hypermethylated genes, mainly PRDM14, RALYL, ELMOD1, and TMEM132E, were validated and confirmed in colorectal cancer by using publicly available DNA methylation data.MeDIP-seq can be used as an optimal approach for analyzing cfDNA methylomes, and 12 probes of four differentially methylated genes identified by MeDIP-seq (PRDM14, RALYL, ELMOD1, and TMEM132E) could serve as potential biomarkers for clinical application in patients with colorectal cancer.© 2022.

PM10daily exposure levels, based on maternal residential address, were estimated for different gestational periods using models based on satellite data. Epigenome-wide analysis to identify differentially methylated probes (DMPs) and regions (DMRs) was conducted, followed by a pathway analysis and replication analysis in an second Piccolipiù dataset. Distributed lag models (DLMs) using weekly exposures were used to study the association of PM10exposure across pregnancy with telomere length, as well as with the DMPs that showed robust associations.Gestational PM10exposure was associated with the DNA methylation of more than 250 unique DMPs, most of them identified in early gestation, and 1 DMR. Out of 151 DMPs available in the replication dataset, ten DMPs showed robust associations: eight were associated with exposure during early gestation and 2 with exposure during the whole pregnancy. These exposure windows were supported by the DLM analysis. The PM10exposure between 15th and 20th gestational week seem to be associated with shorter telomeres at birth, while exposure between 24th and 29th was associated with longer telomeres.The early pregnancy period is a potential critical window during which PM10exposure can influence cord blood DNA methylation. The results from the TL analysis were consistent with previous findings and merit further exploration in future studies. The study underlines the importance of considering gestational windows outside of the predefined trimesters that may not always overlap with biologically relevant windows of exposure.Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

However, screening is invasive, expensive, and associated with significant morbidity making bladder cancer the most expensive cancer to treat per capita. There is an urgent need to expand the understanding of markers related to recurrence and survival outcomes of NMIBC.We used the Illumina HumanMethylationEPIC array to measure peripheral blood DNA methylation profiles of NMIBC patients (N = 603) enrolled in a population-based cohort study in New Hampshire and applied cell type deconvolution to estimate immune cell-type proportions. Using Cox proportional hazard models, we identified that increasing CD4T and CD8T cell proportions were associated with a statistically significant decreased hazard of tumor recurrence or death (CD4T: HR = 0.98, 95% CI = 0.97-1.00; CD8T: HR = 0.97, 95% CI = 0.95-1.00), whereas increasing monocyte proportion and methylation-derived neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (mdNLR) were associated with the increased hazard of tumor recurrence or death (monocyte: HR = 1.04, 95% CI = 1.00-1.07; mdNLR: HR = 1.12, 95% CI = 1.04-1.20). Then, using an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) approach adjusting for age, sex, smoking status, BCG treatment status, and immune cell profiles, we identified 2528 CpGs associated with the hazard of tumor recurrence or death (P < 0.005). Among these CpGs, the 1572 were associated with an increased hazard and were significantly enriched in open sea regions; the 956 remaining CpGs were associated with a decreased hazard and were significantly enriched in enhancer regions and DNase hypersensitive sites.Our results expand on the knowledge of immune profiles and methylation alteration associated with NMIBC outcomes and represent a first step toward the development of DNA methylation-based biomarkers of tumor recurrence.© 2022.

"35061109","Novel methylation mark and essential hypertension.","J Genet Eng Biotechnol","Essential hypertension (EH) is an important risk factor for various cardiovascular, cerebral and renal disorders. It is a multi-factorial trait which occurs through complex interplay between genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors. Even after advancement of technology and deciphering the involvement of multiple signalling pathways in blood pressure regulation, it still remains as a huge global concern. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have revealed EH-associated genetic variants but these solely cannot explain the variability in blood pressure indicating the involvement of additional factors. The etiopathogenesis of hypertension has now advanced to the level of epigenomics where aberrant DNA methylation is the most defined epigenetic mechanism to be involved in gene regulation. Though role of DNA methylation in cancer and other mechanisms is deeply studied but this mechanism is in infancy in relation to hypertension. Generally, 5-methylcytosine (5mC) levels are being targeted at both individual gene and global level to find association with the disease. But recently, with advanced sequencing techniques another methylation mark, N6-methyladenine (6mA) was found and studied in humans which was earlier considered to be absent in case of eukaryotes. Relation of aberrant 6mA levels with cancer and stem cell fate has drawn attention to target 6mA levels with hypertension too.Recent studies targeting hypertension has suggested 6mA levels as novel marker and its demethylase, ALKBH1 as probable therapeutic target to prevent hypertension through epigenetic programming. This review compiles different methylation studies and suggests targeting of both 5mC and 6mA levels to cover role of methylation in hypertension in broader scenario.© 2022. The Author(s)."

We carried out 450 K methylation array analysis to investigate epigenetically dysregulated genes in breast to brain metastases (BBM) compared to normal breast tissues (BN) and primary breast tumours (BP). For this, we referenced 450 K methylation data for BBM tumours prepared in our laboratory with BN and BP from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Experimental validation on our initially identified genes, in an independent cohort of BP and in BBM and their originating primary breast tumours using Combined Bisulphite and Restriction Analysis (CoBRA) and Methylation Specific PCR identified three genes (RP11-713P17.4, MIR124-2, NUS1P3) that are hypermethylated and three genes (MIR3193, CTD-2023M8.1 and MTND6P4) that are hypomethylated in breast to brain metastases. In addition, methylation differences in candidate genes between BBM tumours and originating primary tumours shows dysregulation of DNA methylation occurs either at an early stage of tumour evolution (in the primary tumour) or at a later evolutionary stage (where the epigenetic change is only observed in the brain metastasis). Epigentic changes identified could also be found when analysing tumour free circulating DNA (tfcDNA) in patient's serum taken during BBM biopsies. Epigenetic dysregulation of RP11-713P17.4, MIR3193, MTND6P4 are early events suggesting a potential use for these genes as prognostic markers.© 2022. The Author(s)."

Using genome-wide genotype and methylation data at birth from the Isle of Wight Birth Cohort (n= 1456), a polygenic risk score (PRS), and newborn (nMRS) and childhood (cMRS) methylation risk scores, were developed to predict childhood asthma diagnosis. Each risk score was integrated with two previously published childhood asthma prediction models (CAPE and CAPP) and were validated in the Manchester Asthma and Allergy Study. Individually, the genomic risk scores demonstrated modest-to-moderate discriminative performance (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, AUC: PRS = 0.64, nMRS = 0.55, cMRS = 0.54), and their integration only marginally improved the performance of the CAPE (AUC: 0.75 vs. 0.71) and CAPP models (AUC: 0.84 vs. 0.82). The limited predictive performance of each genomic risk score individually and their inability to substantially improve upon the performance of the CAPE and CAPP models suggests that genetic and epigenetic predictors of the broad phenotype of asthma are unlikely to have clinical utility. Hence, further studies predicting specific asthma endotypes are warranted."

Fifty-four pairs of CRCs and the adjacent normal tissues were subjected to Infinium Human Methylation 450K assay and analysed using ChAMP R package. A total of 26,093 differentially methylated probes were identified, which represent 6156 genes; 650 probes were hypermethylated, and 25,443 were hypomethylated. Hypermethylated sites were common in CpG islands, while hypomethylated sites were in open sea. Most of the hypermethylated genes were associated with pathways in cancer, while the hypomethylated genes were involved in the PI3K-AKT signalling pathway. Among the identified differentially methylated probes, we found evidence of four potential probes in CRCs versus adjacent normal;HOXA2cg06786372,OPLAHcg17301223, cg15638338, andTRIM31cg02583465 that could serve as a new biomarker in CRC since these probes were aberrantly methylated in CRC as well as involved in the progression of CRC. Furthermore, we revealed the potential of promoter methylationADHFE1cg18065361 in differentiating the CRC from normal colonic tissue from the integrated analysis. In conclusion, aberrant DNA methylation is significantly involved in CRC pathogenesis and is associated with gene silencing. This study reports several potential important methylated genes in CRC and, therefore, merit further validation as novel candidate biomarker genes in CRC."
"35052436","Development of Epigenetic Clocks for Key Ruminant Species.","Genes (Basel)","Robust biomarkers of chronological age have been developed in humans and model mammalian species such as rats and mice using DNA methylation data. The concept of these so-called ""epigenetic clocks"" has emerged from a large body of literature describing the relationship between genome-wide methylation levels and age. Epigenetic clocks exploit this phenomenon and use small panels of differentially methylated cytosine (CpG) sites to make robust predictions of chronological age, independent of tissue type. Here, we present highly accurate livestock epigenetic clocks for which we have used the custom mammalian methylation array ""HorvathMammalMethyl40"" to construct the first epigenetic clock for domesticated goat (Capra hircus), cattle (Bos taurus), Red (Cervus elaphus) and Wapiti deer (Cervus canadensis) and composite-breed sheep (Ovis aries). Additionally, we have constructed a 'farm animal clock' for all species included in the study, which will allow for robust predictions to be extended to various breeds/strains. The farm animal clock shows similarly high accuracy to the individual species' clocks (r> 0.97), utilizing only 217 CpG sites to estimate age (relative to the maximum lifespan of the species) with a single mathematical model. We hypothesise that the applications of this livestock clock could extend well beyond the scope of chronological age estimates. Many independent studies have demonstrated that a deviation between true age and clock derived molecular age is indicative of past and/or present health (including stress) status. There is, therefore, untapped potential to utilize livestock clocks in breeding programs as a predictor for age-related production traits."

As the technology evolved to extract features from a wide variety of sources including genetics, a large quantum of data is available to the researchers for conducting micro studies in the field of disease and cures. In cancer research, integrative methods using genomic data sets has become a major area of interest. The petabytes of data that is available at The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), a program jointly under NCI and National Human Genome Research Institute, has made possible more nuanced research in cancer genomics. Our method, Confidence Based Integration (CBI) is an integration method to extract similar as well as complementing information from the genomic data sets. This information will provide insight into the status of patients and their prospects. We used the expression data sets of gene, miRNA and DNA methylation in our fusion experiments on five different cancer types. These data sets, after fusion, are clustered using 'Spectral Clustering' algorithm, which derives clusters that form the disease sub types. Survival properties of each sub type demonstrates the reasons to consider the samples inside them highly similar. The performance of CBI, we report, is better, in terms of P-value in log-rank test, than other methods like similarity network fusion or SNF in forming clusters of significance. Individual features clustered extremely poor compared to CBI in most of the experiments.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
"35130936","The applications of DNA methylation as a biomarker in kidney transplantation: a systematic review.","Clin Epigenetics","Although kidney transplantation improves patient survival and quality of life, long-term results are hampered by both immune- and non-immune-mediated complications. Current biomarkers of post-transplant complications, such as allograft rejection, chronic renal allograft dysfunction, and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, have a suboptimal predictive value. DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification that directly affects gene expression and plays an important role in processes such as ischemia/reperfusion injury, fibrosis, and alloreactive immune response. Novel techniques can quickly assess the DNA methylation status of multiple loci in different cell types, allowing a deep and interesting study of cells' activity and function. Therefore, DNA methylation has the potential to become an important biomarker for prediction and monitoring in kidney transplantation.The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of DNA methylation as a potential biomarker of graft survival and complications development in kidney transplantation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A systematic review of several databases has been conducted. The Newcastle-Ottawa scale and the Jadad scale have been used to assess the risk of bias for observational and randomized studies, respectively.Twenty articles reporting on DNA methylation as a biomarker for kidney transplantation were included, all using DNA methylation for prediction and monitoring. DNA methylation pattern alterations in cells isolated from different tissues, such as kidney biopsies, urine, and blood, have been associated with ischemia-reperfusion injury and chronic renal allograft dysfunction. These alterations occurred in different and specific loci. DNA methylation status has also proved to be important for immune response modulation, having a crucial role in regulatory T cell definition and activity. Research also focused on a better understanding of the role of this epigenetic modification assessment for regulatory T cells isolation and expansion for future tolerance induction-oriented therapies.Studies included in this review are heterogeneous in study design, biological samples, and outcome. More coordinated investigations are needed to affirm DNA methylation as a clinically relevant biomarker important for prevention, monitoring, and intervention.© 2022. The Author(s)."

Hispanic/Latinos (H/L) are the second largest racial/ethnic group in the US. The objective of this study was to assess DNA methylation patterns between aggressive and indolent PCa along with ancestry proportions in 49 H/L men from Puerto Rico (PR). Prostate tumors were classified as aggressive (n= 17) and indolent (n= 32) based on the Gleason score. Genomic DNA samples were extracted by macro-dissection. DNA methylation patterns were assessed using the Illumina EPIC DNA methylation platform. We used ADMIXTURE to estimate global ancestry proportions. We identified 892 differentially methylated genes in prostate tumor tissues as compared with normal tissues. Based on an epigenetic clock model, we observed that the total number of stem cell divisions (TNSC) and stem cell division rate (SCDR) were significantly higher in tumor than adjacent normal tissues. Regarding PCa aggressiveness, 141 differentially methylated genes were identified. Ancestry proportions of PR men were estimated as African, European, and Indigenous American; these were 24.1%, 64.2%, and 11.7%, respectively. The identification of DNA methylation profiles associated with risk and aggressiveness of PCa in PR H/L men will shed light on potential mechanisms contributing to PCa disparities in PR population."

Chemotherapy drugs remain the cornerstone of treatment of BC and undergo significant shifts over the past 100 years. The advent of immunotherapy presents promising opportunities and constitutes a significant complementary to existing therapeutic strategies for BC. Chemotherapy as a cytotoxic treatment that targets proliferation malignant cells has recently been shown as an effective immune-stimulus in multiple ways. Chemotherapeutic drugs can cause the release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) from dying tumor cells, which result in long-lasting antitumor immunity by the key process of immunogenic cell death (ICD). Furthermore, Off-target effects of chemotherapy on immune cell subsets mainly involve activation of immune effector cells including natural killer (NK) cells, dendritic cells (DCs), and cytotoxic T cells, and depletion of immunosuppressive cells including Treg cells, M2 macrophages and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Current mini-review summarized recent large clinical trials regarding the combination of chemotherapy and immunotherapy in BC and addressed the molecular mechanisms of immunostimulatory properties of chemotherapy in BC. The purpose of our work was to explore the immune-stimulating effects of chemotherapy at the molecular level based on the evidence from clinical trials, which might be a rationale for combinations of chemotherapy and immunotherapy in BC.Copyright © 2022 Zhang, Pan, Jian, Hao, Dong, Sun, Jin and Han."

Several studies suggest that PAE modifies DNA methylation in offspring cells and tissues, providing evidence for a potential mechanistic link to Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). We systematically reviewed existing evidence on the extent to which maternal alcohol use during pregnancy is associated with offspring DNA methylation.A systematic literature search was conducted across five online databases according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, Google Scholar and CINAHL Databases were searched for articles relating to PAE in placental mammals. Data were extracted from each study and the Risk of Bias in Non-Randomized Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I) was used to assess the potential for bias in human studies.Forty-three articles were identified for inclusion. Twenty-six animal studies and 16 human studies measured offspring DNA methylation in various tissues using candidate gene analysis, methylome-wide association studies (MWAS), or total nuclear DNA methylation content. PAE dose and timing varied between studies. Risk of bias was deemed high in nearly all human studies. There was insufficient evidence in human and animal studies to support global disruption of DNA methylation from PAE. Inconclusive evidence was found for hypomethylation at IGF2/H19 regions within somatic tissues. MWAS assessing PAE effects on offspring DNA methylation showed inconsistent evidence. There was some consistency in the relatively small number of MWAS conducted in populations with FASD. Meta-analyses could not be conducted due to significant heterogeneity between studies.Considering heterogeneity in study design and potential for bias, evidence for an association between PAE and offspring DNA methylation was inconclusive. Some reproducible associations were observed in populations with FASD although the limited number of these studies warrants further research.

"35111197","Seven-CpG DNA Methylation Age Determined by Single Nucleotide Primer Extension and Illumina's Infinium MethylationEPIC Array Provide Highly Comparable Results.","Front Genet","DNA methylation age (DNAm age, epigenetic clock) is a novel and promising biomarker of aging. It is calculated from the methylation fraction of specific cytosine phosphate guanine sites (CpG sites) of genomic DNA. Several groups have proposed epigenetic clock algorithms and these differ mostly regarding the number and location of the CpG sites considered and the method used to assess the methylation status. Most epigenetic clocks are based on a large number of CpGs, e.g. as measured by DNAm microarrays. We have recently evaluated an epigenetic clock based on the methylation fraction of seven CpGs that were determined by methylation-sensitive single nucleotide primer extension (MS-SNuPE). This method is more cost-effective when compared to array-based technologies as only a few CpGs need to be examined. However, there is only little data on the correspondence in epigenetic age estimation using the 7-CpG clock and other algorithms. To bridge this gap, in this study we measured the 7-CpG DNAm age using two methods, via MS-SNuPE and via the MethylationEPIC array, in a sample of 1,058 participants of the Berlin Aging Study II (BASE-II), assessed as part of the GendAge study. On average, participants were 75.6 years old (SD: 3.7, age range: 64.9-90.0, 52.6% female). Agreement between methods was assessed by Bland-Altman plots. DNAm age was highly correlated between methods (Pearson's r = 0.9) and Bland-Altman plots showed a difference of 3.1 years. DNAm age by the 7-CpG formula was 71.2 years (SD: 6.9 years, SNuPE) and 68.1 years (SD: 6.4 years, EPIC array). The mean of difference in methylation fraction between methods for the seven individual CpG sites was between 0.7 and 13 percent. To allow direct conversion of DNAm age obtained from both methods we developed an adjustment formula with a randomly selected training set of 529 participants using linear regression. After conversion of the Illumina data in a second and independent validation set, the adjusted DNAm age was 71.44 years (SD: 6.1 years, n = 529). In summary, we found the results of DNAm clocks to be highly comparable. Furthermore, we developed an adjustment formula that allows for direct conversion of DNAm age estimates between methods and enables one singular clock to be used in studies that employ either the Illumina or the SNuPE method.Copyright © 2022 Vetter, Kalies, Sommerer, Bertram and Demuth."

In the early 2010s, the introduction of a novel set of sequencing methodologies, presented by two platforms, Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore Sequencing (ONT), gave birth to third-generation sequencing (TGS). The innovative long-read technologies turn genome sequencing into an ease-of-handle procedure by greatly reducing the average time of library construction workflows and simplifying the process of de novo genome assembly due to the generation of long reads. Long sequencing reads produced by both TGS methodologies have already facilitated the decipherment of transcriptional profiling since they enable the identification of full-length transcripts without the need for assembly or the use of sophisticated bioinformatics tools. Long-read technologies have also provided new insights into the field of epitranscriptomics, by allowing the direct detection of RNA modifications on native RNA molecules. This review highlights the advantageous features of the newly introduced TGS technologies, discusses their limitations and provides an in-depth comparison regarding their scientific background and available protocols as well as their potential utility in research and clinical applications."
"35102228","Evaluation of epigenetic age calculators between preeclampsia and normotensive pregnancies in an Australian cohort.","Sci Rep","Advanced biological aging, as assessed through DNA methylation markers, is associated with several complex diseases. The associations between maternal DNA methylation age and preeclampsia (PE) have not been fully assessed. The aim of this study was to examine if increased maternal DNA methylation age (DNAmAge) was shown to be accelerated in women with PE when compared to women who had normotensive pregnancies. The case/control cohort available for study consisted of 166 women (89 with normotensive pregnancy, 77 with PE) recruited previously at the Royal Women's Hospital in Melbourne, Australia. DNA methylation profiles were obtained using the Illumina EPIC Infinium array for analysis of genomic DNA isolated from whole blood. These profiles were used to calculate seven estimates of DNAmAge and included (1) Horvath, (2) Hannum, (3) Horvath Skin and Blood, (4) Wu, (5) PhenoAge, (6) telomere length and (7) GrimAge and its surrogate measures. Three measures of DNA methylation age acceleration were calculated for all seven measures using linear regression. Pearson's correlation was performed to investigate associations between chronological age and DNAmAge. Differences between chronological age and DNAmAge and epigenetic age acceleration were investigated using t-tests. No significant difference was observed for chronological age between women with PE (age = 30.53 ± 5.68) and women who had normotensive pregnancies (age = 31.76 ± 4.76). All seven DNAmAge measures were significantly correlated (p < 0.001) with chronological age. After accounting for multiple testing and investigating differences in DNAmAge between normotensive women and women with PE, only Wu DNAmAge was significant (p = 0.001). When examining differences for epigenetic age acceleration between PE and normotensive women Hannum, Wu, and PhenoAge DNAmAge estimates (p < 0.001) were significant for both epigenetic age acceleration and intrinsic acceleration models. We found that accelerated maternal DNAmAge is increased in women with PE in some models of epigenetic aging. This research underlines the importance for further investigation into the potential changes of differential DNA methylation in PE.© 2022. The Author(s)."

However, the associations between early adulthood lipid levels and GAA in midlife are unknown. Also, it is unknown whether GAA mediates the associations between lipid levels in young adults and subclinical atherosclerosis in midlife.We estimated measures of epigenetic age acceleration in 1118 White and Black participants from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study at examination years (Y) 15 and 20. We used multivariable regression models to examine associations of Y15 and Y20 GAA estimates with plasma lipid levels measured at prior examination years (Y0, Y5, and Y10) and concurrently: triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels. Mediation analysis was used to assess the extent to which GAA may mediate associations between plasma lipids and coronary artery calcification (CAC). In our study each 1-SD higher cumulative TG level was associated with an average 0.73 ± 0.12 years older GAA. Each 1-SD higher cumulative HDL-C level was associated with an average 0.57 ± 0.17 years younger GAA. Stratified analyses showed that the associations between TG and GAA were stronger among female and Black participants and the associations between HDL-C and GAA were stronger among female and White participants. GAA statistically mediated 17.4% of the association of cumulative TG with CAC.High TG and low HDL-C in early adulthood are associated with accelerated epigenetic aging by midlife. Increased epigenetic age acceleration may partially mediate the associations between high TG levels and the presence of subclinical atherosclerosis.© 2022. The Author(s)."

From this cohort, incident MI/ACS (cases,n= 129) and age- and sex-stratified controls (n= 177) were selected for a nested case-control study. Baseline EA (Horvath's, Hannum's, PhenoAge, Skin and Blood) and the differences between EA and chronological age (CA) were calculated (ΔAHr, ΔAHn, ΔAPh, ΔASB). EAs by Horvath's, Hannum's and Skin and Blood were close to CA (median absolute difference, MAD, of 1.08, -1.91 and -2.03 years); PhenoAge had MAD of -9.29 years vs. CA. The adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of MI/ACS per 1-year increments of ΔAHr, ΔAHn, ΔASB and ΔAPh were 1.01 (95% CI 0.95-1.07), 1.01 (95% CI 0.95-1.08), 1.02 (95% CI 0.97-1.06) and 1.01 (0.93-1.09), respectively. When classified into tertiles, only the highest tertile of ΔAPh showed a suggestion of increased risk of MI/ACS with OR 2.09 (1.11-3.94) independent of age and 1.84 (0.99-3.52) in the age- and sex-adjusted model. Metabolic modulation may be the likely mechanism of this association. In conclusion, this case-control study nested in a prospective population-based cohort did not find strong associations between accelerated epigenetic age markers and risk of MI/ACS. Larger cohort studies are needed to re-examine this important research question."

Some ART pregnancies are at risk of obstetric and neonatal complications, but it is unknown whether the procedures used or the etiology of infertility influences this risk. Multiple ART pregnancies are responsible for the increased rate of prematurity and its associated complications. Also, it has been demonstrated that ART pregnancies have a higher risk of congenital anomalies. The rate of ART-associated ocular abnormalities is incompletely known due to a small number of studies conducted regarding this pathology.

These data are interpreted as anomalies in placentation involving a dysregulation of several molecular factors and pathways. It is not clear which extent of the observed placental alterations are the result of ART and which originate from infertility itself. These two aspects probably act synergically for the final obstetric risk. Data show that mechanisms of inappropriate trophoblast invasion and consequent altered vascular remodeling sustain several clinical conditions, leading to obstetric and perinatal risks often found in ART pregnancies, such as preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction and placenta previa or accreta. The roles of factors such as VEGF, GATA3, PIGF, sFLT-1, sEndoglin, EGFL7, melatonin and of ART conditions, such as short or long embryo cultures, trophectoderm biopsy, embryo cryopreservation, and supraphysiologic endometrium preparation, are discussed. Inflammatory local conditions and epigenetic influence on embryos of ART procedures are important research topics since they may have important consequences on obstetric risk. Prevention and treatment of these conditions represent new frontiers for clinicians and biologists involved in ART, and synergic actions with researchers at molecular levels are advocated."

These epigenetic changes can compromise the health of the offspring later in life. We discuss different types of nutritional stressors in human and animal models, such as maternal undernutrition, seasonal diets, low-protein diet, high-fat diet, and synthetic folic acid supplement use, and how these nutritional exposures epigenetically affect target genes and their outcomes. In addition, we review the concept of thrifty genes during the preimplantation period, and some examples that relate to epigenetic change and diet. Finally, we discuss different examples of maternal diets, their effect on outcomes, and their relationship with assisted reproductive technology (ART), including their implications on epigenetic modifications."

Here, we use transient transcriptome sequencing (TT-seq) to define both coding and non-coding transcription units (TUs) in these three pluripotent states and combine TT-seq with RNA polymerase II occupancy profiling to unravel the kinetics of RNA metabolism genome-wide. Compared to the naïve state (serum), RNA synthesis and turnover rates are globally reduced in the ground state (2i) and the paused state (mTORi). The global reduction in RNA synthesis goes along with a genome-wide decrease of polymerase elongation velocity, which is related to epigenomic features and alterations in the Pol II termination window. Our data suggest that transcription activity is the main determinant of steady state mRNA levels in the naïve state and that genome-wide changes in transcription kinetics invoke ground and paused pluripotent states.© 2022 The Authors.

"35039829","Functional characterization of the tomato HAIRPLUS gene reveals the implication of the epigenome in the control of glandular trichome formation.","Hortic Res","Trichomes are specialised epidermal cells developed in the aerial surface of almost every terrestrial plant. These structures form physical barriers, which combined with their capability of synthesis of complex molecules, prevent plagues from spreading and confer trichomes a key role in the defence against herbivores. In this work, the tomato gene HAIRPLUS (HAP) that controls glandular trichome density in tomato plants was characterised. HAP belongs to a group of proteins involved in histone tail modifications although some also bind methylated DNA. HAP loss of function promotes epigenomic modifications in the tomato genome reflected in numerous differentially methylated cytosines and causes transcriptomic changes in hap mutant plants. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that HAP links epigenome remodelling with multicellular glandular trichome development and reveal that HAP is a valuable genomic tool for pest resistance in tomato breeding.© The Author(s) 2022.

The corrected expression was obtained by usingedge R.Limmawas used to correct the expression amount of the samples, andEpiDISHwas used to translate the methylation expression data, so that the expression amount was transformed into the expression matrix of immune cells. The immune cells were then co-expressed, and the proportion and correlation of related immune cells was determined. The results of the cells in each of two groups were analyzed by enrichment and PCA mapping to establish the relevant differences.The data of GBM patients were obtained from the methylation chip of the GEO database. Patients were divided into a long-term (SNU-LTS) (21 cases), and short-term survival group (SNU-STS) (12 cases). There were 73 genes with significant individual differences between the two groups (P<0.05).EpiDISHwas used to translate the methylation expression data into the expression matrix of immune cells, which showed that the highest proportion of cells in groups were mono cells, while Gran cells and CD8T appeared in a very small number of samples. The positive correlation between mono and B cells was the strongest, while the negative correlation between mono and Gran cells was the strongest. A violin chart shows that there was no significant difference in the infiltration degree of six kinds of immune cells between the two groups. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that there was individual difference between the two groups, but the overall consistency was high.Data on tumor immune cell infiltration can be obtained by using a methylation chip in the GEO database. This not only extends the application abilities of methylation chips but provides obvious individual differences.

We used blood-derived DNA from 96 XDP patients for amplicon-based deep Nanopore sequencing and validated it with fragment analysis which was performed using fluorescence-based PCR. To detect methylation from blood- and brain-derived DNA, we used a Cas9-targeted approach.High concordance was observed for hexanucleotide repeat numbers detected with Nanopore sequencing and fragment analysis. Within the SVA locus, there was no difference in genetic variability other than variations of the repeat motif between patients. We detected high CpG methylation frequency (MF) of the SVA and flanking regions (mean MF = 0.94, SD = ±0.12). Our preliminary results suggest only subtle differences between the XDP patient and the control in predicted enhancer sites directly flanking the SVA locus.Nanopore sequencing can reliably detect SVA hexanucleotide repeat numbers, methylation and, lastly, variation in the repeat motif."
"35123558","Bladder cancer detection in urine using DNA methylation markers: a technical and prospective preclinical validation.","Clin Epigenetics","The development of accurate urinary biomarkers for non-invasive and cost-effective detection of primary and recurrent bladder tumours is recognized as one of the major clinical needs in bladder cancer diagnostics. The purposes of this study were (1) to validate the results of a previous technical comparison by determining the diagnostic performance of nine methylation markers in urine pellet compared to full void urine, and (2) to validate the diagnostic performance of the optimal marker panel GHSR/MAL from a previous exploratory study in a preclinical setting.Urine samples of 108 patients with bladder cancer and 100 age- and gender-matched controls were prospectively collected for methylation analysis. Urinary methylation levels of the markers FAM19A4, GHSR, MAL, miR-129, miR-935, PHACTR3, PRDM14, SST and ZIC1 were determined with quantitative methylation-specific PCR in urine pellet. Area under the curves (AUCs) were determined for individual markers and the marker panel GHSR/MAL. The diagnostic performance of the marker panel GHSR/MAL was evaluated in the total study population and in different subgroups of patients with bladder cancer using the Chi-square test. The diagnostic accuracy was assessed by leave-one-out cross-validation.All nine urinary methylation markers (FAM19A4, GHSR, MAL, miR-129, miR-935, PHACTR3, PRDM14, SST and ZIC1) showed significantly higher methylation levels in bladder cancer patients than in controls (p < 0.001). Area under the curves (AUCs) of the nine methylation markers tested in urine pellet were similar to AUCs in full void urine of an independent previous cohort. GHSR/MAL reached an AUC of 0.89 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.84-0.94), at 80% sensitivity and 93% specificity. Sensitivity of GHSR/MAL increased with higher tumour grades, higher tumour stages, in primary vs. recurrent tumours, and in males vs. females.This technical validation supports the robustness of DNA methylation analysis in urine pellet and full void urine for the non-invasive detection of bladder cancer. Subsequent preclinical validation confirmed the diagnostic potential of GHSR/MAL. These findings underline the diagnostic potential of the marker panel GHSR/MAL for future bladder cancer diagnostics.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35111213","DNA Methylation Biomarkers-Based Human Age Prediction Using Machine Learning.","Comput Intell Neurosci","Age can be an important clue in uncovering the identity of persons that left biological evidence at crime scenes. With the availability of DNA methylation data, several age prediction models are developed by using statistical and machine learning methods. From epigenetic studies, it has been demonstrated that there is a close association between aging and DNA methylation. Most of the existing studies focused on healthy samples, whereas diseases may have a significant impact on human age. Therefore, in this article, an age prediction model is proposed using DNA methylation biomarkers for healthy and diseased samples.The dataset contains 454 healthy samples and 400 diseased samples from publicly available sources with age (1-89 years old). Six CpG sites are identified from this data having a high correlation with age using Pearson's correlation coefficient. In this work, the age prediction model is developed using four different machine learning techniques, namely, Multiple Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression, Gradient Boosting Regression, and Random Forest Regression. Separate models are designed for healthy and diseased data. The data are split randomly into 80 : 20 ratios for training and testing, respectively.Among all the techniques, the model designed using Random Forest Regression shows the best performance, and Gradient Boosting Regression is the second best model. In the case of healthy samples, the model achieved a MAD of 2.51 years for training data and 4.85 for testing data. Also, for diseased samples, a MAD of 3.83 years is obtained for training and 9.53 years for testing.These results showed that the proposed model can predict age for healthy and diseased samples.Copyright © 2022 Atef Zaguia et al."
"35069932","Association between Phenotypic Age and Mortality in Patients with Multivessel Coronary Artery Disease.","Dis Markers","Chronological age (CA) is not a perfect proxy for the true biological aging status of the body. A new biological aging measure, phenotypic age (PhenoAge), has been shown to capture morbidity and mortality risk in the general US population and diverse subpopulations. This study was aimed at evaluating the association between PhenoAge and long-term outcome of patients with multivessel coronary artery disease (CAD).A total of 609 multivessel CAD patients who received PCI attempt and with follow-up were enrolled. The clinical outcome was all-cause mortality on follow-up. PhenoAge was calculated using an equation constructed from CA and 9 clinical biomarkers. Cox proportional hazards regression models and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were performed to evaluate the association between PhenoAge and mortality.Overall, patients with more diseases had older PhenoAge and phenotypic age acceleration (PhenoAgeAccel). After a median follow-up of 33.5 months, those with positive PhenoAgeAccel had a significantly higher incidence of all-cause mortality (P= 0.001). After adjusting for CA, Cox proportional hazards models showed that both PhenoAge and PhenoAgeAccel were significantly associated with all-cause mortality. Even after further adjusting for confounding factors, each 10-year increase in PhenoAge was also associated with a 51% increased mortality risk. ROC curves revealed that PhenoAge, with an area under the curve of 0.705, significantly outperformed CA, the individual clinical chemistry measure, and other risk factors. When reexamining the ROC curves using various combinations of variables, we found that PhenoAge provides additional predictive power to all models.In conclusion, PhenoAge was strongly associated with all-cause mortality even after adjusting for CA. Our findings suggest that PhenoAge measure may be complementary in predicting mortality risk for patients with multivessel CAD.Copyright © 2022 Qiong Ma et al."
"35055119","Could Lower Testosterone in Older Men Explain Higher COVID-19 Morbidity and Mortalities?","Int J Mol Sci","The health scourge imposed on humanity by the COVID-19 pandemic seems not to recede. This fact warrants refined and novel ideas analyzing different aspects of the illness. One such aspect is related to the observation that most COVID-19 casualties were older males, a tendency also noticed in the epidemics of SARS-CoV in 2003 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome in 2012. This gender-related difference in the COVID-19 death toll might be directly involved with testosterone (TEST) and its plasmatic concentration in men. TEST has been demonstrated to provide men with anti-inflammatory and immunological advantages. As the plasmatic concentration of this androgen decreases with age, the health benefit it confers also diminishes. Low plasmatic levels of TEST can be determinant in the infection's outcome and might be related to a dysfunctional cell Ca2+homeostasis. Not only does TEST modulate the activity of diverse proteins that regulate cellular calcium concentrations, but these proteins have also been proven to be necessary for the replication of many viruses. Therefore, we discuss herein how TEST regulates different Ca2+-handling proteins in healthy tissues and propose how low TEST concentrations might facilitate the replication of the SARS-CoV-2 virus through the lack of modulation of the mechanisms that regulate intracellular Ca2+concentrations."

Because they shorten with each mitotic cycle, leukocyte telomere length (LTL) serves as a mitotic clock. Reduced LTL has been associated with multiple human disorders.To determine the association between LTL and overall as well as disease-specific mortality and morbidity.This multicenter, community-based cohort study conducted from March 2006 to December 2010 included longitudinal follow-up (mean [SD], 12 [2] years) for 472 432 English participants from the United Kingdom Biobank (UK Biobank) and analyzed morbidity and mortality. The data were analyzed in 2021.Hazard ratios (HRs) and odds ratios for mortality and morbidity associated with a standard deviation change in LTL, adjusted for age, sex, body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared), and ethnicity.This study included a total of 472 432 English participants, of whom 54% were women (mean age, 57 years). Reduced LTL was associated with increased overall (HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.07-1.09), cardiovascular (HR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.06-1.12), respiratory (HR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.34-1.45), digestive (HR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.19-1.33), musculoskeletal (HR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.35-1.92), and COVID-19 (HR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.07-1.23) mortality, but not cancer-related mortality. A total of 214 disorders were significantly overrepresented and 37 underrepresented in participants with shorter LTL. Respiratory (11%), digestive/liver-related (14%), circulatory (18%), and musculoskeletal conditions (6%), together with infections (5%), accounted for most positive associations, whereas (benign) neoplasms and endocrinologic/metabolic disorders were the most underrepresented entities. Malignant tumors, esophageal cancer, and lymphoid and myeloid leukemia were significantly more common in participants with shorter LTL, whereas brain cancer and melanoma were less prevalent. While smoking and alcohol consumption were associated with shorter LTL, additional adjustment for both factors, as well as cognitive function/major comorbid conditions, did not significantly alter the results.This cohort study found that shorter LTL was associated with a small risk increase of overall mortality, but a higher risk of mortality was associated with specific organs and diseases."
"35052343","Alcohol Use Intensity Decreases in Response to Successful Smoking Cessation Therapy.","Genes (Basel)","Smokers frequently drink heavily. However, the effectiveness of smoking cessation therapy for those with comorbid alcohol abuse is unclear, and the content of smoking cessation programs often does not address comorbid alcohol consumption. In order to achieve a better understanding of the relationship between changes in rate of smoking to the change in intensity of alcohol consumption, and the necessity for alcohol-specific programming for dual users, we quantified cigarette and alcohol consumption in 39 subjects undergoing a 3-month contingency management smoking cessation program using recently developed DNA methylation tools. Intake alcohol consumption, as quantified by the Alcohol T Score (ATS), was highly correlated with cg05575921 smoking intensity (adjustedR2= 0.49) with 19 of the 39 subjects having ATS scores indicative of Heavy Alcohol Consumption. After 90 days of smoking cessation therapy, ATS values decreased with the change in ATS score being highly correlated with change in cg05575921 smoking intensity (adjustedR2= 0.60), regardless of whether or not the subject managed to completely quit smoking. We conclude that alcohol consumption significantly decreases in response to successful smoking cessation. Further studies to determine whether targeted therapy focused on comorbid alcohol use increases the success of smoking cessation in those with dual use should be explored."

However, all marker-based heritability estimators implicitly assume mating is random. We provide mathematical and simulation-based evidence demonstrating that both method-of-moments and likelihood-based estimators are biased in the presence of assortative mating and derive corrected heritability estimators for traits subject to assortment. Finally, we demonstrate that the empirical patterns of estimates across methods and sample sizes for real traits subject to assortative mating are congruent with expected assortative mating-induced biases. For example, marker-based heritability estimates for height are 14% - 23% higher than corrected estimates using UK Biobank data.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35069690","SNP and Haplotype Regional Heritability Mapping (SNHap-RHM): Joint Mapping of Common and Rare Variation Affecting Complex Traits.","Front Genet","We describe a genome-wide analytical approach, SNP and Haplotype Regional Heritability Mapping (SNHap-RHM), that provides regional estimates of the heritability across locally defined regions in the genome. This approach utilises relationship matrices that are based on sharing of SNP and haplotype alleles at local haplotype blocks delimited by recombination boundaries in the genome. We implemented the approach on simulated data and show that the haplotype-based regional GRMs capture variation that is complementary to that captured by SNP-based regional GRMs, and thus justifying the fitting of the two GRMs jointly in a single analysis (SNHap-RHM). SNHap-RHM captures regions in the genome contributing to the phenotypic variation that existing genome-wide analysis methods may fail to capture. We further demonstrate that there are real benefits to be gained from this approach by applying it to real data from about 20,000 individuals from the Generation Scotland: Scottish Family Health Study. We analysed height and major depressive disorder (MDD). We identified seven genomic regions that are genome-wide significant for height, and three regions significant at a suggestive threshold (p-value < 1 × 10-5) for MDD. These significant regions have genes mapped to within 400 kb of them. The genes mapped for height have been reported to be associated with height in humans. Similarly, those mapped for MDD have been reported to be associated with major depressive disorder and other psychiatry phenotypes. The results show that SNHap-RHM presents an exciting new opportunity to analyse complex traits by allowing the joint mapping of novel genomic regions tagged by either SNPs or haplotypes, potentially leading to the recovery of some of the ""missing"" heritability.Copyright © 2022 Oppong, Boutin, Campbell, McIntosh, Porteous, Hayward, Haley, Navarro and Knott."
"35021081","2-Hydroxyglutarate destabilizes chromatin regulatory landscape and lineage fidelity to promote cellular heterogeneity.","Cell Rep","The epigenome delineates lineage-specific transcriptional programs and restricts cell plasticity to prevent non-physiological cell fate transitions. Although cell diversification fosters tumor evolution and therapy resistance, upstream mechanisms that regulate the stability and plasticity of the cancer epigenome remain elusive. Here we show that 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) not only suppresses DNA repair but also mediates the high-plasticity chromatin landscape. A combination of single-cell epigenomics and multi-omics approaches demonstrates that 2HG disarranges otherwise well-preserved stable nucleosome positioning and promotes cell-to-cell variability. 2HG induces loss of motif accessibility to the luminal-defining transcriptional factors FOXA1, FOXP1, and GATA3 and a shift from luminal to basal-like gene expression. Breast tumors with high 2HG exhibit enhanced heterogeneity with undifferentiated epigenomic signatures linked to adverse prognosis. Further, ascorbate-2-phosphate (A2P) eradicates heterogeneity and impairs growth of high 2HG-producing breast cancer cells. These findings suggest 2HG as a key determinant of cancer plasticity and provide a rational strategy to counteract tumor cell evolution.Published by Elsevier Inc."

This study investigates the effects of STRs on gene expression in liver tissues based on the whole-genome sequences and RNA-Seq data of a discovery cohort of 260 F6 individuals and a validation population of 296 F7 individuals from a heterogeneous population generated from crosses among eight pig breeds.We identified 5203 and 5868 significantly expression STRs (eSTRs, FDR < 1%) in the F6 and F7 populations, respectively, most of which could be reciprocally validated (π1 = 0.92). The eSTRs explained 27.5% of the cis-heritability of gene expression traits on average. We further identified 235 and 298 fine-mapped STRs through the Bayesian fine-mapping approach in the F6 and F7 pigs, respectively, which were significantly enriched in intron, ATAC peak, compartment A and H3K4me3 regions. We identified 20 fine-mapped STRs located in 100 kb windows upstream and downstream of published complex trait-associated SNPs, which colocalized with epigenetic markers such as H3K27ac and ATAC peaks. These included eSTR of the CLPB, PGLS, PSMD6 and DHDH genes, which are linked with genome-wide association study (GWAS) SNPs for blood-related traits, leg conformation, growth-related traits, and meat quality traits, respectively.This study provides insights into the effects of STRs on gene expression traits.

The role of DNA methylation in the development of the nervous system and the progression of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease has been an interesting research area. Furthermore, mutations altering DNA methylation affect neurodevelopmental functions and may cause the progression of several neurodegenerative diseases. Epigenetic modifications in neurodegenerative diseases are widely studied in different populations to uncover the plausible mechanisms contributing to the development and progression of the disease and detect novel biomarkers for early prognosis and future pharmacotherapeutic targets.

Epigenomic regulations have been known to strongly interact with genetic variations and potentially mediate biochemical cascades involved in tumorigenesis. Due to the cell-type specificity of epigenomic features, profiling of individual cell types is critical for understanding the molecular events in various cellular compartments within complex breast tissue. Here, we produced cell-type-specific profiles of genome-wide histone modifications including H3K27ac and H3K4me3 in basal, luminal progenitor, mature luminal and stromal cells extracted from a small pilot cohort of pre-cancerBRCA1mutation carriers (BRCA1mut/+) and non-carriers (BRCA1+/+), using a low-input ChIP-seq technology that we developed. We discovered that basal and stromal cells present the most extensive epigenomic differences between mutation carriers (BRCA1mut/+) and non-carriers (BRCA1+/+), while luminal progenitor and mature luminal cells are relatively unchanged with the mutation. Furthermore, the epigenomic changes in basal cells due toBRCA1mutation appear to facilitate their transformation into luminal progenitor cells. Taken together, epigenomic regulation plays an important role in the case ofBRCA1mutation for shaping the molecular landscape that facilitates tumorigenesis.© The Author(s) 2022.

Therefore, epigenetic therapeutics might be of key importance to treat PIT. However, developing epigenetic therapeutics is based on understanding the relationship between epigenetics and disease. To date, there is still scarce knowledge about the relationship between epigenetic modifications and PIT, which warrants further investigations.The purpose of this study was to evaluate the level of global DNA methylation associated with implant failure (IF) due to PIT compared to periodontally healthy (PH) patients.A total of 20 participants were initially enrolled in this pilot, exploratory, single-blinded, cross-sectional clinical human study in two groups: 10 in the PH group and 10 in the IF group. In the participants who have completed the study, gingival tissue and bone samples were harvested from each participant and were used to perform global DNA methylation analysis. The percentage of global DNA methylation (5-mC%) was compared (1) between groups (PH and IF); (2) between the subgroups of gingival tissue and bone separately; (3) in the whole sample, comparing gingival tissue and bone; (4) within groups, comparing gingival tissue and bone. Demographic, periodontal, and peri-implant measurements as well as periodontal staging, were also recorded. All statistical comparisons were made at the 0.05 significance level.Out of the initially enrolled 20 patients, only 19 completed the study and, thus, were included in the final analysis; 10 patients in the PH group and 9 patients in the IF group, contributing to a total of 38 samples. One patient from the IF group was excluded from the study due to systemic disease. The mean implant survival time was 10.8 years (2.17-15.25 years). Intergroup comparison, stratified by group, indicated a similar 5-mC% between the PH and IF groups in both gingival tissue and bone (p= 0.599), only in bone (p= 0.414), and only in gingival tissue (p= 0.744). Intragroup comparison, stratified by the type of sample, indicated a significantly higher 5-mC% in gingival tissue samples compared to bone in both the PH and IF groups (p= 0.001), in the PH group (p= 0.019), and in the IF group (p= 0.009).Within the limitations of this study, higher global DNA methylation levels were found in gingival tissue samples compared to bone, regardless of the study groups. However, similar global DNA methylation levels were observed overall between the IF and PH groups. Yet, differences in the global DNA methylation levels between gingival tissues and bone, regardless of the study group, could reflect a different epigenetic response between various tissues within the same microenvironment. Further studies are necessary to elucidate the present findings and to evaluate the role of epigenetic modifications in IF due to PIT."

Examples across multiple taxa have demonstrated that maternal reproductive investment resulting from stress can improve offspring survival; a form of matricidal provisioning when death appears imminent is known as terminal investment. Here we report a reproductive response in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans upon exposure to acute cold shock at 2 °C, whereby vitellogenic lipid movement from the soma to the germline appears to be massively upregulated at the expense of parental survival. This response is dependent on functional TAX-2; TAX-4 cGMP-gated channels that are part of canonical thermosensory mechanisms in worms and can be prevented in the presence of activated SKN-1/Nrf2, the master stress regulator. Increased maternal provisioning promotes improved embryonic cold shock survival, which is notably suppressed in animals with impaired vitellogenesis. These findings suggest that cold shock in C. elegans triggers terminal investment to promote progeny fitness at the expense of parental survival and may serve as a tractable model for future studies of stress-induced progeny plasticity.© 2022.

This and the observation that the cervical cell WID-OC-index mimics the epigenetic program of those cells at risk of becoming cancerous in BRCA1/2 germline mutation carriers (i.e. mammary epithelium, fallopian tube fimbriae, prostate) further suggest that the epigenetic misprogramming of cervical cells is an indicator for cancer predisposition.

A suggestive significant genetic correlation was found between PCOS and WHRadjBMI (rg=0.09, P=0.04). Partitioning the whole genome into 1703 nearly independent regions, we observed a significant local genetic correlation for adult BMI and PCOS at chromosome 18: 57630483-59020751. We identified 16 shared loci underlying PCOS and obesity-related traits via cross-trait meta-analysis including 9 loci shared between BMI and PCOS (adult BMI and PCOS: 5 loci; childhood BMI and PCOS: 4 loci), 6 loci shared between WHR and PCOS, and 5 loci shared between WHRadjBMI and PCOS. Mendelian randomization (MR) supported the causal roles of both adult BMI (OR=2.92, 95% CI=2.33-3.67) and childhood BMI (OR=2.76, 95% CI=2.09-3.66) in PCOS, but not WHR (OR=1.19, 95% CI=0.93-1.52) or WHRadjBMI (OR=1.03, 95% CI=0.87-1.22). Genetic predisposition to PCOS did not seem to influence the risk of obesity-related traits.Our cross-trait analysis suggests a shared genetic basis underlying obesity and PCOS and provides novel insights into the biological mechanisms underlying these complex traits.

These loci provide an opportunity to evaluate shared and distinct genetic components in the two main migraine subtypes: migraine with aura and migraine without aura. Stratification of the risk loci using 29,679 cases with subtype information indicated three risk variants that seem specific for migraine with aura (in HMOX2, CACNA1A and MPPED2), two that seem specific for migraine without aura (near SPINK2 and near FECH) and nine that increase susceptibility for migraine regardless of subtype. The new risk loci include genes encoding recent migraine-specific drug targets, namely calcitonin gene-related peptide (CALCA/CALCB) and serotonin 1F receptor (HTR1F).

"35100265","Super interactive promoters provide insight into cell type-specific regulatory networks in blood lineage cell types.","PLoS Genet","Existing studies of chromatin conformation have primarily focused on potential enhancers interacting with gene promoters. By contrast, the interactivity of promoters per se, while equally critical to understanding transcriptional control, has been largely unexplored, particularly in a cell type-specific manner for blood lineage cell types. In this study, we leverage promoter capture Hi-C data across a compendium of blood lineage cell types to identify and characterize cell type-specific super-interactive promoters (SIPs). Notably, promoter-interacting regions (PIRs) of SIPs are more likely to overlap with cell type-specific ATAC-seq peaks and GWAS variants for relevant blood cell traits than PIRs of non-SIPs. Moreover, PIRs of cell-type-specific SIPs show enriched heritability of relevant blood cell trait (s), and are more enriched with GWAS variants associated with blood cell traits compared to PIRs of non-SIPs. Further, SIP genes tend to express at a higher level in the corresponding cell type. Importantly, SIP subnetworks incorporating cell-type-specific SIPs and ATAC-seq peaks help interpret GWAS variants. Examples include GWAS variants associated with platelet count near the megakaryocyte SIP gene EPHB3 and variants associated lymphocyte count near the native CD4 T-Cell SIP gene ETS1. Interestingly, around 25.7% ~ 39.6% blood cell traits GWAS variants residing in SIP PIR regions disrupt transcription factor binding motifs. Importantly, our analysis shows the potential of using promoter-centric analyses of chromatin spatial organization data to identify biologically important genes and their regulatory regions."

We performed cross-tissue and multiple-gene conditioned transcriptome-wide association studies for 23 tissues of the gut-brain-axis using genome-wide association studies data sets (total 180,592 patients) for Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. We identified NR5A2, SATB2, and PPP3CA (encoding a target for calcineurin inhibitors in refractory ulcerative colitis) as shared susceptibility genes with transcriptome-wide significance both for Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and schizophrenia, largely explaining fine-mapped association signals at nearby genome-wide association study susceptibility loci. Analysis of bulk and single-cell RNA-sequencing data showed that PPP3CA expression was strongest in neurons and in enteroendocrine and Paneth-like cells of the ileum, colon, and rectum, indicating a possible link to the gut-brain-axis. PPP3CA together with three further suggestive loci can be linked to calcineurin-related signaling pathways such as NFAT activation or Wnt.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35125691","Association of Promoter Methylation and Expression of Inflammatory Genes IL-6 and TNF-α with the Risk of Coronary Artery Disease in Diabetic and Obese Subjects among Asian Indians.","Indian J Clin Biochem","The inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) are considered as the most important contributors to the endothelial dysfunction in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity. The hypomethylation of CpG sites in the promoter region of the IL-6 and TNF-α have shown to be associated with the increased expression of IL-6 and TNF-α. However, there are no studies on the methylation and expression of IL-6 and TNF-α with the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) in subjects with T2DM and obesity in Asian Indians. Hence, the present study was aimed to investigate whether the IL-6, TNF-α promoter methylation and expression in blood leukocyte DNA is associated with the risk of CAD in diabetic and obese subjects in Asian Indians. For this study, we recruited 574 subjects which includes, 207 angiographically confirmed CAD patients, 100 T2DM patients, 82 obese subjects and 185 healthy controls. The methylation status of IL-6 and TNF-α gene loci was determined by methylation specific PCR (MPCR) and gene expression was determined by qPCR. We found significant hypomethylation of IL-6 in CAD and T2DM subjects (OR 1.98 95% CI: 1.32-2.97,p = 0.001, OR: 2.23 95% CI:1.34-3.76,p = 0.001, respectively). Further, a significant increase in the expression of IL-6 in CAD and T2DM subjects (fold change: 26.39 & 14.7,p = 0.0001) compared to the control subjects was observed. A significant increase in the hypomethylation of TNF-α in CAD, T2DM and obese subjects was observed as compared to the control (OR: 2.04 95% CI: 1.36-3.05,p = 0.0005, OR: 1.81 95% CI 1.10-2.96,p = 0.01, and OR: 2.1 95% CI 1.24-3.57,p = 0.007, respectively).We also found an increased expression of TNF-α in CAD, T2DM and obese subjects as compared to controls. In addition, presence of low folate, and hyperhomocysteinemia was observed in the present study, may be the contributing factors for the hypomethylation of IL-6 and TNF-α and oxidative stress. In conclusion, increased expression of IL-6 and TNF-α due to hypomethylation in T2DM and obese individuals may contribute to CAD risk in these subjects. The presence of hyperhomocysteinemia and increased oxidative risk may enhance the CAD risk further.© Association of Clinical Biochemists of India 2020."
"35094024","Genome-wide meta-analysis of alcohol use disorder in East Asians.","Neuropsychopharmacology","Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified ~30 AUD risk genes in European populations, but many fewer in East Asians. We conducted GWAS and genome-wide meta-analysis of AUD in 13,551 subjects with East Asian ancestry, using published summary data and newly genotyped data from five cohorts: (1) electronic health record (EHR)-diagnosed AUD in the Million Veteran Program (MVP) sample; (2) DSM-IV diagnosed alcohol dependence (AD) in a Han Chinese-GSA (array) cohort; (3) AD in a Han Chinese-Cyto (array) cohort; and (4) two AD Thai cohorts. The MVP and Thai samples included newly genotyped subjects from ongoing recruitment. In total, 2254 cases and 11,297 controls were analyzed. An AUD polygenic risk score was analyzed in an independent sample with 4464 East Asians (Genetic Epidemiology Research in Adult Health and Aging (GERA)). Phenotypes from survey data and ICD-9-CM diagnoses were tested for association with the AUD PRS. Two risk loci were detected: the well-known functional variant rs1229984 in ADH1B and rs3782886 in BRAP (near the ALDH2 gene locus) are the lead variants. AUD PRS was significantly associated with days per week of alcohol consumption (beta = 0.43, SE = 0.067, p = 2.47 × 10-10) and nominally associated with pack years of smoking (beta = 0.09, SE = 0.05, p = 4.52 × 10-2) and ever vs. never smoking (beta = 0.06, SE = 0.02, p = 1.14 × 10-2). This is the largest GWAS of AUD in East Asians to date. Building on previous findings, we were able to analyze pleiotropy, but did not identify any new risk regions, underscoring the importance of recruiting additional East Asian subjects for alcohol GWAS.© 2022.

TL, mt-DNA and DNAm assessment was performed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Biological age (DNAm age) was computed as the algorithm based on methylation pattern of five genes. Epigenetic age acceleration was estimated from the residuals of the linear model of epigenetic age regressed on chronological age. Long Interspersed Nuclear Elements (LINE)-1 methylation pattern was used as a surrogate for global DNA methylation.This study investigated whether peripheral TL, mt-DNA and DNAm could predict live birth in IVF cycles.TL, mt-DNA and LINE-1 methylation were not associated with IVF success. Conversely, DNAm age resulted significantly lower in women who had a live birth compared to women who did not (36.1 ± 4.2 and 37.3 ± 3.3 years, respectively, p = 0.04). For DNAm age, odds ratio (OR) for live birth per year of age was 0.90 (95%CI: 0.82-0.99, p = 0.036) after adjusting for FSH and antral follicle count (AFC) and 0.90 (95%CI: 0.82-0.99, p = 0.028) after adjusting also for number of oocytes retrieved. A significant association also emerged for epigenetic age acceleration after adjustments (OR = 0.91, 95%CI: 0.83-1.00, p = 0.048).DNAm age is associated with IVF success but the magnitude of this association is insufficient to claim a clinical use. However, our findings are promising and warrant further investigation. Assessment of biological age using different epigenetic clocks or focusing on different tissues may reveal new predictors of IVF success."

Higher female prevalence and sex-specific symptomatology have been observed, suggesting that biologically-determined dimensions might affect the disease onset and outcome. Rumination and executive dysfunction characterize adult-onset MDD, but sex differences in these domains and in the related brain mechanisms are still largely unexplored. The present pilot study aimed to explore any interactions between adult-onset MDD and sex on brain morphology and brain function during a Go/No-Go paradigm. We hypothesized to detect diagnosis by sex effects on brain regions involved in self-referential processes and cognitive control. Twenty-four subjects, 12 healthy (HC) (mean age 68.7 y, 7 females and 5 males) and 12 affected by adult-onset MDD (mean age 66.5 y, 5 females and 7 males), underwent clinical evaluations and a 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) session. Diagnosis and diagnosis by sex effects were assessed on regional gray matter (GM) volumes and task-related functional MRI (fMRI) activations. The GM volume analyses showed diagnosis effects in left mid frontal cortex (p< 0.01), and diagnosis by sex effects in orbitofrontal, olfactory, and calcarine regions (p< 0.05). The Go/No-Go fMRI analyses showed MDD effects on fMRI activations in left precuneus and right lingual gyrus, and diagnosis by sex effects on fMRI activations in right parahippocampal gyrus and right calcarine cortex (p< 0.001, ≥ 40 voxels). Our exploratory results suggest the presence of sex-specific brain correlates of adult-onset MDD-especially in regions involved in attention processing and in the brain default mode-potentially supporting cognitive and symptom differences between sexes.Copyright © 2022 Piani, Maggioni, Delvecchio, Ferro, Gritti, Pozzoli, Fontana, Enrico, Cinnante, Triulzi, Stanley, Battaglioli and Brambilla."
"35088123","Genetics of rheumatoid arthritis.","Semin Immunopathol","Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an inflammatory autoimmune disease involving symmetric joints and is generally characterized by persistent pain, tenderness, and destruction of joints. The vast majority of RA patients produce autoantibodies, and immune cell involvement in disease development is well recognized, as is the contribution of other types of cells in synovial tissue, like fibroblasts. It is known that there are major genetic associations with the HLA locus, while multiple non-HLA genetic variants display relatively low risk of RA. Both HLA and non-HLA associations suggest that the profiles of genetic associations for autoantibody-positive vs. autoantibody-negative RA are different. Several alleles of HLA-DRB1 are associated with high risk for autoantibody-positive RA, with the strongest risk characterized by valine at position 11 of the protein sequence (HLA-DRB1*04 and *10 alleles). There is a strong protective effect for the risk of autoantibody-positive RA associated with HLA-DRB1*13 alleles. Although major genetic associations have been known for several years, understanding of the specific mechanisms in the development of increased risk of RA for these variations is work in progress. Current studies focus on the binding of immune receptors involved in recognition of putative peptides in activation of T cells, as well as investigation of cell signaling mechanisms. At least a part of RA risk could be explained by gene-gene and gene-environment interactions. There are currently more than 150 candidate loci with polymorphisms that associate with RA, mainly related to seropositive disease, and new discoveries are anticipated in the future from investigation of diverse human populations. This new research will help create a strong foundation for the continuing process of integrating genetic, epigenetic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data in studies of RA.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35134196","Evolution of polygenic traits under global vs local adaptation.","Genetics","Observations about the number, frequency, effect size, and genomic distribution of alleles associated with complex traits must be interpreted in light of evolutionary process. These characteristics, which constitute a trait's genetic architecture, can dramatically affect evolutionary outcomes in applications from agriculture to medicine, and can provide a window into how evolution works. Here, I review theoretical predictions about the evolution of genetic architecture under spatially homogeneous, global adaptation as compared with spatially heterogeneous, local adaptation. Due to the tension between divergent selection and migration, local adaptation can favor ""concentrated"" genetic architectures that are enriched for alleles of larger effect, clustered in a smaller number of genomic regions, relative to expectations under global adaptation. However, the evolution of such architectures may be limited by many factors, including the genotypic redundancy of the trait, mutation rate, and temporal variability of environment. I review the circumstances in which predictions differ for global vs local adaptation and discuss where progress can be made in testing hypotheses using data from natural populations and lab experiments. As the field of comparative population genomics expands in scope, differences in architecture among traits and species will provide insights into how evolution works, and such differences must be interpreted in light of which kind of selection has been operating.© The Author(s) 2021.

"35126653","Epigenetics and the city: Non-parallel DNA methylation modifications across pairs of urban-forest Great tit populations.","Evol Appl","Identifying the molecular mechanisms involved in rapid adaptation to novel environments and determining their predictability are central questions in evolutionary biology and pressing issues due to rapid global changes. Complementary to genetic responses to selection, faster epigenetic variations such as modifications of DNA methylation may play a substantial role in rapid adaptation. In the context of rampant urbanization, joint examinations of genomic and epigenomic mechanisms are still lacking. Here, we investigated genomic (SNP) and epigenomic (CpG methylation) responses to urban life in a passerine bird, the Great tit (Parus major). To test whether urban evolution is predictable (i.e. parallel) or involves mostly nonparallel molecular processes among cities, we analysed both SNP and CpG methylation variations across three distinct pairs of city and forest Great tit populations in Europe. Our analyses reveal a polygenic response to urban life, with both many genes putatively under weak divergent selection and multiple differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between forest and city great tits. DMRs mainly overlapped transcription start sites and promotor regions, suggesting their importance in modulating gene expression. Both genomic and epigenomic outliers were found in genomic regions enriched for genes with biological functions related to the nervous system, immunity, or behavioural, hormonal and stress responses. Interestingly, comparisons across the three pairs of city-forest populations suggested little parallelism in both genetic and epigenetic responses. Our results confirm, at both the genetic and epigenetic levels, hypotheses of polygenic and largely nonparallel mechanisms of rapid adaptation in novel environments such as urbanized areas.© 2022 The Authors.

To identify placental gene-trait associations (GTAs) across the life course, we perform distal mediator-enriched transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) for 40 traits, integrating placental multi-omics from the Extremely Low Gestational Age Newborn Study. At [Formula: see text], we detect 248 GTAs, mostly for neonatal and metabolic traits, across 176 genes, enriched for cell growth and immunological pathways. In aggregate, genetic effects mediated by placental expression significantly explain 4 early-life traits but no later-in-life traits. 89 GTAs show significant mediation through distal genetic variants, identifying hypotheses for distal regulation of GTAs. Investigation of one hypothesis in human placenta-derived choriocarcinoma cells reveal that knockdown of mediator gene EPS15 upregulates predicted targets SPATA13 and FAM214A, both associated with waist-hip ratio in TWAS, and multiple genes involved in metabolic pathways. These results suggest profound health impacts of placental genomic regulation in developmental programming across the life course.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35092541","Heritability: What's the point? What is it not for? A human genetics perspective.","Genetica","In this paper, we explain the concept of heritability and describe the different methods and the genotype-phenotype correspondences used to estimate heritability in the specific field of human genetics. Heritability studies are conducted on extremely diverse human traits: quantitative traits (physical, biological, but also cognitive and behavioral measurements) and binary traits (as is the case of most human diseases). Instead of variables such as education and socio-economic status as covariates in genetic studies, they are now the direct object of genetic analysis. We make a review of the different assumptions underlying heritability estimates and dispute the validity of most of them. Moreover, and maybe more importantly, we show that they are very often misinterpreted. These erroneous interpretations lead to a vision of a genetic determinism of human traits. This vision is currently being widely disseminated not only by the mass media and the mainstream press, but also by the scientific press. We caution against the dangerous implication it has both medically and socially. Contrarily to the field of animal and plant genetics for which the polygenic model and the concept of heritability revolutionized selection methods, we explain why it does not provide answer in human genetics.© 2022.

"35089335","Developmental disorders caused by haploinsufficiency of transcriptional regulators: a perspective based on cell fate determination.","Biol Open","Many human birth defects and neurodevelopmental disorders are caused by loss-of-function mutations in a single copy of transcription factor (TF) and chromatin regulator genes. Although this dosage sensitivity has long been known, how and why haploinsufficiency (HI) of transcriptional regulators leads to developmental disorders (DDs) is unclear. Here I propose the hypothesis that such DDs result from defects in cell fate determination that are based on disrupted bistability in the underlying gene regulatory network (GRN). Bistability, a crucial systems biology concept to model binary choices such as cell fate decisions, requires both positive feedback and ultrasensitivity, the latter often achieved through TF cooperativity. The hypothesis explains why dosage sensitivity of transcriptional regulators is an inherent property of fate decisions, and why disruption of either positive feedback or cooperativity in the underlying GRN is sufficient to cause disease. I present empirical and theoretical evidence in support of this hypothesis and discuss several issues for which it increases our understanding of disease, such as incomplete penetrance. The proposed framework provides a mechanistic, systems-level explanation of HI of transcriptional regulators, thus unifying existing theories, and offers new insights into outstanding issues of human disease.

Powered by enormous financial support, this past half-century has witnessed remarkable progress in understanding the individual molecular mechanisms of cancer, primarily through the characterization of cancer genes and the phenotypes associated with their pathways. Despite millions of publications and the overwhelming volume data generated from the Cancer Genome Project, clinical benefits are still lacking. In fact, the massive, diverse data also unexpectedly challenge the current somatic gene mutation theory of cancer, as well as the initial rationales behind sequencing so many cancer samples. Therefore, what should we do next? Should we continue to sequence more samples and push for further molecular characterizations, or should we take a moment to pause and think about the biological meaning of the data we have, integrating new ideas in cancer biology? On this special anniversary, we implore that it is time for the latter. We review the Genome Architecture Theory, an alternative conceptual framework that departs from gene-based theories. Specifically, we discuss the relationship between genes, genomes, and information-based platforms for future cancer research. This discussion will reinforce some newly proposed concepts that are essential for advancing cancer research, including two-phased cancer evolution (which reconciles evolutionary contributions from karyotypes and genes), stress-induced genome chaos (which creates new system information essential for macroevolution), the evolutionary mechanism of cancer (which unifies diverse molecular mechanisms to create new karyotype coding during evolution), and cellular adaptation and cancer emergence (which explains why cancer exists in the first place). We hope that these ideas will usher in new genomic and evolutionary conceptual frameworks and strategies for the next 50 years of cancer research."

Mounting evidence indicates that a disturbance of bone homeostasis can trigger degenerative bone diseases, including osteoporosis and osteoarthritis. In addition to conventional genetic modifications, epigenetic modifications (i.e., DNA methylation, histone modifications, and the expression of noncoding RNAs) are considered to be contributing factors that affect bone homeostasis. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) were previously regarded as 'transcriptional noise' with no biological functions. However, substantial evidence suggests that lncRNAs have roles in the epigenetic regulation of biological processes in MSCs and related diseases. In this review, we summarized the interactions between lncRNAs and epigenetic modifiers associated with osteo-/adipogenic differentiation of MSCs and the pathogenesis of degenerative bone diseases and highlighted promising lncRNA-based diagnostic and therapeutic targets for bone diseases.©The Author(s) 2022.

"35082446","Brahma safeguards canalization of cardiac mesoderm differentiation.","Nature","Differentiation proceeds along a continuum of increasingly fate-restricted intermediates, referred to as canalization1,2. Canalization is essential for stabilizing cell fate, but the mechanisms that underlie robust canalization are unclear. Here we show that the BRG1/BRM-associated factor (BAF) chromatin-remodelling complex ATPase gene Brm safeguards cell identity during directed cardiogenesis of mouse embryonic stem cells. Despite the establishment of a well-differentiated precardiac mesoderm, Brm-/-cells predominantly became neural precursors, violating germ layer assignment. Trajectory inference showed a sudden acquisition of a non-mesodermal identity in Brm-/-cells. Mechanistically, the loss of Brm prevented de novo accessibility of primed cardiac enhancers while increasing the expression of neurogenic factor POU3F1, preventing the binding of the neural suppressor REST and shifting the composition of BRG1 complexes. The identity switch caused by the Brm mutation was overcome by increasing BMP4 levels during mesoderm induction. Mathematical modelling supports these observations and demonstrates that Brm deletion affects cell fate trajectory by modifying saddle-node bifurcations2. In the mouse embryo, Brm deletion exacerbated mesoderm-deleted Brg1-mutant phenotypes, severely compromising cardiogenesis, and reveals an in vivo role for Brm. Our results show that Brm is a compensable safeguard of the fidelity of mesoderm chromatin states, and support a model in which developmental canalization is not a rigid irreversible path, but a highly plastic trajectory.© 2022.

We describe transcription factor specificity using regular expressions and find that most human transcription factor binding site motifs are separated in sequence space by one to three motif-discriminating positions. We apply theorems based on the pigeonhole principle to calculate the maximum number of transcription factors that can coexist given this degree of specificity, which is in the order of ten thousand and would fully utilize the space of DNA subsequences. Taking into account an expanded DNA alphabet with modified bases can further raise this limit by several orders of magnitude, at a lower level of sequence space usage.

This study intended to evaluate the predictors of sICH after EVT in patients with large vessel occlusion (LVO)-induced AIS.We conducted a retrospective review on consecutive AIS patients who underwent EVT in our University hospital between January 2019 and August 2020. The patients were classified into two groups based upon the occurrence of sICH. The main outcomes were the occurrence of sICH using the Heidelberg Bleeding Classification and functional condition at 90 days. Multivariate logistic regression analysis and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves were used to identify independent predictors of sICH after EVT.Three hundred and 69 patients were enrolled in the study, of which 16.8% (n= 62) developed sICH. Favorable neurological outcome was lower in patients with sICH than in patients without sICH (6.5 vs. 43.3%;P< 0.001), with the overall mortality being 112 (30.4%) at 90 days post- EVT. Results from univariate analysis showed significant differences between the two groups in the prevalence of diabetes, initial Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) score, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score after operation, the levels of fasting blood glucose (FBG), neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelets (PLT), and thrombin time (TT) at admission. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that FBG ≥ 7.54 mmol/L (OR: 2.765; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.513-5.054), NLR ≥ 5.48 (OR: 2.711; 95% CI: 1.433-5.128), TT at admission ≥ 16.25 s (OR: 2.022; 95% CI: 1.115-3.667), and NIHSS score within 24 h after the operation ≥ 10 (OR: 3.728; 95% CI: 1.516-9.170) were independent predictors of sICH. The combination of NLR ≥ 5.48, FBG ≥ 7.54 mmol/L, TT at admission ≥ 16.25 s, and NIHSS score within 24 h after the operation ≥ 10 generated an optimal prediction model (AUC: 0.723).Higher levels of FDG, NLR, TT at admission, and NIHSS score after operation were associated with sICH after EVT in patients with LVO-induced AIS.Copyright © 2022 Shen, Ma, Jiao, Chen, Xue, Li, Li, Song and Huang."

We apply a soft-clustering (archetype) method to characterize newly diagnosed T2D based on 32 clinical variables. We assign quantitative clustering scores for individuals and investigate the associations with glycemic deterioration, genetic risk scores, circulating omics biomarkers, and phenotypic stability over 36 months. Four archetype profiles represent dysfunction patterns across combinations of T2D etiological processes and correlate with multiple circulating biomarkers. One archetype associated with obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and impaired β cell glucose sensitivity corresponds with the fastest disease progression and highest demand for anti-diabetic treatment. We demonstrate that clinical heterogeneity in T2D can be mapped to heterogeneity in individual etiological processes, providing a potential route to personalized treatments.© 2021 The Authors."

"35091671","Metabolic programming in the offspring after gestational overfeeding in the mother: toward neonatal rescuing with metformin in a swine model.","Int J Obes (Lond)","Maternal overfeeding during gestation may lead to adverse metabolic programming in the offspring mediated by epigenetic alterations. Potential reversal, in early life, of these alterations may help in the prevention of future cardio-metabolic conditions. In this context, our aims were: (1) to study the effects of maternal overfeeding on the metabolic and epigenetic programming of offspring's adipose tissue; and (2) to test the potential of postnatal metformin treatment to reverse these changes.We used a swine animal model where commercial production sows were either overfed or kept under standard diet during gestation, and piglets at birth were randomly assigned to metformin (n = 16 per group) or vehicle treatment during lactation (n = 16 per group).Piglets born to overfed sows showed a worse metabolic profile (higher weight, weight gain from birth and abdominal circumference; all p < 0.05) together with altered serological markers (increased HOMA-IR, fructosamine, total cholesterol, C-Reactive Protein and lower HMW adiponectin; all p < 0.05). The visceral adipose tissue also showed altered morphology (increased adipocyte area, perimeter and diameter; all p < 0.05), as well as changes in gene expression (higher CCL2 and INSR, lower DLK1; all p < 0.05), and in DNA methylation (96 hypermethylated and 99 hypomethylated CpG sites; FDR < 0.05). Metformin treatment significantly ameliorated the abnormal metabolic profile, decreasing piglets' weight, weight gain from birth, abdominal circumference and fructosamine (all p < 0.05) and reduced adipocyte area, perimeter, and diameter in visceral adipose tissue (all p < 0.05). In addition, metformin treatment potentiated several associations between gene expression in visceral adipose tissue and the altered metabolic markers.Maternal overfeeding during gestation leads to metabolic abnormalities in the offspring, including adipose tissue alterations. Early metformin treatment mitigates these effects and could help rescue the offspring's metabolic health.© 2022. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited."
"35091663","Contribution of obesity and cardiometabolic risk factors in developing cardiovascular disease: a population-based cohort study.","Sci Rep","This study aims to assess the effects of central and general adiposity on development of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) mediated by cardiometabolic risk factors and to analyze their degree of dependency for mediating their effects. To this end, data from the the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study cohort with 6280 participants were included in this study. The hazard ratios were calculated using a 2-stage regression model in the context of a survival model. Systolic blood pressure (BP), total serum cholesterol, and fasting plasma glucose were designated as mediators. Assessing the interactions revealed that BP was the most important mediator for general ( (HRNIE: 1.11, 95% CI 1.17-1.24) and central obesity (CO) (HRNIE: 1.11, 95% CI 1.07-1.15) with 60% and 36% proportion of the effects mediated in the total population, respectively. The proportion of mediated risk for all three metabolic risk factors was 46% (95% CI 31-75%) for overweight, 66% (45-100%) for general obesity and 52% (39-87%) for central obesity. BP was the most important mediator for overweight and central obesity in men, comprising 29% and 36% of the risk, respectively. The proportion of the risk mediated through all three metabolic risk factors in women was 23% (95% CI 13-50%) for overweight, 36% (21-64%) for general obesity and 52% (39-87%) for central obesity. Based on the results of this study, cardiometabolic mediators have conciliated more than 60% of the adverse effects of high BMI on CVDs in men. Controlling the metabolic risk factors in women does not efficiently contribute to decreasing CVDs as effectively.© 2022. The Author(s)."

Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA)-induced inflammation.Male Swiss mice were randomly assigned to 3 groups (n= 7): Saline/Sham, CFA/Sham, and CFA/AJM. Five AJM sessions were carried out at 6, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h after CFA injection. von Frey test was used to assess mechanical hyperalgesia. Tissues from paw skin, paw muscle and spinal cord were collected to measure pro-inflammatory (TNF, IL-1β) and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4, IL-10, and TGF-β1) by ELISA. The macrophage phenotype at the inflammation site was evaluated by Western blotting assay using the Nitric Oxide Synthase 2 (NOS 2) and Arginase-1 immunocontent to identify M1 and M2 macrophages, respectively.Our results confirm a consistent analgesic effect of AJM following the second treatment session. AJM did not change cytokines levels at the inflammatory site, although it promoted a reduction in M2 macrophages. Also, there was a reduction in the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and TNF in the spinal cord.Taken together, the results confirm the anti-hyperalgesic effect of AJM and suggest a central neuroimmunomodulatory effect in a model of persistent inflammation targeting the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and TNF.Copyright © 2022 Omura, Lüdtke, Horewicz, Fernandes, Galassi, Salgado, Palandi, Baldança, Bittencourt, Mack, Seim, Martins and Bobinski."

Previous epigenomic studies focused mainly on clinically diagnosed individuals. The aim of the study was to assess early DNA methylation changes associated with type 1 diabetes already before the diagnosis or even before the appearance of autoantibodies.Reduced representation bisulphite sequencing (RRBS) was applied to study DNA methylation in purified CD4+T cell, CD8+T cell and CD4-CD8-cell fractions of 226 peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples longitudinally collected from seven type 1 diabetes-specific autoantibody-positive individuals and control individuals matched for age, sex, HLA risk and place of birth. We also explored correlations between DNA methylation and gene expression using RNA sequencing data from the same samples. Technical validation of RRBS results was performed using pyrosequencing.We identified 79, 56 and 45 differentially methylated regions in CD4+T cells, CD8+T cells and CD4-CD8-cell fractions, respectively, between type 1 diabetes-specific autoantibody-positive individuals and control participants. The analysis of pre-seroconversion samples identified DNA methylation signatures at the very early stage of disease, including differential methylation at the promoter of IRF5 in CD4+T cells. Further, we validated RRBS results using pyrosequencing at the following CpG sites: chr19:18118304 in the promoter of ARRDC2; chr21:47307815 in the intron of PCBP3; and chr14:81128398 in the intergenic region near TRAF3 in CD4+T cells.These preliminary results provide novel insights into cell type-specific differential epigenetic regulation of genes, which may contribute to type 1 diabetes pathogenesis at the very early stage of disease development. Should these findings be validated, they may serve as a potential signature useful for disease prediction and management.© 2022. The Author(s)."

The UK Biobank does not have measurements of the same cognitive phenotype at distal time points. Therefore, we used education years (EY) as a proxy phenotype for past cognitive performance and current cognitive performance was based on processing speed. This represented an average time span of 40 years between past and current cognitive performance in 330,097 individuals. A confounding factor was that EY is highly polygenic and masked the genetics of resilience. To overcome this, we employed Genomics Structural Equation Modelling (GenomicSEM) to perform a genome-wide association study (GWAS)-by-subtraction using two GWAS, one GWAS of EY and resilience and a second GWAS of EY but not resilience, to generate a GWAS ofResilience. Using independent discovery and replication samples, we found 13 independent genetic loci forResilience. Functional analyses showed enrichment in several brain regions and specific cell types. Gene-set analyses implicated the biological process ""neuron differentiation"", the cellular component ""synaptic part"" and the ""WNT signalosome"". Mendelian randomisation analysis showed a causative effect of white matter volume on cognitive resilience. These results may contribute to the neurobiological understanding of resilience."
"35073935","Variability in newborn telomere length is explained by inheritance and intrauterine environment.","BMC Med","Telomere length (TL) and its attrition are important indicators of physiological stress and biological aging and hence may vary among individuals of the same age. This variation is apparent even in newborns, suggesting potential effects of parental factors and the intrauterine environment on TL of the growing fetus.Average relative TLs of newborns (cord tissue, N = 950) and mothers (buffy coat collected at 26-28 weeks of gestation, N = 892) were measured in a birth cohort. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the effects of heritable factors, socioeconomic status, and in utero exposures linked with maternal nutrition, cardiometabolic health, and mental well-being on the newborn TL. The association between maternal TL and antenatal maternal health was also studied.Longer maternal TL (β = 0.14, P = 1.99E-05) and higher paternal age (β = 0.10, P = 3.73E-03) were positively associated with newborn TL. Genome-wide association studies on newborn and maternal TLs identified 6 genetic variants in a strong linkage disequilibrium on chromosome 3q26.2 (Tag SNP-LRRC34-rs10936600: Pmeta= 5.95E-08). Mothers with higher anxiety scores, elevated fasting blood glucose, lower plasma insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 and vitamin B12 levels, and active smoking status during pregnancy showed a higher risk of giving birth to offspring with shorter TL. There were sex-related differences in the factors explaining newborn TL variation. Variation in female newborn TL was best explained by maternal TL, mental health, and plasma vitamin B12 levels, while that in male newborn TL was best explained by paternal age, maternal education, and metabolic health. Mother's TL was associated with her own metabolic health and nutrient status, which may have transgenerational effects on offspring TL.Our findings provide a comprehensive understanding of the heritable and environmental factors and their relative contributions to the initial setting of TL and programing of longevity in early life.

"35128530","Network Topology of Biological Aging and Geroscience-Guided Approaches to COVID-19.","Front Aging","Aging has emerged as the greatest and most prevalent risk factor for the development of severe COVID-19 infection and death following exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The presence of multiple co-existing chronic diseases and conditions of aging further enhances this risk. Biological aging not only enhances the risk of chronic diseases, but the presence of such conditions further accelerates varied biological processes or ""hallmarks"" implicated in aging. Given growing evidence that it is possible to slow the rate of many biological aging processes using pharmacological compounds has led to the proposal that such geroscience-guided interventions may help enhance immune resilience and improve outcomes in the face of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our review of the literature indicates that most, if not all, hallmarks of aging may contribute to the enhanced COVID-19 vulnerability seen in frail older adults. Moreover, varied biological mechanisms implicated in aging do not function in isolation from each other, and exhibit intricate effects on each other. With all of these considerations in mind, we highlight limitations of current strategies mostly focused on individual single mechanisms, and we propose an approach which is far more multidisciplinary and systems-based emphasizing network topology of biological aging and geroscience-guided approaches to COVID-19."

The folate cycle and methionine cycle are the two key modules of this network that regulate purine and thymidine synthesis, amino acid homeostasis, and epigenetic mechanisms. Intersection with the transsulfuration pathway supports glutathione production and regulation of the cellular redox state. Dietary intake of micronutrients, such as folates and amino acids, directly contributes to OCM, thereby adapting the cellular metabolic state to environmental inputs. The contribution of OCM to cellular proliferation during development and in adult proliferative tissues is well established. Nevertheless, accumulating evidence reveals the pivotal role of OCM in cellular homeostasis of non-proliferative tissues and in coordination of signaling cascades that regulate energy homeostasis and longevity. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on OCM and related pathways and discuss how this metabolic network may impact longevity and neurodegeneration across species."
"35144655","Somatic mutational profiles and germline polygenic risk scores in human cancer.","Genome Med","The mutational profile of cancer reflects the activity of the mutagenic processes which have been operative throughout the lineage of the cancer cell. These processes leave characteristic profiles of somatic mutations called mutational signatures. Mutational signatures, including single-base substitution (SBS) signatures, may reflect the effects of exogenous or endogenous exposures.We used polygenic risk scores (PRS) to summarize common germline variation associated with cancer risk and other cancer-related traits and examined the association between somatic mutational profiles and germline PRS in 12 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Somatic mutational profiles were constructed from whole-exome sequencing data of primary tumors. PRS were calculated for the 12 selected cancer types and 9 non-cancer traits, including cancer risk determinants, hormonal factors, and immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, using germline genetic data and published summary statistics from genome-wide association studies.We found 17 statistically significant associations between somatic mutational profiles and germline PRS after Bonferroni correction (p < 3.15 × 10-5), including positive associations between germline inflammatory bowel disease PRS and number of somatic mutations attributed to signature SBS1 in prostate cancer and APOBEC-related signatures in breast cancer. Positive associations were also found between age at menarche PRS and mutation counts of SBS1 in overall and estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. Consistent with prior studies that found an inverse association between the pubertal development PRS and risk of prostate cancer, likely reflecting hormone-related mechanisms, we found an inverse association between age at menarche PRS and mutation counts of SBS1 in prostate cancer. Inverse associations were also found between several cancer PRS and tumor mutation counts.Our analysis suggests that there are robust associations between tumor somatic mutational profiles and germline PRS. These may reflect the mechanisms through hormone regulation and immune responses that contribute to cancer etiology and drive cancer progression.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35122027","Chemotherapy and mismatch repair deficiency cooperate to fuel TP53 mutagenesis and ALL relapse.","Nat Cancer","Chemotherapy is a standard treatment for pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), which sometimes relapses with chemoresistant features. However, whether acquired drug-resistance mutations in relapsed ALL pre-exist or are induced by treatment remains unknown. Here we provide direct evidence of a specific mechanism by which chemotherapy induces drug-resistance-associated mutations leading to relapse. Using genomic and functional analysis of relapsed ALL we show that thiopurine treatment in mismatch repair (MMR)-deficient leukemias induces hotspot TP53 R248Q mutations through a specific mutational signature (thio-dMMR). Clonal evolution analysis reveals sequential MMR inactivation followed by TP53 mutation in some patients with ALL. Acquired TP53 R248Q mutations are associated with on-treatment relapse, poor treatment response and resistance to multiple chemotherapeutic agents, which could be reversed by pharmacological p53 reactivation. Our findings indicate that TP53 R248Q in relapsed ALL originates through synergistic mutagenesis from thiopurine treatment and MMR deficiency and suggest strategies to prevent or treat TP53-mutant relapse.© 2021.

Embryonic pluripotent cells also accumulate mutations during early development, but how this relates to the mutation burden in iPSCs remains unknown. Here, we directly compared the mutation burden of cultured iPSCs with their isogenic embryonic cells during human embryogenesis. We generated developmental lineage trees of human fetuses by phylogenetic inference from somatic mutations in the genomes of multiple stem cells, which were derived from different germ layers. Using this approach, we characterized the mutations acquired pre-gastrulation and found a rate of 1.65 mutations per cell division. When cultured in hypoxic conditions, iPSCs generated from fetal stem cells of the assessed fetuses displayed a similar mutation rate and spectrum. Our results show that iPSCs maintain a genomic integrity during culture at a similar degree as their pluripotent counterparts doin vivo.© 2022 The Authors."

Little is known concerning the activity of PD-1 antibodies in locally advanced ACSCC. This study reports on the efficacy and toxicities of a neoadjuvant PD-1 blockade combined with chemotherapy followed by concurrent immunoradiotherapy in ACSCC patients, and describes biomarkers expression and mutation signatures.In this cohort study, patients were treated as planned, including four cycles of neoadjuvant PD-1 antibody toripalimab combined with docetaxol and cisplatin, followed by radiotherapy and two cycles of concurrent toripalimab. Multiplex immunofluorescence staining (mIHC) with PD-L1, CD8, CD163, Pan-Keratin and DAPI was performed with the pretreatment tumor tissue. Whole exome sequencing was performed for the primary tumor and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The primary endpoint was the complete clinical response (cCR) rate at 3 months after overall treatment. Acute and late toxicities graded were assessed prospectively.Five female patients with a median age of 50 years old (range, 43-65 years old), finished treatment as planned. One patient had grade 3 immune related dermatitis. Two patients had grade 3 myelosuppression during neoadjuvant treatment. No severe radiation-related toxicities were noted. Four patients with PD-L1 expression >1% achieved a cCR after neoadjuvant treatment. and the other patient with negative PD-L1 expression also achieved a cCR at 3 months after radiotherapy. All the patients were alive and free from disease and had a normal quality of life, with 19.6-24 months follow up. Inconsistent expression of PD-L1 and CD163 was detected in 3 and 5 patients, respectively. TTN, POLE, MGAM2 were the top mutation frequencies, and 80 significant driver genes were identified. Pathway analysis showed enrichment of apoptosis, Rap1, Ras, and pathways in cancer signaling pathways. Eight significantly deleted regions were identified.This small cohort of locally advanced ACSCC patients had quite satisfactory cCR and sphincter preservation rate, after neoadjuvant PD-1 antibody toripalimab combined with chemotherapy followed by concurrent immunoradiotherapy, with mild acute and long-term toxicities.Copyright © 2022 Xiao, Yuan, Wang, Liao, Cai, Chen, Zhang, Wang, Zeng and Gao."

Therefore, the goal of this article is to identify two robust immune subtypes in CRC, further provide novel insights for the underlying mechanisms and clinical management. In this study, two CRC immune subtypes were identified using the consensus clustering of immune-related gene expression profiles in themeta-GEO dataset (n = 1,198), and their reproducibility was further verified in the TCGA-CRC dataset (n = 638). Subsequently, we characterized the immune escape mechanisms, gene alterations, and clinical features of two immune subtypes. Cluster 1 (C1) was defined as the ""immune cold subtype"" with immune cell depletion and deficiency, while cluster 2 (C2) was designed as the ""immune hot subtype"", with abundant immune cell infiltration and matrix activation. We also underlined the potential immune escape mechanisms: lack of MHC molecules and defective tumor antigen presentation capacity in C1, increased immunosuppressive molecules in C2. The prognosis and sensitivity to 5-FU, Cisplatin and immunotherapy differed between two subtypes. According to the two immune subtypes, we developed a prognosis associated risk score (PARS) with the accurate performance for predicting the prognosis. Additionally, two nomograms for overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were further constructed to facilitate clinical management.

Here, using whole-genome sequencing of 1,013 clonal haematopoietic colonies from 12 patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms, we identified 580,133 somatic mutations to reconstruct haematopoietic phylogenies and determine clonal histories. Driver mutations were estimated to occur early in life, including the in utero period. JAK2V617Fwas estimated to have been acquired by 33 weeks of gestation to 10.8 years of age in 5 patients in whom JAK2V617Fwas the first event. DNMT3A mutations were acquired by 8 weeks of gestation to 7.6 years of age in 4 patients, and a PPM1D mutation was acquired by 5.8 years of age. Additional genomic events occurred before or following JAK2V617Facquisition and as independent clonal expansions. Sequential driver mutation acquisition was separated by decades across life, often outcompeting ancestral clones. The mean latency between JAK2V617Facquisition and diagnosis was 30 years (range 11-54 years). Estimated historical rates of clonal expansion varied substantially (3% to 190% per year), increased with additional driver mutations, and predicted latency to diagnosis. Our study suggests that early driver mutation acquisition and life-long growth and evolution underlie adult myeloproliferative neoplasms, raising opportunities for earlier intervention and a new model for cancer development.© 2022.

Immunotherapy achieving long-lasting tumor remission in multiple cancer types has received considerable attention due to its potential to improve the treatment outcomes of patients with glioma. However, clinical trials have not yet demonstrated major improvements in prognoses, which might be attributable to the extrinsic components and intrinsic mechanisms involved in the tumor microenvironment and immune system. It is particularly noteworthy that there is emerging evidence that current routine treatment modalities and the physical and psychological characteristics of patients have different impacts on the efficacy of glioma immunotherapy.

Chronic pain is most frequently reported and at the center of patients' level of disease burden. The construct of multisomatoform disorder (MSD) allows to subsume severely impaired patients suffering from FSS, FMS and other unexplained painful conditions to be examined for common underlying processes. Altered leptin levels and a pathological response of the HPA-axis as a result of chronic stress and childhood trauma have been suggested as one of the driving factors of disease development and severity. Previous studies have demonstrated that methylation of the leptin promoter can play a regulatory role in addiction. In this study, we hypothesized that methylation of the leptin promoter is influenced by the degree of childhood traumatization and differs between patients with MSD and controls. A cohort of 151 patients with MSD and 149 matched healthy volunteers were evaluated using clinical and psychometric assessment while methylation level analysis of the leptin promoter was performed using DNA isolated from whole blood.In female controls, we found CpG C-167 to be negatively correlated with leptin levels, whereas in female patients CpG C-289, C-255, C-193, C-167 and methylation cluster (C-291 to C-167) at putative bindings sites for transcription factors Sp1 and c/EBPalpha were negatively correlated with leptin levels. Methylation levels were significantly lower in female patients CpG C-289 compared with controls. When looking at female patients with chronic widespread pain methylation levels were significantly lower at CpG C-289, C-255 and methylation cluster (C-291 to C-167).Our findings support the hypothesis that epigenetic regulation of leptin plays a role in the regulation of leptin levels in patients with MSD. This effect is more pronounced in patients with chronic widespread pain.© 2022. The Author(s)."

However, the shared genetic architecture and causality of asthma and CVDs remain unclear.Methods:Based on the genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics of recently published studies, our study examined the genetic correlation, shared genetic variants, and causal relationship between asthma (N= 127,669) and CVDs (N= 86,995-521,612). Statistical methods included high-definition likelihood (HDL), cross-trait meta-analyses of large-scale GWAS, transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS), and Mendelian randomization (MR).Results:First, we observed a significant genetic correlation between asthma and heart failure (HF) (Rg = 0.278,P= 5 × 10-4). Through cross-trait analyses, we identified a total of 145 shared loci between asthma and HF. Fifteen novel loci were not previously reported for association with either asthma or HF. Second, we mapped these 145 loci to a total of 99 genes whose expressions are enriched in a broad spectrum of tissues, including the seminal vesicle, tonsil, appendix, spleen, skin, lymph nodes, breast, cervix and uterus, skeletal muscle, small intestine, lung, prostate, cardiac muscle, and liver. TWAS analysis identified five significant genes shared between asthma and HF in tissues from the hemic and immune system, digestive system, integumentary system, and nervous system.GSDMA,GSDMB, andORMDL3are statistically independent genetic effects from all shared TWAS genes between asthma and HF. Third, through MR analysis, genetic liability to asthma was significantly associated with heart failure at the Bonferroni-corrected significance level. The odds ratio (OR) is 1.07 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.03-1.12;p= 1.31 × 10-3] per one-unit increase in logeodds of asthma.Conclusion:These findings provide strong evidence of genetic correlations and causal relationship between asthma and HF, suggesting a shared genetic architecture for these two diseases.Copyright © 2022 Zhou, Liang, Jin, Ding, Huang, Moore, Zheng and Huang."
"35100255","Meta-imputation of transcriptome from genotypes across multiple datasets by leveraging publicly available summary-level data.","PLoS Genet","Transcriptome wide association studies (TWAS) can be used as a powerful method to identify and interpret the underlying biological mechanisms behind GWAS by mapping gene expression levels with phenotypes. In TWAS, gene expression is often imputed from individual-level genotypes of regulatory variants identified from external resources, such as Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Project. In this setting, a straightforward approach to impute expression levels of a specific tissue is to use the model trained from the same tissue type. When multiple tissues are available for the same subjects, it has been demonstrated that training imputation models from multiple tissue types improves the accuracy because of shared eQTLs between the tissues and increase in effective sample size. However, existing joint-tissue methods require access of genotype and expression data across all tissues. Moreover, they cannot leverage the abundance of various expression datasets across various tissues for non-overlapping individuals. Here, we explore the optimal way to combine imputed levels across training models from multiple tissues and datasets in a flexible manner using summary-level data. Our proposed method (SWAM) combines arbitrary number of transcriptome imputation models to linearly optimize the imputation accuracy given a target tissue. By integrating models across tissues and/or individuals, SWAM can improve the accuracy of transcriptome imputation or to improve power to TWAS while only requiring individual-level data from a single reference cohort. To evaluate the accuracy of SWAM, we combined 49 tissue-specific gene expression imputation models from the GTEx Project as well as from a large eQTL study of Depression Susceptibility Genes and Networks (DGN) Project and tested imputation accuracy in GEUVADIS lymphoblastoid cell lines samples. We also extend our meta-imputation method to meta-TWAS to leverage multiple tissues in TWAS analysis with summary-level statistics. Our results capitalize on the importance of integrating multiple tissues to unravel regulatory impacts of genetic variants on complex traits."

This clinical presentation, chronic and highly disabling, is known as treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS). The causes of treatment resistance and their relationships with causes underlying schizophrenia are largely unknown. Adequately powered genetic studies of TRS are scarce because of the difficulty in collecting data from well-characterized TRS cohorts.To examine the genetic architecture of TRS through the reassessment of genetic data from schizophrenia studies and its validation in carefully ascertained clinical samples.Two case-control genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of schizophrenia were performed in which the case samples were defined as individuals with TRS (n = 10 501) and individuals with non-TRS (n = 20 325). The differences in effect sizes for allelic associations were then determined between both studies, the reasoning being such differences reflect treatment resistance instead of schizophrenia. Genotype data were retrieved from the CLOZUK and Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) schizophrenia studies. The output was validated using polygenic risk score (PRS) profiling of 2 independent schizophrenia cohorts with TRS and non-TRS: a prevalence sample with 817 individuals (Cardiff Cognition in Schizophrenia [CardiffCOGS]) and an incidence sample with 563 individuals (Genetics Workstream of the Schizophrenia Treatment Resistance and Therapeutic Advances [STRATA-G]).GWAS of treatment resistance in schizophrenia. The results of the GWAS were compared with complex polygenic traits through a genetic correlation approach and were used for PRS analysis on the independent validation cohorts using the same TRS definition.The study included a total of 85 490 participants (48 635 [56.9%] male) in its GWAS stage and 1380 participants (859 [62.2%] male) in its PRS validation stage. Treatment resistance in schizophrenia emerged as a polygenic trait with detectable heritability (1% to 4%), and several traits related to intelligence and cognition were found to be genetically correlated with it (genetic correlation, 0.41-0.69). PRS analysis in the CardiffCOGS prevalence sample showed a positive association between TRS and a history of taking clozapine (r2 = 2.03%; P = .001), which was replicated in the STRATA-G incidence sample (r2 = 1.09%; P = .04).In this GWAS, common genetic variants were differentially associated with TRS, and these associations may have been obscured through the amalgamation of large GWAS samples in previous studies of broadly defined schizophrenia. Findings of this study suggest the validity of meta-analytic approaches for studies on patient outcomes, including treatment resistance."
"35118467","Variant to function mapping at single-cell resolution through network propagation.","bioRxiv","With burgeoning human disease genetic associations and single-cell genomic atlases covering a range of tissues, there are unprecedented opportunities to systematically gain insights into the mechanisms of disease-causal variation. However, sparsity and noise, particularly in the context of single-cell epigenomic data, hamper the identification of disease- or trait-relevant cell types, states, and trajectories. To overcome these challenges, we have developed the SCAVENGE method, which maps causal variants to their relevant cellular context at single-cell resolution by employing the strategy of network propagation. We demonstrate how SCAVENGE can help identify key biological mechanisms underlying human genetic variation including enrichment of blood traits at distinct stages of human hematopoiesis, defining monocyte subsets that increase the risk for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and identifying intermediate lymphocyte developmental states that are critical for predisposition to acute leukemia. Our approach not only provides a framework for enabling variant-to-function insights at single-cell resolution, but also suggests a more general strategy for maximizing the inferences that can be made using single-cell genomic data."
"35102304","Histone acetylome-wide associations in immune cells from individuals with active Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection.","Nat Microbiol","Host cell chromatin changes are thought to play an important role in the pathogenesis of infectious diseases. Here we describe a histone acetylome-wide association study (HAWAS) of an infectious disease, on the basis of genome-wide H3K27 acetylation profiling of peripheral blood granulocytes and monocytes from persons with active Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection and healthy controls. We detected >2,000 differentially acetylated loci in either cell type in a Singapore Chinese discovery cohort (n = 46), which were validated in a subsequent multi-ethnic Singapore cohort (n = 29), as well as a longitudinal cohort from South Africa (n = 26), thus demonstrating that HAWAS can be independently corroborated. Acetylation changes were correlated with differential gene expression. Differential acetylation was enriched near potassium channel genes, including KCNJ15, which modulates apoptosis and promotes Mtb clearance in vitro. We performed histone acetylation quantitative trait locus (haQTL) analysis on the dataset and identified 69 candidate causal variants for immune phenotypes among granulocyte haQTLs and 83 among monocyte haQTLs. Our study provides proof-of-principle for HAWAS to infer mechanisms of host response to pathogens.© 2022. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited."
"35072137","Machine learning optimized polygenic scores for blood cell traits identify sex-specific trajectories and genetic correlations with disease.","Cell Genom","Genetic association studies for blood cell traits, which are key indicators of health and immune function, have identified several hundred associations and defined a complex polygenic architecture. Polygenic scores (PGSs) for blood cell traits have potential clinical utility in disease risk prediction and prevention, but designing PGS remains challenging and the optimal methods are unclear. To address this, we evaluated the relative performance of 6 methods to develop PGS for 26 blood cell traits, including a standard method of pruning and thresholding (P + T) and 5 learning methods: LDpred2, elastic net (EN), Bayesian ridge (BR), multilayer perceptron (MLP) and convolutional neural network (CNN). We evaluated these optimized PGSs on blood cell trait data from UK Biobank and INTERVAL. We find that PGSs designed using common machine learning methods EN and BR show improved prediction of blood cell traits and consistently outperform other methods. Our analyses suggest EN/BR as the top choices for PGS construction, showing improved performance for 25 blood cell traits in the external validation, with correlations with the directly measured traits increasing by 10%-23%. Ten PGSs showed significant statistical interaction with sex, and sex-specific PGS stratification showed that all of them had substantial variation in the trajectories of blood cell traits with age. Genetic correlations between the PGSs for blood cell traits and common human diseases identified well-known as well as new associations. We develop machine learning-optimized PGS for blood cell traits, demonstrate their relationships with sex, age, and disease, and make these publicly available as a resource.© 2021 The Author(s)."
"35147782","An effector index to predict target genes at GWAS loci.","Hum Genet","Drug development and biological discovery require effective strategies to map existing genetic associations to causal genes. To approach this problem, we selected 12 common diseases and quantitative traits for which highly powered genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were available. For each disease or trait, we systematically curated positive control gene sets from Mendelian forms of the disease and from targets of medicines used for disease treatment. We found that these positive control genes were highly enriched in proximity of GWAS-associated single-nucleotide variants (SNVs). We then performed quantitative assessment of the contribution of commonly used genomic features, including open chromatin maps, expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL), and chromatin conformation data. Using these features, we trained and validated an Effector Index (Ei), to map target genes for these 12 common diseases and traits. Ei demonstrated high predictive performance, both with cross-validation on the training set, and an independently derived set for type 2 diabetes. Key predictive features included coding or transcript-altering SNVs, distance to gene, and open chromatin-based metrics. This work outlines a simple, understandable approach to prioritize genes at GWAS loci for functional follow-up and drug development, and provides a systematic strategy for prioritization of GWAS target genes.© 2022.

"35134197","Natural genetic variation as a tool for discovery in Caenorhabditis nematodes.","Genetics","Over the last 20 years, studies of Caenorhabditis elegans natural diversity have demonstrated the power of quantitative genetic approaches to reveal the evolutionary, ecological, and genetic factors that shape traits. These studies complement the use of the laboratory-adapted strain N2 and enable additional discoveries not possible using only one genetic background. In this chapter, we describe how to perform quantitative genetic studies in Caenorhabditis, with an emphasis on C. elegans. These approaches use correlations between genotype and phenotype across populations of genetically diverse individuals to discover the genetic causes of phenotypic variation. We present methods that use linkage, near-isogenic lines, association, and bulk-segregant mapping, and we describe the advantages and disadvantages of each approach. The power of C. elegans quantitative genetic mapping is best shown in the ability to connect phenotypic differences to specific genes and variants. We will present methods to narrow genomic regions to candidate genes and then tests to identify the gene or variant involved in a quantitative trait. The same features that make C. elegans a preeminent experimental model animal contribute to its exceptional value as a tool to understand natural phenotypic variation.© The Author(s) 2021.

The aim of this study was to assess the moderating effect of breastfeeding duration on the relationship betweenFTOrs9939609 and BMI in a Caucasian sample.Adolescents born in 1997 and in 1999, who were living in the Swedish county Västmanland in 2012, were invited to participate in the Survey of Adolescent Life in Västmanland. The adolescents and their parents completed self-reported questionnaires in 2012, 2015, and 2018. Genotyping of rs9939609 T > A polymorphism was conducted from saliva DNA samples. Interaction effects of parental reported breastfeeding duration in months, including regions of significance, on the relationship between rs9939609 and BMI plus overweight were assessed.Considering physical activity levels, parental reported breastfeeding duration was a moderator of the relationship between rs9939609 and BMI for the younger (regions of significance = <1.6 and >28.1 months) and older adolescents (region of significance = >19.9 months), but not for the young adults. Plots of the association between breastfeeding duration and BMI showed higher BMI for AA with short breastfeeding, but lower BMI with longer breastfeeding than AT and TT. Longer breastfeeding lowered the odds for overweight among the younger adolescents, especially among AA individuals.Rs9939609 AA individuals were more susceptible than AT and TT individuals to both short and long breastfeeding durations, which is consistent with the differential susceptibility hypothesis.FTOrs9939609 AA might be a plasticity variant with differential susceptibility to environmental influences. Breastfeeding duration may be one of many factors that affect the relationship between rs9939609 and BMI.© 2021 The Authors.

To date, genomic research has focused on humans, a small number of agricultural species, and established laboratory models. Fewer than 18,000 of ∼2,000,000 eukaryotic species (<1%) have a representative genome sequence in GenBank, and only a fraction of these have ancillary information on genome structure, genetic variation, gene expression, epigenetic modifications, and population diversity. This imbalance reflects a perception that human studies are paramount in disease research. Yet understanding how genomes work, and how genetic variation shapes phenotypes, requires a broad view that embraces the vast diversity of life. We have the technology to collect massive and exquisitely detailed datasets about the world, but expertise is siloed into distinct fields. A new approach, integrating comparative genomics with cell and evolutionary biology, ecology, archaeology, anthropology, and conservation biology, is essential for understanding and protecting ourselves and our world. Here, we describe potential for scientific discovery when comparative genomics works in close collaboration with a broad range of fields as well as the technical, scientific, and social constraints that must be addressed.Copyright © 2022 the Author(s).

Severely inflamed lesions may leave permanent scars that have been associated with long-term psychosocial consequences. Here, we perform a GWAS meta-analysis comprising 20,165 individuals with acne from nine independent European ancestry cohorts. We identify 29 novel genome-wide significant loci and replicate 14 of the 17 previously identified risk loci, bringing the total number of reported acne risk loci to 46. Using fine-mapping and eQTL colocalisation approaches, we identify putative causal genes at several acne susceptibility loci that have previously been implicated in Mendelian hair and skin disorders, including pustular psoriasis. We identify shared genetic aetiology between acne, hormone levels, hormone-sensitive cancers and psychiatric traits. Finally, we show that a polygenic risk score calculated from our results explains up to 5.6% of the variance in acne liability in an independent cohort.© 2022. The Author(s)."

Larger samples and recent advances in methodology invite systematic exploration of their shared genetics.Genetic analyses leveraged summary statistics from genome-wide association studies of the largest available samples of each disorder, including subtypes of stroke (ischemic stroke, large artery stroke, small vessel stroke, and cardioembolic stroke) and migraine (with aura and without aura). For each pair of disorders, genetic correlation was assessed both on a genome-wide basis and within independent segments across the genome including known specific loci for each disorder. A cross-trait meta-analysis was used to identify novel candidate loci. Finally, potential causality of migraine susceptibility on stroke and CeAD was assessed by Mendelian randomization.Among all pairs of disorders, genome-wide genetic correlation was observed only between CeAD and migraine, particularly MO. Local genetic correlations were more extensive between migraine and CeAD than those between migraine and stroke or CeAD and stroke and revealed evidence for novel CeAD associations at rs6693567 (ADAMTSL4/ECM1), rs11187838 (PLCE1), and rs7940646 (MRVI1) while strengthening prior subthreshold evidence at rs9486725 (FHL5) and rs650724 (LRP1). At known migraine loci, novel associations with stroke had concordant risk alleles for small vessel stroke at rs191602009 (CARF) and for cardioembolic stroke at rs55884259 (NKX2-5). Known migraine loci also revealed novel associations but with opposite risk alleles for all stroke, ischemic stroke, and small vessel stroke at rs55928386 (HTRA1), for large artery stroke at rs11172113 (LRP1), and for all stroke and ischemic stroke at rs1535791 and rs4942561 (bothLRCH1), respectively. rs182923402 (nearPTCH1) was a novel concordant locus for migraine and cardioembolic stroke. Mendelian randomization supported potential causal influences of migraine on CeAD (odds ratio [95% confidence interval] per doubling migraine prevalence = 1.69 [1.24-2.3],p= 0.0009) with concordant risk, but with opposite risk on large artery stroke (0.86 [0.76-0.96],p= 0.0067).The findings emphasize shared genetic risk between migraine and CeAD while identifying loci with likely vascular function in migraine and shared but opposite genetic risk between migraine and stroke subtypes, and a central role ofLRP1in all 3 cerebrovascular disorders.Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).

Meta-analysis with Korean and Japanese population was done. The PheWAS associated 65 phenotypes with 14,101 significant variants (P < 4.92 × 10-10). Network analysis, visualization of cross-phenotype mapping, and causal inference mapping with Mendelian randomization were conducted. Among phenotype pairs from the genotype-driven cross-phenotype associations, we evaluated penetrance in correlation analysis using a clinical database. We focused on the application of PheWAS in order to make it robust and to aid the derivation of biological meaning post-PheWAS. This comprehensive analysis of PheWAS results based on a health check-up database will provide researchers and clinicians with a panoramic overview of the networks among multiple phenotypes and genetic variants, laying groundwork for the practical application of precision medicine.© 2022.

Despite progress from genomic and clinical epidemiology research, risk factors for developing severe COVID-19 are incompletely understood and identification of modifiable risk factors is desperately needed. We conducted linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSR) analysis to estimate cross-trait genetic correlation between COVID-19 severity and various polygenic phenotypes. To attenuate the genetic contribution of smoking and BMI, we further conducted sensitivity analyses by pruning genomic regions associated with smoking/BMI and repeating LDSR analyses. We identified robust positive associations between the genetic architecture of severe COVID-19 and both BMI and smoking. We observed strong positive genetic correlation (rg) with diabetes (rg = 0.25) and shortness of breath walking on level ground (rg = 0.28) and novel protective associations with vitamin E (rg = - 0.53), calcium (rg = - 0.33), retinol (rg = - 0.59), Apolipoprotein A (rg = - 0.13), and HDL (rg = - 0.17), but no association with vitamin D (rg = - 0.02). Removing genomic regions associated with smoking and BMI generally attenuated the associations, but the associations with nutrient biomarkers persisted. This study provides a comprehensive assessment of the shared genetic architecture of COVID-19 severity and numerous clinical/physiologic parameters.

We identify 41 variants at 33 loci. The most significant association (ORIDD = 0.92, P = 1.6 × 10-39; ORdorsalgia = 0.92, P = 7.2 × 10-15) is with a 3'UTR variant (rs1871452-T) in CHST3, encoding a sulfotransferase enzyme expressed in intervertebral discs. The largest effects on IDD are conferred by rare (MAF = 0.07 - 0.32%) loss-of-function (LoF) variants in SLC13A1, encoding a sodium-sulfate co-transporter (LoF burden OR = 1.44, P = 3.1 × 10-11); variants that also associate with reduced serum sulfate.

We performed the first feline genome-wide association study (GWAS) of quantitative traits systolic BP and creatinine and binary outcomes HTN and CKD, testing 1022 domestic cats with a discovery, replication and meta-analysis design. No variants reached experimental significance level in the discovery stage for any phenotype. Follow up of the top 9 variants for creatinine and 5 for systolic BP, one SNP reached experimental-wide significance for association with creatinine in the combined meta-analysis (chrD1.10258177; P = 1.34 × 10-6). Exploratory genetic risk score (GRS) analyses were performed. Within the discovery sample, GRS of top SNPs from the BP and creatinine GWAS show strong association with HTN and CKD but did not validate in independent replication samples. A GRS including SNPs corresponding to human CKD genes was not significant in an independent subset of cats. Gene-set enrichment and pathway-based analysis (GSEA) was performed for both quantitative phenotypes, with 30 enriched pathways with creatinine. Our results support the utility of GWASs and GSEA for genetic discovery of complex traits in cats, with the caveat of our findings requiring validation.© 2022. The Author(s)."

Although genetic susceptibility has been found to be critical for the phenotype of GO, the associated risk alleles in a single gene are generally insufficient to cause the disease. Accruing evidence has shown that epigenetic disorders can act as the potentially missing link between genetic risk and clinically significant disease development. Abnormal epigenetic modifications can lead to pro-inflammatory cascades and activation of orbital fibroblasts (OFs) by promoting the various inflammatory response pathways and regulating the diverse signaling molecules that are involved in the fibrogenesis and adipogenesis, thereby leading to the significant expansion of orbital tissues, fibrosis and inflammation infiltration. Additionally, emerging evidence has shown that the gut microbiome can possibly drive the pathogenesis of GO by influencing the secretion of Thyrotropin receptor antibody (TRAb) and T-helper 17 (Th17)/regulatory T cells (Treg) imbalance. This paper describes the latest epigenetic research evidence and progress made in comprehending the mechanisms of GO development, such as DNA methylation, histone modification, non-coding RNAs, and the gut microbiome.Copyright © 2022 Wang, Ma, Wang, Sun, Wang, Li, Liu and Yu."

Noninvasive methods using 5-hydroxymethylation of cytosine (5hmC) modifications and fragmentation profiles from 5hmC cell-free DNA (cfDNA) sequencing provide an opportunity for lung cancer detection and management.A total of 157 lung cancer patients were recruited to generate the largest lung cancer cfDNA 5hmC dataset, which mainly consisted of 62 lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), 48 lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) and 25 small cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients, with most patients (131, 83.44%) at advanced tumor stages. A 37-feature 5hmC model was constructed and validated to distinguish lung cancer patients from healthy controls, with areas under the curve (AUCs) of 0.8938 and 0.8476 (sensitivity = 87.50% and 72.73%, specificity = 83.87% and 80.60%) in two distinct validation sets. Furthermore, fragment profiles of cfDNA 5hmC datasets were first explored to develop a 48-feature fragmentation model with good performance (AUC = 0.9257 and 0.822, sensitivity = 87.50% and 78.79%, specificity = 80.65% and 76.12%) in the two validation sets. Another diagnostic model integrating 5hmC signals and fragment profiles improved AUC to 0.9432 and 0.8639 (sensitivity = 87.50% and 83.33%, specificity = 90.30% and 77.61%) in the two validation sets, better than models based on either of them alone and performing well in different stages and lung cancer subtypes. Several 5hmC markers were found to be associated with overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) based on gene expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).Both the 5hmC signal and fragmentation profiles in 5hmC cfDNA data are sensitive and effective in lung cancer detection and could be incorporated into the diagnostic model to achieve good performance, promoting research focused on clinical diagnostic models based on cfDNA 5hmC data.© 2022.

However, recent studies suggested that MEKi might cause irreversible defects that compromise the developmental potential of mESCs. Here, we demonstrated the deficient bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signal in the chemically defined condition is one of the main causes for the impaired pluripotency. Mechanistically, activating the BMP signal pathway by BMP4 could safeguard the chromosomal integrity and proliferation capacity of mESCs through regulating downstream targets Ube2s and Chmp4b. More importantly, BMP4 promotes a distinct in vivo developmental potential and a long-term pluripotency preservation. Besides, the pluripotent improvements driven by BMP4 are superior to those by attenuating MEK suppression. Taken together, our study shows appropriate activation of BMP signal is essential for regulating functional pluripotency and reveals that BMP4 should be applied in the serum-free culture system.© 2022.

"35128436","Human artificial oocytes from patients' somatic cells: past, present and future.","Reprod Fertil","The first attempts at generating functional human oocytes by using the transfer of patients' somatic cell nuclei, as DNA source, into donor enucleated oocytes date back to the early 2000s. After initial attempts, that gave rather encouraging results, the technique was abandoned because of adverse results with this technique in the mouse model. Priority was then given to the use of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, based on excellent results in the mouse, where mature oocytes and live healthy offspring were achieved. However, these results could not be reproduced in humans, and oogenesis with human iPS cells did not continue beyond the stage of oogonium. These data suggest that the use of enucleated donor oocytes will be necessary to achieve fertilizable human oocytes with somatic cell-derived DNA. The main problem of all these techniques is that they have to meet with two, sometimes contradictory, requirements: the haploidization of somatic cell-derived DNA, on the one hand, and the remodeling/reprogramming of DNA of somatic cell origin, so as to be capable of supporting all stages of preimplantation and postimplantation development and to give rise to all cell types of the future organism. Further research is needed to determine the optimal strategy to cope with these two requirements.The recourse to artificial oocytes, generated by using the patient's own DNA derived from cells of somatic origin, represents the ultimate opportunity for women who lack healthy oocytes of their own but yearn for genetically related offspring. Many different pathologies, such as ovarian cancer, premature ovarian failure, other ovarian diseases and natural, age-related ovarian decay can cause the absence of available oocytes. The demand for artificial oocytes is increasing continuously, mainly because of the tendency to postpone maternity to still more advanced ages, when the quantity and quality of oocytes is low. This minireview focuses on the generation of artificial oocytes using different strategies and scenarios, based on the accumulated experience in humans and experimental animals.© 2021 The authors."

Although many results have been obtained from animal studies, particularly mouse research, the results cannot be fully applied to humans due to species differences in physiology and pathology. However, due to ethical and material limitations, the direct study of human gametes and embryos is very difficult. The emergence and rapid development of organoids allow the construction of organoid systems that simulate gametogenesis and embryogenesisin vitro, and many studies have successfully established organoid systems for some parts of or even the entire processes of gametogenesis and embryogenesis. These studies typically start with the establishment of mouse models and then modify these models to obtain human organoid models. These organoid models can be used to obtain a better understanding of the signaling pathways, molecular mechanisms, genetics, and epigenetic changes involved in gametogenesis and embryogenesis and could also be applied to clinical applications, such as drug screening.

"35075135","Human reproduction is regulated by retrotransposons derived from ancient Hominidae-specific viral infections.","Nat Commun","Germ cells are essential to pass DNA from one generation to the next. In human reproduction, germ cell development begins with the specification of primordial germ cells (PGCs) and a failure to specify PGCs leads to human infertility. Recent studies have revealed that the transcription factor network required for PGC specification has diverged in mammals, and this has a significant impact on our understanding of human reproduction. Here, we reveal that the Hominidae-specific Transposable Elements (TEs) LTR5Hs, may serve as TEENhancers (TE Embedded eNhancers) to facilitate PGC specification. LTR5Hs TEENhancers become transcriptionally active during PGC specification both in vivo and in vitro with epigenetic reprogramming leading to increased chromatin accessibility, localized DNA demethylation, enrichment of H3K27ac, and occupation of key hPGC transcription factors. Inactivation of LTR5Hs TEENhancers with KRAB mediated CRISPRi has a significant impact on germ cell specification. In summary, our data reveals the essential role of Hominidae-specific LTR5Hs TEENhancers in human germ cell development.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35145108","A mammalian methylation array for profiling methylation levels at conserved sequences.","Nat Commun","Infinium methylation arrays are not available for the vast majority of non-human mammals. Moreover, even if species-specific arrays were available, probe differences between them would confound cross-species comparisons. To address these challenges, we developed the mammalian methylation array, a single custom array that measures up to 36k CpGs per species that are well conserved across many mammalian species. We designed a set of probes that can tolerate specific cross-species mutations. We annotate the array in over 200 species and report CpG island status and chromatin states in select species. Calibration experiments demonstrate the high fidelity in humans, rats, and mice. The mammalian methylation array has several strengths: it applies to all mammalian species even those that have not yet been sequenced, it provides deep coverage of conserved cytosines facilitating the development of epigenetic biomarkers, and it increases the probability that biological insights gained in one species will translate to others.© 2022.

However, conflicting and heterogeneous findings reported in the existing literature make it difficult to draw reliable conclusions. In addition, there is still room to further investigate on more sociodemographic features that include socioeconomic status, cultural differences and procrastination education. To this end, we performed quantitative sociodemographic meta-analyses (k= 193, totaln= 106,764) to fill this gap. It was found that the general tendency and academic procrastination tendency of males were stronger than females (r= 0.04, 95% CI: 0.02-0.05). No significant effects of differences in socioeconomic status (i.e., poor or rich), multiculturalism (i.e., Han nation or minorities), nationality (i.e., China or other countries), family size (i.e., one child or > 1 child), and educational background (i.e., science or arts/literature) were found to affect procrastination tendencies. Furthermore, it was noteworthy that the gender differences in procrastination tendencies were prominently moderated by measurements, which has a greater effect on the Aitken Procrastination Inventory (API) (r= 0.035, 95% CI: -0.01-0.08) than on the General Procrastination Scale (GPS) (r= 0.018, 95% CI: -0.01-0.05). In conclusion, this study provides robust evidence that males tended to procrastinate more than females in general and academic profiles, and further indicates that procrastination tendencies do not vary based on sociodemographic situations, including socioeconomic status, multiculturalism, nationality, family size, and educational background.Copyright © 2022 Lu, He and Tan."

"35110662","Allele-specific transcription factor binding in a cellular model of orofacial clefting.","Sci Rep","Non-syndromic cleft lip with/without cleft palate (nsCL/P) is a frequent congenital malformation with multifactorial etiology. While recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several nsCL/P risk loci, the functional effects of the associated non-coding variants are largely unknown. Furthermore, additional risk loci remain undetected due to lack of power. As genetic variants might alter binding of transcription factors (TF), we here hypothesized that the integration of data from TF binding sites, expression analyses and nsCL/P GWAS might help to (i) identify functionally relevant variants at GWAS loci, and (ii) highlight novel risk variants that have been previously undetected. Analysing the craniofacial TF TFAP2A in human embryonic palatal mesenchyme (HEPM) cells, we identified 2845 TFAP2A ChIP-seq peaks, several of which were located near nsCL/P candidate genes (e.g. MSX1 and SPRY2). Comparison with independent data suggest that 802 of them might be specific to craniofacial development, and genes near these peaks are enriched in processes relevant to nsCL/P. Integration with nsCL/P GWAS data, however, did not show robust evidence for co-localization of common nsCL/P risk variants with TFAP2A ChIP-seq peaks. This data set represents a new resource for the analyses of craniofacial processes, and similar approaches with additional cell lines and TFs could be applied to generate further insights into nsCL/P etiology.© 2022.

In the present study, we investigated the bioactivities of squalene (SQ) derived from ethanol extract (99.5%) of a microalgaeAurantiochytriumSp. (EEA-SQ) in hAECs using whole-genome DNA microarray analysis. Tissue enrichment analysis showed that the brain was the most significantly enriched tissue by the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between EEA-SQ-treated and control hAECs. Further gene set enrichment analysis and tissue-specific functional analysis revealed biological functions related to nervous system development, neurogenesis, and neurotransmitter modulation. Several adipose tissue-specific genes and functions were also enriched. Gene-disease association analysis showed nervous system-, metabolic-, and immune-related diseases were enriched. Altogether, our study suggests the potential health benefits of microalgae-derived SQ and we would further encourage investigation in EEA-SQ and its derivatives as potential therapeutics for nervous system- and metabolism-related diseases."
"35135592","H3K27ac chromatin acetylation and gene expression analysis reveal sex- and situs-related differences in developing chicken gonads.","Biol Sex Differ","Birds exhibit a unique asymmetry in terms of gonad development. The female left gonad generates a functional ovary, whereas the right gonad regresses. In males, both left and right gonads would develop into testes. How is this left/right asymmetry established only in females but not in males remains unknown. The epigenetic regulation of gonadal developmental genes may contribute to this sex disparity. The modification of histone tails such as H3K27ac is tightly coupled to chromatin activation and gene expression. To explore whether H3K27ac marked chromatin activation is involved in the asymmetric development of avian gonads, we probed genome-wide H3K27ac occupancy in left and right gonads from both sexes and related chromatin activity profile to the expression of gonadal genes. Furthermore, we validated the effect of chromatin activity on asymmetric gonadal development by manipulating the chromatin histone acetylation levels.The undifferentiated gonads from both sides of each sex were collected and subjected to RNA-Seq and H3K27ac ChIP-Seq experiments. Integrated analysis of gene expression and active chromatin regions were performed to identify the sex- and situs-specific regulation and expression of gonadal genes. The histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) was applied to the undifferentiated female right gonads to assess the effect of chromatin activation on gonadal gene expression and cell proliferation.Even before sex differentiation, the gonads already show divergent gene expression between different sexes and between left/right sides in females. The sex-specific H3K27ac chromatin distributions coincide with the higher expression of male/female specification genes in each sex. Unexpectedly, the H3K27ac marked chromatin activation show a dramatic difference between left and right gonads in both sexes, although the left/right asymmetric gonadal development was observed only in females but not in males. In females, the side-specific H3K27ac occupancy instructs the differential expression of developmental genes between the pair of gonads and contributes to the development of left but not right gonad. However, in males, the left/right discrepancy of H3K27ac chromatin distribution does not drive the side-biased gene expression or gonad development. The TSA-induced retention of chromatin acetylation causes up-regulation of ovarian developmental genes and increases cell proliferation in the female right gonad.We revealed that left/right asymmetry in H3K27ac marked chromatin activation exists in both sexes, but this discrepancy gives rise to asymmetric gonadal development only in females. Other mechanisms overriding the chromatin activation would control the symmetric development of male gonads in chicken.© 2022. The Author(s)."

In this study, we characterized the spatiotemporal landscape of putative enhancers and promoters and their target genes by combining H3K27ac-targeted ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq in fetal (prenatal days 74-75) and adult (postnatal days 132-150) tissues (brain, liver, heart, muscle and small intestine) sampled from Asian aboriginal Bama Xiang and European highly selected Large White pigs of both sexes. We identified 101,290 H3K27ac peaks, marking 18,521 promoters and 82,769 enhancers, including peaks that were active across all tissues and developmental stages (which could indicate safe harbor locus for exogenous gene insertion) and tissue- and developmental stage-specific peaks (which regulate gene pathways matching tissue- and developmental stage-specific physiological functions). We found that H3K27ac and DNA methylation in the promoter region of the XIST gene may be involved in X chromosome inactivation and demonstrated the utility of the present resource for revealing the regulatory patterns of known causal genes and prioritizing candidate causal variants for complex traits in pigs. In addition, we identified an average of 1,124 super-enhancers per sample and found that they were more likely to show tissue-specific activity than ordinary peaks.

Regular consumption of nuts may improve some BP in adults whereas evidence in children is relatively lacking. This study aimed to determine the efficacy of nuts intake on BP in children.Stratified cluster sampling was performed to include a total of 15,268 primary school children aged 6-12 years in urban and rural areas in Southwest China. The daily nuts intake dosage was collected by questionnaires, and generalized linear model (GLM) and logistic regression were used to analyze the relationship between nuts intake and BP.For the total subjects, 11,130 (72.9%) participants consumed <35 g/day of nuts, 1,145 (7.5%) participants consumed 35 g/day ≤ nut <50 g/day of nuts, 2,053 (13.4%) participants consumed 50~100 g/day of nuts, and 940 (6.2%) participants consumed over 100 g/day of nut. For sex subgroup, 1,074 (13.53%) boys and 979 (13.35%) girls consumed 50~100 g/day of nuts. Compared with the 50~100 g/day of nuts intake group, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were significantly different in <35 g/day, 35g/day ≤ nut <50 g/day, and >100 g/day nuts intake groups (allp< 0.001). The logistic regression showed that compared with the 50~100 g/day group, the other three groups are more likely associated with childhood hypertension (allp< 0.001). Therefore, a U-shaped relationship between nuts intake and BP level was identified.The finding suggests that intake of 50~100 g/day nuts is the recommended dose of nuts intake to control childhood hypertension, as well as for cardioprotection purposes.Copyright © 2022 Feng, Bi, Tang, Zhang, Tong, Peng, Tian and Liang."

"35076500","Epigenetics of Mitochondria-Associated Genes in Striated Muscle.","Epigenomes","Striated muscle has especially large energy demands. We identified 97 genes preferentially expressed in skeletal muscle and heart, but not in aorta, and found significant enrichment for mitochondrial associations among them. We compared the epigenomic and transcriptomic profiles of the 27 genes associated with striated muscle and mitochondria. Many showed strong correlations between their tissue-specific transcription levels, and their tissue-specific promoter, enhancer, or open chromatin as well as their DNA hypomethylation. Their striated muscle-specific enhancer chromatin was inside, upstream, or downstream of the gene, throughout much of the gene as a super-enhancer (CKMT2,SLC25A4, andACO2), or even overlapping a neighboring gene (COX6A2,COX7A1, andCOQ10A). Surprisingly, the 3' end of the 1.38 MbPRKN(PARK2) gene (involved in mitophagy and linked to juvenile Parkinson's disease) displayed skeletal muscle/myoblast-specific enhancer chromatin, a myoblast-specific antisense RNA, as well as brain-specific enhancer chromatin. We also found novel tissue-specific RNAs in brain and embryonic stem cells withinPPARGC1A(PGC-1α), which encodes a master transcriptional coregulator for mitochondrial formation and metabolism. The tissue specificity of this gene's four alternative promoters, including a muscle-associated promoter, correlated with nearby enhancer chromatin and open chromatin. Our in-depth epigenetic examination of these genes revealed previously undescribed tissue-specific enhancer chromatin, intragenic promoters, regions of DNA hypomethylation, and intragenic noncoding RNAs that give new insights into transcription control for this medically important set of genes."

We further establish a novel targeted trans-QTL approach based on polygenic risk scores to determine candidates for AF core genes. Using this approach, we identify two trans-eQTLs and five trans-pQTLs for AF GWAS hits, and elucidate the role of the transcription factor NKX2-5 as a link between the GWAS SNP rs9481842 and AF.

However, few studies have investigated the genetic basis of verbal memory in a neurodevelopmental context, and most genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have been conducted in European-ancestry populations. We conducted a GWAS on verbal memory in a maximum of 11,017 participants aged 8.9 to 11.1 years in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study®, recruited from a diverse population in the United States. Verbal memory was assessed by the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test, which included three measures of verbal memory: immediate recall, short-delay recall, and long-delay recall. We adopted a mixed-model approach to perform a joint GWAS of all participants, adjusting for ancestral background and familial relatedness. The inclusion of participants from all ancestries increased the power of the GWAS. Two novel genome-wide significant associations were found for short-delay and long-delay recall verbal memory. In particular, one locus (rs9896243) associated with long-delay recall was mapped to the NSF (N-Ethylmaleimide Sensitive Factor, Vesicle Fusing ATPase) gene, indicating the role of membrane fusion in adolescent verbal memory. Based on the GWAS in the European subset, we estimated the SNP-heritability to be 15% to 29% for the three verbal memory traits. We found that verbal memory was genetically correlated with schizophrenia, providing further evidence supporting verbal memory as an endophenotype for psychosis."

Applying an assay for profiling the transcriptional activity and the chromosomal locations of individual proviruses, we describe a global genomic and epigenetic map of transcriptionally active and silent proviral species and evaluate their longitudinal evolution in persons receiving suppressive ART. Using genome-wide epigenetic reference data, we show that proviral transcriptional activity is associated with activating epigenetic chromatin features in linear proximity of integration sites and in their inter- and intrachromosomal contact regions. Transcriptionally active proviruses were actively selected against during prolonged ART; however, this pattern was violated by large clones of virally infected cells that may outcompete negative selection forces through elevated intrinsic proliferative activity. Our results suggest that transcriptionally active proviruses are dynamically evolving under selection pressure by host factors.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

The correlation coefficient (r) meta-analyses of 7,084 individuals were firstly implemented to select five genes (ELOVL2,C1orf132,TRIM59,FHL2, andKLF14) from a candidate set of nine age-associated DNAm biomarkers. The DNAm-based profiles of the CHS cohort (240 blood samples differing in age from 1 to 81 years) were generated by the bisulfite targeted amplicon pyrosequencing (BTA-pseq) from 34 cytosine-phosphate-guanine sites (CpGs) of five selected genes, revealing that the methylation levels at different CpGs exhibit population specificity. Furthermore, we established and evaluated four chronological age prediction models using distinct ML algorithms: stepwise regression (SR), support vector regression (SVR-eps and SVR-nu), and random forest regression (RFR). The median absolute deviation (MAD) values increased with chronological age, especially in the 61-81 age category. No apparent gender effect was found in different ML models of the CHS cohort (allp> 0.05). TheMADvalues were 2.97, 2.22, 2.19, and 1.29 years for SR, SVR-eps, SVR-nu, and RFR in the CHS cohort, respectively. Eventually, compared to theMADrange of the meta cohort (2.53-5.07 years), a promising RFR model (ntree= 500 andmtry= 8) was optimized with anMADof 1.15 years in the 1-60 age categories of the CHS cohort, which could be regarded as a robust epigenetic clock in blood for age-related issues.Copyright © 2022 Fan, Xie, Zhang, Wang, Chen and Qiu."

Although differential expression of cyclin-dependent kinase-like 2 (CDKL2) has been reported to be associated with tumor progression in other cancers, its prognostic value, and potential mechanism in patients with ccRCC still remain unknown.Methods:Gene expression analysis was conducted using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Gene Expression Omnibus, and International Cancer Genome Consortium databases. Further, clinicopathologic analysis; Kaplan-Meier survival analysis; weighted gene co-expression network analysis; gene set enrichment analysis; gene ontology enrichment; methylation; and immune infiltration analyses were performed using TCGA-kidney renal clear cell carcinoma profiles. CDKL2 translational levels were analyzed using The Human Protein Atlas database.Results:CDKL2expression was decreased in ccRCC samples retrieved from the four databases. Gender, survival status, histologic grade, clinical stage, TNM classification, and tumor status were closely related toCDKL2expression. In addition,CDKL2downregulation was an independent prognostic factor for poor prognosis in multivariate analysis. Enrichment analyses using multiple tests revealed thatCDKL2is not just closely related to immune response but this association is highly correlated as well. Further, we found thatCDKL2expression was significantly correlated with the infiltration levels of T cell CD4 memory resting; monocytes; macrophages M0, M1, and M2; dendritic cells resting; mast cells resting; plasma cells; T cell CD8; and T cell regulatory.Conclusion:This is the first report to study the expression ofCDKL2in ccRCC, wherein we suggest that decreasedCDKL2expression is closely correlated with poor prognosis in ccRCC.

The triggers for the irreversible renal function deterioration are multifactorial, and diabetes mellitus serves as a major contributor to the development of CKD, namely diabetic kidney disease (DKD). Recently, epigenetic dysregulation emerged as a pivotal player steering the progression of DKD, partly resulting from hyperglycemia-associated metabolic disturbances, rising oxidative stress, and/or uncontrolled inflammation. In this review, we describe the major epigenetic molecular mechanisms, followed by summarizing current understandings of the epigenetic alterations pertaining to DKD.

Decreased ITGA2 promoter methylation is implicated as a driver of increased gene expression in aggressive prostate and pancreatic tumours, however the contribution of altered methylation to ITGA2 expression changes in breast tumours has not been examined.ITGA2 gene methylation and gene expression was examined in publicly available breast cancer datasets, and ITGA2 promoter methylation was mapped by targeted bisulphite sequencing analysis in breast tumour cell lines. The expression of a putative regulatory long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) was examined by qPCR and its' functionality was investigated using gene knockdown (antisense oligonucleotides) and over expression in breast cancer cell lines.In breast tumours and breast cancer cell lines the ITGA2 promoter is largely unmethylated, with gene expression variable in tumour subtypes, irrespective of promoter methylation. A novel lncRNA (AC025180.1;ENSG00000249899), named herein I2ALR, was identified at the ITGA2 gene locus, and was variably expressed in breast tumours and breast cancer cell subtypes. I2LAR knockdown resulted in upregulation of ITGA2 gene expression, whilst over-expression of I2ALR resulted in downregulation of ITGA2 mRNA. Further, examination of two downstream targets of ITGA2 associated with breast tumor stemness and metastasis (CCND1 and ACLY), revealed concomitant gene expression changes in response to I2ALR modulation.I2ALR represents a novel regulatory molecule targeting ITGA2 expression in breast tumours; a finding of significant and topical interest to the development of therapeutics targeting this integrin.© 2021.

Two robust, study-wide significant (P < 1.89 × 10-10) signals near the LCT and ABO genes were found to be associated with multiple microbial taxa and pathways and were replicated in two independent cohorts. The LCT locus associations seemed modulated by lactose intake, whereas those at ABO could be explained by participant secretor status determined by their FUT2 genotype. Twenty-two other loci showed suggestive evidence (P < 5 × 10-8) of association with microbial taxa and pathways.

Previously, studies on the relationship between ageing and DNA methylation have assumed a linear relationship. Here, we show that several markers show a non-linear behaviour. In particular, we observe a tendency for saturation with age, especially in the cerebellum. Further, we show that the relationships between significant methylation changes and ageing are different in different tissues. We suggest a straightforward method of assessing all methylation-age relationships and cluster them according to their relative fold change. Our fold change selection outperforms the most common epigenetic clocks in predicting age for the cerebellum, but not for Blood or the Frontal Cortex. Further, we find that the saturation of methylation observed at older ages for the cerebellum explains why epigenetic clocks consistently underestimate the age there. The findings imply that assuming linear correlations might cause biologically important markers to be missed.© The Author(s) 2022.

The study sample included 153 people from the Ukrainian population with the age from 0 to 101. Both models showed a high correlation with the chronological age in our study sample (R2= 0.85 for the 2 CpG model and R2= 0.92 for the 4 CpG model). We also estimated the accuracy metrics of the age prediction in our study sample. For the age group from 18 to 80 MAD was 5.1 years for the 2 CpG model and 4.1 years for the 4 CpG model.

"35101027","Exploring the causal effect of maternal pregnancy adiposity on offspring adiposity: Mendelian randomisation using polygenic risk scores.","BMC Med","Greater maternal adiposity before or during pregnancy is associated with greater offspring adiposity throughout childhood, but the extent to which this is due to causal intrauterine or periconceptional mechanisms remains unclear. Here, we use Mendelian randomisation (MR) with polygenic risk scores (PRS) to investigate whether associations between maternal pre-/early pregnancy body mass index (BMI) and offspring adiposity from birth to adolescence are causal.We undertook confounder adjusted multivariable (MV) regression and MR using mother-offspring pairs from two UK cohorts: Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) and Born in Bradford (BiB). In ALSPAC and BiB, the outcomes were birthweight (BW; N = 9339) and BMI at age 1 and 4 years (N = 8659 to 7575). In ALSPAC only we investigated BMI at 10 and 15 years (N = 4476 to 4112) and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) determined fat mass index (FMI) from age 10-18 years (N = 2659 to 3855). We compared MR results from several PRS, calculated from maternal non-transmitted alleles at between 29 and 80,939 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).MV and MR consistently showed a positive association between maternal BMI and BW, supporting a moderate causal effect. For adiposity at most older ages, although MV estimates indicated a strong positive association, MR estimates did not support a causal effect. For the PRS with few SNPs, MR estimates were statistically consistent with the null, but had wide confidence intervals so were often also statistically consistent with the MV estimates. In contrast, the largest PRS yielded MR estimates with narrower confidence intervals, providing strong evidence that the true causal effect on adolescent adiposity is smaller than the MV estimates (Pdifference= 0.001 for 15-year BMI). This suggests that the MV estimates are affected by residual confounding, therefore do not provide an accurate indication of the causal effect size.Our results suggest that higher maternal pre-/early-pregnancy BMI is not a key driver of higher adiposity in the next generation. Thus, they support interventions that target the whole population for reducing overweight and obesity, rather than a specific focus on women of reproductive age.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35040968","Analysis of Neurodevelopmental Disorders in Offspring of Mothers With Eating Disorders in Sweden.","JAMA Netw Open","Despite indices of impaired neurodevelopment in children of mothers with eating disorders, it remains unclear whether these children are at increased risk of developing neuropsychiatric diseases.To evaluate the association between maternal eating disorders, whether preexisting or ongoing during pregnancy, and offspring neuropsychiatric disease risk.This population-based prospective cohort study used the Swedish Medical Birth Registry and identified singleton births registered between from January 1, 1990, and December 31, 2012. Children of exposed mothers with eating disorders were matched with comparator children of mothers without diagnoses of eating disorders. To adjust for unmeasured shared familial factors, a cluster of exposed children with full maternal cousin comparators was identified. Follow-up was completed on December 31, 2017. Data were analyzed from August 31, 2020, to April 30, 2021.Maternal eating disorder diagnosis.All children were followed up from 1 year of age for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and from 3 years of age for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The relative risk of ASD and ADHD was assessed among exposed children, stratified by eating disorder subtype and ongoing vs previous disease, adjusted for potential confounders, including parental socioeconomic status and comorbidities.Among the 52 878 children included in the analysis, maternal eating disorder exposure (n = 8813) was associated with an increased risk of ADHD (hazard ratio [HR] for anorexia nervosa, 1.42 [95% CI, 1.23-1.63]; HR for bulimia nervosa, 1.91 [95% CI, 1.43-2.54]; and HR for unspecified eating disorder, 2.00 [95% CI, 1.72-2.32]) and ASD (HR for anorexia nervosa, 2.04 [95% CI, 1.58-2.63]; HR for bulimia nervosa, 2.70 [95% CI, 1.68-4.32]; and HR for unspecified eating disorder, 1.95 [95% CI, 1.49-2.54]). After adjustment for parental confounders, the risk of ADHD remained significantly increased, whereas the risk of ASD in children to mothers with bulimia nervosa was no longer significant. Ongoing anorexia nervosa was associated with a significantly higher risk of ADHD (HR, 2.52 [95% CI, 1.86-3.42]) and ASD (HR, 3.98 [95% CI, 2.49-6.27]) compared with previous disease (HRs, 1.26 [95% CI, 1.06-1.48] and 1.81 [95% CI, 1.38-2.38], respectively). Results based on the family cluster were similar to those of the main analysis for maternal exposure to anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa.These findings suggest that children born to mothers with eating disorders, in particular disorders that were active during pregnancy, were at increased risk of developing ADHD and ASD. The association could not be fully explained by parental psychiatric comorbidities, and among children of mothers with anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, it could not be explained by unmeasured familial confounding."

However, molecular mechanisms affecting cutaneous neurons are largely uncharacterized. Therefore, we reanalyzed a psoriatic RNA sequencing dataset from published transcriptome experiments of nearly 300 individuals. Using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software, we associated several hundreds of differentially expressed transcripts (DETs) to nervous system development and functions. Since neuronal projections were previously reported to be affected in psoriasis, we performed an in-depth analysis of neurite formation-related process. Ourin silicoanalysis suggests that SEMA-PLXN and ROBO-DCC-UNC5 regulating axonal growth and repulsion are differentially affected in non-lesional and lesional skin samples. We identified opposing expressional alterations in secreted ligands for axonal guidance signaling (RTN4/NOGOA, NTNs, SEMAs, SLITs) and non-conventional axon guidance regulating ligands, including WNT5A and their receptors, modulating axon formation. These differences in neuritogenesis may explain the abnormal cutaneous nerve filament formation described in psoriatic skin. The processes also influence T-cell activation and infiltration, thus highlighting an additional angle of the crosstalk between the cutaneous nervous system and the immune responses in psoriasis pathogenesis, in addition to the known neurogenic pro-inflammatory mediators."

However, there are very few data on histone acetylation in primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS). We aimed to investigate whether there was abnormal histones acetylation in patients with pSS.We investigated the expressions of histone acetyltransferase (HAT) genes (p300, CREBBP and PCAF) by real-time PCR in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of pSS patients. HAT activity and histone H3/H4 acetylation activity were measured by activity kit, and histone H3/H4 acetylation was verified by Western blot (WB). Spearman test was utilized to analyze the association between HAT activity levels and clinical parameters of pSS patients.The mRNA expressions of p300, CREBBP and PCAF in PBMCs from pSS patients were decreased in comparison with healthy controls (P < 0.05). HAT activity and histone H3/H4 acetylation were reduced in PBMCs from pSS patients (P < 0.05). We found that HAT activity was negatively correlated with CRP (P = 0.040) and TNF-α (P = 0.012), and was positively correlated with C4 (P = 0.041).Histone hypoacetylation is observed in patients with pSS and is involved in the pathogenesis of pSS.• The mRNA expressions of p300, CREBBP and PCAF in PBMCs from pSS patients were decreased in comparison with HCs. • HAT activity and histone H3/H4 acetylation were reduced in PBMCs from pSS patients. • HAT activity was correlated with disease characters. • We show for the first time that the histone hypoacetylation may be involved in the pathogenesis of pSS.© 2021.

Although genetics is a strong risk factor of asthma, external and internal exposures and their interactions with genetic factors also play important roles in the pathophysiology of asthma. Over the past decades, the application of high-throughput omics approaches has emerged and been applied to the field of asthma research for screening biomarkers such as genes, transcript, proteins, and metabolites in an unbiased fashion. Leveraging large-scale studies representative of diverse population-based omics data and integrating with clinical data has led to better profiling of asthma risk. Yet, to date, no omic-driven endotypes have been translated into clinical practice and management of asthma. In this article, we provide an overview of the current status of omics studies of asthma, namely, genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, proteomics, exposomics, and metabolomics. The current development of the multi-omics integrations of asthma is also briefly discussed. Biomarker discovery following multi-omics profiling could be challenging but useful for better disease phenotyping and endotyping that can translate into advances in asthma management and clinical care, ultimately leading to successful precision medicine approaches."

To determine whether increased maternal fructose intake could have long-term consequences on offspring health, we investigated the effects of 10%w/vfructose water intake during preconception and pregnancy in guinea pigs. Female Dunkin Hartley guinea pigs were fed a control diet (CD) or fructose diet (FD; providing 16% of total daily caloric intake) ad libitum 60 days prior to mating and throughout gestation. Dietary interventions ceased at day of delivery. Offspring were culled at day 21 (D21) (weaning) and at 4 months (4 M) (young adult). Fetal exposure to excess maternal fructose intake significantly increased male and female triglycerides at D21 and 4 M and circulating palmitoleic acid and total omega-7 through day 0 (D0) to 4 M. Proteomic and functional analysis of significantly differentially expressed proteins revealed that FD offspring (D21 and 4 M) had significantly increased mitochondrial metabolic activities of β-oxidation, electron transport chain (ETC) and oxidative phosphorylation and reactive oxygen species production compared to the CD offspring. Western blotting analysis of both FD offspring validated the increased protein abundances of mitochondrial ETC complex II and IV, SREBP-1c and FAS, whereas VDAC1 expression was higher at D21 but lower at 4 M. We provide evidence demonstrating offspring programmed hepatic mitochondrial metabolism and de novo lipogenesis following excess maternal fructose exposure. These underlying asymptomatic programmed pathways may lead to a predisposition to metabolic dysfunction later in life."

Coexpression analysis of common genes with the same direction of differential expression identified modules. Module genes were subjected to enrichment analysis, Short Time-series Expression Miner (STEM) analysis, and PPI network analysis. The top 100 most connected genes in the PPI network were screened to construct the LASSO model, and AUC values were calculated to identify the key genes. Methylation modification of key genes were identified by the chAMP package. Differences in immune cell infiltration between HIV + and HIV- patients, as well as between antiretroviral therapy (ART) and HIV + patients, were calculated using ssGSEA.We obtained 3610 common genes, clustered into nine coexpression modules. Module genes were significantly enriched in interferon signalling, helper T-cell immunity, and HIF-1-signalling pathways. We screened out module genes with gradual changes in expression with increasing time from HIV enrolment using STEM software. We identified 12 significant genes through LASSO regression analysis, especially proteasome 20S subunit beta 8 (PSMB8) and interferon alpha inducible protein 27 (IFI27). The expression of PSMB8 and IFI27 were then detected by quantitative real-time PCR. Interestingly, IFI27 was also a persistently dysregulated gene identified by STEM. In addition, 10 of the key genes were identified to be modified by methylation. The significantly infiltrated immune cells in HIV + patients were restored after ART, and IFI27 was significantly associated with immune cells.The above results provided potential target genes for early diagnosis and treatment of HIV + patients. IFI27 may be associated with the progression of HIV infection and may be a powerful target for immunotherapy."

An increasing number of studies have reported evidence of germline inheritance of DNA methylation induced by nutritional signals in mammals. Vitamins and minerals as micronutrients contribute to growth performance in vertebrates, including Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), and also have a role in epigenetics as environmental factors that alter DNA methylation status. It is important to understand whether micronutrients in the paternal diet can influence the offspring through alterations of DNA methylation signatures in male germ cells.Here, we show the effect of micronutrient supplementation on DNA methylation profiles in the male gonad through a whole life cycle feeding trial of Atlantic salmon fed three graded levels of micronutrient components. Our results strongly indicate that micronutrient supplementation affects the DNA methylation status of genes associated with cell signalling, synaptic signalling, and embryonic development. In particular, it substantially affects DNA methylation status in the promoter region of a glutamate receptor gene, glutamate receptor ionotropic, NMDA 3A-like (grin3a-like), when the fish are fed both medium and high doses of micronutrients. Furthermore, two transcription factors, histone deacetylase 2 (hdac2) and a zinc finger protein, bind to the hyper-methylated site in the grin3a-like promoter. An estimated function of hdac2 together with a zinc finger indicates that grin3a-like has a potential role in intergenerational epigenetic inheritance and the regulation of embryonic development affected by paternal diet.The present study demonstrates alterations of gene expression patterns and DNA methylation signatures in the male gonad when Atlantic salmon are fed different levels of micronutrients. Alterations of gene expression patterns are of great interest because the gonads are supposed to have limited metabolic activities compared to other organs, whereas alterations of DNA methylation signatures are of great importance in the field of nutritional epigenetics because the signatures affected by nutrition could be transferred to the next generation. We provide extensive data resources for future work in the context of potential intergenerational inheritance through the male germline.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35087844","An Update in Epigenetics in Metabolic-Associated Fatty Liver Disease.","Front Med (Lausanne)","Metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) is characterized by hepatic steatosis accompanied by one of three features: overweight or obesity, T2DM, or lean or normal weight with evidence of metabolic dysregulation. It is distinguished by excessive fat accumulation in hepatocytes, and a decrease in the liver's ability to oxidize fats, the accumulation of ectopic fat, and the activation of proinflammatory pathways. Chronic damage will keep this pathophysiologic cycle active causing progression from hepatic steatosis to cirrhosis and eventually, hepatocarcinoma. Epigenetics affecting gene expression without altering DNA sequence allows us to study MAFLD pathophysiology from a different perspective, in which DNA methylation processes, histone modifications, and miRNAs expression have been closely associated with MAFLD progression. However, these considerations also faced us with the circumstance that modifying those epigenetics patterns might lead to MAFLD regression. Currently, epigenetics is an area of great interest because it could provide new insights in therapeutic targets and non-invasive biomarkers. This review comprises an update on the role of epigenetic patterns, as well as innovative therapeutic targets and biomarkers in MAFLD.Copyright © 2022 Rodríguez-Sanabria, Escutia-Gutiérrez, Rosas-Campos, Armendáriz-Borunda and Sandoval-Rodríguez."

There is currently great interest in investigating the environmental and genetic factors that influence sweet taste and sugary food preferences for personalized nutrition. Our aims were: (1) to carry out an integrated analysis of the influence of sweet taste preference (both in isolation and in the context of other tastes) on the preference for sugary foods and its modulation by type 2 diabetes status; (2) as well as to explore new genetic factors associated with sweet taste preference. We studied 425 elderly white European subjects with metabolic syndrome and analyzed taste preference, taste perception, sugary-foods liking, biochemical and genetic markers. We found that type 2 diabetic subjects (38%) have a small, but statistically higher preference for sweet taste (p= 0.021) than non-diabetic subjects. No statistically significant differences (p> 0.05) in preferences for the other tastes (bitter, salty, sour or umami) were detected. For taste perception, type 2 diabetic subjects have a slightly lower perception of all tastes (p= 0.026 for the combined ""total taste score""), bitter taste being statistically lower (p= 0.023). We also carried out a principal component analysis (PCA), to identify latent variables related to preferences for the five tastes. We identified two factors with eigenvalues >1. Factor 2 was the one with the highest correlation with sweet taste preference. Sweet taste preference was strongly associated with a liking for sugary foods. In the exploratory SNP-based genome-wide association study (GWAS), we identified some SNPs associated with sweet taste preference, both at the suggestive and at the genome-wide level, especially a lead SNP in the PTPRN2 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase Receptor Type N2) gene, whose minor allele was associated with a lower sweet taste preference. The PTPRN2 gene was also a top-ranked gene obtained in the gene-based exploratory GWAS analysis. In conclusion, sweet taste preference was strongly associated with sugary food liking in this population. Our exploratory GWAS identified an interesting candidate gene related with sweet taste preference, but more studies in other populations are required for personalized nutrition."

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) accounts for 90% of the global prevalence of diabetes. T2DM is featured by a combination of defective insulin secretion by pancreatic β-cells and the inability of insulin-sensitive tissues to respond appropriately to insulin. However, the pathogenesis of this disease is complicated by genetic and environmental factors, which needs further study. Numerous studies have demonstrated an epigenetic influence on the course of this diseaseviaaltering the expression of downstream diabetes-related proteins. Further studies in the field of epigenetics can help to elucidate the mechanisms and identify appropriate treatments. Histone methylation is defined as a common histone mark by adding a methyl group (-CH3) onto a lysine or arginine residue, which can alter the expression of downstream proteins and affect cellular processes. Thus, in tthis study will discuss types and functions of histone methylation and its role in T2DM wilsed. We will review the involvement of histone methyltransferases and histone demethylases in the progression of T2DM and analyze epigenetic-based therapies.

Epigenetic modifications comprising DNA methylation, histone remodeling, and noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) have been established to govern chromatin structure and transcriptional responses in various cell types during disease development. However, dysregulation of these epigenetic mechanisms has not yet been explored in detail in the pathology of pulmonary arterial hypertension and its progression with vascular remodeling and right-heart failure (RHF). Targeting epigenetic regulators including histone methylation, acetylation, or miRNAs offers many possible candidates for drug discovery and will no doubt be a tempting area to explore for PAH therapies. This review focuses on studies in epigenetic mechanisms including the writers, the readers, and the erasers of epigenetic marks and targeting epigenetic regulators or modifiers for treatment of PAH and its complications described as RHF. Data analyses from experimental cell models and animal induced PAH models have demonstrated that significant changes in the expression levels of multiple epigenetics modifiers such as HDMs, HDACs, sirtuins (Sirt1 and Sirt3), and BRD4 correlate strongly with proliferation, apoptosis, inflammation, and fibrosis linked to the pathological vascular remodeling during PAH development. The reversible characteristics of protein methylation and acetylation can be applied for exploring small-molecule modulators such as valproic acid (HDAC inhibitor) or resveratrol (Sirt1 activator) in different preclinical models for treatment of diseases including PAH and RHF. This review also presents to the readers the application of microfluidic devices to study sex differences in PAH pathophysiology, as well as for epigenetic analysis."

Over the past decades, increasing evidence demonstrates that the space environment can induce changes in gene expression and RNA processing. Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) represent an emerging area of focus in molecular biology as they modulate chromatin structure and function, the transcription of neighboring genes, and affect RNA splicing, stability, and translation. They have been implicated in cancer development and associated with diverse cardiovascular conditions and associated risk factors. However, their role on astronauts' health after spaceflight remains poorly understood. In this perspective article, we provide new insights into the potential role of exosomal lncRNA after spaceflight. We analyzed the transcriptional profile of exosomes isolated from peripheral blood plasma of three astronauts who flew on various Shuttle missions between 1998-2001 by RNA-sequencing.

Little is known about the effect of microgravity on hematopoietic differentiation of pluripotent stem cells (PSCs). In this study, we used the random position machine (RPM) to investigate whether simulated microgravity (SMG) allows the induction of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs)in vitro. The results showed that SMG facilitates hESCs differentiate to HSPC with more efficient induction of CD34+CD31+hemogenic endothelium progenitors (HEPs) on day 4 and CD34+CD43+HSPC on day 7, and these cells shows an increased generation of functional hematopoietic cells in colony-forming unit assay when compared with normal gravity (NG) conditions. Additionally, we found that SMG significantly increased the total number of cells on day 4 and day 7 which formed more 3D cell clusters. Transcriptome analysis of cells identified thousands of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between NG and SMG. DEGs down-regulated were enriched in the axonogenesis, positive regulation of cell adhesion, cell adhesion molecule and axon guidance, while SMG resulted in the up-regulation of genes were functionally associated with DNA replication, cell cycle, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway and tumorigenesis. Interestingly, some key gene terms were enriched in SMG, like hypoxia and ECM receptor interaction. Moreover, HSPC obtained from SMG culture conditions had a robust ability of proliferationin vitro. The proliferated cells also had the ability to form erythroid, granulocyte and monocyte/macrophage colonies, and can be induced to generate macrophages and megakaryocytes. In summary, our data has shown a potent impact of microgravity on hematopoietic differentiation of hPSCs for the first time and reveals an underlying mechanism for the effect of SMG on hematopoiesis development.Copyright © 2022 Ma, Xiong, Han, Zhang, Cao, Wang, Zhao, Duan, Zhang and Lei."
"35052739","The Cardiovascular System in Space: Focus on In Vivo and In Vitro Studies.","Biomedicines","On Earth, humans are subjected to a gravitational force that has been an important determinant in human evolution and function. During spaceflight, astronauts are subjected to several hazards including a prolonged state of microgravity that induces a myriad of physiological adaptations leading to orthostatic intolerance. This review summarises all known cardiovascular diseases related to human spaceflight and focusses on the cardiovascular changes related to human spaceflight (in vivo) as well as cellular and molecular changes (in vitro). Upon entering microgravity, cephalad fluid shift occurs and increases the stroke volume (35-46%) and cardiac output (18-41%). Despite this increase, astronauts enter a state of hypovolemia (10-15% decrease in blood volume). The absence of orthostatic pressure and a decrease in arterial pressures reduces the workload of the heart and is believed to be the underlying mechanism for the development of cardiac atrophy in space. Cellular and molecular changes include altered cell shape and endothelial dysfunction through suppressed cellular proliferation as well as increased cell apoptosis and oxidative stress. Human spaceflight is associated with several cardiovascular risk factors. Through the use of microgravity platforms, multiple physiological changes can be studied and stimulate the development of appropriate tools and countermeasures for future human spaceflight missions in low Earth orbit and beyond."

We categorized the reported associations based on a priori designed levels of evidence supporting a causal association into four categories, namely robust, probable, suggestive, and insufficient, based on the significance and concordance of the main MR analysis results and at least one of the MR-Egger, weighed median, MRPRESSO, and multivariable MR analyses. Associations not presenting any of the aforementioned sensitivity analyses were not graded.We included 190 publications reporting on 4667 MR analyses. Most analyses (3200; 68.6%) were not accompanied by any of the assessed sensitivity analyses. Of the 1467 evaluable analyses, 87 (5.9%) were supported by robust, 275 (18.7%) by probable, and 89 (6.1%) by suggestive evidence. The most prominent robust associations were observed for anthropometric indices with risk of breast, kidney, and endometrial cancers; circulating telomere length with risk of kidney, lung, osteosarcoma, skin, thyroid, and hematological cancers; sex steroid hormones and risk of breast and endometrial cancer; and lipids with risk of breast, endometrial, and ovarian cancer.Despite the large amount of research on genetically predicted risk factors for cancer risk, limited associations are supported by robust evidence for causality. Most associations did not present a MR sensitivity analysis and were thus non-evaluable.

This study is focused on the radiosensitization effect and apoptotic pathways of celastrol via the inhibition of thec-mycgene and the influence of which combined with radiotherapy on the proliferation, apoptosis, invasion, and metastasis of chondrosarcoma cells.A variety of bioinformatic tools were applied to explore the expression level and prognosis of thec-mycgene in different tumor cells and chondrosarcoma cells. We used pharmacology network to analyze the components, pathways, targets, molecular functions of TWHF and explore the relevant effective components over the MYC gene. Clone formation assay, CCK-8 assay, flow cytometry, and transwell migration assay were applied to detect the effects of celastrol on the expression ofc-mycgene, cell apoptosis, and cell cycle. Radiation therapy was used to observe the radiosensitization effect of celastrol on chondrosarcoma.This study shows that the c-myc gene is overexpressed in various tumor cells and bone tumor cells to varying degrees. Celastrol can significantly inhibit the expression of thec-mycgene, induce G2/M phase arrest through regulation of G2/M phase-related proteins, and promote SW1353 cell apoptosis through the mitochondrial signaling pathway. In addition, we also found that the use of triptorubin to inhibitc-mycgene expression in combination with radiotherapy can increase the osteosarcoma cells' apoptosis rate through the mitochondrial signaling pathway significantly.Our study validated the radiosensitization effect of celastrol through knocking down the expression of the c-myc gene to induce G2/M phase arrest and provides a new idea for the treatment of refractory or recurrent chondrosarcoma that is not sensitive to radiotherapy.Copyright © 2022 Jin Qian et al."

However, the mechanisms driving the evolution of colorectal cancer remain unclear. Therefore, we investigated the association betweenMapk14expression and clinicopathological and tumor-infiltrating immune cells.Methods:In this study, we collected CRC patient data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), compared the expression level in CRC and normal colorectal tissue using the Wilcoxon rank sum test and assessed the relationship betweenMapk14and clinicopathological features using the Welch one-way ANOVA test. Kaplan-Meier and timeROC GSE17537 datasets were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) dataset to assess the prognostic impact of theMapk14gene on colorectal cancer. Second, we further explored the methylation level ofMapk14and its influencing factors. Single-cell sequencing ofMapk14in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) was analyzed using the GSE108989 dataset. Further analyses based on the TIMER method were performed to assess the correlation betweenMapk14and tumor immune infiltration, immune checkpoints, tumor mutational load and microsatellite instability. Finally, the results of the bioinformatics analysis were verified by an immunohistochemical analysis.Results:The results showed that the expression ofMapk14was upregulated in CRC tumor tissues compared with normal colorectal tissues and the high expression of Mapk14 was associated with poor clinicopathological features and poor prognoses in the CRC array. In addition, cg05798012 and cg25375420 ofMapk14are the main DNA methylation sites affecting OS. Single-cell sequencing of the tumor immune microenvironment showed that the abundance and cell state of dysfunctional T cells changed greatly. Importantly, the abnormal overexpression ofMapk14in colorectal cancer is related to the level of immune infiltration of immune cells (including CD8+T cells, neutrophils, dendritic cells, B cells, CD4+T cells, and macrophages). The high expression of Mapk14 was significantly correlated with immune checkpoints (includingSIGLEC15,TIGIT,LAG3,CTLA4andPDCDILG2), while the high expression ofMapk14was negatively correlated with TMB and MSI but mostly positively correlated with drug sensitivity. Finally, the immunohistochemical results confirmed that the clinical stage (Ⅰ, Ⅱ, Ⅲ and Ⅳ) and M stage (M0 and M1) affected the abnormally high expression of Mapk14.Conclusion:A comprehensive bioinformatics study and experimental validation revealed that Mapk14 could serve as a novel prognostic biomarker associated with immune infiltration and pharmacotherapy and may represent a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of CRC.Copyright © 2022 Wang, Peng, Hua, Li, Liu and Zhou."

We used six types of evidence, coding potential assessment tool (CPAT), coding potential calculator v2.0 (CPC2), N6-methyladenosine modification of RNA sites (m6A), Pfam, ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq), and translation initiation sites (TISs), to evaluate the coding potential of 883,804 lncRNAs across 39 species. We constructed a comprehensive database of lncRNA-encoded peptides, LncPep (http://www.shenglilabs.com/LncPep/). LncPep provides three major functional modules: 1) user-friendly searching/browsing interface, 2) prediction and BLAST modules for exploring novel lncRNAs and peptides, and 3) annotations for lncRNAs, peptides and supporting evidence.

Our study aimed to investigate the expression and prognostic value of CPNE1 gene in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), to explore its functional network in HCC and its effects on biological behaviors.HCCDB, CCLE, HPA and LinkedOmics online databases were used to explore the expression of CPNE1 gene and analyze the co-expression network of CPNE1 in hepatocellular carcinoma. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used for GO functional annotation, KEGG pathway enrichment analysis and regulators of CPNE1 networks in LIHC. HepG2 and MHCC-97H cells were selected to construct CPNE1 knockdown cell lines by transfection with siRNA, and Hep3B cell was selected to construct CPNE1 overexpression cell line by transfection with plasmid. The effect of CPNE1 on the proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma cells was examined by CCK8 assay and clone formation assay; the effect of CPNE1 on the migration ability of hepatocellular carcinoma cells was assessed by cell scratch assay and Transwell cell migration assay; finally, the expression of related signaling pathway proteins was examined by Western Blot. The correlation of CPNE1 expression with immune infiltration and immune checkpoint molecules in HCC tissues was analyzed using TIMER online database and GSEA.CPNE1 was highly expressed in HCC tissues and significantly correlated with sex, age, cancer stage and tumor grade. Overall survival (OS) was significantly lower in patients with high CPNE1 expression than in patients with low CPNE1 expression, and CPNE1 could be used as an independent prognostic indicator for HCC. Knockdown of CPNE1 gene inhibited the AKT/P53 pathway, resulting in decreased proliferation, migration and invasion of HCC cells. Overexpression of CPNE1 gene showed the opposite results. The level of CPNE1 expression in HCC was significantly and positively correlated with the level of infiltration of B cells, CD8+T cells, CD4+T cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells (P < 0.001). GSEA results also showed that CPNE1 of LIHC was involved in some immune response regulating signaling pathways.Our study firstly found the expression of CPNE1 was significantly higher in LIHC tissues than in normal liver tissues, and high CPNE1 expression was associated with poor prognosis. In addition, we identified the possible mechanism by which CPNE1 functioned in LIHC. CPNE1 influenced AKT/P53 pathway activation and LIHC cell proliferation and migration. There was a significant correlation between CPNE1 expression and tumor immune infiltration in LIHC.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35127516","Capturing Biomarkers and Molecular Targets in Cellular Landscapes From Dynamic Reaction Network Models and Machine Learning.","Front Oncol","Computational dynamic ODE models of cell function describing biochemical reactions have been created for decades, but on a small scale. Still, they have been highly effective in describing and predicting behaviors. For example, oscillatory phospho-ERK levels were predicted and confirmed in MAPK signaling encompassing both positive and negative feedback loops. These models typically were limited and not adapted to large datasets so commonly found today. But importantly, ODE models describe reaction networks in well-mixed systems representing the cell and can be simulated with ordinary differential equations that are solved deterministically. Stochastic solutions, which can account for noisy reaction networks, in some cases, also improve predictions. Today, dynamic ODE models rarely encompass an entire cell even though it might be expected that an upload of the large genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic datasets may allow whole cell models. It is proposed here to combine output from simulated dynamic ODE models, completed with omics data, to discover both biomarkers in cancera prioriand molecular targets in the Machine Learning setting.Copyright © 2022 Mertins."

The associations ofTPI1expression with clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis were also studied in both histological types. Moreover, we analyzed the potential relations ofTPI1with immunomodulators and immune cell infiltrations in the tumor microenvironment based on previous literatures and bioinformatic tools.We found thatTPI1was significantly overexpressed in LUAD and LUSC. Significant associations ofTPI1expression were observed regarding age, gender, and pathological stages in LUAD. However, similar trend was only found with respect to age in LUSC. The high expression ofTPI1was significantly associated with worse survival in LUAD, but not in LUSC. Furthermore, we explored the potential distribution and changes ofTPI1expression in tumor microenvironment. Pathway enrichment analyses were performed to identify possible roles ofTPI1in both lung cancers.TPI1was overexpressed in both LUAD and LUSC. IncreasedTPI1expression was correlated with poor prognosis in LUAD and changed immune cell infiltrating in various degrees in both histological types.

Further delineating such lineage-dependency factors and associated therapeutic implications would provide valuable insights into ovarian cancer biology and treatment. In this study, we identified SOX17 as a new lineage-survival master transcription factor, which shared co-expression pattern with PAX8 in epithelial ovarian carcinoma. Genetic disruption of SOX17 or PAX8 analogously inhibited neoplastic cell viability and downregulated a spectrum of lineage-related transcripts. Mechanistically, we showed that SOX17 physically interacted with PAX8 in cultured cell lines and clinical tumor specimens. The two nuclear proteins bound to overlapping genomic regions and regulated a common set of downstream genes, including those involved in cell cycle and tissue morphogenesis. In addition, we revealed that small-molecule inhibitors of transcriptional cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) effectively reduced SOX17 and PAX8 expression. ZSQ1722, a novel orally bioavailable CDK12/13 covalent antagonist, exerted potent anti-tumor activity in xenograft models. These findings shed light on an actionable lineage-survival transcriptional complex in ovarian cancer, and facilitated drug discovery by generating a serial of candidate compounds to pharmacologically target this difficult-to-treat malignancy.© 2022.

In addition to recurrent gene mutations, there is increasing evidence supporting the role of epigenetic deregulation in disease pathogenesis. Yet, comprehensive cis-regulatory network descriptions from NB are lacking. Here, using genome-wide H3K27ac profiles across 60 NBs, covering the different clinical and molecular subtypes, we identified four major super-enhancer-driven epigenetic subtypes and their underlying master regulatory networks. Three of these subtypes recapitulated known clinical groups; namely, MYCN-amplified, MYCN non-amplified high-risk and MYCN non-amplified low-risk NBs. The fourth subtype, exhibiting mesenchymal characteristics, shared cellular identity with multipotent Schwann cell precursors, was induced by RAS activation and was enriched in relapsed disease. Notably, CCND1, an essential gene in NB, was regulated by both mesenchymal and adrenergic regulatory networks converging on distinct super-enhancer modules. Overall, this study reveals subtype-specific super-enhancer regulation in NBs.© 2020. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc. part of Springer Nature."

"35121865","Moving pan-cancer studies from basic research toward the clinic.","Nat Cancer","Although all cancers share common hallmarks, we have long realized that there is no silver-bullet treatment for the disease. Many clinical oncologists specialize in a single cancer type, based predominantly on the tissue of origin. With advances brought by genetics and cancer genomic research, we now know that cancers are profoundly different, both in origins and in genetic alterations. At the same time, commonalities such as key driver mutations, altered pathways, mutational, immune and microbial signatures and other areas (many revealed by pan-cancer studies) point to the intriguing possibility of targeting common traits across diverse cancer types with the same therapeutic strategies. Studies designed to delineate differences and similarities across cancer types are thus critical in discerning the basic dynamics of oncogenesis, as well as informing diagnoses, prognoses and therapies. We anticipate growing emphases on the development and application of therapies targeting underlying commonalities of different cancer types, while tailoring to the unique tissue environment and intrinsic molecular fingerprints of each cancer type and subtype.

We identify a higher frequency of receptor tyrosine kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway alterations compared to primary GC; moreover, approximately half of the gene alterations are potentially treatable with targeted therapy. Our analyses also stratify ascites-disseminated GC into two distinct molecular subtypes: one displaying active super enhancers (SEs) at the ELF3, KLF5 and EHF loci, and a second subtype bearing transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) pathway activation through SMAD3 SE activation and high expression of transcriptional enhancer factor TEF-1 (TEAD1).

Since autophagy-related genes (ARGs) play a key role in the pathogenesis of many tumors, including ESCC, the purpose of this study is to establish an autophagy-related prognostic risk signature based on ARGs expression profile, and to provide a new method for improving prediction of clinical outcomes. We obtained the expression profiles of ESCC from public data (GSE53625) and extracted the portion of ARGs. Differential expression analysis and enrichment analysis were performed to confirm abnormal autophagy-related biological functions. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed on RNA microarray data (GSE53625) to construct a prognostic risk signature associated with autophagy. The performance of the model was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, survival analysis and Brier score. The model was subjected to bootstrap internal validation. The potential molecular mechanism of gene signature was explored by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). Spearman correlation coefficient examined the correlation between risk score and immune status and ferroptosis. The expression levels of genes and proteins were validated by qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry in ESCC cell lines and ESCC tissues. We constructed and validated an autophagy-related prognostic risk signature in 179 patients with ESCC. The long-term survival of patients in high-risk group was lower than that in low-risk group (log-rank, P value < 0.001). ROC analysis and Brier score confirmed the reliability of the signature. GSEA results showed significant enrichment of cancer- and autophagy-related signaling pathways in the high-risk ESCC patients and immunoregulatory signaling pathways in the low-risk ESCC patients. Correlation analysis showed that the risk signature can effectively predict the effect of immunotherapy. About 33.97% (71/209) ferroptosis-related genes were significantly correlated with risk scores. Finally, the results of qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry experiments were consistent with bioinformatics analysis. In brief, we constructed a novel autophagy-related gene signature (VIM, UFM1, TSC2, SRC, MEFV, CTTN, CFTR and CDKN1A), which could improve the prediction of clinical outcomes in patients with ESCC.© 2022.

The association was preserved even when the analysis was restricted to BRAF-mutant melanoma CCLs, indicating the potential ofTRIM51as a BRAF mutation-independent predictive biomarker. Moreover, the expression level ofTRIM51faithfully represented the degree of post-treatment activity and resistance upon treatment with BRAF-MEK inhibitors bothin vitroand in clinical situations, suggesting its application as a surrogate marker for the pharmacological activity of BRAF-MEK inhibitors. In addition, the high expression levels ofTRIM51were significantly associated with worse prognosis and immuno-resistance features in melanoma, indicating its role as a prognostic marker.Our findings revealed a novel role forTRIM51as a multiuse biomarker in melanoma.

Thus, there is growing recognition that preventing or delaying PC metastasis holds great potential for substantially improving patient outcomes. Here we show receptor-interacting protein kinase 2 (RIPK2) is a clinically actionable target for inhibiting PC metastasis. RIPK2 is amplified/gained in ~65% of lethal metastatic castration-resistant PC. Its overexpression is associated with disease progression and poor prognosis, and its genetic knockout substantially reduces PC metastasis. Multi-level proteomics analyses reveal that RIPK2 strongly regulates the stability and activity of c-Myc (a driver of metastasis), largely via binding to and activating mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 7 (MKK7), which we identify as a direct c-Myc-S62 kinase. RIPK2 inhibition by preclinical and clinical drugs inactivates the noncanonical RIPK2/MKK7/c-Myc pathway and effectively impairs PC metastatic outgrowth. These results support targeting RIPK2 signaling to extend metastasis-free and overall survival.© 2022. The Author(s)."

The solute carrier (SLC)39A family is a main member of the SLC group of membrane transport proteins, which transfer zinc to the cytoplasm when cells are depleted of zinc; thus, it may provide a novel therapeutic target for human cancer. However, the prognostic value of SLC39A genes in patients with liver cancer has remained elusive. Therefore, the present study aimed to explore whether SLC39A family genes are associated with the survival rate of patients with liver cancer and to investigate the role of key genes of the SLC39A family in liver cancer. The mRNA expression of the SLC39A family in liver cancer was obtained from the UALCAN database. Survival curve analysis was performed to investigate the prognostic value of SLC39A family genes in the overall survival of patients with liver cancer. In addition to the bioinformatics analysis, SLC39A6 was knocked down in HepG2 and Hep3B cells to examine the effect on the proliferation, migration and invasion of liver cancer cells. The results suggested that SLC39A6 was significantly upregulated in liver cancer tissues compared with normal liver tissues. High expression of SLC39A6 was significantly associated with poor overall survival of patients with liver cancer. Furthermore, knockdown of SLC39A6 inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion of liver cancer cellsin vitroandin vivo. Collectively, the results of the present study suggested that SLC39A6 may be a promising prognostic biomarker for liver cancer and is associated with the proliferation, migration and invasion of liver cancer.Copyright: © Wan et al."
"35110534","A pan-CRISPR analysis of mammalian cell specificity identifies ultra-compact sgRNA subsets for genome-scale experiments.","Nat Commun","A genetic knockout can be lethal to one human cell type while increasing growth rate in another. This context specificity confounds genetic analysis and prevents reproducible genome engineering. Genome-wide CRISPR compendia across most common human cell lines offer the largest opportunity to understand the biology of cell specificity. The prevailing viewpoint, synthetic lethality, occurs when a genetic alteration creates a unique CRISPR dependency. Here, we use machine learning for an unbiased investigation of cell type specificity. Quantifying model accuracy, we find that most cell type specific phenotypes are predicted by the function of related genes of wild-type sequence, not synthetic lethal relationships. These models then identify unexpected sets of 100-300 genes where reduced CRISPR measurements can produce genome-scale loss-of-function predictions across >18,000 genes. Thus, it is possible to reduce in vitro CRISPR libraries by orders of magnitude-with some information loss-when we remove redundant genes and not redundant sgRNAs.© 2022. The Author(s)."

DNA repair deficiency is one of the main sources of endogenous mutagenesis and is increasingly recognized as a target for cancer therapeutics. The role and prevalence of mechanisms that underly different forms of DNA repair deficiencies and their interactions remain to be elucidated in gynecological malignancies.We analyzed 1231 exomes and 268 whole-genomes from three major gynecological malignancies including uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC) as well as ovarian and cervical cancers. We also analyzed data from 134 related cell lines. We extracted and compared de novo and refitted mutational signature profiles using complementary and confirmatory approaches and performed interaction analysis to detect co-occurring and mutually exclusive signatures.We found an inverse relationship between homologous recombination deficiency (HRd) and mismatch repair deficiency (MMRd). Moreover, APOBEC co-occurred with HRd but was mutually exclusive with MMRd. UCEC tumors were dominated by MMRd, yet a subset of them manifested the HRd and APOBEC signatures. Conversely, ovarian tumors were dominated by HRd, while a subset represented MMRd and APOBEC. In contrast to both, cervical tumors were dominated by APOBEC with a small subsets showing the POLE, HRd, and MMRd signatures. Although the type, prevalence, and heterogeneity of mutational signatures varied across the tumor types, the patterns of co-occurrence and exclusivity were consistently observed in all. Notably, mutational signatures in gynecological tumor cell lines reflected those detected in primary tumors.Taken together, these analyses indicate that application of mutation signature analysis not only advances our understanding of mutational processes and their interactions, but also it has the potential to stratify patients that could benefit from treatments available for tumors harboring distinct mutational signatures and to improve clinical decision-making for gynecological malignancies.© 2022.

However, to date, efforts to improve nanoparticle accumulation at target disease sites have largely failed to translate clinically, stemming from an incomplete understanding of nano-bio interactions. While progress has been made to evaluate the effects of specific physical and chemical nanoparticle properties on trafficking and uptake, there is much to be gained from controlling these properties singularly and in combination to determine their interactions with different cell types. We and others have recently begun leveraging library-based nanoparticle screens to study structure-function relationships of lipid- and polymer-based drug delivery systems to guide nanoparticle design. These combinatorial screening efforts are showing promise in leading to the successful identification of critical characteristics that yield improved and specific accumulation at target sites. However, there is a crucial need to equally consider the influence of biological complexity on nanoparticle delivery, particularly in the context of clinical translation. For example, tissue and cellular heterogeneity presents an additional dimension to nanoparticle trafficking, uptake, and accumulation; applying imaging and screening tools as well as bioinformatics may further expand our understanding of how nanoparticles engage with cells and tissues.

This task is traditionally fulfilled by linear methods such as canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and partial least squares (PLS). However, information contained in one data type pertaining to the other data type may be complex and in nonlinear form. Deep learning provides a convenient alternative to extract low-dimensional nonlinear data embedding. In addition, the deep learning setup can naturally incorporate the effects of clinical confounding factors into the integrative analysis. Here we report a deep learning setup, named Autoencoder-based Integrative Multi-omics data Embedding (AIME), to extract data representation for omics data integrative analysis. The method can adjust for confounder variables, achieve informative data embedding, rank features in terms of their contributions, and find pairs of features from the two data types that are related to each other through the data embedding. In simulation studies, the method was highly effective in the extraction of major contributing features between data types. Using two real microRNA-gene expression datasets, one with confounder variables and one without, we show that AIME excluded the influence of confounders, and extracted biologically plausible novel information.

Particularly, kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) stood out, with altered hypoxia-related pathways and a high proportion of endothelial cells in the TME. Furthermore, an integrated analysis conducted to predict paracrine effectors in the KIRC cancer-to-stroma communication detected well-established soluble factors responsible for the hypoxia-related reaction and the so-far unestablished soluble factor, apelin (APLN).

Mapping the alterations of these genes in 7953 pan-cancer samples reveals that, despite the large size, the known compendium of drivers is still incomplete and biased towards frequently occurring coding mutations. High overlap exists between drivers of cancer and non-cancer somatic evolution, although significant differences emerge in their recurrence.

Univariate Cox regression analysis identified numerous proteins, including immune check-point molecules (PDCD1, PDCD2 and PD1L2) and BCL2 to be significantly associated with OS. However, only ETV6 and PIM2 proteins persisted following multivariate Cox analysis. Independent validation studies by immunohistochemistry and analysis of public gene expression profiles of DLBCL confirmed a prognostic role for high ETV6 and ETV6/PIM2 ratios in DLBCL.ETV6is a recurrently mutated/deleted gene in DLBCL for which its function in this disease entity is currently unknown. We find that ETV6 is upregulated during oncogenic transformation of germinal center B-cells and that it regulates DLBCL survival, as its acute loss results in marked apoptosis. Fluctuations in survivin (BIRC5) expression levels were associated with this phenomenon. Furthermore, an inverse correlation between ETV6 and BIRC5 expression levels was found and correlated with a response to the BIRC5 inhibitor, YM155.

We reconciled our discoveries by identifying several conserved Stat3 binding motifs upstream of the miR-21 gene promoter, and showed that the systemic administration of a miR-21-specific antisense oligonucleotide antagomir reduced the established gastric tumor burden inGp130F/Fmice. We molecularly delineated the therapeutic benefits of miR-21 inhibition with the functional restoration of PTEN in vitro and in vivo, alongside an attenuated epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and the extracellular matrix remodeling phenotype of tumors. We corroborated our preclinical findings by correlating high STAT3 and miR-21 expression with the reduced survival probability of gastric cancer patients. Collectively, our results provide a molecular framework by which miR-21 mediates inflammation-associated gastric cancer progression, and establish miR-21 as a robust therapeutic target for solid malignancies characterized by excessive Stat3 activity."

However, even without such activating mutations, RAS proteins represent core components in signal integration of several membrane-bound kinases. This raises the question of applications of specific inhibitors independent from the mutational status. Here, we examined CRISPR/RNAi data from over 700 cancer cell lines and identified a subset of cell lines without KRAS gain-of-function mutations (KRASwt) which are dependent on KRAS expression. Combining machine learning-based modeling and whole transcriptome data with prior variable selection through protein-protein interaction network analysis by a diffusion kernel successfully predicted KRAS dependency in the KRASwtsubgroup and in all investigated cancer cell lines. In contrast, modeling by RAS activating events (RAE) or previously published RAS RNA-signatures did not provide reliable results, highlighting the heterogeneous distribution of RAE in KRASwtcell lines and the importance of methodological references for expression signature modeling. Furthermore, we show that predictors of KRASwtmodels contain non-substitutable information signals, indicating a KRAS dependency phenotype in the KRASwtsubgroup. Our data suggest that KRAS dependent cancers harboring KRAS wild type status could be targeted by directed therapeutic approaches. RNA-based machine learning models could help in identifying responsive and non-responsive tumors.© 2022. The Author(s)."

Understanding the distinctions between transcriptional regulation of wild-type (WT) and mutant (Mut)hTERTpromoters may open up avenues for development of inhibitors which specially blockhTERTexpression in cancer cells. To comprehensively identify physiological regulators of WT- or Mut-hTERTpromoters, we generated several isogenic reporter cells driven by endogenoushTERTloci. Genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 and small interfering RNA screens using these isogenic reporter lines identified specific regulators of Mut-hTERTpromoters. We validate and characterize one of these hits, namely, MED12, a kinase subunit of mediator complex. We demonstrate that MED12 specifically drives expression ofhTERTfrom the Mut-hTERTpromoter by mediating long-range chromatin interaction between the proximal Mut-hTERTpromoter andT-INT1distal regulatory region 260 kb upstream. Several hits identified in our screens could serve as potential therapeutic targets, inhibition of which may specifically block Mut-hTERTpromoter driven telomerase reactivation in cancers.Copyright © 2022 the Author(s).

"35125829","Celiac disease: From genetics to epigenetics.","World J Gastroenterol","Celiac disease (CeD) is a multifactorial autoimmune disorder spread worldwide. The exposure to gluten, a protein found in cereals like wheat, barley and rye, is the main environmental factor involved in its pathogenesis. Even if the genetic predisposition represented by HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 haplotypes is widely recognised as mandatory for CeD development, it is not enough to explain the total predisposition for the disease. Furthermore, the onset of CeD comprehend a wide spectrum of symptoms, that often leads to a delay in CeD diagnosis. To overcome this deficiency and help detecting people with increased risk for CeD, also clarifying CeD traits linked to disease familiarity, different studies have tried to make light on other predisposing elements. These were in many cases genetic variants shared with other autoimmune diseases. Since inherited traits can be regulated by epigenetic modifications, also induced by environmental factors, the most recent studies focused on the potential involvement of epigenetics in CeD. Epigenetic factors can in fact modulate gene expression with many mechanisms, generating more or less stable changes in gene expression without affecting the DNA sequence. Here we analyze the different epigenetic modifications in CeD, in particular DNA methylation, histone modifications, non-coding RNAs and RNA methylation. Special attention is dedicated to the additional predispositions to CeD, the involvement of epigenetics in developing CeD complications, the pathogenic pathways modulated by epigenetic factors such as microRNAs and the potential use of epigenetic profiling as biomarker to discriminate different classes of patients.©The Author(s) 2022.

Moreover, the use of antidepressants during this critical period presents a serious health concern for both the mother and the child, due to the consequences of treatment in terms of the reliability and safety for the proper neurodevelopment of the organism being not well known. Atypical antidepressants, such as mirtazapine, that targets both serotonergic and noradrenergic systems in the central nervous system (CNS), represent a novel focus of research due to its unique pharmacological profile. The aim of this work was to study the effects of maternal depression and/or perinatal antidepressant mirtazapine treatment on the neurobehavioral development of the offspring. Pre-gestationally chronically stressed or non-stressed Wistar rat dams were treated with either mirtazapine (10 mg/kg/day) or vehicle during pregnancy and lactation followed by analysis of offspring's behavior at juvenile and adolescent age. We found mirtazapine induced significant alterations of nursing behavior. In offspring, pregestational stress (PS) had an anxiogenic effect on adolescent males (p≤0.05) and increased their active behavior in forced swim test (p≤0.01). Interaction between pregestational stress and mirtazapine treatment variously induced anxiolytic changes of juvenile (p≤0.05) and adolescent (p≤0.05) females and impairment of spatial memory (p≤0.01) in adolescent females as well. Hippocampal density of synaptophysin, pre-synaptic protein marker, was decreased mainly by mirtazapine treatment. In conclusion, our results show mirtazapine induced significant alterations in maternal behavior and several sex- and age-dependent changes in neurobehavioral development of offspring caused by both prenatal mirtazapine treatment and/or chronic pregestational stress."

Dysfunction of microglia has been associated with neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. Investigating the function of human microglia in health and disease has been challenging due to the limited models of the human brain available. Here, we develop a method to generate functional microglia in human cortical organoids (hCOs) from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). We apply this system to study the role of microglia during inflammation induced by amyloid-β (Aβ). The overexpression of the myeloid-specific transcription factor PU.1 generates microglia-like cells in hCOs, producing mhCOs (microglia-containing hCOs), that we engraft in the mouse brain. Single-cell transcriptomics reveals that mhCOs acquire a microglia cell cluster with an intact complement and chemokine system. Functionally, microglia in mhCOs protect parenchyma from cellular and molecular damage caused by Aβ. Furthermore, in mhCOs, we observed reduced expression of Aβ-induced expression of genes associated with apoptosis, ferroptosis, and Alzheimer's disease (AD) stage III. Finally, we assess the function of AD-associated genes highly expressed in microglia in response to Aβ using pooled CRISPRi coupled with single-cell RNA sequencing in mhCOs. In summary, we provide a protocol to generate mhCOs that can be used in fundamental and translational studies as a model to investigate the role of microglia in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders.© 2022.

Early recognition of LAA stroke is crucial. Circulating exosomal circRNAs profiling represents a promising, noninvasive approach for the detection of LAA stroke. Exosomal circRNA sequencing was used to identify differentially expressed circRNAs between LAA stroke and normal controls. From a further validation stage, the results were validated using RT-qPCR. We then built logistic regression models of exosomal circRNAs based on a large replication stage, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed to assess the diagnostic efficacy. Using exosomal circRNA sequencing, large sample validation, and diagnostic model construction revealed that exosomal circ_0043837 and circ_ 0001801were independent predictive factors for LAA stroke, and had better diagnostic efficacy than plasma circRNAs. In the atherosclerotic group (AS), we developed a nomogram for clinical use that integrated the two-circRNA-based risk factors to predict which patients might have the risk of plaque rupture. Circulating exosomal circRNAs profiling identifies novel predictive biomarkers for the LAA stroke and plaque rupture, with superior diagnostic value than plasma circRNAs. It might facilitate the prevention and better management of this disease.Copyright © 2022 Xiao, Hou, Li, Zhang, Zhang, Zhu and Pan."

In subjects at high-risk of cancer, gut, and lung microbiota are distinct from those of low-risk subjects, and disease progression is associated with microbiota alterations. As with many inflammatory diseases, it is the combination of specific host and environmental factors in certain individuals that provokes disease outcomes. The microbiota metabolites influence activity of epigenetic enzymes. The knowledge of the mechanisms of action of environmental pollution now includes not only the alteration of the gut microbiota but also the interaction between different human microbiota niches such as the lung-gut axis. The epigenetic regulations can reprogram differentiated cells in response to environmental changes. The microbiota can play a major role in the progression and suppression of several epigenetic diseases. Accordingly, the maintenance of a balanced microbiota by monitoring the environmental stimuli provides a novel preventive approach for disease prevention. Metagenomics technologies can be utilized to establish new mitigation approaches for diseases induced by polluted environments. The purpose of this review is to examine the effects of particulate matter exposure on the progression of disease outcomes as related to the alterations of gut and lung microbial communities and consequent epigenetic modifications."

This paper describes the study protocol, design and baseline characteristics of the cohort.We included 944 pregnant Finnish women, their partners and children born alive between April 2012 and December 2017. The women were recruited through the national, voluntary trisomy 21 screening between 9+0and 21+6gestational weeks. Of the participating women, 543 were screen positive and underwent fetal chromosomal testing. Test result of these women suggested no fetal chromosomal abnormality. Further, we recruited 401 women who were screen negative and who did not undergo fetal chromosomal testing.We have collected chorionic villi and amniotic fluid from the screen-positive women; blood, urine, buccal swabs and diurnal salivary samples from all women; blood and buccal swabs from all partners; and placenta, cord blood and buccal swabs from all newborns for analyses of the genome, epigenome, transcriptome, and endocrine, inflammatory and metabolic markers. These data are coupled with comprehensive phenotypes, including questions on demographic characteristics, health and well-being of the women and their partners during pregnancy and of the women and their children at the child's age of 1.7 and 3 years. Data also come from patient records and nationwide registers covering health, lifestyle and medication data.Multiple layers of ITU data allow integrative data analyses, which translate to biomarker identification and allow risk stratification and understanding of the biological mechanisms involved in prenatal programming of health and disease.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022.

To maximize the biological insights obtained using these techniques, it is critical to both clearly articulate the key biological questions in spatial analysis of tissues and develop the requisite computational tools to address them. Developers of analytical tools need to decide on the intrinsic molecular features of each cell that need to be considered, and how cell shape and morphological features are incorporated into the analysis.

During a dynamic process such as cellular differentiation, the overall cell type composition of a tissue (or an in vitro culture) and the gene regulatory profile of each cell can both experience significant changes over time. To identify these dynamic effects in high resolution, we collected single-cell RNA-sequencing data over a differentiation time course from induced pluripotent stem cells to cardiomyocytes, sampled at 7 unique time points in 19 human cell lines. We employed a flexible approach to map dynamic eQTLs whose effects vary significantly over the course of bifurcating differentiation trajectories, including many whose effects are specific to one of these two lineages. Our study design allowed us to distinguish true dynamic eQTLs affecting a specific cell lineage from expression changes driven by potentially non-genetic differences between cell lines such as cell composition. Additionally, we used the cell type profiles learned from single-cell data to deconvolve and re-analyze data from matched bulk RNA-seq samples. Using this approach, we were able to identify a large number of novel dynamic eQTLs in single cell data while also attributing dynamic effects in bulk to a particular lineage. Overall, we found that using single cell data to uncover dynamic eQTLs can provide new insight into the gene regulatory changes that occur among heterogeneous cell types during cardiomyocyte differentiation."
"35050714","SCOT: Single-Cell Multi-Omics Alignment with Optimal Transport.","J Comput Biol","Recent advances in sequencing technologies have allowed us to capture various aspects of the genome at single-cell resolution. However, with the exception of a few of co-assaying technologies, it is not possible to simultaneously apply different sequencing assays on the same single cell. In this scenario, computational integration of multi-omic measurements is crucial to enable joint analyses. This integration task is particularly challenging due to the lack of sample-wise or feature-wise correspondences. We present single-cell alignment with optimal transport (SCOT), an unsupervised algorithm that uses the Gromov-Wasserstein optimal transport to align single-cell multi-omics data sets. SCOT performs on par with the current state-of-the-art unsupervised alignment methods, is faster, and requires tuning of fewer hyperparameters. More importantly, SCOT uses a self-tuning heuristic to guide hyperparameter selection based on the Gromov-Wasserstein distance. Thus, in the fully unsupervised setting, SCOT aligns single-cell data sets better than the existing methods without requiring any orthogonal correspondence information."

All serum lipids except LDL increase significantly from 6 to 12 weeks, with TG by 23 and TC by 8 units. High MetS prevalence was observed with AHA/NHLBI (n = 150, 5.6%, 95% CI 4.8-6.5) followed by IDF (n = 144, 5.4%, 95% CI 4.6-6.3), NCEP-ATP III (n = 112, 4.2%, 95% CI 3.4-5.0) and WHO (n = 81, 3.0%, 95% CI 2.4-3.7) definitions respectively. Significant difference in prevalence was noted among different sociodemographic characteristics (p < 0.001).

There is abundant evidence that children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) may exhibit atypical function within the HPA axis and the ANS both at the resting state and during the presence of social and/or non-social stressors. The aim of this review is to provide an up-to-date summary of the findings regarding stress system alterations in children and adolescents with ASD. We focus on the variations of stress hormones circadian rhythms, specifically cortisol and alpha-amylase (i.e., a surrogate index of epinephrine/norepinephrine secretion), and on the alterations of stress system responsivity to different stressors. Also, we present imaging and immunological findings that have been associated with stress system dysregulation in children and adolescents with ASD. Finally, we review the pivotal role of HPA axis-ANS coordination, the developmental trajectory of the stress system in ASD, and the possible role of early life stress in the dysregulation of the stress system demonstrated in children and adolescents with ASD. This synthesis will hopefully provide researchers with a foundation for an integrated approach to future research into stress system variations in children and adolescents with ASD.Copyright © 2022 Makris, Agorastos, Chrousos and Pervanidou."

Athletic phenotype is complex and depends on the combination of different traits and characteristics: as such, it requires a ""complex science,"" like that of metadata and multi-OMICS profiles. Several projects and trials (like ELITE, GAMES, Gene SMART, GENESIS, and POWERGENE) are aimed at discovering genomics-based biomarkers with an adequate predictive power. Sports genomics could enable to optimize and maximize physical performance, as well as it could predict the risk of sports-related injuries. Exercise has a profound impact on proteome too.

These adaptations are mainly instigated by transcriptional responses that ensue in reaction to each individual exercise, either resistance or endurance. Consequently, changes in key metabolic, regulatory, and myogenic genes in skeletal muscle occur as both an early and late response to exercise, and these epigenetic modifications, which are influenced by environmental and genetic factors, trigger those alterations in the transcriptional responses. DNA methylation and histone modifications are the most significant epigenetic changes described in gene transcription, linked to the skeletal muscle transcriptional response to exercise, and mediating the exercise adaptations. Nevertheless, other alterations in the epigenetics markers, such as epitranscriptomics, modifications mediated by miRNAs, and lactylation as a novel epigenetic modification, are emerging as key events for gene transcription. Here, we provide an overview and update of the impact of exercise on epigenetic modifications, including the well-described DNA methylations and histone modifications, and the emerging modifications in the skeletal muscle. In addition, we describe the effects of exercise on epigenetic markers in other metabolic tissues; also, we provide information about how systemic metabolism or its metabolites influence epigenetic modifications in the skeletal muscle."

However, its role in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains unclear. Here, we select IMUP as an alternative gene based on GeneChip analysis of clinical PDAC tissues and transcriptome data from The Cancer Genome Atlas. IMUP expression is upregulated in PDAC tumor tissues. Moreover, high IMUP expression correlates with poor prognosis, while IMUP depletion inhibits PDAC cell proliferation and colony formation capacity in vitro, and decreases xenograft tumor growth in vivo. IMUP downregulation leads to cell-cycle arrest in the S phase. IMUP knockdown increases the expression of four-and-a-half LIM domain protein 1 (FHL1), which regulates the phosphorylation of cell division cycle 25A (CDC25A) by cycle checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1) and promotes cytoplasmic distribution of CDC25A by interaction with 14-3-3ξ. Furthermore, FHL1 knockdown restores the effects induced by IMUP depletion. Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry and immunoprecipitation analysis further show that IMUP interacts directly with nucleophosmin (NPM1) and enhances its stability. DNA methylation sequencing shows that FHL1 promoter methylation decreases when IMUP is downregulated. Overexpression of NPM1 can increase the methylation level of FHL1, thereby decreasing its expression. Our study provides a novel perspective on IMUP/NPM1/FHL1-mediated cell-cycle arrest by regulating CDC25A phosphorylation in PDAC. These findings may provide a new therapeutic target for PDAC.© 2022.

We identified hub geneFN1using functional enrichment and protein-protein interaction network analyses. Subsequently, we evaluated the importance of gene expression on clinical prognosis using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and GEO datasets.

In addition, we assessed the effect of silencingFN1expression, using anin vitrocellular model of THCA. Immunohistochemical(IHC) was used to elevate the correlation betweenCD276andFN1.FN1expression was highly correlated with progression-free survival and moderately to strongly correlated with the infiltration levels of M2 macrophages and resting memory CD4+ T cells, as well as withCD276expression. We suggest promoter hypermethylation as the mechanism underlying the observed changes inFN1expression, as 20 CpG sites in 507 THCA cases in TCGA database showed a negative correlation withFN1expression. In addition, silencingFN1expression suppressed clonogenicity, motility, invasiveness, and the expression of CD276in vitro. The correlation between FN1 and CD276 was further confirmed by immunohistochemical.Our findings show thatFN1expression levels correlate with prognosis and immune infiltration levels in THCA, suggesting thatFN1expression be used as an immunity-related biomarker and therapeutic target in THCA.Copyright © 2022 Geng, Huang, Li, Shen, Xue and Zhao."

The thesis also studies multidrug resistance-related proteins and the mechanism underlying 2-methoxyestradiol (2-ME)-induced cytotoxicity in EC109/Taxol cells was examined.In this study, the mechanisms of 2-ME-induced cytotoxicity in EC109/Taxol cells was determined by a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, flow cytometry, DNA ladder assay, DNMT activity assay, and Western blotting. The result of 2-ME-induced cytotoxicity EC109/Taxol cells is compared with that of EC109 parental cells.The results show that low concentrations of 2-ME (0.5-10 µM) inhibited cell growth, with IC50 values of 2.04 and 5.38 µmol/L in EC109/Taxol cells and EC109 parental cells after 72 hours of treatment, respectively. Exposure to 2-ME could increase G2/M cell cycle arrest and could increase apoptosis more effectively in EC109/Taxol cells than that observed in the EC109 parental cells. Furthermore, it is observed that paclitaxel resistance is associated with decreased DNMT activity. This study shows that 2-ME decreases DNMT1-mediated paclitaxel resistance by simultaneously reducing the expression of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, including phosphoglycoprotein (P-gp), breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), and multi-drug resistance protein 1 (MRP1), in EC109/Taxol cells.In this study, the co-treatment of Taxol and 2-ME to EC109 could significantly induce cytotoxic effects, whose mechanism might be associated with DNMT1 and multidrug resistance-associated proteins.2021 Translational Cancer Research.

"35145299","The threat of programmed DNA damage to neuronal genome integrity and plasticity.","Nat Genet","The neuronal genome is particularly sensitive to loss or attenuation of DNA repair, and many neurological diseases ensue when DNA repair is impaired. It is well-established that the neuronal genome is subjected to stochastic DNA damage, most likely because of extensive oxidative stress in the brain. However, recent studies have identified unexpected high levels of 'programmed' DNA breakage in neurons, which we propose arise during physiological DNA metabolic processes intrinsic to neuronal development, differentiation and maintenance. The role of programmed DNA breaks in normal neuronal physiology and disease remains relatively unexplored thus far. However, bulk and single-cell sequencing analyses of neurodegenerative diseases have revealed age-related somatic mutational signatures that are enriched in regulatory regions of the genome. Here, we explore a paradigm of DNA repair in neurons, in which the genome is safeguarded from erroneous impacts of programmed genome breakage intrinsic to normal neuronal function.© 2022.

Since many eQTLs are believed to act by altering transcription factor (TF) binding affinity, we hypothesized that analyzing eQTL effect size as a function of TF level may allow discovery of mechanisms of eQTL variability. Using GTEx Consortium eQTL data from 49 tissues, we analyzed the interaction between eQTL effect size and TF level across tissues and across individuals within specific tissues and generated a list of 10,098 TF-eQTL interactions across 2,136 genes that are supported by at least two lines of evidence. These TF-eQTLs were enriched for various TF binding measures, supporting with orthogonal evidence that these eQTLs are regulated by the implicated TFs. We also found that our TF-eQTLs tend to overlap genes with gene-by-environment regulatory effects and to colocalize with GWAS loci, implying that our approach can help to elucidate mechanisms of context-specificity and trait associations. Finally, we highlight an interesting example of IKZF1 TF regulation of an APBB1IP gene eQTL that colocalizes with a GWAS signal for blood cell traits. Together, our findings provide candidate TF mechanisms for a large number of eQTLs and offer a generalizable approach for researchers to discover TF regulators of genetic variant effects in additional QTL datasets."

MCTA-seq deconvolution analysis combining these loci detected heart-released cfDNA in MI patients at hospital admission, and showed that the prominently elevated total cfDNA level after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was derived from both the heart and white blood cells. Furthermore, for the top marker CORO6, we developed a digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) assay that clearly detected heart damage signals in cfDNA of MI patients at hospital admission.Our study provides insights into MI pathologies and developed a new ddPCR assay for detecting myocardial damage in clinical applications.© 2022.

"35034648","Association between ambient particulate matter exposure and semen quality in fertile men.","Environ Health","Several studies have suggested adverse effects of particulate matter (PM) exposure on male reproductive health; few have investigated the association between PM exposure and semen quality in a large population of fertile men.We evaluated 14 parameters of semen quality in 1554 fertile men in Nanjing from 2014 to 2016. Individual exposure to particular matter ≤10 μm in diameter (PM10) and ≤ 2.5 μm in diameter (PM2.5) during key periods of sperm development (0-90, 0-9, 10-14, 15-69, and 70-90 days before semen collection) were estimated by inverse distance weighting interpolation. Associations between PM exposure and semen quality were estimated using multivariable linear regression.Higher 90-days average PM2.5was in association with decreased sperm motility (2.21% for total motility, 1.93% for progressive motility per 10 μg/m3increase, P <  0.001) and four quantitative aspects of sperm motion (curvilinear velocity (VCL), straight line velocity (VSL), average path velocity (VAP), and amplitude of lateral head displacement (ALH), P <  0.01). The association between PM2.5exposure and semen quality were generally stronger for the earlier exposure window (70-90 days prior to ejaculation) than for recent exposure (0-9, 10-14, or 15-69 days). In the subgroup of men who had normal sperm parameters (n = 1019), similar results were obtained. Ninety-days PM10exposure was associated only with decreased VCL and VAP and was not related to sperm concentration.Exposure to PM2.5adversely affects semen quality, specifically lower sperm motility, in fertile men.© 2022.

Here, to systematically map the regulatory landscape of neural differentiation in the mouse neocortex, we profiled gene expression and chromatin accessibility in single cells and integrated these data with measurements of enhancer activity, DNA methylation and three-dimensional genome architecture in purified cell populations. This allowed us to identify thousands of new enhancers, their predicted target genes and the temporal relationships between enhancer activation, epigenome remodeling and gene expression. We characterize specific neuronal transcription factors associated with extensive and frequently coordinated changes across multiple epigenetic modalities. In addition, we functionally demonstrate a new role for Neurog2 in directly mediating enhancer activity, DNA demethylation, increasing chromatin accessibility and facilitating chromatin looping in vivo. Our work provides a global view of the gene regulatory logic of lineage specification in the cerebral cortex.© 2022. The Author(s)."

Our aim was to investigate PBN's impact on the placenta. Fischer rat dams were treated on gestation days (GD) 12 and 13 by PBN (40 mg/kg), followed by 5azaC (5 mg/kg) after one hour. Global methylation was assessed by pyrosequencing. Numerical density was calculated from immunohistochemical expression in single cells for proliferating (PCNA), oxidative (oxoguanosine) and nitrosative (nitrotyrosine) activity. Results were compared with the PBN-treated and control rats. PBN-pretreatment significantly increased placental weight at GD15 and GD20, diminished by 5azaC, and diminished apoptosis in GD 20 placentas caused by 5azaC. Oxoguanosine expression in placentas of 5azaC-treated dams was especially high in the placental labyrinth on GD 15, while PBN-pretreatment lowered its expression on GD 15 and GD 20 in both the labyrinth and basal layer. 5azaC enhanced nitrotyrosine level in the labyrinth of both gestational stages, while PBN-pretreatment lowered it. We conclude that PBN exerted its prophylactic activity against DNA hypomethylating agent 5azaC in the placenta through free radical scavenging, especially in the labyrinthine part of the placenta until the last day of pregnancy."

However, the epigenetic transmission mechanism of maternal metabolic abnormalities is still poorly understood.We established an obesity model in female mice by high-fat diet (HFD) feeding. The effects of the HFD on the developmental potential of oocytes and embryos, the metabolic phenotype, and epigenetic modifications were investigated. The efficacy of metformin administration was assessed. Finally, the regulatory pathway of epigenetic remodeling during zygotic genome activation (ZGA) was explored.Maternal HFD consumption significantly impaired glucose tolerance and increased the risk of metabolic disorders in F0 and F1 mice. Maternal HFD consumption also decreased embryonic developmental potential, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and γH2AX levels, and reduced the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) within oocytes, causing high levels of oxidative stress damage and DNA damage. Starting with this clue, we observed significantly increased RIF1 levels and shortened telomeres in obese mice. Moreover, significant abnormal DNA methylation and histone modification remodeling were observed during ZGA in obese mice, which may be coregulated by RIF1 and the ZGA marker gene MuERV-L. Metformin treatment reduced RIF1 levels, and partially improved ZGA activation status by rescuing epigenetic modification remodeling in oocytes and preimplantation embryos of obese mice. RIF1 knockdown experiments employing Trim-Away methods showed that RIF1 degradation altered the H3K4me3 and H3K9me3 enrichment and then triggered the MuERV-L transcriptional activation. Moreover, ChIP-seq data analysis of RIF1 knockouts also showed that RIF1 mediates the transcriptional regulation of MuERV-L by changing the enrichment of H3K4me3 and H3K9me3 rather than by altered DNA methylation.Elevated RIF1 in oocytes caused by maternal obesity may mediate abnormal embryonic epigenetic remodeling and increase metabolic risk in offspring by regulating histone modifications on MuERV-L, which can be partially rescued by metformin treatment.© 2022.

Whereas, the study of ferroptosis-related lncRNAs (FRLs) still few in ovarian cancer. We first constructed an FRL-signature for patients with OC in the study. A total of 548 FRLs were identified for univariate Cox regression analysis, and 21 FRLs with significant prognosis were identified. The prognostic characteristics of nine FRLs was constructed and validated, showing opposite prognosis in two subgroups based on risk scores. The multivariate Cox regression analysis and nomogram further verified the prognostic value of the risk model. By calculating ferroptosis score through ssGSEA, we found that patients with higher risk scores exhibited higher ferroptosis scores, and high ferroptosis score was a risk factor. There were 40 microenvironment cells with significant differences in the two groups, and the difference of Stromal score between the two groups was statistically significant. Six immune checkpoint genes were expressed at different levels in the two groups. In addition, five m6A regulators (FMR1, HNRNPC, METTL16, METTL3, and METTL5) were higher expressed in the low-risk group. GSEA revealed that the risk model was associated with tumor-related pathways and immune-associated pathway. We compared the sensitivity of chemotherapy drugs between the two risk groups. We also explored the co-expression, ceRNA relation, cis and trans interaction of ferroptosis-related genes and lncRNAs, providing a new idea for the regulatory mechanisms of FRLs. Moreover, the nine FRLs were selected for detecting their expression levels in OC cells and tissues.Copyright © 2022 Zheng, Guo, Wang, Zheng, Zhang and Tong."

This study evaluated the diagnostic efficacy and clinical utility of adding shear-wave elastography (SWE) to the screening of the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) category 4 breast cancer.A machine learning-based diagnostic model was constructed using data retrospectively collected from 3 independent cohorts with features selected using lasso regression and support vector machine-recursive feature elimination algorithms. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to preclude confounding baseline characteristics between malignant and benign lesions. A decision curve analysis (DCA) was used to evaluate the clinical benefit of the diagnostic model in identifying high-risk tumor patients for intervention while simultaneously avoiding overtreatment of low-risk patients with integrative evaluation using a net benefit value and treatment reduction rate.In our training center, a total of 122 patients were enrolled, and 577 breast tumors were collected. The comparison between malignant and benign lesions revealed significant differences in patient age, tumor size, resistance index (RI), and elasticity values. The maximum elasticity value (Emax) was identified as an independent diagnostic feature and was included in the diagnostic model. The combination of Emax with BI-RADS category 4 demonstrated a significantly better diagnostic efficacy than the BI-RADS category alone [BI-RADS+Emax: AUC =0.908, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.842-0.974; BI-RADS: AUC =0.862, 95% CI: 0.784-0.94; P=0.024] and significantly increased the clinical benefit for patients and policy makers by effectively reducing overdiagnosis and biopsy rates. In the BI-RADS category 4A subgroup, adding Emax to breast cancer screening benefited patients and showed a greater absolute benefit than did the BI-RADS category alone when used for patients with a higher probability of cancer (>0.403), demonstrating a 50% overtreatment reduction.Adding Emax to BI-RADS category 4 breast cancer screening using SWE significantly reduced overdiagnosis and biopsy rates compared with the BI-RADS category alone, especially for BI-RADS 4A patients.2022 Quantitative Imaging in Medicine and Surgery.

Nevertheless, the mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains indistinct. Herein, this study conducted a comprehensive analysis of the biological implications of aging-related genes in AS.Methods:Gene expression profiles of AS and non-AS samples were curated from the GEO project. Differential expression analysis was adopted for screening AS-specific aging-related genes. LASSO regression analysis was presented for constructing a diagnostic model, and the discriminatory capacity was evaluated with ROC curves. Through consensus clustering analysis, aging-based molecular subtypes were conducted. Immune levels were estimated based on the expression of HLAs, immune checkpoints, and immune cell infiltrations. Key genes were then identified via WGCNA. The effects of CEBPB knockdown on macrophage polarization were examined with western blotting and ELISA. Furthermore, macrophages were exposed to 100 mg/L ox-LDL for 48 h to induce macrophage foam cells. After silencing CEBPB, markers of cholesterol uptake, esterification and hydrolysis, and efflux were detected with western blotting.Results:This study identified 28 AS-specific aging-related genes. The aging-related gene signature was developed, which could accurately diagnose AS in both the GSE20129 (AUC = 0.898) and GSE43292 (AUC = 0.685) datasets. Based on the expression profiling of AS-specific aging-related genes, two molecular subtypes were clustered, and with diverse immune infiltration features. The molecular subtype-relevant genes were obtained with WGCNA, which were markedly associated with immune activation.

Alterations in the activity of immunologic and hallmark gene sets in adjacent nontumor tissues may have a potential influence on cell proliferation of normal lung cell after pulmonary lobectomy. We sought to discover LUAD subgroups and prognostic gene sets based on changes in gene set activity in tumor and adjacent nontumor tissues. Firstly, we used gene set variation analysis (GSVA) to characterize the activity changes of 4922 gene sets in LUAD and nontumor samples. Luckily, we identified three novel LUAD subtypes using the nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithm. In detailed, patients with subtype-3 had a favorable prognosis, but subtypes 1 and 2 had a bad prognosis. In addition, patients with subtype-3 in the validation cohort also lived longer. Meanwhile, using the LASSO-Cox algorithm, we discovered 15 prognostic gene sets in tumors (T gene sets) and two prognostic gene sets in adjacent nontumors (N gene sets). Interestingly, genes from N gene sets were related with immune response in nontumor tissues, but genes from T gene sets were correlated with DNA damaging and repairing in tumor tissues. These findings highlighted the possibility of a stronger immune response in nearby nontumor tissues. In conclusion, our study established a theoretical foundation for selecting therapy strategy for LUAD patients that should be guided by changes in activity in tumor and adjacent nontumor tissues, particularly after pulmonary lobectomy.Copyright © 2022 Feng Li et al."

A LASSO prognostic model was conducted, and the predictive performance was evaluated and externally verified in the GEO data set. Associations of the model with tumor-infiltrating immune cells, immune and stromal score, HLA and immune checkpoints, and response to chemotherapeutic agents were analyzed across rectal cancer. Biological processes underlying the model were investigated through GSVA and GSEA methods. Doxorubicin (DOX)-induced or replicative senescent stromal cells were constructed, and AGTR1 was silenced in HUVECs. After coculture with conditioned medium of HUVECs, rectal cancer cell growth and invasion were investigated.Results:An aging-related model was established, consisting of KL, BRCA1, CLU, and AGTR1, which can stratify high- and low-risk patients in terms of overall survival, disease-free survival, and progression-free interval. ROC and Cox regression analyses confirmed that the model was a robust and independent predictor. Furthermore, it was in relation to tumor immunity and stromal activation as well as predicted the responses to gemcitabine and sunitinib. AGTR1 knockdown ameliorated stromal cell senescence and suppressed senescent stromal cell-triggered rectal cancer progression.Conclusion:Our findings suggest that the aging-related gene signature was in relation to tumor immunity and stromal activation in rectal cancer, which might predict survival outcomes and immuno- and chemotherapy benefits.Copyright © 2022 Wang, Liu, Zhu, Zhang and Li."

Extraction of intersecting genes from the combined datasets and the differentially expressed genes in GSE56814 were performed to construct a multi-scale embedded gene co-expression network analysis (MEGENA) to obtain module genes. Module genes with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) >0.60 were chosen to construct the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) model to obtain feature genes. A regulated network was constructed using differentially expressed micro-RNAs (miRNAs) in GSE74209 and feature genes. Finally, key genetic pathways and pathways of the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes were identified and explored.The commonly identified differentially expressed genes involve oxidative phosphorylation and caffeine metabolism. We identified 66 modules with 2354 module genes based on MEGENA. CARD8, FOXO4, IL1R2, MPHOSPH6, MPRIP, MYOM1, PRR5L and YIPF4 were identified as feature genes by the LASSO model. Furthermore, predicted miRNA target genes included 8 genes associated with PMOP. The largest AUC was observed for FOXO4, which was found at the nexus of feature genes and miRNA-regulated genes and which correlated with the upregulation of dendritic cells. Moreover, FOXO4 was found to be involved in ABC transporters, as well as cocaine and nicotine addiction.FOXO4 may serve as potential biomarker and therapeutic target for PMOP.© 2022 Yang et al."

This study developed a prognostic model for predicting clinical outcomes of HCC. RNA and microRNA (miRNA) sequencing data of HCC were obtained from the cancer genome atlas. RNA dysregulation between HCC tumors and adjacent normal liver tissues was examined by DESeq algorithms. Survival analysis was conducted to determine the basic prognostic indicators. We identified competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) containing 15,364 pairs of mRNA-long noncoding RNA (lncRNA). An imbalanced ceRNA network comprising 8 miRNAs, 434 mRNAs, and 81 lncRNAs was developed using hypergeometric test. Functional analysis showed that these RNAs were closely associated with biosynthesis. Notably, 53 mRNAs showed a significant prognostic correlation. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator's feature selection detected four characteristic genes (SAPCD2,DKC1,CHRNA5, andUROD), based on which a four-gene independent prognostic signature for HCC was constructed using Cox regression analysis. The four-gene signature could stratify samples in the training, test, and external validation sets (p<0.01). Five-year survival area under ROC curve (AUC) in the training and validation sets was greater than 0.74. The current prognostic gene model exhibited a high stability and accuracy in predicting the overall survival (OS) of HCC patients.© 2022 Li Li et al., published by De Gruyter."

The performance of the binary classifier was evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the precision-recall (PR) curve.We identified 4072 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) based on cfDNA methylation data, and then a 10-DMR marker panel was established. The panel achieved an area under the ROC curve (AUROC) of 0.922 and an area under the PR curve (AUPR) of 0.899 in a cfDNA cohort containing 29 lung cancer and 74 normal samples, showing outstanding performance. Besides, the cfDNA-derived markers also performed well in primary tissue datasets, which were more robust than the tissue-derived markers.Our study suggested that the 10-DMR marker panel attained high accuracy and robustness and may function as a novel and promising target for lung cancer detection.Copyright © 2022 Hui Zhao et al."

One important implication of nucleosome positioning in clinical epigenetics is its use in the ""nucleosomics"" analysis of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) for the purpose of patient diagnostics in liquid biopsies. The rationale for this is that the apoptotic nucleases that digest chromatin of the dying cells mostly cut DNA between nucleosomes. Thus, the short pieces of DNA in body fluids reflect the positions of nucleosomes in the cells of origin. Here, we report a systematic nucleosomics database - NucPosDB - curating published nucleosome positioning datasets in vivo as well as datasets of sequenced cell-free DNA (cfDNA) that reflect nucleosome positioning in situ in the cells of origin. Users can select subsets of the database by a number of criteria and then obtain raw or processed data. NucPosDB also reports the originally determined regions with stable nucleosome occupancy across several individuals with a given condition. An additional section provides a catalogue of computational tools for the analysis of nucleosome positioning or cfDNA experiments and theoretical algorithms for the prediction of nucleosome positioning preferences from DNA sequence. We provide an overview of the field, describe the structure of the database in this context, and demonstrate data variability using examples of different medical conditions. NucPosDB is useful both for the analysis of fundamental gene regulation processes and the training of computational models for patient diagnostics based on cfDNA. The database currently curates ~ 400 publications on nucleosome positioning in cell lines and in situ as well as cfDNA from > 10,000 patients and healthy volunteers. For open-access cfDNA datasets as well as key MNase-seq datasets in human cells, NucPosDB allows downloading processed mapped data in addition to the regions with stable nucleosome occupancy.

This is due to their genetic and physiological similarity to humans, short generation times, availability of genetically homologous inbred strains, and relatively easy laboratory maintenance. Therefore, following the release of the initial human reference genome, the generation of the mouse reference genome was prioritised and represented an important scientific resource for the mouse genetics community. In 2002, the Mouse Genome Sequencing Consortium published an initial draft of the mouse reference genome which contained ~ 96% of the euchromatic genome of female C57BL/6 J mice. Almost two decades on from the publication of the initial draft, sequencing efforts have continued to increase the completeness and accuracy of the C57BL/6 J reference genome alongside advances in genome annotation. Additionally new sequencing technologies have provided a wealth of data that has added to the repertoire of annotations associated with traditional genomic annotations. Including but not limited to advances in regulatory elements, the 3D genome and individual cellular states. In this review we focus on the reference genome C57BL/6 J and summarise the different aspects of genomic and cellular annotations, as well as their relevance to mouse genetic research. We denote a genomic annotation as a functional unit of the genome. Cellular annotations are annotations of cell type or state, defined by the transcriptomic expression profile of a cell. Due to the wide-ranging number and diversity of annotations describing the mouse genome, we focus on gene, repeat and regulatory element annotation as well as two relatively new technologies; 3D genome architecture and single-cell sequencing outlining their utility in genetic research and their current challenges.© 2022.

"35033007","Aristotle: stratified causal discovery for omics data.","BMC Bioinformatics","There has been a simultaneous increase in demand and accessibility across genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics data, known as omics data. This has encouraged widespread application of omics data in life sciences, from personalized medicine to the discovery of underlying pathophysiology of diseases. Causal analysis of omics data may provide important insight into the underlying biological mechanisms. Existing causal analysis methods yield promising results when identifying potential general causes of an observed outcome based on omics data. However, they may fail to discover the causes specific to a particular stratum of individuals and missing from others.To fill this gap, we introduce the problem of stratified causal discovery and propose a method, Aristotle, for solving it. Aristotle addresses the two challenges intrinsic to omics data: high dimensionality and hidden stratification. It employs existing biological knowledge and a state-of-the-art patient stratification method to tackle the above challenges and applies a quasi-experimental design method to each stratum to find stratum-specific potential causes.Evaluation based on synthetic data shows better performance for Aristotle in discovering true causes under different conditions compared to existing causal discovery methods. Experiments on a real dataset on Anthracycline Cardiotoxicity indicate that Aristotle's predictions are consistent with the existing literature. Moreover, Aristotle makes additional predictions that suggest further investigations.© 2022. The Author(s)."

Therefore, revealing the critical molecules involved in HCC progression and prognosis is urgently needed. In this study, through combining public dataset and our cohort, we found a novel prognosis-related long non-coding RNA KB-68A7.1 in HCC. KB-68A7.1 was lowly expressed in HCC, whose low expression was associated with large tumour size, aggressive clinical characteristic, and poor survival. Gain- and loss-of-function assays demonstrated that KB-68A7.1 restricted HCC cellular proliferation, induced HCC cellular apoptosis, and suppressed HCC cellular migration and invasionin vitro. Xenograft assays demonstrated that KB-68A7.1 suppressed HCC tumour growth and metastasisin vivo. These functional assays suggested KB-68A7.1 as a tumour suppressor in HCC. Histone methyltransferase nuclear receptor binding SET domain-containing protein 1 (NSD1) was found to bind to KB-68A7.1. KB-68A7.1 was mainly distributed in the cytoplasm. The binding of KB-68A7.1 to NSD1 sequestrated NSD1 in the cytoplasm, leading to the reduction in nuclear NSD1 level. Through decreasing nuclear NSD1 level, KB-68A7.1 reduced di-methylation of histone H3 at lysine 36 (H3K36me2) and increased tri-methylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3) at the promoter ofWNT10B, a target of NSD1. Thus, KB-68A7.1 repressedWNT10Btranscription. The expression of WNT10B was negatively correlated with that of KB-68A7.1 in HCC tissues. Through repressing WNT10B, KB-68A7.1 further repressed Wnt/β-catenin signalling. Functional rescue assays showed that overexpression of WNT10B reversed the tumour-suppressive roles of KB-68A7.1, whereas the oncogenic roles of KB-68A7.1 depletion were abolished by Wnt/β-catenin signalling inhibitor. Overall, this study identified KB-68A7.1 as a lowly expressed and prognosis-related lncRNA in HCC, which suppressed HCC progression through binding to NSD1 and repressing Wnt/β-catenin signalling.Copyright © 2022 Zhang, Xu, Cao, Jiang and Xiong."
"35103971","The dCypher Approach to Interrogate Chromatin Reader Activity Against Posttranslational Modification-Defined Histone Peptides and Nucleosomes.","Methods Mol Biol","Bulk chromatin encompasses complex sets of histone posttranslational modifications (PTMs) that recruit (or repel) the diverse reader domains of Chromatin-Associated Proteins (CAPs) to regulate genome processes (e.g., gene expression, DNA repair, mitotic transmission). The binding preference of reader domains for their PTMs mediates localization and functional output, and are often dysregulated in disease. As such, understanding chromatin interactions may lead to novel therapeutic strategies, However the immense chemical diversity of histone PTMs, combined with low-throughput, variable, and nonquantitative methods, has defied accurate CAP characterization. This chapter provides a detailed protocol for dCypher, a novel approach for the rapid, quantitative interrogation of CAPs (as mono- or multivalent Queries) against large panels (10s to 100s) of PTM-defined histone peptide and semisynthetic nucleosomes (the potential Targets). We describe key optimization steps and controls to generate robust binding data. Further, we compare the utility of histone peptide and nucleosome substrates in CAP studies, outlining important considerations in experimental design and data interpretation.© 2022.

It is less prevalent in many other metazoan organisms and completely absent in some key model species, such as Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans. We report here a comprehensive study of the presence and absence of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) in 138 Ecdysozoa, covering Arthropoda, Nematoda, Priapulida, Onychophora, and Tardigrada. Three of these phyla have not been investigated for the presence of DNA methylation before. We observe that the loss of individual DNMTs independently occurred multiple times across ecdysozoan phyla. We computationally predict the presence of DNA methylation based on CpG rates in coding sequences using an implementation of Gaussian Mixture Modeling, MethMod. Integrating both analysis we predict two previously unknown losses of DNA methylation in Ecdysozoa, one within Chelicerata (Mesostigmata) and one in Tardigrada. In the early-branching Ecdysozoa Priapulus caudatus, we predict the presence of a full set of DNMTs and the presence of DNA methylation. We are therefore showing a very diverse and independent evolution of DNA methylation in different ecdysozoan phyla spanning a phylogenetic range of more than 700 million years.© 2022. The Author(s)."

Through an extensive meta-analysis of nine previously published microarray studies, we demonstrated that a big proportion of the detected differentially expressed genes was indeed caused by cyto-architectural alterations due to the heterogeneity in the neurodegenerative stage and/or technical artefacts. After correcting for cell composition, we identified a common signature that deregulated the previously unreported ammonium transport, as well as known biological processes such as bioenergetic pathways, response to proteotoxic stress, and immune response. By integrating with protein interaction data, we shortlisted a set of key genes, such asLRRK2,PINK1,PRKN,andFBXO7, known to be related to PD, others with compelling evidence for their role in neurodegeneration, such asGSK3β,WWOX, andVPC, and novel potential players in the PD pathogenesis. Together, these data show the importance of accounting for cyto-architecture in these analyses and highlight the contribution of multiple cell types and novel processes to PD pathology, providing potential new targets for drug development."
"35091668","What genes are differentially expressed in individuals with schizophrenia? A systematic review.","Mol Psychiatry","Schizophrenia is a severe, complex mental disorder characterized by a combination of positive symptoms, negative symptoms, and impaired cognitive function. Schizophrenia is highly heritable (~80%) with multifactorial etiology and complex polygenic genetic architecture. Despite the large number of genetic variants associated with schizophrenia, few causal variants have been established. Gaining insight into the mechanistic influences of these genetic variants may facilitate our ability to apply these findings to prevention and treatment. Though there have been more than 300 studies of gene expression in schizophrenia over the past 15 years, none of the studies have yielded consistent evidence for specific genes that contribute to schizophrenia risk. The aim of this work is to conduct a systematic review and synthesis of case-control studies of genome-wide gene expression in schizophrenia. Comprehensive literature searches were completed in PubMed, EmBase, and Web of Science, and after a systematic review of the studies, data were extracted from those that met the following inclusion criteria: human case-control studies comparing the genome-wide transcriptome of individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia to healthy controls published between January 1, 2000 and June 30, 2020 in the English language. Genes differentially expressed in cases were extracted from these studies, and overlapping genes were compared to previous research findings from the genome-wide association, structural variation, and tissue-expression studies. The transcriptome-wide analysis identified different genes than those previously reported in genome-wide association, exome sequencing, and structural variation studies of schizophrenia. Only one gene, GBP2, was replicated in five studies. Previous work has shown that this gene may play a role in immune function in the etiology of schizophrenia, which in turn could have implications for risk profiling, prevention, and treatment. This review highlights the methodological inconsistencies that impede valid meta-analyses and synthesis across studies. Standardization of the use of covariates, gene nomenclature, and methods for reporting results could enhance our understanding of the potential mechanisms through which genes exert their influence on the etiology of schizophrenia. Although these results are promising, collaborative efforts with harmonization of methodology will facilitate the identification of the role of genes underlying schizophrenia.© 2021. The Author(s)."
"35064169","Insights into the genetic architecture of haematological traits from deep phenotyping and whole-genome sequencing for two Mediterranean isolated populations.","Sci Rep","Haematological traits are linked to cardiovascular, metabolic, infectious and immune disorders, as well as cancer. Here, we examine the role of genetic variation in shaping haematological traits in two isolated Mediterranean populations. Using whole-genome sequencing data at 22× depth for 1457 individuals from Crete (MANOLIS) and 1617 from the Pomak villages in Greece, we carry out a genome-wide association scan for haematological traits using linear mixed models. We discover novel associations (p < 5 × 10-9) of five rare non-coding variants with alleles conferring effects of 1.44-2.63 units of standard deviation on red and white blood cell count, platelet and red cell distribution width. Moreover, 10.0% of individuals in the Pomak population and 6.8% in MANOLIS carry a pathogenic mutation in the Haemoglobin Subunit Beta (HBB) gene. The mutational spectrum is highly diverse (10 different mutations). The most frequent mutation in MANOLIS is the common Mediterranean variant IVS-I-110 (G>A) (rs35004220). In the Pomak population, c.364C>A (""HbO-Arab"", rs33946267) is most frequent (4.4% allele frequency). We demonstrate effects on haematological and other traits, including bilirubin, cholesterol, and, in MANOLIS, height and gestation age. We find less severe effects on red blood cell traits for HbS, HbO, and IVS-I-6 (T>C) compared to other b+ mutations. Overall, we uncover allelic diversity of HBB in Greek isolated populations and find an important role for additional rare variants outside of HBB.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35027541","An intronic transposon insertion associates with a trans-species color polymorphism in Midas cichlid fishes.","Nat Commun","Polymorphisms have fascinated biologists for a long time, but their genetic underpinnings often remain elusive. Here, we aim to uncover the genetic basis of the gold/dark polymorphism that is eponymous of Midas cichlid fish (Amphilophus spp.) adaptive radiations in Nicaraguan crater lakes. While most Midas cichlids are of the melanic ""dark morph"", about 10% of individuals lose their melanic pigmentation during their ontogeny and transition into a conspicuous ""gold morph"". Using a new haplotype-resolved long-read assembly we discover an 8.2 kb, transposon-derived inverted repeat in an intron of an undescribed gene, which we term goldentouch in reference to the Greek myth of King Midas. The gene goldentouch is differentially expressed between morphs, presumably due to structural implications of inverted repeats in both DNA and/or RNA (cruciform and hairpin formation). The near-perfect association of the insertion with the phenotype across independent populations suggests that it likely underlies this trans-specific, stable polymorphism.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35082268","Immune marker levels in severe mental disorders: associations with polygenic risk scores of related mental phenotypes and psoriasis.","Transl Psychiatry","Several lines of evidence implicate immune abnormalities in the pathophysiology of severe mental disorders (SMD) and comorbid mental disorders. Here, we use the data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of autoimmune diseases and mental phenotypes associated with SMD to disentangle genetic susceptibilities of immune abnormalities in SMD. We included 1004 patients with SMD and 947 healthy controls (HC) and measured plasma levels of IL-1Ra, sIL-2R, gp130, sTNFR-1, IL-18, APRIL, and ICAM-1. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) of six autoimmune disorders, CRP, and 10 SMD-related mental phenotypes were calculated from GWAS. General linear models were applied to assess the association of PRS with immune marker abnormalities. We found negative associations between PRS of educational attainment and IL-1Ra (P = 0.01) and IL-18 (P = 0.01). There were nominal positive associations between PRS of psoriasis and sgp130 (P = 0.02) and PRS of anxiety and IL-18 (P = 0.03), and nominal negative associations between PRS of anxiety and sIL-2R (P = 0.02) and PRS of educational attainment and sIL-2R (P = 0.03). Associations explained minor amounts of the immune marker plasma-level difference between SMD and HC. Different PRS and immune marker associations in the SMD group compared to HC were shown for PRS of extraversion and IL-1Ra ([interaction effect (IE), P = 0.002), and nominally for PRS of openness and IL-1Ra (IE, P = 0.02) and sTNFR-1 (IE, P = 0.04). Our findings indicate polygenic susceptibilities to immune abnormalities in SMD involving genetic overlap with SMD-related mental phenotypes and psoriasis. Associations might suggest immune genetic factors of SMD subgroups characterized by autoimmune or specific mental features.© 2022. The Author(s)."

Although typically observed during disease state, extant hypotheses suggest that anhedonia may also be an early risk factor for development of psychopathology. Understanding the contribution of anhedonia to the trauma-response trajectory may bolster inferences about biological mechanisms contributing to pre-trauma risk versus trauma-related symptom expression, knowledge of which could aid in targeted interventions.Using a prospective, longitudinal design in a population at risk for trauma disorders, we tested the hypothesis that anhedonia may be a pre-trauma risk factor for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms.Adult male participants from the Marine Resilience Study (N = 2,593) were assessed across three time-points (pre-deployment, 3-month and 6-month post-deployment). An anhedonia factor was extracted from self-report instruments pre-trauma and tested for its relationship with development of PTSD re-experiencing symptoms after deployment.Higher pre-deployment anhedonia predicted increased PTSD intrusive re-experiencing symptoms at 3- and 6-months post-deployment when controlling for pre-trauma PTSD and depression symptoms. Depression symptoms were not significant predictors of subsequent PTSD intrusive re-experiencing symptoms. Anhedonia at 3 mo also robustly predicted maintenance of PTSD intrusive re-experiencing symptoms at the 6 mo time point.Pre-deployment anhedonia may be a pre-trauma risk factor for PTSD, not simply a state-dependent effect of trauma exposure and PTSD symptom expression. Anhedonia may contribute to persistence and/or chronicity of re-experiencing symptoms after the emergence of PTSD symptoms.© 2022 The Author(s).

"35091705","Perinatal and early childhood biomarkers of psychosocial stress and adverse experiences.","Pediatr Res","The human brain develops through a complex interplay of genetic and environmental influences. During critical periods of development, experiences shape brain architecture, often with long-lasting effects. If experiences are adverse, the effects may include the risk of mental and physical disease, whereas positive environments may increase the likelihood of healthy outcomes. Understanding how psychosocial stress and adverse experiences are embedded in biological systems and how we can identify markers of risk may lead to discovering new approaches to improve patient care and outcomes. Biomarkers can be used to identify specific intervention targets and at-risk children early when physiological system malleability increases the likelihood of intervention success. However, identifying reliable biomarkers has been challenging, particularly in the perinatal period and the first years of life, including in preterm infants. This review explores the landscape of psychosocial stress and adverse experience biomarkers. We highlight potential benefits and challenges of identifying risk clinically and different sub-signatures of stress, and in their ability to inform targeted interventions. Finally, we propose that the combination of preterm birth and adversity amplifies the risk for abnormal development and calls for a focus on this group of infants within the field of psychosocial stress and adverse experience biomarkers. IMPACT: Reviews the landscape of biomarkers of psychosocial stress and adverse experiences in the perinatal period and early childhood and highlights the potential benefits and challenges of their clinical utility in identifying risk status in children, and in developing targeted interventions. Explores associations between psychosocial stress and adverse experiences in childhood with prematurity and identifies potential areas of assessment and intervention to improve outcomes in this at-risk group.© 2022.

IDD is known to be associating with a complex process involving in extracellular matrix and cellular damage, and in recent years, there is increasing evidence that oxidative stress is an important activation mechanism of IDD and that reactive oxygen and reactive nitrogen species regulate matrix metabolism, proinflammatory phenotype, autophagy and senescence in intervertebral disc cells, apoptosis, autophagy, and senescence. Despite the tremendous efforts of researchers within the field of IDD pathogenesis, the proven strategies to prevent and treat this disease are still very limited. Up to now, several antioxidants have been proved to be effective for alleviating IDD. In this article, we discussed that oxidative stress accelerates disc degeneration by influencing aging, inflammation, autophagy, and DNA methylation, and summarize some antioxidant therapeutic measures for IDD, indicating that antioxidant therapy for disc degeneration holds excellent promise.Copyright © 2022 Guoshuai Cao et al."

We evaluated newly-diagnosed MM patients in the CoMMpass dataset and divided them into three groups: genomic high-risk (GHR) group for patients with t(4;14) or t(14;16) or complete loss of functional TP53 (bi-allelic deletion of TP53 or mono-allelic deletion of 17p13 (del17p13) and TP53 mutation) or 1q21 gain and International Staging System (ISS) stage 3; FHR group for patients who had no markers of GHR group but were refractory to induction therapy or had early relapse within 12 months; and standard-risk (SR) group for patients who did not fulfill any of the criteria for GHR or FHR. FHR patients had the worst survival. FHR patients are characterized by increased mutations affecting the IL-6/JAK/STAT3 pathway, and a gene expression profile associated with aberrant mitosis and DNA damage response. This is also corroborated by the association with the mutational signature associated with abnormal DNA damage response. We have also developed a machine learning based classifier that can identify most of these patients at diagnosis.© 2022. The Author(s)."

Assessing the cluster of cell nuclei is essential for pathological investigation. In this study, we present a computer-based method for cluster analyses of cell nuclei and performed traditional (i.e., unsupervised method) and modern (i.e., supervised method) artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for distinguishing the grade groups of PCa. Two datasets on PCa were collected to carry out this research. Histopathology samples were obtained from whole slides stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). In this research, state-of-the-art approaches were proposed for color normalization, cell nuclei segmentation, feature selection, and classification. A traditional minimum spanning tree (MST) algorithm was employed to identify the clusters and better capture the proliferation and community structure of cell nuclei. K-medoids clustering and stacked ensemble machine learning (ML) approaches were used to perform traditional and modern AI-based classification. The binary and multiclass classification was derived to compare the model quality and results between the grades of PCa. Furthermore, a comparative analysis was carried out between traditional and modern AI techniques using different performance metrics (i.e., statistical parameters). Cluster features of the cell nuclei can be useful information for cancer grading. However, further validation of cluster analysis is required to accomplish astounding classification results."
"35085849","Comprehensive summary of mitochondrial DNA alterations in the postmortem human brain: A systematic review.","EBioMedicine","Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) encodes 37 genes necessary for synthesizing 13 essential subunits of the oxidative phosphorylation system. mtDNA alterations are known to cause mitochondrial disease (MitD), a clinically heterogeneous group of disorders that often present with neuropsychiatric symptoms. Understanding the nature and frequency of mtDNA alterations in health and disease could be a cornerstone in disentangling the relationship between biochemical findings and clinical symptoms of brain disorders. This systematic review aimed to summarize the mtDNA alterations in human brain tissue reported to date that have implications for further research on the pathophysiological significance of mtDNA alterations in brain functioning.We searched the PubMed and Embase databases using distinct terms related to postmortem human brain and mtDNA up to June 10, 2021. Reports were eligible if they were empirical studies analysing mtDNA in postmortem human brains.A total of 158 of 637 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were clustered into the following groups: MitD (48 entries), neurological diseases (NeuD, 55 entries), psychiatric diseases (PsyD, 15 entries), a miscellaneous group with controls and other clinical diseases (5 entries), ageing (20 entries), and technical issues (5 entries). Ten entries were ascribed to more than one group. Pathogenic single nucleotide variants (pSNVs), both homo- or heteroplasmic variants, have been widely reported in MitD, with heteroplasmy levels varying among brain regions; however, pSNVs are rarer in NeuD, PsyD and ageing. A lower mtDNA copy number (CN) in disease was described in most, but not all, of the identified studies. mtDNA deletions were identified in individuals in the four clinical categories and ageing. Notably, brain samples showed significantly more mtDNA deletions and at higher heteroplasmy percentages than blood samples, and several of the deletions present in the brain were not detected in the blood. Finally, mtDNA heteroplasmy, mtDNA CN and the deletion levels varied depending on the brain region studied.mtDNA alterations are well known to affect human tissues, including the brain. In general, we found that studies of MitD, NeuD, PsyD, and ageing were highly variable in terms of the type of disease or ageing process investigated, number of screened individuals, studied brain regions and technology used. In NeuD and PsyD, no particular type of mtDNA alteration could be unequivocally assigned to any specific disease or diagnostic group. However, the presence of mtDNA deletions and mtDNA CN variation imply a role for mtDNA in NeuD and PsyD. Heteroplasmy levels and threshold effects, affected brain regions, and mitotic segregation patterns of mtDNA alterations may be involved in the complex inheritance of NeuD and PsyD and in the ageing process. Therefore, more information is needed regarding the type of mtDNA alteration, the affected brain regions, the heteroplasmy levels, and their relationship with clinical phenotypes and the ageing process.Hospital Universitari Institut Pere Mata; Institut d'Investigació Sanitària Pere Virgili; Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación (PI18/00514).Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).

We conducted a single-arm, non-randomized, phase II trial (NCT03104439) combining radiation, ipilimumab and nivolumab to treat patients with metastatic MSS CRC (n = 40) and PDAC (n = 25) with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1. The primary endpoint was disease control rate (DCR) by intention to treat. DCRs were 25% for CRC (ten of 40; 95% confidence interval (CI), 13-41%) and 20% for PDAC (five of 25; 95% CI, 7-41%). In the per-protocol analysis, defined as receipt of radiation, DCR was 37% (ten of 27; 95% CI, 19-58%) in CRC and 29% (five of 17; 95% CI, 10-56%) in PDAC. Pretreatment biopsies revealed low tumor mutational burden for all samples but higher numbers of natural killer (NK) cells and expression of the HERVK repeat RNA in patients with disease control.

"35118386","The contribution of uncharted RNA sequences to tumor identity in lung adenocarcinoma.","NAR Cancer","The identity of cancer cells is defined by the interplay between genetic, epigenetic transcriptional and post-transcriptional variation. A lot of this variation is present in RNA-seq data and can be captured at once using reference-free, k-mer analysis. An important issue with k-mer analysis, however, is the difficulty of distinguishing signal from noise. Here, we use two independent lung adenocarcinoma datasets to identify all reproducible events at the k-mer level, in a tumor versus normal setting. We find reproducible events in many different locations (introns, intergenic, repeats) and forms (spliced, polyadenylated, chimeric etc.). We systematically analyze events that are ignored in conventional transcriptomics and assess their value as biomarkers and for tumor classification, survival prediction, neoantigen prediction and correlation with the immune microenvironment. We find that unannotated lincRNAs, novel splice variants, endogenous HERV, Line1 and Alu repeats and bacterial RNAs each contribute to different, important aspects of tumor identity. We argue that differential RNA-seq analysis of tumor/normal sample collections would benefit from this type k-mer analysis to cast a wider net on important cancer-related events.

An unbiased coexpression network was established to evaluate module-trait relationships by using weight gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA). Global regulatory network was constructed to predict the protein-protein interaction. Further cross-talking pathways of PIK3CB were identified by functional enrichment analysis.The mean expression of PIK3CB in AD patients was significantly lower than those in nondementia controls. We identified 2,385 DEGs from 16,790 background genes in AD/control and PIK3CB-low/high groups. Five coexpression modules were established using WGCNA, which participated in apoptosis, axon guidance, long-term potentiation (LTP), regulation of actin cytoskeleton, synaptic vesicle cycle, FoxO, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling pathways. DEGs with strong relation to AD and low PIK3CB expression were extracted to construct a global regulatory network, in which cross-talking pathways of PIK3CB were identified, such as apoptosis, axon guidance, and FoxO signaling pathway. The occurrence of AD could be accurately predicted by low PIK3CB based on the area under the curve of 71.7%.These findings highlight downregulated PIK3CB as a potential causative factor of AD, possibly mediated via apoptosis, axon guidance, and FoxO signaling pathway.Copyright © 2022 Zhike Zhou et al."

The obligatory parthenogenetic marbled crayfish, Procambarus virginalis, whose genome and methylome are fully established, proved very suitable to study this issue in detail. Comparison between developmental stages and DNA methylation revealed low expression of Dnmt methylation and Tet demethylation enzymes from the spawned oocyte to the 256 cell embryo and considerably increased expression thereafter. The global 5-methylcytosine level was 2.78% at mid-embryonic development and decreased slightly to 2.41% in 2-year-old adults. Genetically identical clutch-mates raised in the same uniform laboratory setting showed broad variation in morphological, behavioural and life history traits and differences in DNA methylation. The invasion of diverse habitats in tropical to cold-temperate biomes in the last 20 years by the marbled crayfish was associated with the expression of significantly different phenotypic traits and DNA methylation patterns, despite extremely low genetic variation on the whole genome scale, suggesting the establishment of epigenetic ecotypes. The evolution of marbled crayfish from its parent species Procambarus fallax by autotriploidy a few decades ago was accompanied by a significant increase in body size, fertility and life span, a 20% reduction of global DNA methylation and alteration of methylation in hundreds of genes, suggesting that epigenetic mechanisms were involved in speciation and fitness enhancement. The combined analysis of phenotypic traits and DNA methylation across multiple biological contexts in the laboratory and field in marbled crayfish may serve as a blueprint for uncovering the role of epigenetic mechanisms in shaping of phenotypes in macro-invertebrates.© 2021.

"35078993","Selective translation of epigenetic modifiers affects the temporal pattern and differentiation of neural stem cells.","Nat Commun","The cerebral cortex is formed by diverse neurons generated sequentially from neural stem cells (NSCs). A clock mechanism has been suggested to underlie the temporal progression of NSCs, which is mainly defined by the transcriptome and the epigenetic state. However, what drives such a developmental clock remains elusive. We show that translational control of histone H3 trimethylation in Lys27 (H3K27me3) modifiers is part of this clock. We find that depletion of Fbl, an rRNA methyltransferase, reduces translation of both Ezh2 methyltransferase and Kdm6b demethylase of H3K27me3 and delays the progression of the NSC state. These defects are partially phenocopied by simultaneous inhibition of H3K27me3 methyltransferase and demethylase, indicating the role of Fbl in the genome-wide H3K27me3 pattern. Therefore, we propose that Fbl drives the intrinsic clock through the translational enhancement of the H3K27me3 modifiers that predominantly define the NSC state.© 2022. The Author(s)."

There is growing evidence that short structural variations (SSVs) residing in frequently overlooked genomic regions can contribute to complex disease mechanisms and can explain, in part, the phenotypic variability in ALS patients. Here, we discuss SSVs recently characterized by our laboratory and how these discoveries integrate into the current literature on ALS, particularly in the context of application to future clinical trials. These markers may help to identify and differentiate patients for clinical trials that have a similar ALS disease mechanism(s), thereby reducing the impact of participant heterogeneity.

Molecular profiling of ctDNA is often performed using targeted sequencing or low-coverage whole genome sequencing (WGS) to identify tumour specific somatic mutations or somatic copy number aberrations (sCNAs). However, these approaches cannot efficiently detect all tumour-derived genomic changes in ctDNA.We performed WGS analysis of cfDNA from 4 breast cancer patients and 2 patients with benign tumours. We sequenced matched germline DNA for all 6 patients and tumour samples from the breast cancer patients. All samples were sequenced on Illumina HiSeqXTen sequencing platform and achieved approximately 30x, 60x and 100x coverage on germline, tumour and plasma DNA samples, respectively.The mutational burden of the plasma samples (1.44 somatic mutations/Mb of genome) was higher than the matched tumour samples. However, 90% of high confidence somatic cfDNA variants were not detected in matched tumour samples and were found to comprise two background plasma mutational signatures. In contrast, cfDNA from the di-nucleosome fraction (300 bp-350 bp) had much higher proportion (30%) of variants shared with tumour. Despite high coverage sequencing we were unable to detect sCNAs in plasma samples.Deep sequencing analysis of plasma samples revealed higher fraction of unique somatic mutations in plasma samples, which were not detected in matched tumour samples. Sequencing of di-nucleosome bound cfDNA fragments may increase recovery of tumour mutations from plasma.© 2022. The Author(s)."

Despite the fact that changes in glycosylation patterns during tumour progression have been reported, no systematic approach has been conducted to evaluate its potential for patient stratification. By analysing publicly available transcriptomic data of patient samples and cell lines, we identified here two specific glycan profiles in PDAC that correlated with progression, clinical outcome and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) status. These different glycan profiles, confirmed by glycomics, can be distinguished by the expression of O-glycan fucosylated structures, present only in epithelial cells and regulated by the expression of GALNT3. Moreover, these fucosylated glycans can serve as ligands for DC-SIGN positive tumour-associated macrophages, modulating their activation and inducing the production of IL-10. Our results show mechanisms by which the glyco-code contributes to the tolerogenic microenvironment in PDAC.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35071145","Leptin Concentration, Obesity, and Plasma Non-esterified Fatty Acid Levels in Children.","Front Pediatr","The association between obesity and higher non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) levels has been established in adults. In contrast, lower NEFA levels have been described in children with obesity although the reason behind this association remains unclear. Leptin, which regulates body weight and plays a role in lipolysis, could be involved in this relationship. We evaluated the influence of leptin in the association between obesity and NEFA concentrations in children, analyzing two cohorts including 684 6- to 8-year-olds and 836 12- to 16-year-old children, respectively. After adjusting by leptin, insulin levels remained significantly higher in adolescents with obesity as compared with levels in those without obesity. However, insulin levels showed no differences between prepubertal children with and without obesity. The significantly lower NEFA concentrations observed in 6- to 8-year-old girls with obesity disappeared when comparing NEFA levels between girls with and without obesity after adjusting by leptin.

"35132128","Placental proteins with predicted roles in fetal development decrease in premature infants.","Pediatr Res","Emerging evidence from animal experiments indicate that factors secreted by the placenta are critical for normal fetal organ development. Our objective was to characterize the umbilical vein and artery proteome in preterm infants and identify proteins that decrease in the neonatal circulation following delivery.Cord blood at delivery and neonatal blood at 48-72 h of life was collected in 25 preterm infants. Plasma protein abundance was determined using the SomaLogic platform.When comparing protein levels of umbilical venous to arterial cord blood, 434 proteins were significantly higher indicating placental secretion into the fetal circulation. Moreover, when comparing neonatal blood to umbilical vein levels, 142 proteins were significantly lower. These proteins included Endoplasmic reticulum resident protein 29, CD59, Fibroblast growth factor 2 and Dynactin subunit 2, which are involved in brain development and prevention of brain damage as well as Fibroblast growth factor 1 which prevents lung fibrosis.The late second trimester human placenta secretes proteins into the fetal circulation which decrease following delivery. Many of these proteins are predicted to be important in the development of fetal organs. Further studies are needed to directly link placental proteins to organ development and poor outcomes in preterm infants.Prematurity remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality requiring the development of novel treatments. Emerging evidence from animal studies suggest that factors secreted from the placenta may be critical in the development of the fetus. We report that the preterm human placenta secretes an array of proteins into the fetal circulation. Some of these proteins are predicted to be involved in the development of the brain and the lung. When born prematurely, infants are deprived of these placental proteins, which may contribute to their poor outcomes.© 2022.

These biomarkers address, however, only a very limited subset of cardiovascular diseases, such as acute myocardial infarct or acute deep vein thrombosis, and clinical plasma biomarkers for the diagnosis and stratification cardiovascular diseases that are growing in incidence, such as heart failure and abdominal aortic aneurysm, do not exist and are urgently needed. The discovery of novel biomarkers in plasma has been hindered by the complexity of the human plasma proteome that again transforms into an extreme analytical complexity when it comes to the discovery of novel plasma biomarkers. This complexity is, however, addressed by recent achievements in technologies for analyzing the human plasma proteome, thereby facilitating the possibility for novel biomarker discoveries. The aims of this article is to provide an overview of the recent achievements in technologies for proteomic analysis of the human plasma proteome and their applications in cardiovascular medicine."

It has been noticed that epigenetic modification and chromatin architecture may participate in the regulation process. However, the regulation patterns and functional elements of long-range gene regulation are unclear.Based on the clinical transcriptome data from different tumor sets, a novel expressional correlation analysis pipeline was performed to classify the co-regulated regions and subsets of intercorrelated regions. The GLAM2 program was used to predict conserved DNA elements that enriched in regions. Two conserved elements were selected to delete in Ishikawa and HeLa cells by CRISPR-Cas9. SAHA treatment and HDAC knockdown were used to change the histone acetylation status. Using qPCR, MTT, and scratch healing assay, we evaluate the effect on gene expression and cancer cell phenotype. By DNA pull-down and ChIP, the element-binding proteins were testified. 3C and 3D-FISH were performed to depict the alteration in chromatin architecture.In multiple cancer genomes, we classified subsets of coordinately regulated regions (sub-CRRs) that possibly shared the same regulatory mechanisms and exhibited similar expression patterns. A new conserved DNA element (CRE30) was enriched in sub-CRRs and associated with cancer patient survival. CRE30 could restrict gene regulation in sub-CRRs and affect cancer cell phenotypes. DNA pull-down showed that multiple proteins including CTCF were recruited on the CRE30 locus, and ChIP assay confirmed the CTCF-binding signals. Subsequent results uncovered that as an essential element, CRE30 maintained chromatin loops and mediated a compact chromatin architecture. Moreover, we found that blocking global histone deacetylation induced chromatin loop disruption and CTCF dropping in the region containing CRE30, linked to promoted gene regulation. Additionally, similar effects were observed with CRE30 deletion in another locus of chromosome 8.Our research clarified a new functional element that recruits CTCF and collaborates with histone deacetylation to maintain high-order chromatin organizations, linking to long-range gene regulation in cancer genomes. The findings highlight a close relationship among conserved DNA element, epigenetic modification, and chromatin architecture in long-range gene regulation process.Copyright © 2022 Tang, Li, Han, Li, Lin, Sun, Zhang, Jiang, Nie and Li."
"35082783","Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress-Associated Neuronal Death and Innate Immune Response in Neurological Diseases.","Front Immunol","Neuronal death and inflammatory response are two common pathological hallmarks of acute central nervous system injury and chronic degenerative disorders, both of which are closely related to cognitive and motor dysfunction associated with various neurological diseases. Neurological diseases are highly heterogeneous; however, they share a common pathogenesis, that is, the aberrant accumulation of misfolded/unfolded proteins within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Fortunately, the cell has intrinsic quality control mechanisms to maintain the proteostasis network, such as chaperone-mediated folding and ER-associated degradation. However, when these control mechanisms fail, misfolded/unfolded proteins accumulate in the ER lumen and contribute to ER stress. ER stress has been implicated in nearly all neurological diseases. ER stress initiates the unfolded protein response to restore proteostasis, and if the damage is irreversible, it elicits intracellular cascades of death and inflammation. With the growing appreciation of a functional association between ER stress and neurological diseases and with the improved understanding of the multiple underlying molecular mechanisms, pharmacological and genetic targeting of ER stress are beginning to emerge as therapeutic approaches for neurological diseases.Copyright © 2022 Shi, Chai, Zhang and Chen."

The purpose of this study was to explore whether the cognitive heterogeneity in aging was related to the subgroups of successful and usual aging.Participants were a representative sample of normal older adults (n = 65, age range 70-89 years). All subjects had participated in the third phase of the Nord-Trøndelag Health Survey (HUNT3) and completed all subtests in the Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS-III) and Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-III). Successful aging was defined in four ways in the study: as (1) absence of disease, (2) high functioning, (3) active engagement with life, or (4) all three components combined. Five domains of memory and intelligence functions were investigated using linear regression analysis, with group membership (successful versus usual aging) as predictors and age, sex and education as correlates.Processing speed performance was correlated with the successful aging component absence of disease, younger age and being of the female sex, while working memory performance was correlated with the successful aging component absence of disease and more years of education. Performance in other domains (verbal, visuospatial, and episodic memory) were not related to any successful aging definition. Age had a consistent negative effect on the processing speed domain for all successful aging definitions. Education was positively linked to cognitive performance on the verbal and working memory domains. Being female was positively linked to processing speed and episodic memory.Processing speed and working memory were linked to successful aging when it was defined as absence of disease, but not by other components of successful aging, i.e. domain-specific. In contrast, other cognitive domains were not related to any components of successful aging.© 2022. The Author(s)."

Differences between sexes have been observed in other infectious diseases and in the response to vaccines. Sex-specific expression patterns of proteins mediating virus binding and entry, and divergent reactions of the immune and endocrine system, in particular the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, in response to acute stress might explain the higher severity of COVID-19 in men. In this Personal View, we discuss how sex hormones, comorbidities, and the sex chromosome complement influence these mechanisms in the context of COVID-19. Due to its role in the severity and progression of SARS-CoV-2 infections, we argue that sexual dimorphism has potential implications for disease treatment, public health measures, and follow-up of patients predisposed to the development of long COVID. We suggest that sex differences could be considered in future pandemic surveillance and treatment of patients with COVID-19 to help to achieve better disease stratification and improved outcomes.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

The concept of circulating tumor cells (CTCs), which describes the tumor cells diffusing into the blood, is being increasingly recognized for its role in cancer metastasis as well as it is considered the key step of tumor blood metastasis. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is the reverse transition from mesenchymal phenotypes to an epithelial one. Tumor cells undergoing this process have stronger metastatic potential. Though the biological characteristics of CTCs after EMT can help explain the unknown phenomena in tumor metastasis, the biomarkers of CTCs after EMT are not accurate. Also the correlation between CTCs after EMT and the prognosis of patients and the dynamic transformation of cell groups during treatment are not clear. Tumor metastasis initiating cells (MIC), which eventually lead to metastasis in CTCs, are types of cancer stem cells, or at least tumor cells with many stem cell characteristics. Further investigation of the maintenance of tumor stem cell characteristics of CTCs is required. The circulating tumor microemboli (CTM) can prevent CTCs from losing their nests, and the presence of host cells facilitates special metastasis and helps tumor cells escape immune surveillance. In this paper, we reviewed research on the biological cytological characteristics of CTCs in recent years, and provided relevant supporting evidence for monitoring tumor recurrence, assessing patient prognosis, evaluating the sensitivity of anti-tumor biological drugs, and selecting an individualized treatment plan.2021 Translational Cancer Research.

Integrating the resulting multimodal single-cell datasets is a new bioinformatics challenge. Equally important, it is a new experimental design challenge for the bench scientist, who is not only choosing from a myriad of techniques for each data modality but also faces new challenges in experimental design. The ultimate goal is to design, execute, and analyze multimodal single-cell experiments that are more than just descriptive but enable the learning of new causal and mechanistic biology. This objective requires strict consideration of the goals behind the analysis, which might range from mapping the heterogeneity of a cellular population to assembling system-wide causal networks that can further our understanding of cellular functions and eventually lead to models of tissues and organs. We review steps and challenges toward this goal. Single-cell transcriptomics is now a mature technology, and methods to measure proteins, lipids, small-molecule metabolites, and other molecular phenotypes at the single-cell level are rapidly developing. Integrating these single-cell readouts so that each cell has measurements of multiple types of data, e.g., transcriptomes, proteomes, and metabolomes, is expected to allow identification of highly specific cellular subpopulations and to provide the basis for inferring causal biological mechanisms.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

However, current understanding of post-PICU psychological outcomes is incomplete.To systematically review and evaluate reported long-term psychological outcomes among children previously admitted to the PICU.A systematic search of the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Embase, MEDLINE (PubMed), and PsycINFO was conducted from database inception to June 2021. Search terms included phrases related to intensive care (eg, intensive care units and critical care) and terms for psychological disorders (eg, posttraumatic stress disorder, depressive disorder, conduct disorder, and neurodevelopmental disorder) limited to the pediatric population.This systematic review and meta-analysis included randomized clinical trials and observational studies reporting psychological disorders among children younger than 18 years who were admitted to the PICU with follow-up for at least 3 months. Psychological disorders were defined using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fifth Edition). Children were excluded if they were admitted to the PICU for primary brain conditions (eg, traumatic brain injury, meningoencephalitis, and brain tumors) or discharged to the home for palliative care.Titles and abstracts were independently screened by 2 reviewers, with data extraction conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) reporting guideline. Data were pooled using a random-effects model during meta-analysis.Age-corrected IQ scores and long-term psychological outcomes measured by scales such as the Child Behavior Checklist (higher scores indicate more behavioral problems) among children admitted to the PICU.Of 9193 records identified, 31 independent studies (5 randomized clinical trials and 26 observational studies) involving 7786 children (mean age, 7.3 years [95% CI, 6.2-8.4 years]; 4267 boys [54.8%]; race and ethnicity were not reported by all studies) admitted to the PICU were included. Overall, 1 of 19 children (5.3%) to 14 of 16 children (88.0%) previously admitted to the PICU were reported to have at least 1 psychological disorder. Studies that examined posttraumatic stress disorder reported that 6 of 60 children (10.0%) to 31 of 102 children (30.4%) met the diagnostic criteria for the disorder at 3 to 6 months of follow-up. Compared with healthy children, those admitted to the PICU had lower IQ scores at 1 to 2 years of follow-up (mean, 89.40 points [95% CI, 88.33-90.47 points] vs 100.70 points [95% CI, 99.43-101.97 points]; P < .001) and 3 to 5 years of follow-up (mean, 88.54 points [95% CI, 83.92-93.16 points] vs 103.18 [95% CI, 100.36-105.99 points]; P < .001) and greater total emotional and behavioral problems at 4 years of follow-up (mean, 51.69 points [95% CI, 50.37-53.01 points] vs 46.66 points [95% CI, 45.20-48.13 points]; P < .001).This systematic review and meta-analysis found a high burden of psychological sequelae among children previously admitted to the PICU, suggesting that risk stratification and early interventions are needed for high-risk groups."

Intermediates of the one-carbon cycle (1CC), which is duplicated in the cytoplasm and mitochondria, have a major role in modulating the impact of diet on the epigenome. Moreover, epigenetic pathways and the redox system are linked by the metabolism of glutathione (GSH). In a cohort of 101 normal-weight and 97 overweight/obese subjects, we evaluated mtDNAcn and methylation levels in both mitochondrial and nuclear areas to test the association of these marks with body weight, metabolic profile, and availability of 1CC intermediates associated with diet. Body composition was associated with 1CC intermediate availability. Reduced levels of GSH were measured in the overweight/obese group (p= 1.3∗10-5). A high BMI was associated with lower LINE-1 (p= 0.004) and nominally lower methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene methylation (p= 0.047). mtDNAcn was lower in overweight/obese subjects (p= 0.004) and independently correlated withMTHFRmethylation levels (p= 0.005) but not to LINE-1 methylation levels (p= 0.086). DNA methylation has been detected in the light strand but not in the heavy strand of the mtDNA. Although mtDNA methylation in the light strand did not differ between overweight/obese and normal-weight subjects, it was nominally correlated with homocysteine levels (p= 0.035) andMTHFRmethylation (p= 0.033). This evidence suggests that increased body weight might perturb mitochondrial-nuclear homeostasis affecting the availability of nutrients acting as intermediates of the one-carbon cycle.Copyright © 2022 Laura Bordoni et al."

"35078341","Cluster mean-field theory accurately predicts statistical properties of large-scale DNA methylation patterns.","J R Soc Interface","The accurate establishment and maintenance of DNA methylation patterns is vital for mammalian development and disruption to these processes causes human disease. Our understanding of DNA methylation mechanisms has been facilitated by mathematical modelling, particularly stochastic simulations. Megabase-scale variation in DNA methylation patterns is observed in development, cancer and ageing and the mechanisms generating these patterns are little understood. However, the computational cost of stochastic simulations prevents them from modelling such large genomic regions. Here, we test the utility of three different mean-field models to predict summary statistics associated with large-scale DNA methylation patterns. By comparison to stochastic simulations, we show that a cluster mean-field model accurately predicts the statistical properties of steady-state DNA methylation patterns, including the mean and variance of methylation levels calculated across a system of CpG sites, as well as the covariance and correlation of methylation levels between neighbouring sites. We also demonstrate that a cluster mean-field model can be used within an approximate Bayesian computation framework to accurately infer model parameters from data. As mean-field models can be solved numerically in a few seconds, our work demonstrates their utility for understanding the processes underpinning large-scale DNA methylation patterns."

Serine proteinase inhibitor A3 (SERPINA3) plays crucial roles in multiple human diseases; however, its role in alcohol dependence clinical practice has not been confirmed.Methods:We screened Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) expression profiles, and identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were generated using STRING and Cytoscape, and the key clustering module was identified using the MCODE plugin.SERPINA3-based target microRNA prediction was performed using online databases. Functional enrichment analysis was performed. Fifty-eight patients with alcohol dependence and 20 healthy controls were recruited. Clinical variables were collected and follow-up was conducted for 8 months for relapse.Results:SERPINA3was identified as a DEG.ELANEand miR-137 were identified after PPI analysis. The enriched functions and pathways included acute inflammatory response, response to stress, immune response, and terpenoid backbone biosynthesis.SERPINA3concentrations were significantly elevated in the alcohol dependence group than in healthy controls (P< 0.001). According to the median value ofSERPINA3expression level in alcohol dependence group, patients were divided into highSERPINA3(≥2677.33 pg/ml,n= 29) and lowSERPINA3groups (<2677.33 pg/ml,n= 29). Binary logistic analysis indicated that IL-6 was statistically significant (P= 0.015) Kaplan-Meier survival analysis did not indicate any difference in event-free survival between patients with low and highSERPINA3levels (P= 0.489) after 8 months of follow-up. Receiver characteristic curve analysis revealed thatSERPINA3had an area under the curve of 0.921 (P< 0.0001), with a sensitivity and specificity of 93.1 and 80.0%, respectively. Cox regression analysis revealed that aspartate transaminase level was a negative predictor of relapse (β = 0.003; hazard ratio = 1.003;P= 0.03).Conclusions:SERPINA3level was remarkably elevated in patients with alcohol dependence than healthy controls, indicating thatSERPINA3is correlated with alcohol dependence. However,SERPINA3may not be a potential predictive marker of relapse with patients in alcohol dependence.Copyright © 2022 Zhang, Wang, Huang, Zhu, Xue and Hu."

To investigate the early biomarkers of air pollution exposure, a panel study of eight college students recorded after a business trip from Qingdao to Shijiazhuang and back to Qingdao was performed in this work. The concentration of PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, and CO in Shijiazhuang was higher than that in Qingdao during the study period. The platelet count was positively correlated with air pollutants of 0-6 day moving averages (βPM2.5= 88.90; βPM10= 61.83; βSO2= 41.13; βNO2= 57.70; βCO= 62.99, respectively, for an IQR increased). Additionally, internal dose biomarkers 2-OHNa, 1-OHNa, 2-OHFlu, 2,3-OHPhe, and ∑PAHs were also significantly associated with platelet count in participants. Furthermore, PM2.5and PM10are positively linked with methylation of one CpG site at platelet mitochondrial geneCO2(PM2.5= 0.47; PM10= 0.25, respectively, for an IQR increase). Both platelet counts and methylation levels returned to their pre-exposure levels after leaving the highly contaminated area. In short, this study investigated the relationship between platelet properties and air pollution exposure, revealing that short-term exposure to air pollution might increase the risk of thrombosis.

"35082597","Evolution of the Neocortex Through RNA-Binding Proteins and Post-transcriptional Regulation.","Front Neurosci","The human neocortex is undoubtedly considered a supreme accomplishment in mammalian evolution. It features a prenatally established six-layered structure which remains plastic to the myriad of changes throughout an organism's lifetime. A fundamental feature of neocortical evolution and development is the abundance and diversity of the progenitor cell population and their neuronal and glial progeny. These evolutionary upgrades are partially enabled due to the progenitors' higher proliferative capacity, compartmentalization of proliferative regions, and specification of neuronal temporal identities. The driving force of these processes may be explained by temporal molecular patterning, by which progenitors have intrinsic capacity to change their competence as neocortical neurogenesis proceeds. Thus, neurogenesis can be conceptualized along two timescales of progenitors' capacity to (1) self-renew or differentiate into basal progenitors (BPs) or neurons or (2) specify their fate into distinct neuronal and glial subtypes which participate in the formation of six-layers. Neocortical development then proceeds through sequential phases of proliferation, differentiation, neuronal migration, and maturation. Temporal molecular patterning, therefore, relies on the precise regulation of spatiotemporal gene expression. An extensive transcriptional regulatory network is accompanied by post-transcriptional regulation that is frequently mediated by the regulatory interplay between RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). RBPs exhibit important roles in every step of mRNA life cycle in any system, from splicing, polyadenylation, editing, transport, stability, localization, to translation (protein synthesis). Here, we underscore the importance of RBP functions at multiple time-restricted steps of early neurogenesis, starting from the cell fate transition of transcriptionally primed cortical progenitors. A particular emphasis will be placed on RBPs with mostly conserved but also divergent evolutionary functions in neural progenitors across different species. RBPs, when considered in the context of the fascinating process of neocortical development, deserve to be main protagonists in the story of the evolution and development of the neocortex.Copyright © 2022 Salamon and Rasin."

We then conducted a systematic analysis of the factors that result in high-quality co-expression predictions, focusing on normalization, batch effect correction, and measure of correlation. We confirmed the key importance of high sample counts for high-quality predictions. However, choosing a suitable normalization approach and applying batch effect correction can further improve the quality of co-expression estimates, equivalent to a >80% and >40% increase in samples. In larger datasets, batch effect removal was equivalent to a more than doubling of the sample size. Finally, Pearson correlation appears more suitable than Spearman correlation, except for smaller datasets.A key point for accurate prediction of gene co-expression is the collection of many samples.

Therefore, further studies on novel screening strategies are urgently required.We used a simple suboptimal inoculation melanoma mouse model to obtain 'pre-diagnostic samples' of mice with macroscopic melanomas. High-throughput sequencing and bioinformatic analysis were employed to identify differentially expressed RNAs in platelet signatures of mice injected with a suboptimal number of melanoma cells (eDEGs) compared with mice with macroscopic melanomas and negative controls. Moreover, 36 genes selected from the eDEGs via bioinformatics analysis were verified in a mouse validation cohort via quantitative real-time PCR. LASSO regression was utilized to generate the prediction models with gene expression signatures as the best predictors for occult tumor progression in mice.These RNAs identified from eDEGs of mice injected with a suboptimal number of cancer cells were strongly enriched in pathways related to immune response and regulation. The prediction models generated by 36 gene qPCR verification data showed great diagnostic efficacy and predictive value in our murine validation cohort, and could discriminate mice with occult tumors from control group (area under curve (AUC) of 0.935 (training data) and 0.912 (testing data)) (gene signature including Cd19, Cdkn1a, S100a9, Tap1, and Tnfrsf1b) and also from macroscopic tumor group (AUC of 0.920 (training data) and 0.936 (testing data)) (gene signature including Ccr7, Cd4, Kmt2d, and Ly6e).Our proof-of-concept study provides evidence for potential clinical relevance of blood platelets as a platform for liquid biopsy-based early detection of cancer.© 2022.

"35071216","Review on Strategies and Technologies for Exosome Isolation and Purification.","Front Bioeng Biotechnol","Exosomes, a nano-sized subtype of extracellular vesicles secreted from almost all living cells, are capable of transferring cell-specific constituents of the source cell to the recipient cell. Cumulative evidence has revealed exosomes play an irreplaceable role in prognostic, diagnostic, and even therapeutic aspects. A method that can efficiently provide intact and pure exosomes samples is the first step to both exosome-based liquid biopsies and therapeutics. Unfortunately, common exosomal separation techniques suffer from operation complexity, time consumption, large sample volumes and low purity, posing significant challenges for exosomal downstream analysis. Efficient, simple, and affordable methods to isolate exosomes are crucial to carrying out relevant researches. In the last decade, emerging technologies, especially microfluidic chips, have proposed superior strategies for exosome isolation and exhibited fascinating performances. While many excellent reviews have overviewed various methods, a compressive review including updated/improved methods for exosomal isolation is indispensable. Herein, we first overview exosomal properties, biogenesis, contents, and functions. Then, we briefly outline the conventional technologies and discuss the challenges of clinical applications of these technologies. Finally, we review emerging exosomal isolation strategies and large-scale GMP production of engineered exosomes to open up future perspectives of next-generation Exo-devices for cancer diagnosis and treatment.Copyright © 2022 Chen, Li, Zhang, Xu, Huang, Wang and Du."

The shed cells remain in circulation until they extravasate to form a secondary metastatic lesion or undergo anoikis. The circulating tumor cells (CTCs) found as single cells or clusters carry a plethora of information, are acknowledged as potential biomarkers for predicting cancer prognosis and cancer progression, and are supposed to play key roles in determining tailored therapies for advanced diseases. With the advent of novel technologies that allow the precise isolation of CTCs, more and more clinical trials are focusing on the prognostic and predictive potential of CTCs. In this review, we summarize the role of CTCs as a predictive marker for cancer incidence, relapse, and response to therapy."

Recent studies have demonstrated that GA facilitates numerous cellular processes in cancer development. Therefore, this study aimed to establish a novel lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) risk evaluation model based on GA gene signatures. In this study, we used TCGA-LUAD (n= 500) as the training cohort and GSE50081 (n= 127), GSE68465 (442), and GSE72094 (398) as the validation cohorts. Two immunotherapy datasets (GSE135222 and GSE126044) were also obtained from a previous study. Based on machine algorithms and bioinformatics methods, a GA gene-related risk score (GARS) was established. We found that the GARS independently predicted the prognosis of LUAD patients and remained effective across stages IA to IIIA. Then, we identified that the GARS was highly correlated with mutations in P53 and TTN. Further, this study identified that GARS is related to multiple immune microenvironmental characteristics. Furthermore, we investigated GSE135222 and GSE126044 and found that a lower GARS may be indicative of an improved therapeutic effect of PD-1/PD-L1 therapy. We also found that high GARS may lead to a better response to multiple anticancer drugs. Finally, we established a nomogram to better guide clinical application. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate a novel GA signature-based risk score formula to predict clinical prognosis and guide the treatment of LUAD patients.Copyright © 2022 Jiang, Ouyang, Zhang, Yu and Yao."

Previous scholarship in bioethics and science and technology studies has made clear that different nations have varying expectations about trust, transparency, and public reason in relation to emerging technologies and their governance. The key aims of this article are to assess genetic literacy, perceptions of genetic testing, privacy concerns, and governing norms amongst the Singapore population by collecting surveys.This study investigated genetic literacy and broad public attitudes toward genetic tests in Singapore with an online public survey (n = 560). To assess potential changes in attitudes following receipt of results from a genetic test, we also surveyed undergraduate students who underwent a genetic screen as part of a university class before and after they received their test results (n = 25).Public participants showed broad support for the use of genetic tests; scored an average of 48.9% in genetic literacy; and expressed privacy concerns over data sharing and a desire for control over their genetic data. After taking a genetic test and receiving genetic test results, students reported less fear of genetic tests while other attitudes did not change significantly.These findings highlight the potential of genetic education and active engagement with genetic testing to increase support and participation in genomic projects, PM, and biobanking initiatives; and they suggest that data privacy protections could potentially reduce discrimination by giving participants control over who can access their data. More specifically, these findings and the dataset we provide may be helpful in formulating culturally sensitive education programs and regulations concerning genomic technologies and data privacy.© 2022.

Capitalizing on the increasing comfort of consumers with genetic testing outside the clinical environment, commercial vendors are expanding their customer base by marketing genetic and genomic testing services, including testing for pharmacogenomic and pathogenic variants, to employers for inclusion in workplace wellness programs. We describe the appeal of voluntary workplace genomic testing (wGT) to employers and employees, how the ethical, legal, and social implications literature has approached the issue of genetic testing in the workplace in the past, and outline the relevant legal landscape. Given that we are in the early stages of development of the wGT market, now is the time to identify the critical interests and concerns of employees and employers, so that governance can develop and evolve along with the wGT market, rather than behind it, and be based on data, rather than speculative hopes and fears.© 2022.

"35033985","Circulating proteins reveal prior use of menopausal hormonal therapy and increased risk of breast cancer.","Transl Oncol","Accessible risk predictors are crucial for improving the early detection and prognosis of breast cancer. Blood samples are widely available and contain proteins that provide important information about human health and disease, however, little is still known about the contribution of circulating proteins to breast cancer risk prediction. We profiled EDTA plasma samples collected before diagnosis from the Swedish KARMA breast cancer cohort to evaluate circulating proteins as molecular predictors. A data-driven analysis strategy was applied to the molecular phenotypes built on 700 circulating proteins to identify and annotate clusters of women. The unsupervised analysis of 183 future breast cancer cases and 366 age-matched controls revealed five stable clusters with distinct proteomic plasma profiles. Among these women, those in the most stable cluster (N = 19; mean Jaccard index: 0.70 ± 0.29) were significantly more likely to have used menopausal hormonal therapy (MHT), get a breast cancer diagnosis, and were older compared to the remaining clusters. The circulating proteins associated with this cluster (FDR < 0.001) represented physiological processes related to cell junctions (F11R, CLDN15, ITGAL), DNA repair (RBBP8), cell replication (TJP3), and included proteins found in female reproductive tissue (PTCH1, ZP4). Using a data-driven approach on plasma proteomics data revealed the potential long-lasting molecular effects of menopausal hormonal therapy (MHT) on the circulating proteome, even after women had ended their treatment. This provides valuable insights concerning proteomics efforts to identify molecular markers for breast cancer risk prediction.Copyright © 2022. Published by Elsevier Inc."
"35106622","Of mice and human-specific long noncoding RNAs.","Mamm Genome","The number of human LncRNAs has now exceeded all known protein-coding genes. Most studies of human LncRNAs have been conducted in cell culture systems where various mechanisms of action have been worked out. On the other hand, efforts to elucidate the function of human LncRNAs in an in vivo setting have been limited. In this brief review, we highlight some strengths and weaknesses of studying human LncRNAs in the mouse. Special consideration is given to bacterial artificial chromosome transgenesis and genome editing. The integration of these technical innovations offers an unprecedented opportunity to complement and extend the expansive literature of cell culture models for the study of human LncRNAs. Two different examples of how BAC transgenesis and genome editing can be leveraged to gain insight into human LncRNA regulation and function in mice are presented: the random integration of a vascular cell-enriched LncRNA and a targeted approach for a new LncRNA immediately upstream of the ACE2 gene, which encodes the receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiologic agent underlying the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic.© 2022.

"35017538","Age influences on the molecular presentation of tumours.","Nat Commun","Cancer is often called a disease of aging. There are numerous ways in which cancer epidemiology and behaviour change with the age of the patient. The molecular bases for these relationships remain largely underexplored. To characterise them, we analyse age-associations in the nuclear and mitochondrial somatic mutational landscape of 20,033 tumours across 35 tumour-types. Age influences both the number of mutations in a tumour (0.077 mutations per megabase per year) and their evolutionary timing. Specific mutational signatures are associated with age, reflecting differences in exogenous and endogenous oncogenic processes such as a greater influence of tobacco use in the tumours of younger patients, but higher activity of DNA damage repair signatures in those of older patients. We find that known cancer driver genes such as CDKN2A and CREBBP are mutated in age-associated frequencies, and these alter the transcriptome and predict for clinical outcomes. These effects are most striking in brain cancers where alterations like SUFU loss and ATRX mutation are age-dependent prognostic biomarkers. Using three cancer datasets, we show that age shapes the somatic mutational landscape of cancer, with clinical implications.© 2022. The Author(s)."

Given that the regulation of active copies of mtDNA is still not fully understood, we investigated the effects of CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing ofTFAMin human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells on mtDNA copy number. The aim of this study was to generate a new in vitro model by CRISPR-Cas9 system by editing theTFAMlocus in HEK293T cells. Among the resulting single-cell clones, seven had high mutation rates (67-96%) and showed a decrease in mtDNA copy number compared to control. Cell staining with Mitotracker Red showed a reduction in fluorescence in the edited cells compared to the non-edited cells. Our findings suggest that the mtDNA copy number is directly related toTFAMcontrol and its disruption results in interference with mitochondrial stability and maintenance."

Although the use of imaging data is well established in biomedical research, its primary application has been to observe phenotypes at the tissue or organ level, often using medical imaging techniques such as MRI, CT, and PET. These imaging technologies complement omics-based data in biomedical research because they are helpful for identifying associations between genotype and phenotype, along with functional changes occurring at the tissue level. Single cell imaging can act as an intermediary between these levels. Meanwhile new technologies continue to arrive that can be used to interrogate the genome of single cells and its related omics datasets. As these two areas, single cell imaging and single cell omics, each advance independently with the development of novel techniques, the opportunity to integrate these data types becomes more and more attractive. This review outlines some of the technologies and methods currently available for generating, processing, and analysing single-cell omics- and imaging data, and how they could be integrated to further our understanding of complex biological phenomena like ageing. We include an emphasis on machine learning algorithms because of their ability to identify complex patterns in large multidimensional data.Copyright © 2022 Watson, Taherian Fard and Mar."
"35111154","High Throughput scRNA-Seq Provides Insights Into Leydig Cell Senescence Induced by Experimental Autoimmune Orchitis: A Prominent Role of Interstitial Fibrosis and Complement Activation.","Front Immunol","Leydig cells (Lc), located in the interstitial space of the testis between seminiferous tubules, produce 95% of testosterone in male individuals, which is pivotal for male sexual differentiation, spermatogenesis, and maintenance of the male secondary sex characteristics. Lc are prone to senescence in aging testes, resulting in compromised androgen synthesis capability upon aging. However, little is known about whether Lc undergo senescence in a chronic inflammatory environment. To investigate this question, mouse models of experimental autoimmune orchitis (EAO) were used, and Lc were analyzed by high throughput scRNA-Seq. Data were screened and analyzed by correlating signaling pathways with senescence, apoptosis, androgen synthesis, and cytokine/chemokine signaling pathways. EAO did induce Lc senescence, and Lc senescence in turn antagonized androgen synthesis. Based on the correlation screening of pathways inducing Lc senescence, a plethora of pathways were found to play potential roles in triggering Lc senescence during EAO, among which theArf6and angiopoietin receptor pathways were highly correlated with senescence signature. Notably, complement and interstitial fibrosis activated by EAO worsened Lc senescence and strongly antagonized androgen synthesis. Furthermore, most proinflammatory cytokines enhanced both senescence and apoptosis in Lc and spermatogonia (Sg) during EAO, and proinflammatory cytokine antagonism of the glutathione metabolism pathway may be key in inducing cellular senescence during EAO.Copyright © 2022 Li, Mi, Wu, Tang, Liu, Cheng, Huang, Qin, Cheng and Sun."

Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) causes mild-to-moderate symptoms in most individuals. However, rapid deterioration to severe disease with or without acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) can occur within 1-2 weeks from the onset of symptoms in a proportion of patients. Early identification by risk stratifying such patients who are at risk of severe complications of COVID-19 is of great clinical importance. Computed tomography (CT) is widely available and offers the potential for fast triage, robust, rapid, and minimally invasive diagnosis: Ground glass opacities (GGO), crazy-paving pattern (GGO with superimposed septal thickening), and consolidation are the most common chest CT findings in COVID pneumonia. There is growing interest in the prognostic value of baseline chest CT since an early risk stratification of patients with COVID-19 would allow for better resource allocation and could help improve outcomes. Recent studies have demonstrated the utility of baseline chest CT to predict intensive care unit (ICU) admission in patients with COVID-19. Furthermore, developments and progress integrating artificial intelligence (AI) with computer-aided design (CAD) software for diagnostic imaging allow for objective, unbiased, and rapid assessment of CT images.© 2021.

This population-based cohort study comprised 10,937 healthy mother-child dyads. Data on highest maternal random capillary glucose level during pregnancy and sequential anthropometric data on their children during the first five years of life were gathered from the Uppsala County Mother and Child Cohort. Statistical analyses were performed with linear regression and linear mixed effect regression models. We found that higher glucose level during pregnancy was associated with higher weight z-score (β 0.10, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.08-0.11), length z-score (β 0.05, 95% CI 0.03-0.07) and BMI z-score (β 0.09, 95% CI 0.07-0.12) at birth, adjusted for maternal BMI and country of birth, smoking during pregnancy and parity. The association did not remain at 1½, 3, 4 and 5 years of age. There was a positive relationship between higher glucose level during pregnancy and a decrease in weight z-score, height z-score and BMI z-score from birth to 5 years of age. In conclusion, higher random capillary glucose levels in pregnant healthy women were associated with greater infant size at birth, as well as decreased growth velocity in early childhood.© 2022.

There is very limited understanding on the genetic factors that associated with antipsychotic-induced QTc interval change. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of antipsychotic-induced QTc interval change among patients with schizophrenia. A total of 2040 patients with schizophrenia were randomly assigned to six groups (olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine, aripiprazole, ziprasidone, and first-generation antipsychotics; first-generation antipsychotics including haloperidol or perphenazine were also assigned randomly) and received 6-week antipsychotic treatment. We identified two novel loci (rs200050752 in ATAD3B and rs186507741 in SKIL) that were associated with antipsychotic-induced QTc interval change at a genome-wide significance level. The combination of polygenic risk score (PRS), based the GWAS of myocardial infarction from BioBank Japan project, and clinical data (sex, heart rate and QTc interval at baseline) could be applied to predict whether patients with schizophrenia have QTc interval prolongation (10 ms was applied as threshold, P < 0.001, area under the curve [AUC] was 0.797), especially for the first episode patients (P < 0.001, AUC was 0.872). We identified two loci located within genes related to mitochondrial function and cell growth and differentiation, which were both associated with schizophrenia and heart function. The combination of PRS and clinical data could predict whether patients with schizophrenia have the side effect of QTc interval prolongation, which could fundamentally guide the choice of antipsychotic in patients with schizophrenia, especially for the first-episode patients.© 2022.

Many analyses require ""mosaic integration"", including both features shared across datasets and features exclusive to a single experiment. Previous computational integration approaches require that the input matrices share the same number of either genes or cells, and thus can use only shared features. To address this limitation, we derive a nonnegative matrix factorization algorithm for integrating single-cell datasets containing both shared and unshared features. The key advance is incorporating an additional metagene matrix that allows unshared features to inform the factorization. We demonstrate that incorporating unshared features significantly improves integration of single-cell RNA-seq, spatial transcriptomic, SNARE-seq, and cross-species datasets.

The clinical information of 100 patients who underwent CRC surgery at Jiangsu Cancer Hospital was retrospectively evaluated. Immunohistochemistry was used to further analyzeMETTL11Bexpression in CRC tissues from the patients. Patients were monitored for 3 years to assess survival. The Kaplan-Meier technique and log-rank test were employed for single-factor survival analysis; for multifactor analysis, the Cox regression approach was adopted. Nomograms were built for internal verification.METTL11Bexpression was higher in cancer tissues than in neighboring normal tissues. Significant differences were observed regarding body weight reduction, CA199, serum albumin, chemotherapy use, and the incidence of vascular cancer thrombus between the low and highMETTL11Bexpression groups (all P<0.05). After 3 years of follow-up, 69 patients were alive and 31 patients had died, translating to a 31.0% mortality rate. The progression-free and overall survival of the lowMETTL11Bexpression and low NLR/PA groups were significantly superior to those of the highMETTL11Bexpression and high NLR/PA groups, respectively (all P<0.05). Cox regression analysis revealed NLR/PA andMETTL11Bto be independent risk factors for CRC development, and tumor size and chemotherapy also had independent effects on CRC development. Our nomograms' c-index was 0.8493, indicating a reasonable accuracy of the prediction model.Increases in NLR/PA andMETTL11Bexpression are linked to a poor prognosis of CRC. NLR/PA combined withMETTL11Bhas a certain prognostic value for CRC. Moreover,METTL11Bhas the potential to be a new predictive biomarker and therapeutic target for individuals with this disease.2021 Journal of Gastrointestinal Oncology. All rights reserved."

Considering the potential therapeutic scope of intraovarian PRP would likely cover both menopause and infertility, the mainstream response has ranged from skeptical disbelief to welcome astonishment. Indeed, reports of intraovarian PRP leading to restored menses in menopause (as an alternative to conventional hormone replacement therapy) and healthy term livebirths for infertility patients (from IVF or as unassisted conceptions) continue to draw notice. Yet, any proper criticism of ovarian PRP applications will be difficult to rebut given the heterogenous patient screening, varied sample preparations, wide differences in platelet incubation and activation protocols, surgical/anesthesia techniques, and delivery methods. Notwithstanding these aspects, no adverse events have thus far been reported and ovarian PRP appears well tolerated by patients. Here, early studies guiding the transition of 'ovarian rejuvenation' from experimental to clinical are outlined, with mechanisms to explain results observed in both veterinary and human ovarian PRP research. Current and future challenges for intraovarian cytokine treatment are also discussed."

Accumulating data indicate that lncRNAs mediate essential biological functions in human development, including early embryogenesis, induction of pluripotency, and germ cell development. Comprehensive analysis of sequencing data highlights that lncRNAs are expressed in a stage-specific and human/primate-specific pattern during early human development. They contribute to cell fate determination through interacting with almost all classes of cellular biomolecules, including proteins, DNA, mRNAs, and microRNAs. Furthermore, the expression of a few of lncRNAs is highly associated with the pathogenesis and progression of many reproductive diseases, suggesting that they could serve as candidate biomarkers for diagnosis or novel targets for treatment.

"35085847","Reduced chromatin accessibility to CD4 T cell super-enhancers encompassing susceptibility loci of rheumatoid arthritis.","EBioMedicine","Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an inflammatory disease that manifests as a preclinical stage of systemic autoimmunity followed by chronic progressive synovitis. Disease-associated genetic SNP variants predominantly map to non-coding, regulatory regions of functional importance in CD4 T cells, implicating these cells as key regulators. A better understanding of the epigenome of CD4 T cells holds the promise of providing information on the interaction between genetic susceptibility and exogenous factors.We mapped regions of chromatin accessibility using ATAC-seq in peripheral CD4 T cell subsets of patients with RA (n=18) and compared them to T cells from patients with psoriatic arthritis (n=11) and age-matched healthy controls (n=10). Transcripts of selected genes were quantified using qPCR.RA-associated epigenetic signatures were identified that in part overlapped between central and effector memory CD4 T cells and that were to a lesser extent already present in naïve cells. Sites more accessible in RA were highly enriched for the motif of the transcription factor (TF) CTCF suggesting differences in the three-dimensional chromatin structure. Unexpectedly, sites with reduced chromatin accessibility were enriched for motifs of TFs pertinent for T cell function. Most strikingly, super-enhancers encompassing RA-associated SNPs were less accessible. Analysis of selected transcripts and published DNA methylation patterns were consistent with this finding. The preferential loss in accessibility at these super-enhancers was seen in patients with high and low disease activity and on a variety of immunosuppressive treatment modalities.Disease-associated genes are epigenetically less poised to respond in CD4 T cells from patients with established RA.This work was supported by I01 BX001669 from the Veterans Administration.Published by Elsevier B.V."

In this study, we aimed to increase the diagnostic yield of CE using a custom reanalysis algorithm. Sequencing data were available for three cohorts using two commercial protocols applied as part of the diagnostic process. Using these cohorts, we compared the performance of general and clinically relevant variant calling and the efficacy of an in-house bioinformatic protocol (FJD-pipeline) in detecting causal variants as compared to commercial protocols. On the whole, the FJD-pipeline detected 99.74% of the causal variants identified by the commercial protocol in previously solved cases. In the unsolved cases, FJD-pipeline detects more INDELs and non-exonic variants, and is able to increase the diagnostic yield in 2.5% and 3.2% in the re-analysis of 78 cancer and 62 cardiovascular cases. These results were considered to design a reanalysis, filtering and prioritization algorithm that was tested by reassessing 68 inconclusive cases of monoallelic autosomal recessive retinal dystrophies increasing the diagnosis by 4.4%. In conclusion, a guided NGS reanalysis of unsolved cases increases the diagnostic yield in genetic disorders, making it a useful diagnostic tool in medical genetics.© 2022. The Author(s)."

Currently, researchers focus on a single biomarker type and one tumor entity. This study aimed to create a multi-analyte liquid biopsy test for the simultaneous detection of several solid cancers. For this purpose, we analyzed cell-free DNA (cfDNA) mutations and methylation, as well as circulating miRNAs (miRNAs) in plasma samples from 97 patients with cancer (20 bladder, 9 brain, 30 breast, 28 colorectal, 29 lung, 19 ovarian, 12 pancreas, 27 prostate, 23 stomach) and 15 healthy controls via real-time qPCR. Androgen receptor p.H875Y mutation (AR) was detected for the first time in bladder, lung, stomach, ovarian, brain, and pancreas cancer, all together in 51.3% of all cancer samples and in none of the healthy controls. A discriminant function model, comprising cfDNA mutations (COSM10758, COSM18561), cfDNA methylation markers (MLH1,MDR1,GATA5,SFN) and miRNAs (miR-17-5p, miR-20a-5p, miR-21-5p, miR-26a-5p, miR-27a-3p, miR-29c-3p, miR-92a-3p, miR-101-3p, miR-133a-3p, miR-148b-3p, miR-155-5p, miR-195-5p) could further classify healthy and tumor samples with 95.4% accuracy, 97.9% sensitivity, 80% specificity.

"35145236","The use of new CRISPR tools in cardiovascular research and medicine.","Nat Rev Cardiol","Many novel CRISPR-based genome-editing tools, with a wide variety of applications, have been developed in the past few years. The original CRISPR-Cas9 system was developed as a tool to alter genomic sequences in living organisms in a simple way. However, the functions of new CRISPR tools are not limited to conventional genome editing mediated by non-homologous end-joining or homology-directed repair but expand into gene-expression control, epigenome editing, single-nucleotide editing, RNA editing and live-cell imaging. Furthermore, genetic perturbation screening by multiplexing guide RNAs is gaining popularity as a method to identify causative genes and pathways in an unbiased manner. New CRISPR tools can also be applied to ex vivo or in vivo therapeutic genome editing for the treatment of conditions such as hyperlipidaemia. In this Review, we first provide an overview of the diverse new CRISPR tools that have been developed to date. Second, we summarize how these new CRISPR tools are being used to study biological processes and disease mechanisms in cardiovascular research and medicine. Finally, we discuss the prospect of therapeutic genome editing by CRISPR tools to cure genetic cardiovascular diseases.© 2022. Springer Nature Limited."

Thanks to a fast-developing field of single cell genomics, we are facing an unprecedented leap in information available pertaining organ biology offering a comprehensive overview. The single-cell technologies that arose aided in resolving the precise cellular composition of many organ systems in the past years. Importantly, when applied to diseased tissues, the novel approaches have been immensely improving our understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of common human diseases. With this information, precise prediction of regulatory elements controlling gene expression upon perturbations in a given cell type or a specific context will be realistic. Simultaneously, the technological advances in CRISPR-mediated regulation of gene transcription as well as their application in the context of epigenome modulation, have opened up novel avenues for targeted therapy and personalized medicine. Here, we discuss the fast-paced advancements during the recent years and the applications thereof in the context of cardiac biology and common cardiac disease. The combination of single cell technologies and the deep knowledge of fundamental biology of the diseased heart together with the CRISPR-mediated modulation of gene regulatory networks will be instrumental in tailoring the right strategies for personalized and precision medicine in the near future.

"35079035","Serotonin transporter functional polymorphisms potentially increase risk of schizophrenia separately and as a haplotype.","Sci Rep","Schizophrenia is a severe, disabling psychiatric disorder with unclear etiology. Family-based, twins, and adoption studies have shown that genetic factors have major contributions in schizophrenia occurrence. Until now, many studies have discovered the association of schizophrenia and its comorbid symptoms with functional polymorphisms that lie within serotonin reuptake pathway genes. Here, we aimed to investigate the association of three variable number tandem repeats (VNTR) functional polymorphisms in MAOA and SLC6A4 with schizophrenia in the Iranian population. Two hundred and forty-one subjects with schizophrenia and three hundred and seventy age and sex-matched healthy controls were genotyped for MAOA promoter uVNTR, 5-HTTLPR, and STin2 polymorphisms. Genotyping was performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with locus-specific primers and running the PCR product on agarose 2.5% gel electrophoresis. Finally, the statistical inference was performed using R programming language and Haploview software. MAOA promoter uVNTR analysis of allele frequency showed no differences between schizophrenia subjects and healthy controls in both males and females and no significant differences were observed between female cases and female controls in MAOA promoter uVNTR 4 repeat frequency. Also, there were no differences between Schizophrenia and healthy control groups in 5-HTTLPR allele and genotype frequency but, 5-HTTLPR S allele carriers are significantly more frequent among cases. In addition, STin2.12 repeats were significantly more frequent among schizophrenia patients. Genotype comparison suggested that 5-HTTLPR S allele and STin2.12 repeat carriers were significantly more frequent among schizophrenia cases and being STin2.12 repeat carrier significantly increase the risk of schizophrenia occurrence. Besides, analysis of haplotype showed stronger linkage disequilibrium between 5-HTTLPR and STin2 haplotype block in cases than controls. These results suggest that SLC6A4 functional polymorphisms potentially could play a possible role as risk factors for the incidence of schizophrenia.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35127705","A Broad m6A Modification Landscape in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.","Front Cell Dev Biol","Background and Aims:N6-Methyladenosine (m6A) is the most common post-transcriptional modification on eukaryotic mRNA, affecting the mRNA's fate. The role of m6A regulation in inflammatory bowel disease is unclear. Here, we investigated the m6A landscape in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD).Methods:Eleven human IBD microarray datasets were recruited from the Gene Expression Omnibus database and four were selected as discovery cohorts. An RNA-seq dataset from the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Multi'omics Database was used as a validation cohort. m6A regulators were measured in volunteers' colonic samples. Consensus clustering and immune scoring were used to estimate the characteristics of m6A regulation in IBD. m6A-related characteristics of different sub-phenotypes, sample sources, and biological therapeutic responses were determined using seven independent datasets.Results:m6A modification involves methyltransferases (writers), demethylases (erasers), and methylation-reading proteins (readers). A wide interaction exists between m6A regulators and IBD risk genes. The IBD risk loci can also be modified by m6A modifications in the public m6A sequencing data. Furthermore, m6A regulators displayed extensive differential expression in four independent discovery cohorts that share common differential genes (IGF2BP2, HNRNPA2B1, ZCCHC4, and EIF3I). In the validated cohort and enrolled volunteers' colonic biopsy samples, the differential m6A regulators were reconfirmed. Two clusters of consensus clustering exhibit different immune phenotypes. m6A-modified positions exist in the core IBD immune cytokines. Another set of IBD datasets revealed m6A-related differences across clinical phenotypes, biological samples, and therapeutic response subgroups in IBD patients.Conclusion:Regulation of m6A methylation is widely involved in IBD occurrence and development. m6A modifications in risk variants, core cytokines, immune cells, and other proteins may deeply influence the pathophysiology and clinical phenotypes. Further studies are needed to determine its role in IBD.Copyright © 2022 Nie, Yi, Yang, Deng, Yang, Wang, Chen, Zhang and Wang."

Although the available risk assessment methods for HFpEF have achieved some progress, they were based on clinical or genetic features alone. Here, we have developed a deep learning framework, HFmeRisk, using both 5 clinical features and 25 DNA methylation loci to predict the early risk of HFpEF in the Framingham Heart Study Cohort.The framework incorporates Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator and Extreme Gradient Boosting-based feature selection, as well as a Factorization-Machine based neural network-based recommender system. Model discrimination and calibration were assessed using the AUC and Hosmer-Lemeshow test. HFmeRisk, including 25 CpGs and 5 clinical features, have achieved the AUC of 0.90 (95% confidence interval 0.88-0.92) and Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic was 6.17 (P = 0.632), which outperformed models with clinical characteristics or DNA methylation levels alone, published chronic heart failure risk prediction models and other benchmark machine learning models. Out of them, the DNA methylation levels of two CpGs were significantly correlated with the paired transcriptome levels (R < -0.3, P < 0.05). Besides, DNA methylation locus in HFmeRisk were associated with intercellular signaling and interaction, amino acid metabolism, transport and activation and the clinical variables were all related with the mechanism of occurrence of HFpEF. Together, these findings give new evidence into the HFmeRisk model.Our study proposes an early risk assessment framework for HFpEF integrating both clinical and epigenetic features, providing a promising path for clinical decision making.© 2022.

Patients with LSCC, in which the cancer has infiltrated and metastasized, have a poor prognosis. Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify more potential targets for drugs and biomarkers for early diagnosis.RNA sequence data from LSCC and patients' clinical traits were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (GSE142083) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) were performed to identify hub genes. Gene ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis, prognostic value analysis, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, gene mutation analysis, tumor-infiltrating immune cell abundance profile estimation, gene set variation analysis (GSVA), and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) were performed. Single-gene RNA sequencing data were obtained from the GSE150321 dataset. Cell proliferation and viability were confirmed by the CCK-8 assay and real-time PCR.A total of 701 DEGs, including 329 upregulated and 372 downregulated genes, were screened in the GSE142083 dataset. Using WGCNA, three modules were identified to be closely related to LSCC. After intersecting the DEGs and performing univariate and multivariate Cox analyses, a novel prognostic model based on three genes (SLC35C1,HOXB7, andTEDC2) for LSCC was established. InterferingTEDC2expression inhibited tumor cell proliferation and migration.Our results show thatSLC35C1,HOXB7, andTEDC2have the potential to become new therapeutic targets and prognostic biomarkers for LSCC.Copyright © 2022 Huang, He, Dong, Huang, Chen, Peng and Huang."

Here, we aimed to investigate the association of plasma apolipoprotein concentrations in prediabetes subjects with the incidence of new-onset T2D during follow-up.In the IT-DIAB prospective study, 307 participants with impaired fasting glucose levels (fasting plasma glucose [FPG]: 110-125 mg/dL) were followed yearly for 5 years. The onset of T2D was defined as a first FPG value ≥ 126 mg/dL during follow-up. Apolipoprotein (apo)A-I, A-II, A-IV, B100, C-I, C-II, C-III, C-IV, D, E, F, H, J, L1, M, and (a) plasma concentrations were determined by mass spectrometry. Correlations between apolipoproteins and metabolic parameters at baseline were assessed by Spearman's coefficients. Kaplan-Meier curves were drawn using a ternary approach based on terciles and incident T2D. The association between plasma apolipoproteins concentrations and the incidence of T2D was determined using Cox proportional-hazards models.During a median follow-up of 5-year, 115 participants (37.5%) developed T2D. After adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, FPG, HbA1c, and statin use, the plasma levels of apoC-I, apoC-II, apoC-III, apoE, apoF, apoH, apoJ, and apoL1 were positively associated with a high risk for T2D. After further adjustment for plasma triglycerides, only apoE (1 SD natural-log-transformed hazard ratio: 1.28 [95% confidence interval: 1.06; 1.54]; p = 0.010), apoF (1.22 [1.01; 1.48]; p = 0.037), apoJ (1.24 [1.03; 1.49]; p = 0.024), and apoL1 (1.26 [1.05; 1.52]; p = 0.014) remained significantly associated with the onset of T2D. Kaplan-Meier survival curves also showed that the lower third of plasma apoE levels (< 5.97 mg/dL) was significantly associated with a lower risk of conversion to T2D (log-rank test, p = 0.002) compared to the middle and upper thirds.The plasma apoE levels are positively associated with the risk of T2D in prediabetes subjects, independently of traditional risk factors. The possible associations of apoF, apoJ, and apoL1 with T2D risk also pave the way for further investigations.

Visceral obesity and factors derived from altered adipose tissue, adipokines, play critical roles in the development of metabolic syndrome. Although the adipokines leptin and adiponectin improve insulin sensitivity, others contribute to the development of glucose intolerance, including visfatin, fetuin-A, resistin, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). Leptin and adiponectin increase fatty acid oxidation, prevent foam cell formation, and improve lipid metabolism, while visfatin, fetuin-A, PAI-1, and resistin have pro-atherogenic properties.

MODY8 patients develop childhood-onset exocrine pancreas dysfunction followed by diabetes during adulthood. However, it is unclear how CEL mutations cause diabetes. In the present study, we report the transfer of CEL proteins from acinar cells to β-cells as a form of cross-talk between exocrine and endocrine cells. Human β-cells show a relatively higher propensity for internalizing the mutant versus the wild-type CEL protein. After internalization, the mutant protein forms stable intracellular aggregates leading to β-cell secretory dysfunction. Analysis of pancreas sections from a MODY8 patient reveals the presence of CEL protein in the few extant β-cells. The present study provides compelling evidence for the mechanism by which a mutant gene expressed specifically in acinar cells promotes dysfunction and loss of β-cells to cause diabetes.© 2022.

However, dynamic inference of an evolving cell population from time series scRNA-seq data is challenging owing to the stochasticity and nonlinearity of the underlying biological processes. This calls for the development of mathematical models and methods capable of reconstructing cellular dynamic transition processes and uncovering the nonlinear cell-cell interactions. In this study, we present GraphFP, a nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation on graph based model and dynamic inference framework, with the aim of reconstructing the cell state-transition complex potential energy landscape from time series single-cell transcriptomic data. The free energy of our model explicitly takes into account of the cell-cell interactions in a nonlinear quadratic term. We then recast the model inference problem in the form of a dynamic optimal transport framework and solve it efficiently with the adjoint method of optimal control. We evaluated GraphFP on the time series scRNA-seq data set of embryonic murine cerebral cortex development. We illustrated that it 1) reconstructs cell state potential energy, which is a measure of cellular differentiation potency, 2) faithfully charts the probability flows between paired cell states over the dynamic processes of cell differentiation, and 3) accurately quantifies the stochastic dynamics of cell type frequencies on probability simplex in continuous time. We also illustrated that GraphFP is robust in terms of cluster labelling with different resolutions, as well as parameter choices. Meanwhile, GraphFP provides a model-based approach to delineate the cell-cell interactions that drive cell differentiation. GraphFP software is available at https://github.com/QiJiang-QJ/GraphFP."

Uncovering molecular mechanisms associated with GWG could be helpful to develop public health strategies for tackling this issue. Here, our study aimed to understand the relationship of DNA telomere length with weigh gain during pregnancy, using data and samples from the ongoing prospective ""Mamma & Bambino"" study (Catania, Italy). GWG was calculated according to the Institute of Medicine (IOM) guidelines. Relative telomere length was assessed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction in 252 samples of maternal leucocyte DNA (mlDNA) and 150 samples of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from amniotic fluid. We observed that relative telomere length of mlDNA seemed to weakly increase with GWG. In contrast, telomere length of cfDNA exhibited a U-shaped relationship with GWG. Women with adequate GWG showed longer telomere length than those who gained weight inadequately. Accordingly, the logistic regression model confirmed the association between telomere length of cfDNA and adequate GWG, after adjusting for potential confounders. Our findings suggest an early effect of GWG on telomere length of cfDNA, which could represent a molecular mechanism underpinning the effects of maternal behaviours on foetal well-being."

Methylation levels of these CpGs did not differ significantly between bronchial washings obtained from 76 NSCLC patients and 60 cancer-free patients. However, methylation levels ofSLIT2gene were significantly higher in plasma cell-free DNA of 72 NSCLC patients than in that of 61 cancer-free patients (p= 0.001, Wilcoxon rank sum test). Prediction of NSCLC usingSLIT2methylation was achieved with a sensitivity of 73.7% and a specificity of 61.9% in a plasma test dataset (N= 40). A Cox proportional hazards model showed thatSLIT2hypermethylation in plasma cell-free DNA was significantly associated with poor recurrence-free survival (hazards ratio = 2.19, 95% confidence interval = 1.21-4.36,p= 0.01). The present study suggests that aberrant methylation ofSLIT2in plasma cell-free DNA is a valuable biomarker for the early detection of NSCLC and prediction of recurrence-free survival.

The biological function of ANKRD55, its role in the immune system, and cellular sources of expression other than lymphocytes remain uncharacterized. Here, we show that monocytes gain capacity to expressANKRD55during differentiation in immature monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs) in the presence of interleukin (IL)-4/granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF).ANKRD55expression levels are further enhanced by retinoic acid agonist AM580 but downregulated following maturation with interferon (IFN)-γ and lipopolysaccharide (LPS).ANKRD55was detected in the nucleus of moDC in nuclear speckles. We also analyzed the adjacentIL6ST,IL31RA, andSLC38A9genes. Of note, in healthy controls, MS risk SNP genotype influencedANKRD55andIL6STexpression in immature moDC in opposite directions to that in CD4+T cells. This effect was stronger for a partially correlated SNP, rs13186299, that is located, similar to the main MS risk SNPs, in anANKRD55intron. Upon analysis in MS patients, the main GWAS MS risk SNP rs7731626 was associated withANKRD55expression levels in CD4+T cells. MoDC-specificANKRD55andIL6STmRNA levels showed significant differences according to the clinical form of the disease, but, in contrast to healthy controls, were not influenced by genotype. We also measured serum sgp130 levels, which were found to be higher in homozygotes of the protective allele of rs7731626. Our study characterizesANKRD55expression in moDC and indicates monocyte-to-dendritic cell (Mo-DC) differentiation as a process potentially influenced by MS risk SNPs.Copyright © 2022 Mena, Alloza, Tulloch Navarro, Aldekoa, Díez García, Villanueva Etxebarria, Lindskog, Antigüedad, Boyero, Mendibe-Bilbao, Álvarez de Arcaya, Sánchez Menoyo, Midaglia, Villarrubia, Malhotra, Montalban, Villar, Comabella and Vandenbroeck."
