Yes,20230209,ewas,,36738748,Epigenetic profile of Japanese supercentenarians: a cross-sectional study.,Lancet Healthy Longev,"Centenarians and supercentenarians with exceptional longevity are excellent models for research towards improvements of healthy life expectancy. Extensive research regarding the maintenance and reduction of epigenetic age has provided insights into increasing healthy longevity. To this end, we explored the epigenetic signatures reflecting hallmarks of exceptional healthy longevity, including avoidance of age-related diseases and cognitive functional decline.In this cross-sectional study, we enrolled Japanese non-centenarians (eligible participants aged 20-80 years) from the Tohoku Medical Megabank Community-Based Cohort Study and centenarians and supercentenarians (aged 101-115 years) from the Tokyo Centenarian Study and the Japanese Semi-supercentenarian Study. We assessed participants' whole-blood DNA methylation profiles and then developed sex-specific and non-specific first-generation epigenetic clocks by elastic net regression, calculated individuals' epigenetic ages, and assessed their age acceleration. We also screened for age-related CpG sites in non-centenarians by epigenome-wide linear regression analyses and ANOVA. We subsequently investigated which CpG sites in centenarians and supercentenarians had DNA methylation patterns following the age-related findings obtained from non-centenarians and which did not. We further characterised CpG sites with hypermethylation or hypomethylation in the centenarians and supercentenarians using enrichment and protein-protein interaction network analyses.We enrolled 421 non-centenarians (231 [55%] women and 190 [45%] men; age range 20-78 years), recruited between May 20, 2013, and March 31, 2016, and 94 centenarians and supercentenarians (66 women [70%] and 28 [30%] men; age range 101-115 years), recruited between Jan 20, 2001, and April 17, 2018. Non-sex-specific epigenetic clock showed the highest accuracy (r=0Â·96) based on which centenarians and supercentenarians had negative epigenetic age acceleration. Epigenome-wide association analyses further showed that centenarians and supercentenarians had younger-than-expected epigenetic states (DNA methylation profiles similar to those of non-centenarians) for 557 CpG sites enriched in cancer-related and neuropsychiatric-related genes, whereas these individuals had advanced (or older) epigenetic states for 163 CpG sites represented by genes related to TGF-Î² signalling, which is involved in anti-inflammatory responses and known to contribute to healthy ageing.These results indicate that exceptionally healthy longevity depends not only on maintaining young epigenetic states but also on advanced states of specific epigenetic regions.The Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development, KDDI Research, and Keio University.For the Japanese translation of the abstract see Supplementary Materials section.Copyright Â© 2023 The Author(s).

Yes,20230209,ewas,,36737504,Differential DNA methylation of steatosis and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in adolescence.,Hepatol Int,"Epigenetic modifications are associated with hepatic fat accumulation and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, few epigenetic modifications directly implicated in such processes have been identified during adolescence, a critical developmental window where physiological changes could influence future disease trajectory. To investigate the association between DNA methylation and NAFLD in adolescence, we undertook discovery and validation of novel methylation marks, alongside replication of previously reported marks.We performed a DNA methylation epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) on DNA from whole blood from 707 Raine Study adolescents phenotyped for steatosis score and NAFLD by ultrasound at age 17. Next, we performed pyrosequencing validation of loci within the most 100 strongly associated differentially methylated CpG sites (dmCpGs) for whichâ€‰â‰¥â€‰2 probes per gene remained significant across four statistical models with a nominal p valueâ€‰<â€‰0.007. EWAS identified dmCpGs related to three genes (ANK1, MIR10a, PTPRN2) that met our criteria for pyrosequencing. Of the dmCpGs and surrounding loci that were pyrosequenced (ANK1 nâ€‰=â€‰6, MIR10a nâ€‰=â€‰7, PTPRN2 nâ€‰=â€‰3), three dmCpGs in ANK1 and two in MIR10a were significantly associated with NAFLD in adolescence. After adjustment for waist circumference only dmCpGs in ANK1 remained significant. These ANK1 CpGs were also associated with Î³-glutamyl transferase and alanine aminotransferase concentrations. Three of twenty-two differentially methylated dmCpGs previously associated with adult NAFLD were associated with NAFLD in adolescence (all adjusted pâ€‰<â€‰2.3â€‰Ã—â€‰10-3).We identified novel DNA methylation loci associated with NAFLD and serum liver biochemistry markers during adolescence, implicating putative dmCpG/gene regulatory pathways and providing insights for future mechanistic studies.Â© 2023.

Yes,20230209,ewas,,36734879,Metformin use history and genome-wide DNA methylation profile: potential molecular mechanism for aging and longevity.,Aging (Albany NY),"Metformin, a commonly prescribed anti-diabetic medication, has repeatedly been shown to hinder aging in pre-clinical models and to be associated with lower mortality for humans. It is, however, not well understood how metformin can potentially prolong lifespan from a biological standpoint. We hypothesized that metformin's potential mechanism of action for longevity is through its epigenetic modifications.To test our hypothesis, we conducted a post-hoc analysis of available genome-wide DNA methylation (DNAm) data obtained from whole blood collected from inpatients with and without a history of metformin use. We assessed the methylation profile of 171 patients (first run) and only among 63 diabetic patients (second run) and compared the DNAm rates between metformin users and nonusers.Enrichment analysis from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome (KEGG) showed pathways relevant to metformin's mechanism of action, such as longevity, AMPK, and inflammatory pathways. We also identified several pathways related to delirium whose risk factor is aging. Moreover, top hits from the Gene Ontology (GO) included HIF-1Î± pathways. However, no individual CpG site showed genome-wide statistical significance (p< 5E-08).This study may elucidate metformin's potential role in longevity through epigenetic modifications and other possible mechanisms of action."
No,20230209,mitochondria,,36726473,Genome-wide characterization of mitochondrial DNA methylation in human brain.,Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),"There is growing interest in the role of DNA methylation in regulating the transcription of mitochondrial genes, particularly in brain disorders characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction. Here, we present a novel approach to interrogate the mitochondrial DNA methylome at single base resolution using targeted bisulfite sequencing. We applied this method to investigate mitochondrial DNA methylation patterns in post-mortem superior temporal gyrus and cerebellum brain tissue from seven human donors.We show that mitochondrial DNA methylation patterns are relatively low but conserved, with peaks in DNA methylation at several sites, such as within theD-LOOPand the genesMT-ND2,MT-ATP6,MT-ND4,MT-ND5andMT-ND6, predominantly in a non-CpG context. The elevated DNA methylation we observe in theD-LOOPwe validate using pyrosequencing. We identify loci that show differential DNA methylation patterns associated with age, sex and brain region. Finally, we replicate previously reported differentially methylated regions between brain regions from a methylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing study.We have annotated patterns of DNA methylation at single base resolution across the mitochondrial genome in human brain samples. Looking to the future this approach could be utilized to investigate the role of mitochondrial epigenetic mechanisms in disorders that display mitochondrial dysfunction.Copyright Â© 2023 Devall, Soanes, Smith, Dempster, Smith, Burrage, Iatrou, Hannon, Troakes, Moore, Oâ€™Neill, Al-Sarraj, Schalkwyk, Mill, Weedon and Lunnon."
No,20230209,methods,x,36721080,Systematic and benchmarking studies of pipelines for mammal WGBS data in the novel NGS platform.,BMC Bioinformatics,"Whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS), possesses the aptitude to dissect methylation status at the nucleotide-level resolution of 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) on a genome-wide scale. It is a powerful technique for epigenome in various cell types, and tissues. As a recently established next-generation sequencing (NGS) platform, GenoLab M is a promising alternative platform. However, its comprehensive evaluation for WGBS has not been reported. We sequenced two bisulfite-converted mammal DNA in this research using our GenoLab M and NovaSeq 6000, respectively. Then, we systematically compared those data via four widely used WGBS tools (BSMAP, Bismark, BatMeth2, BS-Seeker2) and a new bisulfite-seq tool (BSBolt). We interrogated their computational time, genome depth and coverage, and evaluated their percentage of methylated Cs.Here, benchmarking a combination of pre- and post-processing methods, we found that trimming improved the performance of mapping efficiency in eight datasets. The data from two platforms uncovered ~â€‰80% of CpG sites genome-wide in the human cell line. Those data sequenced by GenoLab M achieved a far lower proportion of duplicates (~â€‰5.5%). Among pipelines, BSMAP provided an intriguing representation of 5-mC distribution at CpG sites with 5-mC levels >â€‰~â€‰78% in datasets from human cell lines, especially in the GenoLab M. BSMAP performed more advantages in running time, uniquely mapped reads percentages, genomic coverage, and quantitative accuracy. Finally, compared with the previous methylation pattern of human cell line and mouse tissue, we confirmed that the data from GenoLab M performed similar consistency and accuracy in methylation levels of CpG sites with that from NovaSeq 6000.Together we confirmed that GenoLab M was a qualified NGS platform for WGBS with high performance. Our results showed that BSMAP was the suitable pipeline that allowed for WGBS studies on the GenoLab M platform.Â© 2023. The Author(s)."
No,20230209,dnamage,scott,36516495,DNA methylation GrimAge version 2,Aging (Albany NY),"We previously described a DNA methylation (DNAm) based biomarker of human mortality risk DNAm GrimAge. Here we describe version 2 of GrimAge (trained on individuals aged between 40 and 92) which leverages two new DNAm based estimators of (log transformed) plasma proteins: high sensitivity C-reactive protein (logCRP) and hemoglobin A1C (logA1C). We evaluate GrimAge2 in 13,399 blood samples across nine study cohorts. After adjustment for age and sex, GrimAge2 outperforms GrimAge in predicting mortality across multiple racial/ethnic groups (meta P=3.6x10-167 versus P=2.6x10-144) and in terms of associations with age related conditions such as coronary heart disease, lung function measurement FEV1 (correlation= -0.31, P=1.1x10-136), computed tomography based measurements of fatty liver disease. We present evidence that GrimAge version 2 also applies to younger individuals and to saliva samples where it tracks markers of metabolic syndrome. DNAm logCRP is positively correlated with morbidity count (P=1.3x10-54). DNAm logA1C is highly associated with type 2 diabetes (P=5.8x10-155). DNAm PAI-1 outperforms the other age-adjusted DNAm biomarkers including GrimAge2 in correlating with triglyceride (cor=0.34, P=9.6x10-267) and visceral fat (cor=0.41, P=4.7x10-41). Overall, we demonstrate that GrimAge version 2 is an attractive epigenetic biomarker of human mortality and morbidity risk."
No,20230209,methods,,36617464,Comparative epigenome analysis using Infinium DNA methylation BeadChips,Brief Bioinform,"The arrival of the Infinium DNA methylation BeadChips for mice and other nonhuman mammalian species has outpaced the development of the informatics that supports their use for epigenetics study in model organisms. Here, we present informatics infrastructure and methods to allow easy DNA methylation analysis on multiple species, including domesticated animals and inbred laboratory mice (in SeSAMe version 1.16.0+). First, we developed a data-driven analysis pipeline covering species inference, genome-specific data preprocessing and regression modeling. We targeted genomes of 310 species and 37 inbred mouse strains and showed that genome-specific preprocessing prevents artifacts and yields more accurate measurements than generic pipelines. Second, we uncovered the dynamics of the epigenome evolution in different genomic territories and tissue types through comparative analysis. We identified a catalog of inbred mouse strain-specific methylation differences, some of which are linked to the strains' immune, metabolic and neurological phenotypes. By streamlining DNA methylation array analysis for undesigned genomes, our methods extend epigenome research to broad species contexts."
No,20230209,cell type,x,33588693,Saliva cell type DNA methylation reference panel for epidemiological studies in children,Epigenetics,"Saliva is a widely used biological sample, especially in pediatric research, containing a heterogenous mixture of immune and epithelial cells. Associations of exposure or disease with saliva DNA methylation can be influenced by cell-type proportions. Here, we developed a saliva cell-type DNA methylation reference panel to estimate interindividual cell-type heterogeneity in whole saliva studies. Saliva was collected from 22 children (7-16 years) and sorted into immune and epithelial cells, using size exclusion filtration and magnetic bead sorting. DNA methylation was measured using the Illumina MethylationEPIC BeadChip. We assessed cell-type differences in DNA methylation profiles and tested for enriched biological pathways. Immune and epithelial cells differed at 181,577 (22.8%) DNA methylation sites (t-test p < 6.28 × 10-8). Immune cell hypomethylated sites are mapped to genes enriched for immune pathways (p < 3.2 × 10-5). Epithelial cell hypomethylated sites were enriched for cornification (p = 5.2 × 10-4), a key process for hard palette formation. Saliva immune and epithelial cells have distinct DNA methylation profiles which can drive whole-saliva DNA methylation measures. A primary saliva DNA methylation reference panel, easily implemented with an R package, will allow estimates of cell proportions from whole saliva samples and improve epigenetic epidemiology studies by accounting for measurement heterogeneity by cell-type proportions. https://github.com/bakulskilab/BeadSorted.Saliva.EPIC"
No,20230209,dnamage,,36721372,Use of incorrect and correct methods to account for age in studies on epigenetic accelerated aging: implications and recommendations for best practices,Am J Epidemiol,"Motivated by our conduct of a literature review on social exposures and accelerated aging as measured by a growing number of epigenetic ""clocks"" (which estimate age via DNA methylation patterns (DNAm)), we report on three different approaches - 1 incorrect and 2 correct - in the epidemiologic literature on treatment of age in these and other studies using other common exposures (i.e., body mass index and alcohol consumption). Among the 50 empirical articles reviewed, the majority (n = 29; 58%) used the incorrect method of analyzing accelerated aging detrended for age as the outcome and did not control for age as a covariate. By contrast, only 42% used the correct methods, which are either to analyze accelerated aging detrended for age as the outcome and control for age as a covariate (n = 16; 32%), or to analyze raw DNAm age as the outcome and control for age as a covariate (n = 5; 10%). In accord with prior demonstrations of bias introduced by the incorrect approach, we provide simulation analyses and additional empirical analyses to illustrate how the incorrect method can lead to bias to the null, and we discuss implications for extant research and recommendations for best practices."
No,20230209,omics,x,36717624,Molecular mechanisms of environmental exposures and human disease,Nat Rev Genet,"A substantial proportion of disease risk for common complex disorders is attributable to environmental exposures and pollutants. An appreciation of how environmental pollutants act on our cells to produce deleterious health effects has led to advances in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of chronic diseases, including cancer and cardiovascular, neurodegenerative and respiratory diseases. Here, we discuss emerging research on the interplay of environmental pollutants with the human genome and epigenome. We review evidence showing the environmental impact on gene expression through epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation, histone modification and non-coding RNAs. We also highlight recent studies that evaluate recently discovered molecular processes through which the environment can exert its effects, including extracellular vesicles, the epitranscriptome and the mitochondrial genome. Finally, we discuss current challenges when studying the exposome - the cumulative measure of environmental influences over the lifespan - and its integration into future environmental health research."
No,20230209,ewas,sam?,36716967,DNA methylation analysis identifies novel genetic loci associated with circulating fibrinogen levels in blood,J Thromb Haemost,"Background: Fibrinogen plays an essential role in blood coagulation and inflammation. Circulating fibrinogen levels may be determined by inter-individual differences in DNA methylation at CpG sites, and vice versa.

Methods: We performed an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of circulating fibrinogen levels in 18,037 White, Black, American Indian, and Hispanic participants representing 14 studies from the CHARGE consortium. Circulating leukocyte DNA methylation was measured in 12,904 participants using the Illumina 450K array, and in 5,133 participants using the EPIC array. Each study performed an EWAS of fibrinogen using linear mixed models adjusted for potential confounders. Study-specific results were combined using array-specific meta-analysis, followed by cross-replication of epigenome-wide significant associations. We compared models with and without C-reactive protein (CRP) adjustment to examine the role of inflammation.

Results: We identified 208 and 87 significant CpG sites associated with fibrinogen from the 450K (p-value<1.03×10-7) and EPIC arrays (p-value<5.78×10-8), respectively. There were 78 associations from the 450K array that replicated in the EPIC array and 26 vice versa. After accounting for the overlapping sites, there were 83 replicated CpG sites located in 61 loci, of which only 4 have been previously reported for fibrinogen. Examples of genes located near these CpG sites were SOCS3 and AIM2, which are involved in inflammatory pathways. The associations for all 83 replicated CpG sites were attenuated after CRP adjustment, although many remained significant.

Conclusion: We identified 83 CpG sites associated with circulating fibrinogen levels. These associations are partially driven by inflammatory pathways shared by both fibrinogen and CRP."
No,20230209,review,,36694711,DNA methylation signatures as biomarkers of socioeconomic position,Environ Epigenet,"This review article provides a framework for the use of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation (DNAm) biomarkers to study the biological embedding of socioeconomic position (SEP) and summarizes the latest developments in the area. It presents the emerging literature showing associations between individual- and neighborhood-level SEP exposures and DNAm across the life course. In contrast to questionnaire-based methods of assessing SEP, we suggest that DNAm biomarkers may offer an accessible metric to study questions about SEP and health outcomes, acting as a personal dosimeter of exposure. However, further work remains in standardizing SEP measures across studies and evaluating consistency across domains, tissue types, and time periods. Meta-analyses of epigenetic associations with SEP are offered as one approach to confirm the replication of DNAm loci across studies. The development of DNAm biomarkers of SEP would provide a method for examining its impact on health outcomes in a more robust way, increasing the rigor of epidemiological studies."
