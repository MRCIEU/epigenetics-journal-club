"36748674","The SET domain protein PsKMT3 regulates histone H3K36 trimethylation and modulates effector gene expression in the soybean pathogen Phytophthora sojae.","Mol Plant Pathol","Plant pathogens secrete effector proteins to overcome host immunity and promote colonization. In oomycete plant pathogens, the expression of many effector genes is altered upon infection; however, the regulatory mechanisms are unclear. In this study, we identified a su(var)3-9, enhancer of zeste, and trithorax (SET) domain protein-encoding gene, PsKMT3, that was highly induced at early infection stages in Phytophthora sojae. Deletion of PsKMT3 led to asexual development and pathogenicity defects. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) and western blot analyses demonstrated that histone H3K36 trimethylation (H3K36me3) was significantly reduced genome-wide in mutants. RNA-seq analysis identified 374 genes encoding secreted proteins that were differentially expressed in pskmt3 at the mycelium stage. The significantly altered genes encompassed the RxLR (Arg-x-Lys-Arg) effector gene family, including the essential effector genes Avh23, Avh181, Avh240, and Avh241. Transcriptome analysis at early infection stages showed misregulation of effector gene expression waves in pskmt3. H3K36me3 was directly and indirectly associated with RxLR effector gene activation. Our results reveal a role of a SET domain protein in regulating effector gene expression and modulating histone methylation in P. sojae.© 2023 The Authors.

"36745154","CpH methylome analysis in human cortical neurons identifies novel gene pathways and drug targets for opioid use disorder.","Front Psychiatry","DNA methylation (DNAm), an epigenetic mechanism, has been associated with opioid use disorder (OUD) in preclinical and human studies. However, most of the studies have focused on DNAm at CpG sites. DNAm at non-CpG sites (mCpHs, where H indicates A, T, or C) has been recently shown to have a role in gene regulation and to be highly abundant in neurons. However, its role in OUD is unknown. This work aims to evaluate mCpHs in the human postmortem orbital frontal cortex (OFC) in the context of OUD.A total of 38 Postmortem OFC samples were obtained from the VA Brain Bank (OUD = 12; Control = 26). mCpHs were assessed using reduced representation oxidative bisulfite sequencing in neuronal nuclei. Differential analysis was performed using the ""methylkit"" R package. Age, ancestry, postmortem interval, PTSD, and smoking status were included as covariates. Significant mCpHs were set atq-value < 0.05. Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG enrichment analyses were performed for the annotated genes of all differential mCpH loci using String, ShinyGO, and amiGO software. Further, all annotated genes were analyzed using the Drug gene interaction database (DGIdb).A total of 2,352 differentially methylated genome-wide significant mCpHs were identified in OUD, mapping to 2,081 genes. GO analysis of genes with differential mCpH loci showed enrichment for nervous system development (p-value = 2.32E-19). KEGG enrichment analysis identified axon guidance and glutamatergic synapse (FDR 9E-4-2.1E-2). Drug interaction analysis found 3,420 interactions between the annotated genes and drugs, identifying interactions with 15 opioid-related drugs, including lofexidine and tizanidine, both previously used for the treatment of OUD-related symptoms.Our findings suggest a role of mCpHs for OUD in cortical neurons and reveal important biological pathways and drug targets associated with the disorder.Copyright © 2023 Nagamatsu, Rompala, Hurd, Núñez-Rios, Montalvo-Ortiz and Traumatic Stress Brain Research Group."
"36741001","Heterogeneous clinicopathological findings and patient-reported outcomes in adults with MN1-altered CNS tumors: A case report and systematic literature review.","Front Oncol","The uncommonMN1-altered primary central nervous system (CNS) tumors were recently added to the World Health Organization 2021 classification under the name Astroblastoma,MN1-altered. Another term used to describe them, ""High-grade neuroepithelial tumor withMN1alteration"" (HGNET-MN1), makes reference to their distinct epigenetic profile but is currently not a recommended name. Thought to occur most commonly in children and predominantly in females,MN1-altered CNS tumors are associated with typical but not pathognomonic histological patterns and are characterized by a distinct DNA methylation profile and recurrent fusions implicating theMN1(meningioma 1) gene. Diagnosis based on histological features alone is challenging: most cases with morphological features of astroblastoma (but not all) show these molecular features, whereas not all tumors withMN1fusions show astroblastoma morphology. There is large variability in reported outcomes and detailed clinical and therapeutic information is frequently missing. Some patients experience multiple recurrences despite multimodality treatment, whereas others experience no recurrence after surgical resection alone, suggesting large clinical and biological heterogeneity despite unifying epigenetic features and recurrent fusions. In this report, we present the demographics, tumor characteristics, treatment, and outcome (including patient-reported outcomes) of three adults withMN1-altered primary CNS tumors diagnosedviagenome-wide DNA methylation and RNA sequencing. All three patients were females and two of them were diagnosed as young adults. By reporting our neuropathological and clinical findings and comparing them with previously published cases we provide insight into the clinical heterogeneity of this tumor. Additionally, we propose a model for prospective, comprehensive, and systematic collection of clinical data in addition to neuropathological data, including standardized patient-reported outcomes.Copyright © 2023 Frederico, Vera, Abdullaev, Acquaye, Aldape, Boris, Briceno, Choi, Christ, Cooper, Grajkowska, Kunst, Leeper, Levine, Lollo, Pratt, Quezado, Shah, Wall, Gilbert, Armstrong and Penas-Prado."
"36740678","Genome-wide identification, characterization, and expression pattern of the late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) gene family in Juglans regia and its wild relatives J. mandshurica.","BMC Plant Biol","Late Embryogenesis Abundant (LEA) proteins are a class of proteins associated with plant stress resistance. Two Juglans species, Juglans regia and J. mandshurica, are both diploid (2n = 32), monoecious perennial economic tree species with high edible, pharmaceutical, and timber value. The identification, characterization, and expression patterns of LEA proteins in J. regia and its wild relative, J. mandshurica, would not only provide the genetic basis of this gene family, but it would also supply clues for further studies of the evolution and regulating mechanisms of LEA proteins in other tree species.In this study, we identified 25 and 20 members of the LEA gene family in Juglans regia and its wild relative, Juglans mandshurica, respectively. The results of phylogenetic analysis showed that the LEA members were divided into eight main subgroups. Predictions of their physicochemical properties showed the variable characteristics of LEA proteins, and the subcellular localization analysis indicated that most LEA proteins are localized in the nucleus. Chromosomal localization analysis and gene replication pattern prediction indicated that WGD is the predominant duplication mode of LEA genes. The results of the comparative analysis indicated a high level of collinearity between the two Juglans species. Analysis of cis-acting elements indicated that LEA genes had a relatively wide range of responses to abiotic stresses and phytohormonal processes, particularly in two phytohormones, methyl jasmonate and abscisic acid. Transcriptome profiling and qRT-PCR experiments showed that JrLEAs are commonly expressed in leaves, green husks, and male and female flowers, and most JmLEAs are more highly expressed in male flowers. We also hypothesized that JrLEAs are involved in the process of anthracnose resistance. Anthracnose-resistant varieties of JrLEAs presented relatively high expression levels at later stages.In this study, we provide a theoretical basis for the functional study of LEA genes in J. regia and J. mandshurica. Analysis of cis-acting elements and gene expression indicated that JrLEAs and JmLEAs play important roles in resistance to biotic stresses in these species.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"36740242","Epigenetic and genetic population structure is coupled in a marine invertebrate.","Genome Biol Evol","Delineating the relative influence of genotype and the environment on DNA methylation is critical for characterizing the spectrum of organism fitness as driven by adaptation and phenotypic plasticity. In this study, we integrated genomic and DNA methylation data for two distinct Olympia oyster (Ostrea lurida) populations while controlling for within-generation environmental influences. In addition to providing the first characterization of genome-wide DNA methylation patterns in the oyster genus Ostrea, we identified 3,963 differentially methylated loci between populations. Our results show a clear coupling between genetic and epigenetic patterns of variation, with 27% of variation in inter-individual methylation differences explained by genotype. Underlying this association are both direct genetic changes in CpGs (CpG-SNPs) and genetic variation with indirect influence on methylation (mQTLs). When comparing measures of genetic and epigenetic population divergence at specific genomic regions this relationship surprisingly breaks down, which has implications for the methods commonly used to study epigenetic and genetic coupling in marine invertebrates.© The Author(s) 2023.

"36739454","Longitudinal DNA methylation analysis of adult-type IDH-mutant gliomas.","Acta Neuropathol Commun","Diffuse gliomas are the most prevalent malignant primary brain tumors in adults and remain incurable despite standard therapy. Tumor recurrence is currently inevitable, which contributes to a persistent high morbidity and mortality in these patients. In this study, we examined the genome-wide DNA methylation profiles of primary and recurrent adult-type IDH-mutant gliomas to elucidate DNA methylation changes associated with tumor progression (with or without malignant transformation). We analyzed DNA methylation profiles of 37 primary IDH-mutant gliomas and 42 paired recurrences using the DNA methylation EPIC beadChip array. DNA methylation-based classification reflected the tumor progression over time. We observed a methylation subtype switch in a proportion of IDH-mutant astrocytomas; the primary tumors were subclassified as low-grade astrocytomas, which progressed to high-grade astrocytomas in the recurrent tumors. The CNS WHO grade 4 IDH-mutant astrocytomas did not always resemble methylation subclasses of higher grades. The number of differentially methylated CpG sites increased over time, and astrocytomas accumulated more differentially methylated CpG sites than oligodendrogliomas during tumor progression. Few differentially methylated CpG sites were shared between patients. We demonstrated that DNA methylation profiles are mostly maintained during IDH-mutant glioma progression, but CpG site-specific methylation alterations can occur.© 2023. The Author(s)."

However, HLA-B genotype is not sufficient to predict the occurrence of allopurinol-induced SCAR.To discover DNA methylation markers for allopurinol-induced SCAR which may improve the prediction accuracy of genetic testing.The study was designed as a retrospective case-control clinical study in multicenter hospitals across Taiwan, Mainland China, Malaysia and Canada. 125 cases of allopurinol-induced SCAR patients and 139 cases of allopurinol tolerant controls were enrolled in this study during 2005 to 2021.The results of genome-wide DNA methylation assay of 62 patients revealed that ITGB2 showed strong discriminative ability of allopurinol-induced SCAR in both HLA-B*58:01 positive and negative patients with AUC value of 0.9364 (95% CI 0.8682-1.000). In validation study, significant hypermethylation of ITGB2 were further validated in allopurinol-induced SCAR patients compared to tolerant controls, especially in those without HLA-B*58:01(AUC value of 0.8814 (95% CI 0.7121-1.000)). Additionally, the methylation levels of 2 sites on ITGB2 were associated with SCAR phenotypes. Combination of HLA-B*58:01 genotyping and ITGB2 methylation status could improve the prediction accuracy of allopurinol-induced SCAR with the AUC value up to 0.9387 (95% CI 0.9089-0.9684), while the AUC value of HLA-B*58:01 genotyping alone was 0.8557 (95% CI 0.8030-0.9083).Our study uncovers differentially methylated genes between allopurinol-induced SCAR patients and tolerant controls with positive or negative HLA-B*58:01 allele and provides the novel epigenetic marker that improves the prediction accuracy of genetic testing for prevention of allopurinol-induced SCAR.Copyright © 2023.

"36738748","Epigenetic profile of Japanese supercentenarians: a cross-sectional study.","Lancet Healthy Longev","Centenarians and supercentenarians with exceptional longevity are excellent models for research towards improvements of healthy life expectancy. Extensive research regarding the maintenance and reduction of epigenetic age has provided insights into increasing healthy longevity. To this end, we explored the epigenetic signatures reflecting hallmarks of exceptional healthy longevity, including avoidance of age-related diseases and cognitive functional decline.In this cross-sectional study, we enrolled Japanese non-centenarians (eligible participants aged 20-80 years) from the Tohoku Medical Megabank Community-Based Cohort Study and centenarians and supercentenarians (aged 101-115 years) from the Tokyo Centenarian Study and the Japanese Semi-supercentenarian Study. We assessed participants' whole-blood DNA methylation profiles and then developed sex-specific and non-specific first-generation epigenetic clocks by elastic net regression, calculated individuals' epigenetic ages, and assessed their age acceleration. We also screened for age-related CpG sites in non-centenarians by epigenome-wide linear regression analyses and ANOVA. We subsequently investigated which CpG sites in centenarians and supercentenarians had DNA methylation patterns following the age-related findings obtained from non-centenarians and which did not. We further characterised CpG sites with hypermethylation or hypomethylation in the centenarians and supercentenarians using enrichment and protein-protein interaction network analyses.We enrolled 421 non-centenarians (231 [55%] women and 190 [45%] men; age range 20-78 years), recruited between May 20, 2013, and March 31, 2016, and 94 centenarians and supercentenarians (66 women [70%] and 28 [30%] men; age range 101-115 years), recruited between Jan 20, 2001, and April 17, 2018. Non-sex-specific epigenetic clock showed the highest accuracy (r=0·96) based on which centenarians and supercentenarians had negative epigenetic age acceleration. Epigenome-wide association analyses further showed that centenarians and supercentenarians had younger-than-expected epigenetic states (DNA methylation profiles similar to those of non-centenarians) for 557 CpG sites enriched in cancer-related and neuropsychiatric-related genes, whereas these individuals had advanced (or older) epigenetic states for 163 CpG sites represented by genes related to TGF-β signalling, which is involved in anti-inflammatory responses and known to contribute to healthy ageing.These results indicate that exceptionally healthy longevity depends not only on maintaining young epigenetic states but also on advanced states of specific epigenetic regions.The Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development, KDDI Research, and Keio University.For the Japanese translation of the abstract see Supplementary Materials section.Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).

However, few epigenetic modifications directly implicated in such processes have been identified during adolescence, a critical developmental window where physiological changes could influence future disease trajectory. To investigate the association between DNA methylation and NAFLD in adolescence, we undertook discovery and validation of novel methylation marks, alongside replication of previously reported marks.We performed a DNA methylation epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) on DNA from whole blood from 707 Raine Study adolescents phenotyped for steatosis score and NAFLD by ultrasound at age 17. Next, we performed pyrosequencing validation of loci within the most 100 strongly associated differentially methylated CpG sites (dmCpGs) for which ≥ 2 probes per gene remained significant across four statistical models with a nominal p value < 0.007. EWAS identified dmCpGs related to three genes (ANK1, MIR10a, PTPRN2) that met our criteria for pyrosequencing. Of the dmCpGs and surrounding loci that were pyrosequenced (ANK1 n = 6, MIR10a n = 7, PTPRN2 n = 3), three dmCpGs in ANK1 and two in MIR10a were significantly associated with NAFLD in adolescence. After adjustment for waist circumference only dmCpGs in ANK1 remained significant. These ANK1 CpGs were also associated with γ-glutamyl transferase and alanine aminotransferase concentrations. Three of twenty-two differentially methylated dmCpGs previously associated with adult NAFLD were associated with NAFLD in adolescence (all adjusted p < 2.3 × 10-3).We identified novel DNA methylation loci associated with NAFLD and serum liver biochemistry markers during adolescence, implicating putative dmCpG/gene regulatory pathways and providing insights for future mechanistic studies.© 2023.

"36736484","The role of N(6)-methyladenosine modification in benzene-induced testicular damage and the protective effect of melatonin.","Chemosphere","Benzene is a universal ambient pollutant. Population-based studies have shown that benzene exposure affects male fertility. However, the mechanism of benzene-induced reproductive toxicity is unknown. Here, we established a dynamic inhalation model and exposed C57BL/6J mice to 0, 10, and 50 ppm benzene (6 h/day, 6 days/week, 7 weeks). Our study revealed that benzene exposure caused testicular injury, including structural damage to spermatogenic tubules, reduced semen quality, and decreased testosterone levels. In addition, the decrease in the global level of N6-Methyladenosine (m6A) and the change of m6A important regulatory enzymes in mice testes suggested that m6A was involved in the benzene-induced testicular injury. Further genome-wide m6A methylation analysis showed that 1469 differential m6A peaks were present in the testes of control and benzene groups, indicating that benzene exposure modulated m6A methylation in testes. Furthermore, the comprehensive analysis of m6A-sequencing and transcriptome revealed that hypermethylated Rara and its consequent reduced expression impaired the sperm production process. In particular, melatonin alleviated benzene-induced testicular injury by modulating m6A-related genes. Overall, our research provides a new idea and fundamental knowledge into the possible mechanisms of m6A modifications in benzene-induced testicular impairment, as well as a new experimental basis for benzene-induced male fertility therapy.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

It is, however, not well understood how metformin can potentially prolong lifespan from a biological standpoint. We hypothesized that metformin's potential mechanism of action for longevity is through its epigenetic modifications.To test our hypothesis, we conducted a post-hoc analysis of available genome-wide DNA methylation (DNAm) data obtained from whole blood collected from inpatients with and without a history of metformin use. We assessed the methylation profile of 171 patients (first run) and only among 63 diabetic patients (second run) and compared the DNAm rates between metformin users and nonusers.Enrichment analysis from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome (KEGG) showed pathways relevant to metformin's mechanism of action, such as longevity, AMPK, and inflammatory pathways. We also identified several pathways related to delirium whose risk factor is aging. Moreover, top hits from the Gene Ontology (GO) included HIF-1α pathways. However, no individual CpG site showed genome-wide statistical significance (p< 5E-08).This study may elucidate metformin's potential role in longevity through epigenetic modifications and other possible mechanisms of action."

To study the role of m6dA in human DNA, we introduced it in human cells at a genome-wide scale at GANTC and GATC sites by expression of bacterial DNA methyltransferases and observed concomitant reductions in cell viability, in particular after global GANTC methylation. We identified several genes that are directly regulated by m6dA in a GANTC context. Upregulated genes showed m6dA-dependent reduction of H3K27me3 suggesting that the PRC2 complex is inhibited by m6dA. Genes downregulated by m6dA showed enrichment of JUN family transcription factor binding sites. JUN binds m6dA containing DNA with reduced affinity suggesting that m6dA can reduce the recruitment of JUN transcription factors to target genes. Our study documents that global introduction of m6dA in human DNA has physiological effects. Furthermore, we identified a set of target genes which are directly regulated by m6dA in human cells, and we defined two molecular pathways with opposing effects by which artificially introduced m6dA in GANTC motifs can directly control gene expression and phenotypes of human cells.© 2023.

"36727912","Decoding the genetic and epigenetic basis of asthma.","Allergy","Asthma is a complex and heterogeneous chronic inflammatory disease of the airways. Alongside environmental factors, asthma susceptibility is strongly influenced by genetics. Given its high prevalence and our incomplete understanding of the mechanisms underlying disease susceptibility, asthma is frequently studied in genome-wide association studies (GWAS), which have identified thousands of genetic variants associated with asthma development. Virtually all these genetic variants reside in non-coding genomic regions, which has obscured the functional impact of asthma-associated variants and their translation into disease-relevant mechanisms. Recent advances in genomics technology and epigenetics now offer methods to link genetic variants to gene regulatory elements embedded within non-coding regions, which have started to unravel the molecular mechanisms underlying the complex (epi)genetics of asthma. Here we provide an integrated overview of (epi)genetic variants associated with asthma, focusing on efforts to link these disease associations to biological insight into asthma pathophysiology using state-of-the-art genomics methodology. Finally, we provide a perspective as to how decoding the genetic and epigenetic basis of asthma has the potential to transform clinical management of asthma and to predict the risk of asthma development.This article is protected by copyright.

Epigenetic modification and immunity have significant implications for tumorigenesis and development.We combined aberrant methylation and CAFs abundances to build a prognostic model and the impact on the biological properties of LGGs. Grouping based on the median CAFs abundances score of samples in the TCGA-LGGs dataset, differentially expressed genes and aberrantly methylated genes were combined for subsequent analysis.We identified five differentially methylated and expressed genes (LAT32, SWAP70, GSAP, EMP3, and SLC2A10) and established a prognostic gene signature validated in the CGGA-LGGs dataset. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in vitro tests were performed to verify these expressions. The high-risk group increased in tumor-promoting immune cells and tumor mutational burden. Notably, risk stratification had different ICB sensitivities in LGGs, and there were also significant sensitivity differences for temozolomide and the other three novel chemotherapeutic agents.Our study reveals characteristics of CAFs in LGGs, refines the direct link between epigenetics and tumor stroma, and might provide clinical implications for guiding tailored anti-CAFs therapy in combination with immunotherapy for LGGs patients.Copyright © 2023 Dong, Wang, Gao, Zhao, Zhang, Wang, Liu, Yan, Jin, Ba, Ma, Du, Ji and Hu."

DNA methylation was measured in 140 US military veterans who served in Iraq and/or Afghanistan (112 current PTSD cases enrolled in a PTSD treatment study and 28 veterans without PTSD history controls), and also 59 non-trauma exposed controls at baseline posttreatment (24 weeks after baseline). Increased DNA methylation GrimAge acceleration (p = 8.8e-09) was observed in patients with PTSD compared to a pooled control group (trauma exposed and non-trauma exposed), suggesting a higher risk of premature mortality in those with PTSD.

The risk of HIVAN is mostly confined to individuals with two APOL1 variants (kidney-risk genotypes). APOL1 kidney-risk genotypes are present in approximately 80% of patients with HIVAN and account for nearly half the burden of end-stage CKD in people of African ancestry with HIV. Progress has been made in elucidating the mechanisms of kidney injury in APOL1 nephropathy, and several targeted molecular therapies are being investigated in clinical trials. Genome- and epigenome-wide association studies are identifying additional genes and pathways that may be involved in the pathogenesis of CKD in people with HIV.Genetic variants of APOL1 are strongly associated with severe CKD and contribute to the high rates of CKD in Black populations with HIV. Most individuals with APOL1 kidney-risk genotypes, however, do not develop kidney disease and further studies are required to understand the role of additional genetic and environmental factors that may affect CKD risk in this population.Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

However, few reports about PRC2 are available in plant species with large and complicated genomes, like cotton.Here, we performed a genome-wide identification and comprehensive analysis of cotton PRC2 core components, especially in upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum). Firstly, a total of 8 and 16 PRC2 core components were identified in diploid and tetraploid cotton species, respectively. These components were classified into four groups, E(z), Su(z)12, ESC and p55, and the members in the same group displayed good collinearity, similar gene structure and domain organization. Next, we cloned G. hirsutum PRC2 (GhPRC2) core components, and found that most of GhPRC2 proteins were localized in the nucleus, and interacted with each other to form multi-subunit complexes. Moreover, we analyzed the expression profile of GhPRC2 genes. The transcriptome data and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) assays indicated that GhPRC2 genes were ubiquitously but differentially expressed in various tissues, with high expression levels in reproductive organs like petals, stamens and pistils. And the expressions of several GhPRC2 genes, especially E(z) group genes, were responsive to various abiotic and biotic stresses, including drought, salinity, extreme temperature, and Verticillium dahliae (Vd) infection.We identified PRC2 core components in upland cotton, and systematically investigated their classifications, phylogenetic and synteny relationships, gene structures, domain organizations, subcellular localizations, protein interactions, tissue-specific and stresses-responsive expression patterns. Our results will provide insights into the evolution and composition of cotton PRC2, and lay the foundation for further investigation of their biological functions and regulatory mechanisms.© 2023.

It is a powerful technique for epigenome in various cell types, and tissues. As a recently established next-generation sequencing (NGS) platform, GenoLab M is a promising alternative platform. However, its comprehensive evaluation for WGBS has not been reported. We sequenced two bisulfite-converted mammal DNA in this research using our GenoLab M and NovaSeq 6000, respectively. Then, we systematically compared those data via four widely used WGBS tools (BSMAP, Bismark, BatMeth2, BS-Seeker2) and a new bisulfite-seq tool (BSBolt). We interrogated their computational time, genome depth and coverage, and evaluated their percentage of methylated Cs.Here, benchmarking a combination of pre- and post-processing methods, we found that trimming improved the performance of mapping efficiency in eight datasets. The data from two platforms uncovered ~ 80% of CpG sites genome-wide in the human cell line. Those data sequenced by GenoLab M achieved a far lower proportion of duplicates (~ 5.5%). Among pipelines, BSMAP provided an intriguing representation of 5-mC distribution at CpG sites with 5-mC levels > ~ 78% in datasets from human cell lines, especially in the GenoLab M. BSMAP performed more advantages in running time, uniquely mapped reads percentages, genomic coverage, and quantitative accuracy. Finally, compared with the previous methylation pattern of human cell line and mouse tissue, we confirmed that the data from GenoLab M performed similar consistency and accuracy in methylation levels of CpG sites with that from NovaSeq 6000.Together we confirmed that GenoLab M was a qualified NGS platform for WGBS with high performance. Our results showed that BSMAP was the suitable pipeline that allowed for WGBS studies on the GenoLab M platform.© 2023. The Author(s)."
