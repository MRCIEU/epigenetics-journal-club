Yes,20230223,,ewas,36800980,Role of epigenetics in the clinical evolution of COVID-19 disease. Epigenome-wide association study identifies markers of severe outcome.,Eur J Med Res,"COVID-19 has a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations and given its impact on morbidity and mortality, there is an unmet medical need to discover endogenous cellular and molecular biomarkers that predict the expected clinical course of the disease. Recently, epigenetics and especially DNA methylation have been pointed out as a promising tool for outcome prediction in several diseases.Using the Illumina Infinium Methylation EPIC BeadChip850K, we investigated genome-wide differences in DNA methylation in an Italian Cohort of patients with comorbidities and compared severe (n = 64) and mild (123) prognosis. Results showed that the epigenetic signature, already present at the time of Hospital admission, can significantly predict risk of severe outcomes. Further analyses provided evidence of an association between age acceleration and a severe prognosis after COVID-19 infection. The burden of Stochastic Epigenetic Mutation (SEMs) has been significantly increased in patients with poor prognosis. Results have been replicated in silico considering COVID-19 negative subjects and available previously published datasets.Using original methylation data and taking advantage of already published datasets, we confirmed in the blood that epigenetics is actively involved in immune response after COVID-19 infection, allowing the identification of a specific signature able to discriminate the disease evolution. Furthermore, the study showed that epigenetic drift and age acceleration are associated with severe prognosis. All these findings prove that host epigenetics undergoes notable and specific rearrangements to respond to COVID-19 infection which can be used for a personalized, timely, and targeted management of COVID-19 patients during the first stages of hospitalization.© 2023.

No,20230223,scott,methods,36797751,An overview of DNA methylation-derived trait score methods and applications.,Genome Biol,"Microarray technology has been used to measure genome-wide DNA methylation in thousands of individuals. These studies typically test the associations between individual DNA methylation sites (""probes"") and complex traits or diseases. The results can be used to generate methylation profile scores (MPS) to predict outcomes in independent data sets. Although there are many parallels between MPS and polygenic (risk) scores (PGS), there are key differences. Here, we review motivations, methods, and applications of DNA methylation-based trait prediction, with a focus on common diseases. We contrast MPS with PGS, highlighting where assumptions made in genetic modeling may not hold in epigenetic data.© 2023. The Author(s)."
Yes,20230223,,ewas,36796456,Multi-Omic Approach Associates Blood Methylome with Bronchodilator Drug Response in Pediatric Asthma.,J Allergy Clin Immunol,"Albuterol is the drug most widely used as asthma treatment among African Americans despite having a lower bronchodilator drug response (BDR) than other populations. Although BDR is affected by gene and environmental factors, the influence of DNA methylation (DNAm) is unknown.This study aims to identify epigenetic markers in whole blood associated with BDR, study their functional consequences by multi-omic integration, and assess their clinical applicability in admixed populations with a high asthma burden.We studied 414 children and young adults asthma patients (8-21 years old) in a discovery and replication design. We performed an epigenome-wide association study on 221 African Americans and replicated the results on 193 Latinos. Functional consequences were assessed by integrating epigenomics with genomics, transcriptomics, and environmental exposure data. Furthermore, a machine learning approach was used to develop a panel of epigenetic markers to classify treatment response.We identified five differentially methylated regions and two CpGs genome-wide significantly associated with BDR in African Americans located in FGL2 (cg08241295, p=6.8x10-9) and DNASE2 (cg15341340, p=7.8x10-8), which were regulated by genetic variation and/or associated with gene expression of nearby genes (false discovery rate<0.05). The CpG cg15341340 was replicated in Latinos (p=3.5x10-3). Moreover, a panel of 70 CpGs showed good classification for albuterol responders and nonresponders in African American and Latino children (AUCtraining:0.99, AUCvalidation:0.70-0.71). DNAm model showed similar discrimination as clinical predictors (p>0.05).We report novel associations of epigenetic markers with BDR in pediatric asthma and demonstrate for the first time the applicability of pharmacoepigenetics in precision medicine of respiratory diseases.Copyright © 2023.

The aim of this study was to identify DNA-methylation loci associated with plasma lipids in Ghanaians.We conducted an EWAS using Illumina 450k DNA-methylation array profiles of extracted DNA from 663 Ghanaian participants. Differentially methylated positions (DMPs) were examined for association with plasma total cholesterol (TC), LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides concentrations using linear regression models adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, diabetes mellitus, and technical covariates. Findings were replicated in independent cohorts of different ethnicities.We identified one significantly associated DMP with triglycerides (cg19693031 annotated to TXNIP, regression coefficient beta -0.26, false discovery rate adjusted p-value 0.001), which replicated in-silico in South African Batswana, African American, and European populations. From the top five DMPs with the lowest nominal p-values, two additional DMPs for triglycerides (CPT1A, ABCG1), two DMPs for LDL-cholesterol (EPSTI1, cg13781819), and one for TC (TXNIP) replicated. With the exception of EPSTI1, these loci are involved in lipid transport/metabolism or are known GWAS-associated loci. The top 5 DMPs per lipid trait explained 9.5% in the variance of TC, 8.3% in LDL-cholesterol, 6.1% in HDL-cholesterol, and 11.0% in triglycerides.The top DMPs identified in this study are in loci that play a role in lipid metabolism across populations, including West-Africans. Future studies including larger sample size, longitudinal study design and translational research is needed to increase our understanding on the epigenetic regulation of lipid metabolism among West-African populations.European Commission under the Framework Programme (grant number: 278901).Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

Yes,20230223,,ewas,36581877,Chromatin modifier developmental pluripotency associated factor 4 (DPPA4) is a candidate gene for alcohol-induced developmental disorders.,BMC Med,"Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) affects embryonic development, causing a variable fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) phenotype with neuronal disorders and birth defects. We hypothesize that early alcohol-induced epigenetic changes disrupt the accurate developmental programming of embryo and consequently cause the complex phenotype of developmental disorders. To explore the etiology of FASD, we collected unique biological samples of 80 severely alcohol-exposed and 100 control newborns at birth.We performed genome-wide DNA methylation (DNAm) and gene expression analyses of placentas by using microarrays (EPIC, Illumina) and mRNA sequencing, respectively. To test the manifestation of observed PAE-associated DNAm changes in embryonic tissues as well as potential biomarkers for PAE, we examined if the changes can be detected also in white blood cells or buccal epithelial cells of the same newborns by EpiTYPER. To explore the early effects of alcohol on extraembryonic placental tissue, we selected 27 newborns whose mothers had consumed alcohol up to gestational week 7 at maximum to the separate analyses. Furthermore, to explore the effects of early alcohol exposure on embryonic cells, human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) as well as hESCs during differentiation into endodermal, mesodermal, and ectodermal cells were exposed to alcohol in vitro.DPPA4, FOXP2, and TACR3 with significantly decreased DNAm were discovered-particularly the regulatory region of DPPA4 in the early alcohol-exposed placentas. When hESCs were exposed to alcohol in vitro, significantly altered regulation of DPPA2, a closely linked heterodimer of DPPA4, was observed. While the regulatory region of DPPA4 was unmethylated in both control and alcohol-exposed hESCs, alcohol-induced decreased DNAm similar to placenta was seen in in vitro differentiated mesodermal and ectodermal cells. Furthermore, common genes with alcohol-associated DNAm changes in placenta and hESCs were linked exclusively to the neurodevelopmental pathways in the enrichment analysis, which emphasizes the value of placental tissue when analyzing the effects of prenatal environment on human development.Our study shows the effects of early alcohol exposure on human embryonic and extraembryonic cells, introduces candidate genes for alcohol-induced developmental disorders, and reveals potential biomarkers for prenatal alcohol exposure.© 2022.

Yes,20230223,,ewas,36577721,Dissecting the epigenomic differences between smoking and nicotine dependence in a veteran cohort.,Addict Biol,"Smoking is a serious public health issue linked to more than 8 million deaths per year worldwide and may lead to nicotine dependence (ND). Although the epigenomic literature on smoking is well established, studies evaluating the role of epigenetics in ND are limited. In this study, we examined the epigenomic signatures of ND and how these differ from smoking exposure to identify biomarkers specific to ND. We investigated the peripheral epigenetic profile of smoking status (SS) and ND in a US male veteran cohort. DNA from saliva was collected from 1135 European American (EA) male US military veterans. DNAm was assessed using the Illumina Infinium Human MethylationEPIC BeadChip array. SS was evaluated as current smokers (n = 137; 12.1%) and non-current smokers (never and former; n = 998; 87.9%). NDFTNDwas assessed as a continuous variable using the Fagerström Test for ND (FTND; n = 1135; mean = 2.54 ± 2.29). Epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) and co-methylation analyses were conducted for SS and NDFTND. A total of 450 and 22 genome-wide significant differentially methylated sites (DMS) were associated with SS and NDFTND, respectively (15 overlapped DMS). We identified 97 DMS (43 genes) in SS-EWAS previously reported in the literature, including AHRR and F2RL3 genes (p-value: 1.95 × 10-83to 4.55 × 10-33). NDFTNDnovel DMS mapped to NEUROG1, ANPEP, and SLC29A1. Co-methylation analysis identified 386 modules (11 SS-related and 19 NDFTND-related). SS-related modules showed enrichment for alcoholism, while NDFTND-related modules were enriched for nicotine addiction. This study confirms previous findings associated with SS and identifies novel and-potentially specific-epigenetic biomarkers of ND that may inform prognosis and novel treatment strategies.© 2022 Society for the Study of Addiction."

Diet is suggested to affect metabolism and health via epigenetic modifications. Thus, our aim was to explore the association between food consumption and DNA methylation.Epigenome-wide association studies were conducted in three cohorts: KORA FF4, TwinsUK, and Leiden Longevity Study, and 37 dietary exposures were evaluated. Food group definition was harmonized across the three cohorts. DNA methylation was measured using Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip in KORA and Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip in the Leiden study and the TwinsUK study. Overall, data from 2293 middle-aged men and women were included. A fixed-effects meta-analysis pooled study-specific estimates. The significance threshold was set at 0.05 for false-discovery rate-adjusted p values per food group.We identified significant associations between the methylation level of CpG sites and the consumption of onions and garlic (2), nuts and seeds (18), milk (1), cream (11), plant oils (4), butter (13), and alcoholic beverages (27). The signals targeted genes of metabolic health relevance, for example, GLI1, RPTOR, and DIO1, among others.This EWAS is unique with its focus on food groups that are part of a Western diet. Significant findings were mostly related to food groups with a high-fat content.© 2022. The Author(s)."
No,20230223,,dnam age,36566336,Social mobility across the lifecourse and DNA methylation age acceleration in adults in the UK.,Sci Rep,"Disadvantaged socio-economic position (SEP) is associated with greater biological age, relative to chronological age, measured by DNA methylation (positive 'age acceleration', AA). Social mobility has been proposed to ameliorate health inequalities. This study aimed to understand the association of social mobility with positive AA. Diagonal reference modelling and ordinary least square regression techniques were applied to explore social mobility and four measures of age acceleration (first-generation: 'Horvath', 'Hannum' and second-generation: 'Phenoage', DunedinPoAm) in n = 3140 participants of the UK Household Longitudinal Study. Disadvantaged SEP in early life is associated with positive AA for three (Hannum, Phenoage and DunedinPoAm) of the four measures examined while the second generation biomarkers are associated with SEP in adulthood (p < 0.01). Social mobility was associated with AA measured with Hannum only such that compared to no mobility, upward mobility was associated with greater age independently of origin and destination SEP. Compared to continuously advantaged groups, downward mobility was associated with positive Phenoage (1.06y [- 0.03, 2.14]) and DunedinPoAm assessed AA (0.96y [0.24, 1.68]). For these two measures, upward mobility was associated with negative AA (Phenoage, - 0.65y [- 1.30, - 0.002]; DunedinPoAm, - 0.96y [- 1.47, - 0.46]) compared to continually disadvantaged groups. While we find some support for three models of lifecourse epidemiology with early life as a sensitive period, SEP across the lifecourse and social mobility for age acceleration measured with DNA methylation, our findings suggest that disadvantaged SEP across the lifecourse is most consistently associated with positive AA.© 2022.

No,20230223,paul,cancer,35609926,Extrachromosomal DNA in Cancer,Annu Rev Genomics Hum Genet,"In cancer, complex genome rearrangements and other structural alterations, including the amplification of oncogenes on circular extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) elements, drive the formation and progression of tumors. ecDNA is a particularly challenging structural alteration. By untethering oncogenes from chromosomal constraints, it elevates oncogene copy number, drives intratumoral genetic heterogeneity, promotes rapid tumor evolution, and results in treatment resistance. The profound changes in DNA shape and nuclear architecture generated by ecDNA alter the transcriptional landscape of tumors by catalyzing new types of regulatory interactions that do not occur on chromosomes. The current suite of tools for interrogating cancer genomes is well suited for deciphering sequence but has limited ability to resolve the complex changes in DNA structure and dynamics that ecDNA generates. Here, we review the challenges of resolving ecDNA form and function and discuss the emerging tool kit for deciphering ecDNA architecture and spatial organization, including what has been learned to date about how this dramatic change in shape alters tumor development, progression, and drug resistance."
No,20230223,ryan,methods,31911605,Selecting likely causal risk factors from high-throughput experiments using multivariable Mendelian randomization,Nat Commun,"Modern high-throughput experiments provide a rich resource to investigate causal determinants of disease risk. Mendelian randomization (MR) is the use of genetic variants as instrumental variables to infer the causal effect of a specific risk factor on an outcome. Multivariable MR is an extension of the standard MR framework to consider multiple potential risk factors in a single model. However, current implementations of multivariable MR use standard linear regression and hence perform poorly with many risk factors. Here, we propose a two-sample multivariable MR approach based on Bayesian model averaging (MR-BMA) that scales to high-throughput experiments. In a realistic simulation study, we show that MR-BMA can detect true causal risk factors even when the candidate risk factors are highly correlated. We illustrate MR-BMA by analysing publicly-available summarized data on metabolites to prioritise likely causal biomarkers for age-related macular degeneration."
No,20230223,neil,pwas,36790168,"Proteome-wide antigenic profiling in Ugandan cohorts identifies associations between age, exposure intensity, and responses to repeat-containing antigens in Plasmodium falciparum",Elife,"Protection against Plasmodium falciparum, which is primarily antibody-mediated, requires recurrent exposure to develop. The study of both naturally acquired limited immunity and vaccine induced protection against malaria remains critical for ongoing eradication efforts. Towards this goal, we deployed a customized P. falciparum PhIP-seq T7 phage display library containing 238,068 tiled 62-amino acid peptides, covering all known coding regions, including antigenic variants, to systematically profile antibody targets in 198 Ugandan children and adults from high and moderate transmission settings. Repeat elements - short amino acid sequences repeated within a protein - were significantly enriched in antibody targets. While breadth of responses to repeat-containing peptides was twofold higher in children living in the high versus moderate exposure setting, no such differences were observed for peptides without repeats, suggesting that antibody responses to repeat-containing regions may be more exposure dependent and/or less durable in children than responses to regions without repeats. Additionally, short motifs associated with seroreactivity were extensively shared among hundreds of antigens, potentially representing cross-reactive epitopes. PfEMP1 shared motifs with the greatest number of other antigens, partly driven by the diversity of PfEMP1 sequences. These data suggest that the large number of repeat elements and potential cross-reactive epitopes found within antigenic regions of P. falciparum could contribute to the inefficient nature of malaria immunity."
No,20230223,neil,pqtl,35501419,Plasma proteome analyses in individuals of European and African ancestry identify cis-pQTLs and models for proteome-wide association studies,Nat Genet,"Improved understanding of genetic regulation of the proteome can facilitate identification of the causal mechanisms for complex traits. We analyzed data on 4,657 plasma proteins from 7,213 European American (EA) and 1,871 African American (AA) individuals from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study, and further replicated findings on 467 AA individuals from the African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension study. Here, we identified 2,004 proteins in EA and 1,618 in AA, with most overlapping, which showed associations with common variants in cis-regions. Availability of AA samples led to smaller credible sets and notable number of population-specific cis-protein quantitative trait loci. Elastic Net produced powerful models for protein prediction in both populations. An application of proteome-wide association studies to serum urate and gout implicated several proteins, including IL1RN, revealing the promise of the drug anakinra to treat acute gout flares. Our study demonstrates the value of large and diverse ancestry study to investigate the genetic mechanisms of molecular phenotypes and their relationship with complex traits."
