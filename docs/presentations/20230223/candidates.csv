"36803907","Epigenetic clock analysis reveals increased plasma cystatin C levels based on DNA methylation in major depressive disorder.","Psychiatry Res","Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common mental illness and a major public health concern worldwide. Depression is associated with epigenetic changes that regulate gene expression, and analyzing these changes may help elucidate the pathophysiology of MDD. Genome-wide DNA methylation (DNAm) profiles can function as 'epigenetic clocks' that can help estimate biological aging. Here, we assessed biological aging in patients with MDD using various DNAm-based indicators of epigenetic aging. We used a publicly available dataset containing data obtained from the whole blood samples of MDD patients (n = 489) and controls (n = 210). We analyzed five epigenetic clocks (HorvathAge, HannumAge, SkinBloodAge, PhenoAge, and GrimAge) and DNAm-based telomere length (DNAmTL). We also investigated seven DNAm-based age-predictive plasma proteins (including cystatin C) and smoking status, which are components of GrimAge. Following adjustment for confounding factors such as age and sex, patients with MDD showed no significant difference in epigenetic clocks and DNAmTL. However, DNAm-based plasma cystatin C levels were significantly higher in patients with MDD than controls. Our findings revealed specific DNAm changes predicting plasma cystatin C levels in MDD. These findings may help elucidate the pathophysiology of MDD, leading to the development of new biomarkers and medications.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"36803844","Utility of promoter hypermethylation in malignant risk stratification of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms.","Clin Epigenetics","Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs), a type of cystic pancreatic cancer (PC) precursors, are increasingly identified on cross-sectional imaging and present a significant diagnostic challenge. While surgical resection of IPMN-related advanced neoplasia, i.e., IPMN-related high-grade dysplasia or PC, is an essential early PC detection strategy, resection is not recommended for IPMN-low-grade dysplasia (LGD) due to minimal risk of carcinogenesis, and significant procedural risks. Based on their promising results in prior validation studies targeting early detection of classical PC, DNA hypermethylation-based markers may serve as a biomarker for malignant risk stratification of IPMNs. This study investigates our DNA methylation-based PC biomarker panel (ADAMTS1, BNC1, and CACNA1G genes) in differentiating IPMN-advanced neoplasia from IPMN-LGDs.Our previously described genome-wide pharmaco-epigenetic method identified multiple genes as potential targets for PC detection. The combination was further optimized and validated for early detection of classical PC in previous case-control studies. These promising genes were evaluated among micro-dissected IPMN tissue (IPMN-LGD: 35, IPMN-advanced neoplasia: 35) through Methylation-Specific PCR. The discriminant capacity of individual and combination of genes were delineated through Receiver Operating Characteristics curve analysis.As compared to IPMN-LGDs, IPMN-advanced neoplasia had higher hypermethylation frequency of candidate genes: ADAMTS1 (60% vs. 14%), BNC1 (66% vs. 3%), and CACGNA1G (25% vs. 0%). We observed Area Under Curve (AUC) values of 0.73 for ADAMTS1, 0.81 for BNC1, and 0.63 for CACNA1G genes. The combination of the BNC1/ CACNA1G genes resulted in an AUC of 0.84, sensitivity of 71%, and specificity of 97%. Combining the methylation status of the BNC1/CACNA1G genes, blood-based CA19-9, and IPMN lesion size enhanced the AUC to 0.92.DNA-methylation based biomarkers have shown a high diagnostic specificity and moderate sensitivity for differentiating IPMN-advanced neoplasia from LGDs. Addition of specific methylation targets can improve the accuracy of the methylation biomarker panel and enable the development of noninvasive IPMN stratification biomarkers.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"36803404","Distinct genome-wide DNA methylation and gene expression signatures in classical monocytes from African American patients with systemic sclerosis.","Clin Epigenetics","Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a multisystem autoimmune disorder that has an unclear etiology and disproportionately affects women and African Americans. Despite this, African Americans are dramatically underrepresented in SSc research. Additionally, monocytes show heightened activation in SSc and in African Americans relative to European Americans. In this study, we sought to investigate DNA methylation and gene expression patterns in classical monocytes in a health disparity population.Classical monocytes (CD14+ + CD16-) were FACS-isolated from 34 self-reported African American women. Samples from 12 SSc patients and 12 healthy controls were hybridized on MethylationEPIC BeadChip array, while RNA-seq was performed on 16 SSc patients and 18 healthy controls. Analyses were computed to identify differentially methylated CpGs (DMCs), differentially expressed genes (DEGs), and CpGs associated with changes in gene expression (eQTM analysis).We observed modest DNA methylation and gene expression differences between cases and controls. The genes harboring the top DMCs, the top DEGs, as well as the top eQTM loci were enriched for metabolic processes. Genes involved in immune processes and pathways showed a weak upregulation in the transcriptomic analysis. While many genes were newly identified, several other have been previously reported as differentially methylated or expressed in different blood cells from patients with SSc, supporting for their potential dysregulation in SSc.While contrasting with results found in other blood cell types in largely European-descent groups, the results of this study support that variation in DNA methylation and gene expression exists among different cell types and individuals of different genetic, clinical, social, and environmental backgrounds. This finding supports the importance of including diverse, well-characterized patients to understand the different roles of DNA methylation and gene expression variability in the dysregulation of classical monocytes in diverse populations, which might help explaining the health disparities.© 2023.

Epigenome-wide association study identifies markers of severe outcome.","Eur J Med Res","COVID-19 has a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations and given its impact on morbidity and mortality, there is an unmet medical need to discover endogenous cellular and molecular biomarkers that predict the expected clinical course of the disease. Recently, epigenetics and especially DNA methylation have been pointed out as a promising tool for outcome prediction in several diseases.Using the Illumina Infinium Methylation EPIC BeadChip850K, we investigated genome-wide differences in DNA methylation in an Italian Cohort of patients with comorbidities and compared severe (n = 64) and mild (123) prognosis. Results showed that the epigenetic signature, already present at the time of Hospital admission, can significantly predict risk of severe outcomes. Further analyses provided evidence of an association between age acceleration and a severe prognosis after COVID-19 infection. The burden of Stochastic Epigenetic Mutation (SEMs) has been significantly increased in patients with poor prognosis. Results have been replicated in silico considering COVID-19 negative subjects and available previously published datasets.Using original methylation data and taking advantage of already published datasets, we confirmed in the blood that epigenetics is actively involved in immune response after COVID-19 infection, allowing the identification of a specific signature able to discriminate the disease evolution. Furthermore, the study showed that epigenetic drift and age acceleration are associated with severe prognosis. All these findings prove that host epigenetics undergoes notable and specific rearrangements to respond to COVID-19 infection which can be used for a personalized, timely, and targeted management of COVID-19 patients during the first stages of hospitalization.© 2023.

"36797830","Estimating the overall fraction of phenotypic variance attributed to high-dimensional predictors measured with error.","Biostatistics","In prospective genomic studies (e.g., DNA methylation, metagenomics, and transcriptomics), it is crucial to estimate the overall fraction of phenotypic variance (OFPV) attributed to the high-dimensional genomic variables, a concept similar to heritability analyses in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Unlike genetic variants in GWAS, these genomic variables are typically measured with error due to technical limitation and temporal instability. While the existing methods developed for GWAS can be used, ignoring measurement error may severely underestimate OFPV and mislead the design of future studies. Assuming that measurement error variances are distributed similarly between causal and noncausal variables, we show that the asymptotic attenuation factor equals to the average intraclass correlation coefficients of all genomic variables, which can be estimated based on a pilot study with repeated measurements. We illustrate the method by estimating the contribution of microbiome taxa to body mass index and multiple allergy traits in the American Gut Project. Finally, we show that measurement error does not cause meaningful bias when estimating the correlation of effect sizes for two traits.Published by Oxford University Press 2023.

"36797465","Identification of a DNA methylation signature for renpenning syndrome (RENS1), a spliceopathy.","Eur J Hum Genet","The challenges and ambiguities in providing an accurate diagnosis for patients with neurodevelopmental disorders have led researchers to apply epigenetics as a technique to validate the diagnosis provided based on the clinical examination and genetic testing results. Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis has recently been adapted for clinical testing of patients with genetic neurodevelopmental disorders. In this paper, preliminary data demonstrating a DNA methylation signature for Renpenning syndrome (RENS1 - OMIM 309500), which is an X-linked recessive neurodevelopmental disorder caused by variants in polyglutamine-binding protein 1 (PQBP1) is reported. The identified episignature was then utilized to construct a highly sensitive and specific binary classification model. Besides providing evidence for the existence of a DNA methylation episignature for Renpenning syndrome, this study increases the knowledge of the molecular mechanisms related to the disease. Moreover, the availability of more subjects in future may facilitate the establishment of an episignature that can be utilized for diagnosis in a clinical setting and for reclassification of variants of unknown clinical significance.© 2023.

"36797233","Functional connectivity signatures of NMDAR dysfunction in schizophrenia-integrating findings from imaging genetics and pharmaco-fMRI.","Transl Psychiatry","Both, pharmacological and genome-wide association studies suggest N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) dysfunction and excitatory/inhibitory (E/I)-imbalance as a major pathophysiological mechanism of schizophrenia. The identification of shared fMRI brain signatures of genetically and pharmacologically induced NMDAR dysfunction may help to define biomarkers for patient stratification. NMDAR-related genetic and pharmacological effects on functional connectivity were investigated by integrating three different datasets: (A) resting state fMRI data from 146 patients with schizophrenia genotyped for the disease-associated genetic variant rs7191183 of GRIN2A (encoding the NMDAR 2 A subunit) as well as 142 healthy controls. (B) Pharmacological effects of the NMDAR antagonist ketamine and the GABA-A receptor agonist midazolam were obtained from a double-blind, crossover pharmaco-fMRI study in 28 healthy participants. (C) Regional gene expression profiles were estimated using a postmortem whole-brain microarray dataset from six healthy donors. A strong resemblance was observed between the effect of the genetic variant in schizophrenia and the ketamine versus midazolam contrast of connectivity suggestive for an associated E/I-imbalance. This similarity became more pronounced for regions with high density of NMDARs, glutamatergic neurons, and parvalbumin-positive interneurons. From a functional perspective, increased connectivity emerged between striato-pallido-thalamic regions and cortical regions of the auditory-sensory-motor network, while decreased connectivity was observed between auditory (superior temporal gyrus) and visual processing regions (lateral occipital cortex, fusiform gyrus, cuneus). Importantly, these imaging phenotypes were associated with the genetic variant, the differential effect of ketamine versus midazolam and schizophrenia (as compared to healthy controls). Moreover, the genetic variant was associated with language-related negative symptomatology which correlated with disturbed connectivity between the left posterior superior temporal gyrus and the superior lateral occipital cortex. Shared genetic and pharmacological functional connectivity profiles were suggestive of E/I-imbalance and associated with schizophrenia. The identified brain signatures may help to stratify patients with a common molecular disease pathway providing a basis for personalized psychiatry.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Although BDR is affected by gene and environmental factors, the influence of DNA methylation (DNAm) is unknown.This study aims to identify epigenetic markers in whole blood associated with BDR, study their functional consequences by multi-omic integration, and assess their clinical applicability in admixed populations with a high asthma burden.We studied 414 children and young adults asthma patients (8-21 years old) in a discovery and replication design. We performed an epigenome-wide association study on 221 African Americans and replicated the results on 193 Latinos. Functional consequences were assessed by integrating epigenomics with genomics, transcriptomics, and environmental exposure data. Furthermore, a machine learning approach was used to develop a panel of epigenetic markers to classify treatment response.We identified five differentially methylated regions and two CpGs genome-wide significantly associated with BDR in African Americans located in FGL2 (cg08241295, p=6.8x10-9) and DNASE2 (cg15341340, p=7.8x10-8), which were regulated by genetic variation and/or associated with gene expression of nearby genes (false discovery rate<0.05). The CpG cg15341340 was replicated in Latinos (p=3.5x10-3). Moreover, a panel of 70 CpGs showed good classification for albuterol responders and nonresponders in African American and Latino children (AUCtraining:0.99, AUCvalidation:0.70-0.71). DNAm model showed similar discrimination as clinical predictors (p>0.05).We report novel associations of epigenetic markers with BDR in pediatric asthma and demonstrate for the first time the applicability of pharmacoepigenetics in precision medicine of respiratory diseases.Copyright © 2023.

"36793679","Differences by origin in methylome suggest eco-phenotypes in the kelp Saccharina latissima.","Evol Appl","Most kelp species are of high ecological and economic importance worldwide, but are highly susceptible to rising ocean temperatures due to their sessile lifestyle. Due to interference with reproduction, development and growth, natural kelp forests have vanished in multiple regions after extreme summer heat waves. Furthermore, increasing temperatures are likely to decrease biomass production and, thus, reduce production security of farmed kelp. Epigenetic variation, and cytosine methylation as a heritable epigenetic trait, is a rapid means of acclimation and adaptation to environmental conditions, including temperature. While the first methylome of brown macroalgae has been recently described in the kelpSaccharina japonica, its functional relevance and contribution to environmental acclimation is currently unknown. The main objective of our study was to identify the importance of the methylome in the congener kelp speciesSaccharina latissimafor temperature acclimation. Our study is the first to compare DNA methylation in kelp between wild populations of different latitudinal origin, and the first to investigate the effect of cultivation and rearing temperature on genome-wide cytosine methylation. Origin appears to determine many traits in kelp, but it is unknown to what extent the effects of thermal acclimation may be overruled by lab-related acclimation. Our results suggest that seaweed hatchery conditions have strong effects on the methylome and, thus, putatively on the epigenetically controlled characteristics of young kelp sporophytes. However, culture origin could best explain epigenetic differences in our samples suggesting that epigenetic mechanisms contribute to local adaptation of eco-phenotypes. Our study is a first step to understand whether DNA methylation marks (via their effect on gene regulation) may be used as biological regulators to enhance production security and kelp restoration success under rising temperatures, and highlights the importance to match hatchery conditions to origin.© 2022 The Authors.

"36793308","METTL3 promotes SMSCs chondrogenic differentiation by targeting the MMP3, MMP13, and GATA3.","Regen Ther","Synovium-derived mesenchymal stem cells (SMSCs) are multipotential non-hematopoietic progenitor cells that can differentiate into various mesenchymal lineages in adipose and bone tissue, especially in chondrogenesis. Post-transcriptional methylation modifications are relative to the various biological development procedures. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methylation has been identified as one of the abundant widespread post-transcriptional modifications. However, the connection between the SMSCs differentiation and m6A methylation remains unknown and needs further exploration.SMSCs were derived from synovial tissues of the knee joint of male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. In the chondrogenesis of SMSCs, m6A regulators were detected by quantitative real-time PCR (RT-PCR) and Western blot (WB). We observed the situation that the knockdown of m6A ""writer"" protein methyltransferase-like (METTL)3 in the chondrogenesis of SMSCs. We also mapped the transcript-wide m6A landscape in chondrogenic differentiation of SMSCs and combined RNA-seq and MeRIP-seq in SMSCs by the interference of METTL3.The expression of m6A regulators were regulated in the chondrogenesis of SMSCs, only METTL3 is the most significant factor. In addition, after the knockdown of METTL3, MeRIP-seq and RNA-seq technology were applied to analyze the transcriptome level in SMSCs. 832 DEGs displayed significant changes, consisting of 438 upregulated genes and 394 downregulated genes. DEGs were enriched in signaling pathways regulating the glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis-chondroitin sulfate/dermatan sulfate and ECM-receptor interaction via Kyoto Encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis. The findings of this study indicate a difference in transcripts of MMP3, MMP13, and GATA3 containing consensus m6A motifs required for methylation by METTL3. Further, the reduction of METTL3 decreased the expression of MMP3, MMP13, and GATA3.These findings confirm the molecular mechanisms of METTL3-mediated m6A post-transcriptional change in the modulation of SMSCs differentiating into chondrocytes, thus highlighting the potential therapeutic effect of SMSCs for cartilage regeneration.© 2023 The Japanese Society for Regenerative Medicine.

The aim of this study was to identify DNA-methylation loci associated with plasma lipids in Ghanaians.We conducted an EWAS using Illumina 450k DNA-methylation array profiles of extracted DNA from 663 Ghanaian participants. Differentially methylated positions (DMPs) were examined for association with plasma total cholesterol (TC), LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides concentrations using linear regression models adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, diabetes mellitus, and technical covariates. Findings were replicated in independent cohorts of different ethnicities.We identified one significantly associated DMP with triglycerides (cg19693031 annotated to TXNIP, regression coefficient beta -0.26, false discovery rate adjusted p-value 0.001), which replicated in-silico in South African Batswana, African American, and European populations. From the top five DMPs with the lowest nominal p-values, two additional DMPs for triglycerides (CPT1A, ABCG1), two DMPs for LDL-cholesterol (EPSTI1, cg13781819), and one for TC (TXNIP) replicated. With the exception of EPSTI1, these loci are involved in lipid transport/metabolism or are known GWAS-associated loci. The top 5 DMPs per lipid trait explained 9.5% in the variance of TC, 8.3% in LDL-cholesterol, 6.1% in HDL-cholesterol, and 11.0% in triglycerides.The top DMPs identified in this study are in loci that play a role in lipid metabolism across populations, including West-Africans.

Variation in tumor DNA methylation shows promise predicting outcome, yet prior studies were largely platform-specific and unable to evaluate multiple molecular features.We analyzed genome-wide DNA methylation in 1,040 frozen HGSC, including 325 previously reported upon, seeking a multi-platform quantitative methylation signature that we evaluated in relation to clinical features, tumor characteristics, time to recurrence/death, extent of CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL), gene expression molecular subtypes, and gene expression of the ATP-binding cassette transporter TAP1.Methylation signature was associated with shorter time to recurrence, independent of clinical factors (N = 715 new set, hazard ratio (HR), 1.65; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.10-2.46; P = 0.015; N = 325 published set HR, 2.87; 95% CI, 2.17-3.81; P = 2.2 × 10-13) and remained prognostic after adjustment for gene expression molecular subtype and TAP1 expression (N = 599; HR, 2.22; 95% CI, 1.66-2.95; P = 4.1 × 10-8). Methylation signature was inversely related to CD8+ TIL levels (P = 2.4 × 10-7) and TAP1 expression (P = 0.0011) and was associated with gene expression molecular subtype (P = 5.9 × 10-4) in covariate-adjusted analysis.Multi-center analysis identified a novel quantitative tumor methylation signature of HGSC applicable to numerous commercially available platforms indicative of shorter time to recurrence/death, adjusting for other factors. Along with immune cell composition analysis, these results suggest a role for DNA methylation in the immunosuppressive microenvironment.This work aids in identification of targetable epigenome processes and stratification of patients for whom tailored treatment may be most beneficial.©2023 American Association for Cancer Research."

Given DNA methylation (DNAm) may alter transcriptional levels, we further integrated an imaging-transcriptomic-epigenetic analysis to explore multi-omics treatment response biomarkers.Forty-two treatment-naive first-episode schizophrenia patients were scanned by TI weighted (T1W) imaging and DTI before and after 8-week risperidone monotherapy, and their peripheral blood genomic DNAm values were examined in parallel with MRI scanning. Morphometric similarity network (MSN) quantified with DTI and T1W data were used as a marker of treatment-related alterations in interareal cortical connectivity. We utilized partial least squares (PLS) to examine spatial associations between treatment-related MSN variations and cortical transcriptomic data obtained from the Allen Human Brain Atlas.Longitudinal MSN alterations were related to treatment response on cognitive function and general psychopathology symptoms, while DNAm values of 59 PLS1 genes were on negative and positive symptoms. Virtual-histology transcriptomic analysis linked the MSN alterations with the neurobiological, cellular and metabolic pathways or processes, and assigned MSN-related genes to multiple cell types, specifying neurons and glial cells as contributing most to the transcriptomic associations of longitudinal changes in MSN.We firstly reveal how brain-wide transcriptional levels and cell classes capture molecularly validated cortical connectivity alterations after antipsychotic treatment.

"36585691","Whole-blood methylation signatures are associated with and accurately classify multiple sclerosis disease severity.","Clin Epigenetics","The variation in multiple sclerosis (MS) disease severity is incompletely explained by genetics, suggesting genetic and environmental interactions are involved. Moreover, the lack of prognostic biomarkers makes it difficult for clinicians to optimise care. DNA methylation is one epigenetic mechanism by which gene-environment interactions can be assessed. Here, we aimed to identify DNA methylation patterns associated with mild and severe relapse-onset MS (RMS) and to test the utility of methylation as a predictive biomarker.We conducted an epigenome-wide association study between 235 females with mild (n = 119) or severe (n = 116) with RMS. Methylation was measured with the Illumina methylationEPIC array and analysed using logistic regression. To generate hypotheses about the functional consequence of differential methylation, we conducted gene set enrichment analysis using ToppGene. We compared the accuracy of three machine learning models in classifying disease severity: (1) clinical data available at baseline (age at onset and first symptoms) built using elastic net (EN) regression, (2) methylation data using EN regression and (3) a weighted methylation risk score of differentially methylated positions (DMPs) from the main analysis using logistic regression. We used a conservative 70:30 test:train split for classification modelling. A false discovery rate threshold of 0.05 was used to assess statistical significance.Females with mild or severe RMS had 1472 DMPs in whole blood (839 hypermethylated, 633 hypomethylated in the severe group). Differential methylation was enriched in genes related to neuronal cellular compartments and processes, and B-cell receptor signalling. Whole-blood methylation levels at 1708 correlated CpG sites classified disease severity more accurately (machine learning model 2, AUC = 0.91) than clinical data (model 1, AUC = 0.74) or the wMRS (model 3, AUC = 0.77). Of the 1708 selected CpGs, 100 overlapped with DMPs from the main analysis at the gene level. These overlapping genes were enriched in neuron projection and dendrite extension, lending support to our finding that neuronal processes, rather than immune processes, are implicated in disease severity.RMS disease severity is associated with whole-blood methylation at genes related to neuronal structure and function. Moreover, correlated whole-blood methylation patterns can assign disease severity in females with RMS more accurately than clinical data available at diagnosis.© 2022. Crown."

Twenty-five DMPs annotated to 20 genes (QSOX1, FCHSD2, LOC101928162, ADGRB3, GCNT1, TAP1, MYO16, NAV1, ATP8A2, LBXCOR1, EN2, INCA1, CAMTA2, SORCS2, SLC4A4, RPA3, UMAD1,USP53, OR2L13 and NR3C2) could explain 80% of the birth weight variations. Pathway analyses did not detect any statistically significant pathways after correcting for multiple tests. We validated a newly discovered differentially (hyper-)methylated gene-visual system homeobox 1 (VSX1) in an independent pyrosequencing study sample (LGA 47, OGA 47). Our data confirmed a hypermethylated gene-cadherin 13 (CDH13) reported in a previous epigenome-wide association study. Adiponectin in cord blood was correlated with its gene methylation in the placenta, while leptin and fetal growth factors (insulin, IGF-1, IGF-2) were not.Fetal overgrowth may be associated with a large number of altered placental gene methylations. Placental VSX1 and CDH13 genes are hypermethylated in fetal overgrowth. Placental ADIPOQ gene methylations and fetal circulating adiponectin levels were correlated, suggesting the contribution of placenta-originated adiponectin to cord blood adiponectin.© 2022.

The datasets are processed from raw read count data collected from five types of sequencing-based assays collected by the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements consortium (ENCODE, http://www.encodeproject.org). Data from high-throughput sequencing assays were processed and crystallized into a total of 6,305 genome-wide profiles. To ensure the quality of the features, we filtered out assays with low read depth, inconsistent read counts, and poor data quality. The types of sequencing-based experiment assays include DNase-seq, histone and TF ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, and Poly(A) RNA-seq. Merging of processed data was done by averaging read counts across technical replicates to obtain signals in about 30 million predefined 100-bp bins that tile the entire genome. We provide an example of fetching read counts using disease-related risk variants from the GWAS Catalog. Additionally, we have created a tabix index enabling fast user retrieval of read counts given coordinates in the human genome. The data processing pipeline is replicable for users' own purposes and for other experimental assays. The processed data can be found on Zenodo at https://zenodo.org/record/7015783. These data can be used as features for statistical and machine learning models to predict or infer a wide range of variables of biological interest. They can also be applied to generate novel insights into gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and epigenetic modifications across the human genome. Finally, the processing pipeline can be easily applied to data from any other genome-wide profiling assays, expanding the amount of available data.© 2022 The Author(s)."

In addition to their antioxidant power, polyphenols have also drawn attention for being able to modulate both gene expression and modify epigenetic alterations, suggesting an essential involvement in the prevention and/or development of some pathologies. Therefore, this review briefly explained the mechanisms in the development of some NCDs, followed by a summary of some evidence related to the interaction of polyphenols in oxidative stress, as well as the modulation of epigenetic mechanisms involved in the management of NCDs.© 2022 The Author(s)."
"36581877","Chromatin modifier developmental pluripotency associated factor 4 (DPPA4) is a candidate gene for alcohol-induced developmental disorders.","BMC Med","Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) affects embryonic development, causing a variable fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) phenotype with neuronal disorders and birth defects. We hypothesize that early alcohol-induced epigenetic changes disrupt the accurate developmental programming of embryo and consequently cause the complex phenotype of developmental disorders. To explore the etiology of FASD, we collected unique biological samples of 80 severely alcohol-exposed and 100 control newborns at birth.We performed genome-wide DNA methylation (DNAm) and gene expression analyses of placentas by using microarrays (EPIC, Illumina) and mRNA sequencing, respectively. To test the manifestation of observed PAE-associated DNAm changes in embryonic tissues as well as potential biomarkers for PAE, we examined if the changes can be detected also in white blood cells or buccal epithelial cells of the same newborns by EpiTYPER. To explore the early effects of alcohol on extraembryonic placental tissue, we selected 27 newborns whose mothers had consumed alcohol up to gestational week 7 at maximum to the separate analyses. Furthermore, to explore the effects of early alcohol exposure on embryonic cells, human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) as well as hESCs during differentiation into endodermal, mesodermal, and ectodermal cells were exposed to alcohol in vitro.DPPA4, FOXP2, and TACR3 with significantly decreased DNAm were discovered-particularly the regulatory region of DPPA4 in the early alcohol-exposed placentas. When hESCs were exposed to alcohol in vitro, significantly altered regulation of DPPA2, a closely linked heterodimer of DPPA4, was observed. While the regulatory region of DPPA4 was unmethylated in both control and alcohol-exposed hESCs, alcohol-induced decreased DNAm similar to placenta was seen in in vitro differentiated mesodermal and ectodermal cells. Furthermore, common genes with alcohol-associated DNAm changes in placenta and hESCs were linked exclusively to the neurodevelopmental pathways in the enrichment analysis, which emphasizes the value of placental tissue when analyzing the effects of prenatal environment on human development.Our study shows the effects of early alcohol exposure on human embryonic and extraembryonic cells, introduces candidate genes for alcohol-induced developmental disorders, and reveals potential biomarkers for prenatal alcohol exposure.© 2022.

"36577841","In individuals with Williams syndrome, dysregulation of methylation in non-coding regions of neuronal and oligodendrocyte DNA is associated with pathology and cortical development.","Mol Psychiatry","Williams syndrome (WS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by a heterozygous micro-deletion in the WS critical region (WSCR) and is characterized by hyper-sociability and neurocognitive abnormalities. Nonetheless, whether and to what extent WSCR deletion leads to epigenetic modifications in the brain and induces pathological outcomes remains largely unknown. By examining DNA methylation in frontal cortex, we revealed genome-wide disruption in the methylome of individuals with WS, as compared to typically developed (TD) controls. Surprisingly, differentially methylated sites were predominantly annotated as introns and intergenic loci and were found to be highly enriched around binding sites for transcription factors that regulate neuronal development, plasticity and cognition. Moreover, by utilizing enhancer-promoter interactome data, we confirmed that most of these loci function as active enhancers in the human brain or as target genes of transcriptional networks associated with myelination, oligodendrocyte (OL) differentiation, cognition and social behavior. Cell type-specific methylation analysis revealed aberrant patterns in the methylation of active enhancers in neurons and OLs, and important neuron-glia interactions that might be impaired in individuals with WS. Finally, comparison of methylation profiles from blood samples of individuals with WS and healthy controls, along with other data collected in this study, identified putative targets of endophenotypes associated with WS, which can be used to define brain-risk loci for WS outside the WSCR locus, as well as for other associated pathologies. In conclusion, our study illuminates the brain methylome landscape of individuals with WS and sheds light on how these aberrations might be involved in social behavior and physiological abnormalities. By extension, these results may lead to better diagnostics and more refined therapeutic targets for WS.© 2022. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited."
"36577721","Dissecting the epigenomic differences between smoking and nicotine dependence in a veteran cohort.","Addict Biol","Smoking is a serious public health issue linked to more than 8 million deaths per year worldwide and may lead to nicotine dependence (ND). Although the epigenomic literature on smoking is well established, studies evaluating the role of epigenetics in ND are limited. In this study, we examined the epigenomic signatures of ND and how these differ from smoking exposure to identify biomarkers specific to ND. We investigated the peripheral epigenetic profile of smoking status (SS) and ND in a US male veteran cohort. DNA from saliva was collected from 1135 European American (EA) male US military veterans. DNAm was assessed using the Illumina Infinium Human MethylationEPIC BeadChip array. SS was evaluated as current smokers (n = 137; 12.1%) and non-current smokers (never and former; n = 998; 87.9%). NDFTNDwas assessed as a continuous variable using the Fagerström Test for ND (FTND; n = 1135; mean = 2.54 ± 2.29). Epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) and co-methylation analyses were conducted for SS and NDFTND. A total of 450 and 22 genome-wide significant differentially methylated sites (DMS) were associated with SS and NDFTND, respectively (15 overlapped DMS). We identified 97 DMS (43 genes) in SS-EWAS previously reported in the literature, including AHRR and F2RL3 genes (p-value: 1.95 × 10-83to 4.55 × 10-33). NDFTNDnovel DMS mapped to NEUROG1, ANPEP, and SLC29A1. Co-methylation analysis identified 386 modules (11 SS-related and 19 NDFTND-related). SS-related modules showed enrichment for alcoholism, while NDFTND-related modules were enriched for nicotine addiction. This study confirms previous findings associated with SS and identifies novel and-potentially specific-epigenetic biomarkers of ND that may inform prognosis and novel treatment strategies.© 2022 Society for the Study of Addiction."
"36577521","Genome-wide evaluation of the effect of short tandem repeat variation on local DNA methylation.","Genome Res","Short tandem repeats (STRs) contribute significantly to genetic diversity in humans, including disease-causing variation. While the effect of STR variation on gene expression has been extensively assessed, their impact on epigenetics has been poorly studied and limited to specific genomic regions. Here, we investigated the hypothesis that some STRs act as independent regulators of local DNA methylation in the human genome, and modify risk of common human traits. To address these questions, we first analyzed two independent datasets comprising PCR-free whole genome sequencing (WGS) and genome-wide DNA methylation levels derived from whole blood samples in 245 (discovery cohort) and 484 individuals (replication cohort). Utilizing genotypes for 131,635 polymorphic STRs derived from WGS using HipSTR, we identified 11,870 STRs that associated with DNA methylation levels (mSTRs) of 11,774 CpGs (Bonferroni p<0.001) in our discovery cohort, with 90% successfully replicating in our second cohort. Subsequently, through fine-mapping using CAVIAR we defined 585 of these mSTRs as the likely causal variants underlying the observed associations (fm-mSTRs), and linked a fraction of these to previously reported genome-wide association study signals, providing insights into the mechanisms underlying complex human traits. Furthermore, by integrating gene expression data, we observed that 12.5% of the tested fm-mSTRs also modulate expression levels of nearby genes, reinforcing their regulatory potential. Overall, our findings expand the catalog of functional sequence variants that affect genome regulation, highlighting the importance of incorporating STRs in future genetic association analysis and epigenetics data for the interpretation of trait-associated variants.Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press."
"36575384","Integrated transcriptome and methylome analyses reveal the molecular regulation of drought stress in wild strawberry (Fragaria nilgerrensis).","BMC Plant Biol","Fragaria nilgerrensis, which is a diploid wild strawberry with excellent drought-resistance, would provide useful candidate genes for improving drought resistance of cultivated strawberry. So far, its molecular regulatory networks involved in drought stress are unclear. We therefore investigated the drought response regulatory networks of F. nilgerrensis based on the integrated analysis of DNA methylation, transcriptome and physiological traits during four time points under drought stress.  RESULTS: The most differentially expressed genes and the physiological changes were found at 8 days (T8) compared with 0 day (T0, control). Methylome analysis revealed slight dynamic changes in genome-wide mC levels under drought conditions, while the most hypomethylated and hypermethylated regions were identified at T4 and T8. Association analysis of the methylome and transcriptome revealed that unexpressed genes exhibited expected hypermethylation levels in mCHG and mCHH contexts, and highly expressed genes exhibited corresponding hypomethylation levels in the gene body, but mCG contexts showed the opposite trend. Then, 835 differentially methylated and expressed genes were identified and grouped into four clustering patterns to characterize their functions. The genes with either negative or positive correlation between methylation and gene expression were mainly associated with kinases, Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) synthesis, scavenging, and the abscisic acid (ABA) signal pathway. Consistently, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) revealed Hub genes including NCED, CYP707A2, PP2Cs and others that play important roles in the ABA signaling pathway.F. nilgerrensis drought is dominated by ABA-dependent pathways, possibly accompanied by ABA-independent crosstalk. DNA methylation may affect gene expression, but their correlation was more subtle and multiple types of association exist. Maintaining the balance between ROS regeneration and scavenging is an important factor in drought resistance in F. nilgerrensis. These results deepen our understanding of drought resistance and its application in breeding in strawberry plants.© 2022. The Author(s)."

"36575183","High-precision mapping reveals rare N(6)-deoxyadenosine methylation in the mammalian genome.","Cell Discov","N6-deoxyadenosine methylation (6mA) is the most widespread type of DNA modification in prokaryotes and is also abundantly distributed in some unicellular eukaryotes. However, 6mA levels are remarkably low in mammals. The lack of a precise and comprehensive mapping method has hindered more advanced investigations of 6mA. Here, we report a new method MM-seq (modification-induced mismatch sequencing) for genome-wide 6mA mapping based on a novel detection principle. We found that modified DNA bases are prone to form a local open region that allows capture by antibody, for example, via a DNA breathing or base-flipping mechanism. Specified endonuclease or exonuclease can recognize the antibody-stabilized mismatch-like structure and mark the exact modified sites for sequencing readout. Using this method, we examined the genomic positions of 6mA in bacteria (E. coli), green algae (C. reinhardtii), and mammalian cells (HEK239T, Huh7, and HeLa cells). In contrast to bacteria and green algae, human cells possess a very limited number of 6mA sites which are sporadically distributed across the genome of different cell types. After knocking out the RNA m6A methyltransferase METTL3 in mouse ES cells, 6mA becomes mostly diminished. Our results imply that rare 6mA in the mammalian genome is introduced by RNA m6A machinery via a non-targeted mechanism.© 2022. The Author(s)."

However, the DNA methylation regulators involved in horse milk traits have not been clarified. To explore the important role of genome-wide DNA methylation in regulating equine milk yield, this study systematically investigated the genome-wide DNA methylation profiles of Kazakh horse blood by comparing a high-production group (HP, average daily milk yield of 7.5 kg) and low-production group (LP, average daily milk yield of 3.2 kg) using deep whole-genome bisulfite sequencing. First, both groups showed similar proportions of methylation at CpG sites. Subsequently, we identified 26,677 differential methylated regions (DMRs) of CG, 15 DMRs of CHG, 480 DMRs of CHH and 8268 DMR-related genes (DMGs). GO and KEGG analyses revealed that some DMGs were involved in regulating milk and milk component formation. By combining the WGBS-seq and the previous RNA-seq data, a total of 94 overlapping genes were obtained. Finally, we found that 9 DMGs are likely involved in milk production by Kazakh horses.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Repeat number variation in genomic DNA was evaluated, along with the analysis of H3K4me3 by using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq). Analyses were performed with material extracted from whole blood of the adolescents, complemented by in vitro assessments of human (HeLa) cells exposed to 10 nM BPA, specifically, immunofluorescence evaluation of protein levels, gene expression analysis and ChIP‒qPCR analysis.Adolescents in the high urinary BPA levels group presented a higher level of Satellite A (SATA) repetitive region copy numbers compared to those in the low BPA group and a tendency towards increase in telomere length. We also observed decreased DNA methylation at the promoters of the imprinted genes H19, KCNQ1, and IGF2; at LINE1 retroelements; and at the ARID2, EGFR and ESRRA and TERT genes. Genome-wide sequencing revealed increased H3K4me3 occupancy at the promoters of genes encoding histone acetyltransferases, telomeric DNA binding factors and DNA repair genes. Results were supported in HeLa cells exposed to 10 nM BPA in vitro. In accordance with the data obtained in blood samples, we observed higher H3K4me3 occupancy and lower DNA methylation at some specific targets in HeLa cells. In exposed cells, changes in the expression of genes encoding DNA repair factors (ATM, ARID2, TRP53) were observed, and increased expression of several genes encoding telomeric DNA binding factors (SMG7, TERT, TEN1, UPF1, ZBTB48) were also found. Furthermore, an increase in ESR1/ERa was observed in the nuclei of HeLa cells along with increased binding of ESR1 to KAT5, KMT2E and TERF2IP promoters and decreased ESR1 binding at the RARA promoter. The DNA damage marker p53/TP53 was also increased.In this pilot study, genome-wide analysis of histone trimethylation in adolescent males exposed to BPA revealed a global impact on the expression of genes encoding telomeric binding proteins and histone acetyltransferase factors with similar results in HeLa cells.

Variation in clinical presentation, the rate of disease progression, and treatment responsiveness have been observed amongst DMD patients, suggesting that factors beyond the loss of dystrophin may contribute to DMD pathophysiology. Epigenetic mechanisms are becoming recognized as important factors implicated in the etiology and progression of various diseases. A growing number of genetic syndromes have been associated with unique genomic DNA methylation patterns (called ""episignatures"") that can be used for diagnostic testing and as disease biomarkers. To further investigate DMD pathophysiology, we assessed the genome-wide DNA methylation profiles of peripheral blood from 36 patients with DMD using the combination of Illumina Infinium Methylation EPIC bead chip array and EpiSign technology. We identified a unique episignature for DMD that whose specificity was confirmed in relation other neurodevelopmental disorders with known episignatures. By modeling the DMD episignature, we developed a new DMD episignature biomarker and provided novel insights into the molecular pathogenesis of this disorder, which have the potential to advance more effective, personalized approaches to DMD care.Copyright © 2022.

Despite growing evidence involving epigenetic processes, such as DNA methylation, in response to pesticide contamination in agroecosystems, research on wild populations of non-model species remains scarce, particularly for endemic freshwater arthropods. Using the MethylRAD method, this study investigates whether exposure to pesticide contamination in natural populations of the endemic mayfly A. torrens produces genome wide changes in levels of DNA methylation. From a total of 1,377,147 MethylRAD markers produced from 285 specimens collected at 30 different study sites along the Limarí watershed of north-central Chile, six showed significant differential methylation between populations exposed and unexposed to pesticides. In all cases the effect of pesticides was positive, independent and stronger than the effects detected for other spatial and environmental factors. Only one candidate marker appeared correlated significantly with additional variables, nitrate and calcium levels, which also reflects the impact of agrichemicals and could additionally suggest, to a lower extent, antagonistic effects of mineral salts concentration for this specific marker. These results suggest that the effect of pesticide exposure on methylation levels is apparent at these six MethylRAD markers in A. torrens populations. Such data is challenging to obtain in natural populations and is, for the most part, lacking in ecotoxicological studies. Our study shows that DNA methylation processes are involved in the response to pesticide contamination in populations of the mayfly A. torrens in their natural habitat, and provides new evidence regarding the impact of pesticide contamination and agricultural activities on the endemic fauna of lotic ecosystems.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Food group definition was harmonized across the three cohorts. DNA methylation was measured using Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip in KORA and Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip in the Leiden study and the TwinsUK study.

Different gene families have role in the regulation of the RdDM pathway and there is a lack of information about these gene families in the grapes (Vitis viniferaL.). Here, we mentioned the genome-wide identification, bioinformatics analysis, evolutionary history, and expression profiling ofVvRdDMpathway genes against various stresses, hormonal treatments as well as in different organs. SixtyVvRdDMgenes belonging to fourteen different families were identified. All the genes were unevenly distributed and chromosome 4 contained the highest number of genes (7). Most of the genes showed similar exon-intron and motif distribution patterns within the same subfamilies. Out of 14 families, only members of 4 families underwent duplication events during the evolutionary process and 50% of members of the AGO family are the result of duplication events. Based on Ka/Ks ratio all duplicated gene pairs have a negative mode of selection.VvRdDMpathway genes showed differential spatiotemporal expression patterns against different hormone and stress treatments. Further, with multiple transcriptome analysis, someVvRdDMgenes showed a broad spectrum of high expression in different organs at various stages, andVvRdDMgenes also displayed different expression in seeded and seedless cultivars during different phases of seed development. This proposed thatVvRdDMgenes may play multiple roles in grape growth and development, especially in seed development. qRT-PCR analysis of selected genes further verified the critical roles of RdDM genes in multiple biological processes, especially in seed development/ovule abortion i.e.,VvIDN2a,VvDRD1a,VvRDR1a, andVvRDR6. Our study provides detailed information aboutVvRdDMgenes in perspective of gene structure and evolution, as well as expression pattern against different stress, hormones and in different plants parts.

DNA methylation microenvironment of Munro's microabscess and the crosstalk with transcription and its effect on neutrophils have not yet been revealed.Performed genome-wide DNA methylation analysis and further differential methylation analysis of psoriatic skin lesions with and without Munro's microabscess from two batch samples consisting of 114 former samples in the discovery stage and 21 newly-collected samples in the validation stage. Utilized GO, MEME, and other tools to conduct downstream analysis on differentially methylated sites (DMSs). Correlation analysis of methylation level and transcriptome data was also conducted.We observed 647 overlapping DMSs associated with Munro's microabscess. Subsequently, GO pathway analysis revealed that DNA methylation might affect the physical properties associated with skin cells through focal adhesion and cellsubstrate junction and was likely to recruit neutrophils in the epidermis. Via the MEME tool, used to investigate the possible binding transcription factors (TFs) of 20 motifs around the 647 DMSs, it was found that DNA methylation regulated the binding of AP1 family members and the recruitment of neutrophils in the epidermis through the TGF-beta pathway and the TH17 pathway. Meanwhile, combined with our earlier transcriptome data, we found DNA methylation would regulate the expressions of CFDP, SIRT6, SMG6, TRAPPC9, HSD17B7, and KIAA0415, indicating these genes would potentially promote the process of Munro's microabscess.In conclusion, DNA methylation may affect the course of psoriasis by regulating the progression of Munro's microabscess in psoriatic skin lesions.Copyright © 2022 Xu, Zhang, Pan, Zhang, Liu, Tang, Zhang, Zhou and Cheng."

Recent studies have identified millions of MNVs in human populations, but their functions remain largely unknown. Numerous studies have demonstrated that single-nucleotide variants could serve as quantitative trait loci (QTLs) by affecting molecular phenotypes. Therefore, we propose that MNVs can also affect molecular phenotypes by influencing regulatory elements. Using the genotype data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we first identified 223 759 unique MNVs in 33 cancer types. Then, to decipher the functions of these MNVs, we investigated the associations between MNVs and six molecular phenotypes, including coding gene expression, miRNA expression, lncRNA expression, alternative splicing, DNA methylation and alternative polyadenylation. As a result, we identified 1 397 821cis-MNVQTLs and 402 381trans-MNVQTLs. We further performed survival analysis and identified 46 173 MNVQTLs associated with patient overall survival. We also linked the MNVQTLs to genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data and identified 119 762 MNVQTLs that overlap with existing GWAS loci.

Previous epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) for externalizing behaviours have been limited in sample size, and, therefore, candidate genes and biomarkers with robust evidence are still lacking. We 1) performed a systematic literature review of EWAS of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)- and aggression-related behaviours conducted in peripheral tissue and cord blood and 2) combined the most strongly associated DNAm sites observed in individual studies (p < 10-3) to identify candidate genes and biological systems for ADHD and aggressive behaviours. We observed enrichment for neuronal processes and neuronal cell marker genes for ADHD. Astrocyte and granulocytes cell markers among genes annotated to DNAm sites were relevant for both ADHD and aggression-related behaviours. Only 1 % of the most significant epigenetic findings for ADHD/ADHD symptoms were likely to be directly explained by genetic factors involved in ADHD. Finally, we discuss how the field would greatly benefit from larger sample sizes and harmonization of assessment instruments.Copyright © 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd..

Here we describe a nanopore-sequencing-based-method, nanoHiMe-seq, for interrogating the genome-wide localization of histone modifications and DNA methylation from single DNA molecules. nanoHiMe-seq leverages a nonspecific methyltransferase to exogenously label adenine bases proximal to antibody-targeted modified nucleosomes in situ. The labelled adenines and the endogenous methylated CpG sites are simultaneously detected on individual nanopore reads using a hidden Markov model, which is implemented in the nanoHiMe software package. We demonstrate the utility, robustness and sensitivity of nanoHiMe-seq by jointly profiling DNA methylation and histone modifications at low coverage depths, concurrently determining phased patterns of DNA methylation and histone modifications, and probing the intrinsic connectivity between these epigenetic marks across the genome.© 2022.

Due to the paucity of data on the molecular profiling of meningiomas and their clinical implications, no effective therapies and new treatments have been implemented.DNA methylation profiling, copy number analysis, targeted sequencing and H3K27me3 expression was performed on 35 meningiomas and 5 controls.Unsupervised hierarchical clustering (UHC) analysis revealed four distinct molecular subgroups: Malignant; Intermediate; Benign A, and Benign B. Molecular heterogeneity was observed within the same grade as the Intermediate, Benign A, and Benign B subgroups were composed of WHO grade 1 as well as grade 2 cases. There was association of mutations with distinct methylation subgroups (NF2, AKT1, SMO, TRAF7 and pTERT). Loss of chromosome 22q was observed across all subgroups. 1p/14q co-deletion was seen in 50% of malignant and intermediate while CDKN2A loss was predominantly observed in malignant subgroup (50%). Majority of malignant (75%) and a small proportion of other subgroups (Intermediate: 25%, Benign A: 38.5%, and Benign B: 20%) harboured H3K27me3 loss. 38,734 genes were dysregulated amongst the four subgroups. DKFZ classified 71% cases with acceptable score. On survival analysis, methylation profiling had significant impact on progression-free-survival in WHO grade1 and 2 meningiomas (p = 0.0051).Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling highlights clinically distinct molecular subgroups and heterogeneity within the same grade of meningiomas.

Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) has become the standard treatment for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). However, there are few reliable epigenetic parameters for patients with ESCC undergoing neoadjuvant therapy. Genomic extract from tumor tissue was amplified and sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq4000 to quantify genes associated methylation or hydromethylation in 12 patients with ESCC undergoing nCRT. The genome-wide hydroxymethylation were analyzed by methylated and hydroxymethylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing by MACS2 software and UCSC RefSeq database. Abnormal DNA methylation was statistically different between nCRT-well (showed a pathological complete response to nCRT) and nCRT-poor (showed incomplete pathological response to nCRT) patients. Levels of ten-eleven translocation 1, 2 and 3 mRNA and protein were higher in tumor tissue in nCRT-well group patients than in nCRT-poor group patients. Illumina HiSeq 4000 sequencing identified 2925 hypo-differentially hydroxymethylated region (DhMRs) and 292 hyper-DhMRs in promoter between nCRT-well and nCRT-poor patients. Biological processes associated with hyper-DhMRs included 'snRNA processing', 'hormone-mediated signaling pathway' and 'cellular response'. Metabolic processes were associated with hypo-DhMRs. These data may explain the functional response to nCRT in patients with abnormal promoter of methylation gene-associated mRNA expression. The present results implied that hyper-DhMRs and hypo-DhMRs affect molecular pathways, such as hippo and Notch signaling pathways, highlighting epigenetic modifications associated with clinical response to nCRT in patients with esophageal cancer.Copyright: © Zhang et al."

However, knowledge of the m6A modification in litchi remains limited. In this study, a complete analysis of m6A writers, erasers, and readers in litchi was performed and 31 litchi m6A regulatory genes were identified in total, including 7 m6A writers, 12 m6A erases, and 12 readers. Phylogeny analysis showed that all three of the kinds of litchi m6A regulatory proteins could be divided into three groups; domains and motifs exhibited similar patterns in the same group. MiRNA target site prediction showed that 77 miRNA target sites were located in 25 (80.6%) litchi m6A regulatory genes. Cis-elements analysis exhibited that litchi m6A regulatory genes were mainly responsive to light and plant hormones, followed by environmental stress and plant development. Expression analysis revealed litchi m6A regulatory genes might play an important role during the peel coloration and fruit abscission of litchi. This study provided valuable and expectable information of litchi m6A regulatory genes and their potential epigenetic regulation mechanism in litchi."
"36552808","A Targeted Epigenetic Clock for the Prediction of Biological Age.","Cells","Epigenetic clocks were initially developed to track chronological age, but accumulating evidence indicates that they can also predict biological age. They are usually based on the analysis of DNA methylation by genome-wide methods, but targeted approaches, based on the assessment of a small number of CpG sites, are advisable in several settings. In this study, we developed a targeted epigenetic clock purposely optimized for the measurement of biological age. The clock includes six genomic regions mapping inELOVL2,NHLRC1,AIM2,EDARADD,SIRT7andTFAP2Egenes, selected from a re-analysis of existing microarray data, whose DNA methylation is measured by EpiTYPER assay. In healthy subjects (n = 278), epigenetic age calculated using the targeted clock was highly correlated with chronological age (Spearman correlation = 0.89). Most importantly, and in agreement with previous results from genome-wide clocks, epigenetic age was significantly higher and lower than expected in models of increased (persons with Down syndrome, n = 62) and decreased (centenarians, n = 106; centenarians' offspring, n = 143; nutritional intervention in elderly, n = 233) biological age, respectively. These results support the potential of our targeted epigenetic clock as a new marker of biological age and open its evaluation in large cohorts to further promote the assessment of biological age in healthcare practice."

To assess the effect of paternal DNA on sexual dimorphism of embryonic genome activation, we compared X and Y sperm and different sexes of embryos before sex determination. Through transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) and whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) of X and Y sperm, we found a big proportion of upregulated genes in Y sperm, supported by the observation that genome-wide DNA methylation level is slightly lower than in X sperm. Cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, TGF-beta, and toll-like receptor pathways play important roles in spermatogenesis. Through whole-genome re-sequencing (WGRS) of parental fish and RNA-seq of five early embryonic stages, we found the low-blastocyst time point is a key to maternal transcriptome degradation and zygotic genome activation. Generally, sexual differences emerged from the bud stage. Moreover, through integrated analysis of paternal SNPs and gene expression, we evaluated the influence of paternal inheritance on sexual dimorphism of genome activation. Besides, we screened outgata6andddx5as potential instructors for early sex determination and gonad development in yellow catfish. This work is meaningful for revealing the molecular mechanisms of sex determination and sexual dimorphism of fish species."
"36551712","Correlation between DNA Methylation and Cell Proliferation Identifies New Candidate Predictive Markers in Meningioma.","Cancers (Basel)","Meningiomas are the most common primary tumors of the central nervous system. Based on the 2021 WHO classification, they are classified into three grades reflecting recurrence risk and aggressiveness. However, the WHO's histopathological criteria defining these grades are somewhat subjective. Together with reliable immunohistochemical proliferation indices, other molecular markers such as those studied with genome-wide epigenetics promise to revamp the current prognostic classification. In this study, 48 meningiomas of various grades were randomly included and explored for DNA methylation with the Infinium MethylationEPIC microarray over 850k CpG sites. We conducted differential and correlative analyses on grade and several proliferation indices and markers, such as mitotic index and Ki-67 or MCM6 immunohistochemistry. We also set up Cox proportional hazard models for extensive associations between CpG methylation and survival. We identified loci highly correlated with cell growth and a targeted methylation signature of regulatory regions persistently associated with proliferation, grade, and survival. Candidate genes under the control of these regions includeSMC4,ESRRG,PAX6,DOK7,VAV2,OTX1, andPCDHA-PCDHB-PCDHG, i.e., the protocadherin gene clusters. This study highlights the crucial role played by epigenetic mechanisms in shaping dysregulated cellular proliferation and provides potential biomarkers bearing prognostic and therapeutic value for the clinical management of meningioma."
"36570792","Maternal SARS-CoV-2 exposure alters infant DNA methylation.","Brain Behav Immun Health","Infection during pregnancy can increase the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders in offspring. The impact of maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection on infant neurodevelopment is poorly understood. The maternal immune response to infection may be mimicked in rodent models of maternal immune activation which recapitulate altered neurodevelopment and behavioural disturbances in the offspring. In these models, epigenetic mechanisms, in particular DNA methylation, are one pathway through which this risk is conferredin uteroto offspring. We hypothesised thatin uteroexposure to SARS-CoV-2 in humans may alter infant DNA methylation, particularly in genes associated with neurodevelopment. We aimed to test this hypothesis in a pilot sample of children in Victoria, Australia, who were exposedin uteroto SARS-CoV-2.DNA was extracted from buccal swab specimens from (n = 4) SARS-CoV-2in uteroexposed and (n = 4) non-exposed infants and methylation status assessed across 850,000 methylation sites using an Illumina EPIC BeadChip. We also conducted an exploratory enrichment analysis using Gene Ontology annotations.1962 hypermethylated CpG sites were identified with an unadjusted p-value of 0.05, where 1133 CpGs mapped to 959 unique protein coding genes, and 716 hypomethylated CpG sites mapped to 559 unique protein coding genes in SARS-CoV-2 exposed infants compared to non-exposed. One differentially methylated position (cg06758191), located in the gene body of AFAP1 that was hypomethylated in the SARS-CoV-2 exposed cohort was significant after correction for multiple testing (FDR-adjusted p-value <0.00083). Two significant differentially methylated regions were identified; a hypomethylated intergenic region located in chromosome 6p proximal to the genes ZP57 and HLA-F (fwer <0.004), and a hypomethylated region in the promoter and body of the gene GAREM2 (fwer <0.036). Gene network enrichment analysis revealed differential methylation in genes corresponding to pathways relevant to neurodevelopment, including the ERBB pathway.These pilot data suggest that exposure to SARS-CoV-2in uterodifferentially alters methylation of genes in pathways that play a role in human neurodevelopment.© 2022 Published by Elsevier Inc."
"36552094","Effects of Genetics and Sex on Acute Gene Expression Changes in the Hippocampus Following Neonatal Ethanol Exposure in BXD Recombinant Inbred Mouse Strains.","Brain Sci","Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are prevalent neurodevelopmental disorders. Genetics have been shown to have a role in the severity of alcohol's teratogenic effects on the developing brain. We previously identified recombinant inbred BXD mouse strains that show high (HCD) or low cell death (LCD) in the hippocampus following ethanol exposure. The present study aimed to identify gene networks that influence this susceptibility. On postnatal day 7 (3rd-trimester-equivalent), male and female neonates were treated with ethanol (5.0 g/kg) or saline, and hippocampi were collected 7hrs later. Using the Affymetrix microarray platform, ethanol-induced gene expression changes were identified in all strains with divergent expression sets found between sexes. Genes, such asBcl2l11,Jun, andTgfb3, showed significant strain-by-treatment interactions and were involved in many apoptosis pathways. Comparison of HCD versus LCD showed twice as many ethanol-induced genes changes in the HCD. Interestingly, these changes were regulated in the same direction suggesting (1) more perturbed effects in HCD compared to LCD and (2) limited gene expression changes that confer resistance to ethanol-induced cell death in LCD. These results demonstrate that genetic background and sex are important factors that affect differential cell death pathways after alcohol exposure during development that could have long-term consequences."

Social mobility has been proposed to ameliorate health inequalities. This study aimed to understand the association of social mobility with positive AA. Diagonal reference modelling and ordinary least square regression techniques were applied to explore social mobility and four measures of age acceleration (first-generation: 'Horvath', 'Hannum' and second-generation: 'Phenoage', DunedinPoAm) in n = 3140 participants of the UK Household Longitudinal Study. Disadvantaged SEP in early life is associated with positive AA for three (Hannum, Phenoage and DunedinPoAm) of the four measures examined while the second generation biomarkers are associated with SEP in adulthood (p < 0.01). Social mobility was associated with AA measured with Hannum only such that compared to no mobility, upward mobility was associated with greater age independently of origin and destination SEP. Compared to continuously advantaged groups, downward mobility was associated with positive Phenoage (1.06y [- 0.03, 2.14]) and DunedinPoAm assessed AA (0.96y [0.24, 1.68]). For these two measures, upward mobility was associated with negative AA (Phenoage, - 0.65y [- 1.30, - 0.002]; DunedinPoAm, - 0.96y [- 1.47, - 0.46]) compared to continually disadvantaged groups. While we find some support for three models of lifecourse epidemiology with early life as a sensitive period, SEP across the lifecourse and social mobility for age acceleration measured with DNA methylation, our findings suggest that disadvantaged SEP across the lifecourse is most consistently associated with positive AA.© 2022.

"36551655","Single-Cell DNA Methylation Analysis in Cancer.","Cancers (Basel)","Morphological, transcriptomic, and genomic defects are well-explored parameters of cancer biology. In more recent years, the impact of epigenetic influences, such as DNA methylation, is becoming more appreciated. Aberrant DNA methylation has been implicated in many types of cancers, influencing cell type, state, transcriptional regulation, and genomic stability to name a few. Traditionally, large populations of cells from the tissue of interest are coalesced for analysis, producing averaged methylome data. Considering the inherent heterogeneity of cancer, analysing populations of cells as a whole denies the ability to discover novel aberrant methylation patterns, identify subpopulations, and trace cell lineages. Due to recent advancements in technology, it is now possible to obtain methylome data from single cells. This has both research and clinical implications, ranging from the identification of biomarkers to improved diagnostic tools. As with all emerging technologies, distinct experimental, bioinformatic, and practical challenges present themselves. This review begins with exploring the potential impact of single-cell sequencing on understanding cancer biology and how it could eventually benefit a clinical setting. Following this, the techniques and experimental approaches which made this technology possible are explored. Finally, the present challenges currently associated with single-cell DNA methylation sequencing are described."

OFCs affect different structures and functions with social, psychological and economic implications in children and their families. Identifying modifiable risk factors is mandatory to prevent the occurrence of non-syndromic OFCs (NSOFCs). PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus and Web of Science were searched from 1 January 2012 to 25 May 2022 and a total of 7668 publications were identified. Studies focusing on the risk factors of NSOFCs were selected, leading to 62 case-control and randomized clinical trials. Risk factors were categorized into non-modifiable and modifiable. The first group includes genetic polymorphisms, gender of the newborn, ethnicity, and familiarity. Within the second group, risk factors that can only be modified before conception (consanguinity, parental age at conception, socio-economical and educational level, area of residency and climate), and risk factors modifiable before and after conception (weight, nutritional state, acute and chronic diseases, psychophysical stress, licit and illicit drugs, alcohol, smoke, pollutants and contaminants) have been distinguished. This study provides a wide overview of the risk factors of NSOFCs, focusing on modifiable ones, to suggest new perspectives in education, prevention, medical interventions and clinical research."

Although the biological mechanisms influencing this process remain unknown, altered DNA methylation is considered to be one potential mechanism. We investigated associations between maternal prenatal psychological distress, infant salivary DNA methylation, and stress physiology at 12 months. Mother's distress was measured via depression and anxiety in early and late pregnancy in a cohort of 80 pregnant adolescents. Maternal hair cortisol was collected during pregnancy. Saliva samples were collected from infants at 12 months to quantify DNA methylation of three stress-related genes (FKBP5, NR3C1, OXTR) (n = 62) and diurnal cortisol (n = 29). Multivariable linear regression was used to test for associations between prenatal psychological distress, and infant DNA methylation and cortisol. Hair cortisol concentrations in late pregnancy were negatively associated with two sites of FKBP5 (site 1: B = -22.33, p = .003; site 2: B = -15.60, p = .012). Infants of mothers with elevated anxiety symptoms in late pregnancy had lower levels of OXTR2 CpG2 methylation (B = -2.17, p = .03) and higher evening salivary cortisol (B = 0.41, p = .03). Furthermore, OXTR2 methylation was inversely associated with evening cortisol (B = -0.14, p-value ≤ .001). Our results are, to our knowledge, the first evidence that the methylation of the oxytocin receptor may contribute to the regulation of HPAA during infancy.© 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC."

In this brief report, cardiac mesenchymal stem cell-like cells (CMSCLC) from the right atria of a 21-year-old female patient with a bicuspid aortic valve and aortic stenosis (referred to as biscuspid aortic valve disease BAVD-CMSCLC), were compared with those of a 78-year-old female patient undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery (referred to as coronary artery disease CAD-CMSCLC). Cells were analyzed for expression of MSC markers, ability to form CFU-Fs, metabolic activity, cell cycle kinetics, expression of NANOG and p16, and telomere length. The cardiac-derived cells expressed MSC markers and were able to form CFU-Fs, with higher rate of formation in CAD-CMSCLCs. BAVD-CMSCLCs did not display normal MSC morphology, had a much lower cell doubling rate, and were less metabolically active than CAD-CMSCLCs. Cell cycle analysis revealed a population of BAVD-CMSCLC in G2/M phase, whereas the bulk of CAD-CMSCLC were in the G0/G1 phase. BAVD-CMSCLC had lower expression of NANOG and shorter telomere lengths, but higher expression of p16 compared with the CAD-CMSCLC. In conclusion, BAVD-CMSCLC have a prematurely aged phenotype compared with CAD-CMSCLC, despite originating from a younger patient."

Population genetics studies showed that such exposures lead to adaptive genetic changes; while observing present exposures to different toxicants, the first molecular mechanism that confers plasticity is epigenetic remodeling and, in particular, DNA methylation variation, a molecular mechanism proposed for medium-term adaptation. A large amount of scientific literature from clinical and medical studies revealed the high impact of such exposure on human biology; thus, in this review, we examine and infer the impact that different environmental toxicants may have in shaping human evolution. We first describe how environmental toxicants shape natural human variation in terms of genetic and epigenetic diversity, and then we describe how DNA methylation may influence mutation rate and, thus, genetic variability. We describe the impact of these substances on biological fitness in terms of reproduction and survival, and in conclusion, we focus on their effect on brain evolution and physiology."
"36575526","Circulating cell-free DNA methylation mirrors alterations in cerebral patterns in epilepsy.","Clin Epigenetics","DNA methylation profiling of circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) has rapidly become a promising strategy for biomarker identification and development. The cell-type-specific nature of DNA methylation patterns and the direct relationship between cfDNA and apoptosis can potentially be used non-invasively to predict local alterations. In addition, direct detection of altered DNA methylation patterns performs well as a biomarker. In a previous study, we demonstrated marked DNA methylation alterations in brain tissue from patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis (MTLE-HS).We performed DNA methylation profiling in cfDNA isolated from the serum of MTLE patients and healthy controls using BeadChip arrays followed by systematic bioinformatic analysis including deconvolution analysis and integration with DNase accessibility data sets. Differential cfDNA methylation analysis showed an overrepresentation of gene ontology terms and transcription factors related to central nervous system function and regulation. Deconvolution analysis of the DNA methylation data sets ruled out the possibility that the observed differences were due to changes in the proportional contribution of cortical neurons in cfDNA. Moreover, we found no overrepresentation of neuron- or glia-specific patterns in the described cfDNA methylation patterns. However, the MTLE-HS cfDNA methylation patterns featured a significant overrepresentation of the epileptic DNA methylation alterations previously observed in the hippocampus.Our results support the use of cfDNA methylation profiling as a rational approach to seeking non-invasive and reproducible epilepsy biomarkers.© 2022.

Among the molecular potential mechanisms underlying this relationship, DNA methylation has been studied, but a direct link between high GI and/or GL of diet and global DNA methylation levels has not been proved yet. We analyzed the associations between GI and GL and global DNA methylation patterns within an Italian population.Genomic DNA methylation (5mC) and hydroxymethylation (5hmC) levels were measured in 1080 buffy coat samples from participants of the Moli-sani study (mean(SD) = 54.9(11.5) years; 52% women) via ELISA. A 188-item Food Frequency Questionnaire was used to assess food intake and dietary GI and GL for each participant were calculated. Multiple linear regressions were used to investigate the associations between dietary GI and GL and global 5mC and 5hmC levels, as well as the proportion of effect explained by metabolic and inflammatory markers. We found negative associations of GI with both 5mC (β (SE) = - 0.073 (0.027), p = 0.007) and 5hmC (- 0.084 (0.030), p = 0.006), and of GL with 5mC (- 0.14 (0.060), p = 0.014). Circulating biomarkers did not explain the above-mentioned associations. Gender interaction analyses revealed a significant association of the gender-x-GL interaction with 5mC levels, with men showing an inverse association three times as negative as in women (interaction β (SE) = - 0.16 (0.06), p = 0.005).Our findings suggest that global DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation patterns represent a biomarker of carbohydrate intake. Based on the differential association of GL with 5mC between men and women, further gender-based separate approaches are warranted.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"36585655","Association of Phenotypic Aging Marker with comorbidities, frailty and inflammatory markers in people living with HIV.","BMC Geriatr","Aging characteristics in people living with HIV (PLWH) are heterogeneous, and the identification of risk factors associated with aging-related comorbidities such as neurocognitive impairment (NCI) and frailty is important. We evaluated predictors of novel aging markers, phenotypic age (PhenoAge) and phenotypic age acceleration (PAA) and their association with comorbidities, frailty, and NCI.In a cohort of PLWH and age- and sex-matched HIV-negative controls, we calculated PhenoAge using chronological age and 9 biomarkers from complete blood counts, inflammatory, metabolic-, liver- and kidney-related parameters. PAA was calculated as the difference between chronological age and PhenoAge. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to identify the factors associated with higher (>median) PAA. Area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) was used to assess model discrimination for frailty.Among 333 PLWH and 102 HIV-negative controls (38% female), the median phenotypic age (49.4 vs. 48.5 years, p = 0.54) and PAA (- 6.7 vs. -7.5, p = 0.24) was slightly higher and PAA slightly less in PLWH although this did not reach statistical significance. In multivariate analysis, male sex (adjusted odds ratio = 1.68 [95%CI = 1.03-2.73]), current smoking (2.74 [1.30-5.79]), diabetes mellitus (2.97 [1.48-5.99]), hypertension (1.67 [1.02-2.72]), frailty (3.82 [1.33-10.93]), and higher IL-6 levels (1.09 [1.04-1.15]), but not HIV status and NCI, were independently associated with higher PAA. PhenoAge marker discriminated frailty better than chronological age alone (AUROC: 0.75 [0.66-0.85] vs. 0.65 [0.55-0.77], p = 0.04). In the analysis restricted to PLWH, PhenoAge alone predicted frailty better than chronological age alone (AUROC: 0.7412 vs. 0.6499, P = 0.09) and VACS index (AUROC: 0.7412 vs. 0.6811, P = 0.34) despite not statistically significant.While PLWH did not appear to have accelerated aging in our cohort, the phenotypic aging marker was significantly associated with systemic inflammation, frailty, and cardiovascular disease risk factors. This simple aging marker could be useful to identify high-risk PLWH within a similar chronological age group.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"36582365","Accelerated ageing is associated with increased COVID-19 severity and differences across ethnic groups may exist.","Front Public Health","While increased age is an established risk factor for COVID-19, there is great heterogeneity in outcomes within age groups. This is because chronological age does not reflect health, unlike biological age. We intend to investigate the association between accelerated ageing and COVID-19 outcomes through the lens of three measures, namely phenotypic age acceleration (PhenoAgeAccel), telomere length (Adjusted T/S Ratio) and facial ageing, and to examine whether there are differences across ethnic groups.Taking participants from the UK Biobank, we associated accelerated ageing with severe COVID-19 outcomes, defined as COVID-related hospitalisation or death. Separate logistic regressions models were created for age and the three accelerated ageing-related variables, adjusting for a variety of covariates in each model. Multivariable logistic regression models were also created within White, Black, Asian and Other ethnic groups to assess for potential differing associations. Forward likelihood ratio logistic regression models were created to evaluate importance of the variables and to assess for patterns of association across the total population and ethnic groups.After adjusting for all covariates, the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of COVID-19 severe outcomes for age was 1.080 (1.074-1.086). After further adjusting age for the accelerated ageing variables, the ORs were 1.029 (1.020-1.039) for PhenoAgeAccel and 0.847 (0.772-0.929) for Facial Ageing's ""Younger Than You Are"" while Adjusted T/S ratio and ""Older Than You Are"" were statistically insignificant. The OR for age remained similar across ethnic groups. Both PhenoAgeAccel and younger facial ages in the White population and PhenoAgeAccel in the Black population had ORs of 1.031 (1.021-1.042), 0.853 (0.774-0.939), and 1.049 (1.001-1.100), respectively. Both Adjusted T/S Ratio and older facial ages showed statistical insignificance in all ethnicities. In forward logistic regression, age and PhenoAgeAccel were the age-related variables selected most frequently in all models.Accelerated ageing is associated with increased COVID-19 severity. The mechanisms at work here are likely immunosenescence and inflamaging. This association indicates that anti-ageing treatment may improve COVID-19 outcome. The results within ethnic groups and that of telomere length were inconclusive, but point to a need for future, more focused research on the topic.Copyright © 2022 Reeves, Kooner and Zhang."

There are some symptomatic treatments to manage the psychological symptoms but none of these drugs can halt disease progression. Additionally, over the last few years, many anti-AD drugs failed in late stages of clinical trials and many hypotheses surfaced to explain these failures, including the lack of clear understanding of disease pathways and processes. Recently, different epigenetic factors have been implicated in AD pathogenesis; thus, they could serve as promising AD diagnostic biomarkers. Additionally, network biology approaches have been suggested as effective tools to study AD on the systems level and discover multi-target-directed ligands as novel treatments for AD. Herein, we provide a comprehensive review on Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology to provide a better understanding of disease pathogenesis hypotheses and decipher the role of genetic and epigenetic factors in disease development and progression. We also provide an overview of disease biomarkers and drug targets and suggest network biology approaches as new tools for identifying novel biomarkers and drugs. We also posit that the application of machine learning and artificial intelligence to mining Alzheimer's disease multi-omics data will facilitate drug and biomarker discovery efforts and lead to effective individualized anti-Alzheimer treatments."

We hypothesized that plasma proteomics in women with breast cancer could identify new mechanisms of anthracycline cardiac toxicity. We measured changes in 1317 proteins in anthracycline-treated patients (n = 30) and replicated key findings in a second cohort (n = 31). An increase in the heme-binding protein hemopexin (Hpx) 3 months after anthracycline initiation was associated with cardiac toxicity by echocardiography. To assess the functional role of Hpx, we administered Hpx to wild-type (WT) mice treated with Dox and observed improved cardiac function. Conversely,Hpx-/-mice demonstrated increased Dox cardiac toxicity compared to WT mice. Initial mechanistic studies indicate that Hpx is likely transported to the heart by circulating monocytes/macrophages and that Hpx may mitigate Dox-induced ferroptosis to confer cardioprotection. Together, these observations suggest that Hpx induction represents a compensatory response during Dox treatment."

We assessed the association of several blood test measurements, soluble urokinase receptor (uPAR) serum level and specific single nucleotide polymorphisms ofACE(I/D),NOS3(rs2070744, rs1799983),SERPINE1(rs1799768),PLAU(rs2227564) andPLAUR(rs344781, rs2302524) genes, with the disease severity classified by the percentage of lung involvement on computerized tomography scans. Our findings reveal that the T/C genotype ofPLAURrs2302524 was independently associated with a less severe lung damage (odds ratio 0.258 [0.071-0.811]). Along with high C-reactive protein, fibrinogen and soluble uPAR serum levels turned out to be independently associated with more severe lung damage in COVID-19 patients. The identified factors may be further employed as predictors of a possibly severe COVID-19 clinical course."
"36555942","Management of Adult Patients with Gastrointestinal Symptoms from Food Hypersensitivity-Narrative Review.","J Clin Med","The incidence of food hypersensitivity has increased dramatically over the years not only among children but also in adults. Adult patients are usually less suspected of food hypersensitivity symptoms since food allergies are more typical for small children, with a tendency to outgrow the condition. The aim of this article is to increase awareness of hypersensitivity to food symptoms and their diagnosis and treatment possibilities among gastroenterologists and other health care professionals dealing with this type of patient. Symptoms of many gastrointestinal disorders, especially functional, may be driven by different types of mechanisms, and food intolerance or allergy should be considered as a potential cause. This article presents the current understanding of the epidemiology, diagnosis and treatment of immune- and non-immune-mediated food-induced diseases. Diagnosis of food hypersensitivity is based mainly on medical history, different types of sensitivity tests, e.g., hydrogen breath test, specific IgE (sIgE) serum concentration, tissue eosinophil count, skin tests and oral food challenges considered as a ""gold standard"" for food allergy. Elimination diet and pharmacologic treatment for allergy symptoms are first-line therapies. Eosinophilic gastrointestinal diseases are often caused by non-IgE-mediated food allergies, require endoscopic biopsy samples to confirm diagnosis and proper elimination diet often combined with steroids or proton pump inhibitor agents for treatment. Mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) derives from pathologic reaction of mast cells with increased tryptase serum level as a marker. Symptoms may occur in the digestive, respiratory, skin, neurologic and cardiovascular system. Treatment is based on histamine type 1, type 2 (H1, H2) receptor antagonists and other mast cell stabilizing agents. Carbohydrate intolerances are the most common type of food hypersensitivity in adult patients, and an elimination diet is effective for reducing symptoms. Food additives hypersensitivity remains difficult to diagnose, but use of a diet low in chemical substances alleviates symptoms and helps to diagnose the triggering factors."
"36580462","Investigating the potential impact of PCSK9-inhibitors on mood disorders using eQTL-based Mendelian randomization.","PLoS One","Prescription of PCSK9-inhibitors has increased in recent years but not much is known about its off-target effects. PCSK9-expression is evident in non-hepatic tissues, notably the brain, and genetic variation in the PCSK9 locus has recently been shown to be associated with mood disorder-related traits. We investigated whether PCSK9 inhibition, proxied by a genetic reduction in expression of PCSK9 mRNA, might have a causal adverse effect on mood disorder-related traits. We used genetic variants in the PCSK9 locus associated with reduced PCSK9 expression (eQTLs) in the European population from GTEx v8 and examined the effect on PCSK9 protein levels and three mood disorder-related traits (major depressive disorder, mood instability, and neuroticism), using summary statistics from the largest European ancestry genome-wide association studies. We conducted summary-based Mendelian randomization analyses to estimate the causal effects, and attempted replication using data from eQTLGen, Brain-eMETA, and the CAGE consortium. We found that genetically reduced PCSK9 gene-expression levels were significantly associated with reduced PCSK9 protein levels but not with increased risk of mood disorder-related traits. Further investigation of nearby genes demonstrated that reduced USP24 gene-expression levels was significantly associated with increased risk of mood instability (p-value range = 5.2x10-5-0.03), and neuroticism score (p-value range = 2.9x10-5-0.02), but not with PCSK9 protein levels. Our results suggest that genetic variation in this region acts on mood disorders through a PCSK9-independent pathway, and therefore PCSK9-inhibitors are unlikely to have an adverse impact on mood disorder-related traits.Copyright: © 2022 Aman et al.

"36582826","Genetic influences on human blood metabolites in the Japanese population.","iScience","An increase in ethnic diversity in genetic studies has the potential to provide unprecedented insights into how genetic variations influence human phenotypes. In this study, we conducted a quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis of 121 metabolites measured using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry with plasma samples from 4,888 Japanese individuals. We found 60 metabolite-gene associations, of which 13 have not been previously reported. Meta-analyses with another Japanese and a European study identified six and two additional unreported loci, respectively. Genetic variants influencing metabolite levels were more enriched in protein-coding regions than in the regulatory regions while being associated with the risk of various diseases. Finally, we identified a signature of strong negative selection for uric acid (Sˆ = -1.53, p = 6.2 × 10-18). Our study expanded the knowledge of genetic influences on human blood metabolites, providing valuable insights into their physiological, pathological, and selective properties.© 2022 The Author(s)."
"36584096","Sparse canonical correlation to identify breast cancer related genes regulated by copy number aberrations.","PLoS One","Copy number aberrations (CNAs) in cancer affect disease outcomes by regulating molecular phenotypes, such as gene expressions, that drive important biological processes. To gain comprehensive insights into molecular biomarkers for cancer, it is critical to identify key groups of CNAs, the associated gene modules, regulatory modules, and their downstream effect on outcomes.In this paper, we demonstrate an innovative use of sparse canonical correlation analysis (sCCA) to effectively identify the ensemble of CNAs, and gene modules in the context of binary and censored disease endpoints. Our approach detects potentially orthogonal gene expression modules which are highly correlated with sets of CNA and then identifies the genes within these modules that are associated with the outcome.Analyzing clinical and genomic data on 1,904 breast cancer patients from the METABRIC study, we found 14 gene modules to be regulated by groups of proximally located CNA sites. We validated this finding using an independent set of 1,077 breast invasive carcinoma samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Our analysis of 7 clinical endpoints identified several novel and interpretable regulatory associations, highlighting the role of CNAs in key biological pathways and processes for breast cancer. Genes significantly associated with the outcomes were enriched for early estrogen response pathway, DNA repair pathways as well as targets of transcription factors such as E2F4, MYC, and ETS1 that have recognized roles in tumor characteristics and survival. Subsequent meta-analysis across the endpoints further identified several genes through the aggregation of weaker associations.Our findings suggest that sCCA analysis can aggregate weaker associations to identify interpretable and important genes, modules, and clinically consequential pathways.Copyright: © 2022 Dutta et al.

"36574455","Leveraging pleiotropy to discover and interpret GWAS results for sleep-associated traits.","PLoS Genet","Genetic association studies of many heritable traits resulting from physiological testing often have modest sample sizes due to the cost and burden of the required phenotyping. This reduces statistical power and limits discovery of multiple genetic associations. We present a strategy to leverage pleiotropy between traits to both discover new loci and to provide mechanistic hypotheses of the underlying pathophysiology. Specifically, we combine a colocalization test with a locus-level test of pleiotropy. In simulations, we show that this approach is highly selective for identifying true pleiotropy driven by the same causative variant, thereby improves the chance to replicate the associations in underpowered validation cohorts and leads to higher interpretability. Here, as an exemplar, we use Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA), a common disorder diagnosed using overnight multi-channel physiological testing. We leverage pleiotropy with relevant cellular and cardio-metabolic phenotypes and gene expression traits to map new risk loci in an underpowered OSA GWAS. We identify several pleiotropic loci harboring suggestive associations to OSA and genome-wide significant associations to other traits, and show that their OSA association replicates in independent cohorts of diverse ancestries. By investigating pleiotropic loci, our strategy allows proposing new hypotheses about OSA pathobiology across many physiological layers. For example, we identify and replicate the pleiotropy across the plateletcrit, OSA and an eQTL of DNA primase subunit 1 (PRIM1) in immune cells. We find suggestive links between OSA, a measure of lung function (FEV1/FVC), and an eQTL of matrix metallopeptidase 15 (MMP15) in lung tissue. We also link a previously known genome-wide significant peak for OSA in the hexokinase 1 (HK1) locus to hematocrit and other red blood cell related traits. Thus, the analysis of pleiotropic associations has the potential to assemble diverse phenotypes into a chain of mechanistic hypotheses that provide insight into the pathogenesis of complex human diseases.Copyright: © 2022 Chun et al.

"36566278","Unravelling the genetics of non-random fertilization associated with gametic incompatibility.","Sci Rep","In the dairy industry, mate allocation is dependent on the producer's breeding goals and the parents' breeding values. The probability of pregnancy differs among sire-dam combinations, and the compatibility of a pair may vary due to the combination of gametic haplotypes. Under the hypothesis that incomplete incompatibility would reduce the odds of fertilization, and complete incompatibility would lead to a non-fertilizing or lethal combination, deviation from Mendelian inheritance expectations would be observed for incompatible pairs. By adding an interaction to a transmission ratio distortion (TRD) model, which detects departure from the Mendelian expectations, genomic regions linked to gametic incompatibility can be identified. This study aimed to determine the genetic background of gametic incompatibility in Holstein cattle. A total of 283,817 genotyped Holstein trios were used in a TRD analysis, resulting in 422 significant regions, which contained 2075 positional genes further investigated for network, overrepresentation, and guilt-by-association analyses. The identified biological pathways were associated with immunology and cellular communication and a total of 16 functional candidate genes were identified. Further investigation of gametic incompatibility will provide opportunities to improve mate allocation for the dairy cattle industry.© 2022. The Author(s)."

This method is an end-to-end deep learning method, consisting mainly of an embedding layer, bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM) layer, capsule network layer, and three fully connected layers. The presented method obtained an accuracy of 0.8820, being superior to the state-of-the-art methods. These empirical experiments showed that the inclusion of the capsule network promoted great performances and that the capsule network-based representation was superior to the property-based representation for distinguishing between TFs and non-TFs.

"36553125","Has COVID-19 Modified the Weight of Known Systemic Inflammation Indexes and the New Ones (MCVL and IIC) in the Assessment as Predictive Factors of Complications and Mortality in Acute Pancreatitis?","Diagnostics (Basel)","We aimed at evaluating the prognostic capacity of the inflammatory indices derived from routine complete blood cell counts in two groups of patients with acute pancreatitis from two different time periods, before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, when a high incidence of complications with surgical risk and mortality was found. Two new markers were introduced: the mean corpuscular volume to lymphocyte ratio (MCVL) and the cumulative inflammatory index (IIC), which were calculated at a baseline in the two groups of patients. Of the already established markers, none of them managed to effectively predict the complications with surgical risk and mortality, with a decrease of less than 50% in specificity in the peri-COVID group. The MCVL had the best prediction of complications with surgical risk in both the pre-COVID and peri-COVID groups, validated it as an independent factor by multivariate analysis. The IIC had the best prediction of mortality in both periods and was proven to be an independent factor by multivariate analysis. As the IIC predicted death best, we tested the occurrence of death and found that patients with PA who had an IIC &gt; 12.12 presented a risk of death 4.08 times higher in the pre-COVID group and 3.33 times higher in the peri-COVID group. The new MCVL and IIC independent markers had a superior sensitivity and specificity in predicting surgical risk complications and, respectively, mortality in the group of patients with acute pancreatitis during the COVID-19 pandemic, which makes them widely applicable in populations with modified immune and inflammatory status. Conclusions: In patients with acute pancreatitis, MCVL has a significant predictive value regarding complications with surgical risk (abscess, necrosis, and pseudocyst), and the IIC has a significant predictive value for mortality."

We included 132 viable tumor samples from 35 pediatric oncology centers in seven countries. DSP was conducted on multicellular fresh tumor tissue spheroid cultures in 384-well plates with an overall mean processing time of three weeks. In 89 cases (67%), sufficient viable tissue was received; 69 (78%) passed internal quality controls. The DSP results matched the identified molecular targets, including BRAF, ALK, MET, and TP53 status. Drug vulnerabilities were identified in 80% of cases lacking actionable (very) high-evidence molecular events, adding value to the molecular data. Striking parallels between clinical courses and the DSP results were observed in selected patients.

HNSCCs share common clinical risk factors and genomic features, including smoking, alcohol, age, male sex, aneuploidy, andTP53mutations. Viral initiating and contributing events are increasingly recognized in HNSCCs. While both Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) and human papilloma virus (HPV) are observed, EBV is more frequently associated with nasopharyngeal cancers whereas HPV is associated with oropharyngeal cancers. HNSCCs are associated with high tumor mutational burden and loss of tumor suppressor gene function, especially inTP53and X-linked genes. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that HNSCCs are subject to immunologic surveillance and immune-induced evolutionary pressure that correlate with negative clinical outcomes. This review will discuss genomic mechanisms related to immune-mediated pressures and propose prognostic and therapeutic implications of detectable immune escape mechanisms that drive tumorigenesis and disease progression."

DNA methylation has essential roles in multiple diseases, but its association with stroke was barely studied. We hereby explored the association between blood-based HTRA serine protease 1 (HTRA1) methylation and the risk of stroke.The association was discovered in a hospital-based case-control study (cases/controls = 190:190) and further validated in a prospective nested case-control study including 139 cases who developed stroke within 2 years after recruitment and 144 matched stroke-free controls. We observed stroke-related altered HTRA1 methylation and expression in both case-control study and prospective study. This blood-based HTRA1 methylation was associated with stroke independently from the known risk factors and mostly affected the older population. The prospective results further showed that the altered HTRA1 methylation was detectable 2 years before the clinical determination of stroke and became more robust with increased discriminatory power for stroke along with time when combined with other known stroke-related variables [onset time ≤ 1 year: area under the curve (AUC) = 0.76].In our study, altered HTRA1 methylation was associated with stroke at clinical and preclinical stages and thus may provide a potential biomarker in the blood for the risk evaluation and preclinical detection of stroke.© 2022.

Here, we searched for local adaptation signals, based on integrated haplotype scores and population branch statistics, in 325 Mexican Indigenous individuals with at least 99% Native American ancestry from five previously defined geographical regions. Although each region exhibited its own local adaptation profile, onlyPPARGandAJAP1, both negative regulators of the Wnt/β catenin signaling pathway, showed significant adaptation signals in all the tested regions. Several signals were found, mainly in the genes related to the metabolic processes and immune response. A pathway enrichment analysis revealed the overrepresentation of selected genes related to several biological phenotypes/conditions, such as the immune response and metabolic pathways, in agreement with previous studies, suggesting that immunological and metabolic pressures are major drivers of human adaptation. Genes related to the gut microbiome measurements were overrepresented in all the regions, highlighting the importance of studying how humans have coevolved with the microbial communities that colonize them. Our results provide a further explanation of the human evolutionary history in response to environmental pressures in this region."

Traditional genomic approaches have provided limited insight regarding disease onset and severity, but recent epigenomic studies indicate that DNA methylation patterns can be altered in CP. Here, we examined whether a diagnosis of spastic CP is associated with intrinsic DNA methylation differences in myoblasts and myotubes derived from muscle resident stem cell populations (satellite cells; SCs). Twelve subjects were enrolled (6 CP; 6 control) with informed consent/assent. Skeletal muscle biopsies were obtained during orthopedic surgeries, and SCs were isolated and cultured to establish patient-specific myoblast cell lines capable of proliferation and differentiation in culture. DNA methylation analyses indicated significant differences at 525 individual CpG sites in proliferating SC-derived myoblasts (MB) and 1774 CpG sites in differentiating SC-derived myotubes (MT). Of these, 79 CpG sites were common in both culture types. The distribution of differentially methylated 1 Mbp chromosomal segments indicated distinct regional hypo- and hyper-methylation patterns, and significant enrichment of differentially methylated sites on chromosomes 12, 13, 14, 15, 18, and 20. Average methylation load across 2000 bp regions flanking transcriptional start sites was significantly different in 3 genes in MBs, and 10 genes in MTs. SC derived MBs isolated from study participants with spastic CP exhibited fundamental differences in DNA methylation compared to controls at multiple levels of organization that may reveal new targets for studies of mechanisms contributing to muscle dysregulation in spastic CP."

However, the oncogenic transformation determined byHOTAIRin vivo and its impact on chromatin dynamics are incompletely understood. Here, we generate a transgenic mouse model with doxycycline-inducible expression of humanHOTAIRin the context of the MMTV-PyMT breast cancer-prone background to systematically interrogate the cellular mechanisms by which humanHOTAIRlncRNA acts to promote breast cancer progression. We show that sustained high levels ofHOTAIRover time increased breast metastatic capacity and invasiveness in breast cancer cells, promoting migration and subsequent metastasis to the lung. Subsequent withdrawal ofHOTAIRoverexpression reverted the metastatic phenotype, indicating oncogenic lncRNA addiction. Furthermore,HOTAIRoverexpression altered both the cellular transcriptome and chromatin accessibility landscape of multiple metastasis-associated genes and promoted EMT. These alterations are abrogated within several cell cycles afterHOTAIRexpression is reverted to basal levels, indicating an erasable lncRNA-associated epigenetic memory. These results suggest that a continual role forHOTAIRin programming a metastatic gene regulatory program.

"36551003","Epigenetics and Gut Microbiota Crosstalk: A potential Factor in Pathogenesis of Cardiovascular Disorders.","Bioengineering (Basel)","Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading cause of mortality, morbidity, and ""sudden death"" globally. Environmental and lifestyle factors play important roles in CVD susceptibility, but the link between environmental factors and genetics is not fully established. Epigenetic influence during CVDs is becoming more evident as its direct involvement has been reported. The discovery of epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation and histone modification, suggested that external factors could alter gene expression to modulate human health. These external factors also influence our gut microbiota (GM), which participates in multiple metabolic processes in our body. Evidence suggests a high association of GM with CVDs. Although the exact mechanism remains unclear, the influence of GM over the epigenetic mechanisms could be one potential pathway in CVD etiology. Both epigenetics and GM are dynamic processes and vary with age and environment. Changes in the composition of GM have been found to underlie the pathogenesis of metabolic diseases via modulating epigenetic changes in the form of DNA methylation, histone modifications, and regulation of non-coding RNAs. Several metabolites produced by the GM, including short-chain fatty acids, folates, biotin, and trimethylamine-N-oxide, have the potential to regulate epigenetics, apart from playing a vital role in normal physiological processes. The role of GM and epigenetics in CVDs are promising areas of research, and important insights in the field of early diagnosis and therapeutic approaches might appear soon."

Additionally, we performed multivariable meta-analysis with metaUSAT, to allow integration of summary data across traits to generate combined effect estimates. On individual hernia analysis, we identified 3404 variants across 38 genome-wide significant (p < 5×10-8) loci of which 11 are previously unreported. Robust evidence for five shared susceptibility loci was discovered: ZC3H11B, EFEMP1, MHC region, WT1 and CALD1. Combined hernia phenotype analyses with additional multivariable meta-analysis of summary statistics in metaUSAT revealed 28 independent (seven previously unreported) shared susceptibility loci.

Evidence from epidemiological studies and randomised controlled trials on their role in cardiovascular, inflammatory, and other diseases remains inconsistent. The objective of this study was to assess whether genetically predicted fatty acid concentrations affect the risk of disease across a wide variety of clinical health outcomes.The UK Biobank (UKB) is a large study involving over 500,000 participants aged 40 to 69 years at recruitment from 2006 to 2010. We used summary-level data for 117,143 UKB samples (base dataset), to extract genetic associations of fatty acids, and individual-level data for 322,232 UKB participants (target dataset) to conduct our discovery analysis. We studied potentially causal relationships of circulating fatty acids with 845 clinical diagnoses, using mendelian randomisation (MR) approach, within a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) framework. Regression models in PheWAS were adjusted for sex, age, and the first 10 genetic principal components. External summary statistics were used for replication. When several fatty acids were associated with a health outcome, multivariable MR and MR-Bayesian method averaging (MR-BMA) was applied to disentangle their causal role. Genetic predisposition to higher docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) was associated with cholelithiasis and cholecystitis (odds ratio per mmol/L: 0.76, 95% confidence interval: 0.66 to 0.87). This was supported in replication analysis (FinnGen study) and by the genetically predicted omega-3 fatty acids analyses. Genetically predicted linoleic acid (LA), omega-6, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), and total fatty acids (total FAs) showed positive associations with cardiovascular outcomes with support from replication analysis. Finally, higher genetically predicted levels of DHA (0.83, 0.73 to 0.95) and omega-3 (0.83, 0.75 to 0.92) were found to have a protective effect on obesity, which was supported using body mass index (BMI) in the GIANT consortium as replication analysis. Multivariable MR analysis suggested a direct detrimental effect of LA (1.64, 1.07 to 2.50) and omega-6 fatty acids (1.81, 1.06 to 3.09) on coronary heart disease (CHD). MR-BMA prioritised LA and omega-6 fatty acids as the top risk factors for CHD. Although we present a range of sensitivity analyses to the address MR assumptions, horizontal pleiotropy may still bias the reported associations and further evaluation in clinical trials is needed.Our study suggests potentially protective effects of circulating DHA and omega-3 concentrations on cholelithiasis and cholecystitis and on obesity, highlighting the need to further assess them as prevention treatments in clinical trials. Moreover, our findings do not support the supplementation of unsaturated fatty acids for cardiovascular disease prevention.Copyright: © 2022 Zagkos et al.

Leveraging large-scale genome-wide association studies' summary statistics, we comprehensively assessed genetic overlap and potential causality of cognitive traits and Alzheimer's disease (AD) with several GIT disorders. We demonstrate a strong and highly significant inverse global genetic correlation between cognitive traits and GIT disorders-peptic ulcer disease (PUD), gastritis-duodenitis, diverticulosis, irritable bowel syndrome, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), but not inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Further analysis detects 35 significant (p&lt; 4.37 × 10-5) bivariate local genetic correlations between cognitive traits, AD, and GIT disorders (including IBD). Mendelian randomisation analysis suggests a risk-decreasing causality of educational attainment, intelligence, and other cognitive traits on PUD and GERD, but not IBD, and a putative association of GERD with cognitive function decline. Gene-based analysis reveals a significant gene-level genetic overlap of cognitive traits with AD and GIT disorders (IBD inclusive, pbinomial-test = 1.18 × 10-3-2.20 × 10-16). Our study supports the protective roles of genetically-influenced educational attainments and other cognitive traits on the risk of GIT disorders and highlights a putative association of GERD with cognitive function decline. Findings from local genetic correlation analysis provide novel insights, indicating that the relationship of IBD with cognitive traits (and AD) will depend largely on their local effects across the genome."

Ten single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the 10 genome-wide association studies (GWAS)-significant hypertension/blood pressure (BP) candidate genes were genotyped in 950 pregnant women divided into two cohorts according to their pre-pregnancy body mass index (preBMI): preBMI ≥ 25 (162 with PE and 159 control) and preBMI &lt; 25 (290 with PE and 339 control). The PLINK software package was utilized to study the association (analyzed four genetic models using logistic regression). The functionality of PE-correlated loci was analyzed by performing an in silico database analysis. Two SNP hypertension/BP genes, rs805303BAG6(OR: 0.36-0.66) and rs167479RGL3(OR: 1.86), in subjects with preBMI ≥ 25 were associated with PE. No association between the studied SNPs and PE in the preBMI &lt; 25 group was determined. Further analysis showed that two PE-associated SNPs are functional (have weighty eQTL, sQTL, regulatory, and missense values) and could be potentially implicated in PE development. In conclusion, this study was the first to discover the modifying influence of overweight/obesity on the pattern of association of GWAS-significant hypertension/BP susceptibility genes with PE: these genes are linked with PE in preBMI ≥ 25 pregnant women and are not PE-involved in the preBMI &lt; 25 group."
"36550638","DNA methylation profile in the whole blood of acute coronary syndrome patients with aspirin resistance.","J Clin Lab Anal","Aspirin resistance (AR) results in major adverse cardiovascular events, and DNA methylation might participate in the regulation of this pathological process.In present study, a sum of 35 patients with AR and 35 non-AR (NAR) controls were enrolled. Samples from 5 AR and 5 NAR were evaluated in an 850 BeadChip DNA methylation assay, and another 30 AR versus 30 NAR were evaluated to validate the differentially methylated CpG loci (DML). Then, qRT-PCR was used to investigate the target mRNA expression of genes at CpG loci. Finally, Gene Ontology (GO) as well as Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses were performed to reveal the enriched pathways.The AR and NAR groups displayed significant differences in DNA methylation at 7707 positions, with 270 hypermethylated sites (e.g., cg09555818 located in APOC2) and 7437 sites hypomethylated sites (e.g., cg26828689 located in SLC12A5). Six DML were validated by pyrosequencing, and it was confirmed that DNA methylation (cg16391727, cg21008208, cg21293749, and cg13945576) was related to the increasing risk of AR. The relative mRNA expression of the ROR1 gene was also associated with AR (p = 0.007), suggesting that the change of cg21293749 in DNA methylation might lead to differential ROR1 mRNA expression, ultimately resulting in AR. Furthermore, the identified differentially methylated sites were associated with the molecular pathways such as circadian rhythms and insulin secretion.Hence, the distinct DNA methylation might play a vital role in the biological regulation of AR through the pathways such as circadian rhythms.© 2022 The Authors.

"36585699","DNA methylation in human gastric epithelial cells defines regional identity without restricting lineage plasticity.","Clin Epigenetics","Epigenetic modifications in mammalian DNA are commonly manifested by DNA methylation. In the stomach, altered DNA methylation patterns have been observed following chronic Helicobacter pylori infections and in gastric cancer. In the context of epigenetic regulation, the regional nature of the stomach has been rarely considered in detail.Here, we establish gastric mucosa derived primary cell cultures as a reliable source of native human epithelium. We describe the DNA methylation landscape across the phenotypically different regions of the healthy human stomach, i.e., antrum, corpus, fundus together with the corresponding transcriptomes. We show that stable regional DNA methylation differences translate to a limited extent into regulation of the transcriptomic phenotype, indicating a largely permissive epigenetic regulation. We identify a small number of transcription factors with novel region-specific activity and likely epigenetic impact in the stomach, including GATA4, IRX5, IRX2, PDX1 and CDX2. Detailed analysis of the Wnt pathway reveals differential regulation along the craniocaudal axis, which involves non-canonical Wnt signaling in determining cell fate in the proximal stomach. By extending our analysis to pre-neoplastic lesions and gastric cancers, we conclude that epigenetic dysregulation characterizes intestinal metaplasia as a founding basis for functional changes in gastric cancer. We present insights into the dynamics of DNA methylation across anatomical regions of the healthy stomach and patterns of its change in disease. Finally, our study provides a well-defined resource of regional stomach transcription and epigenetics.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"36556394","A Pipeline for Phasing and Genotype Imputation on Mixed Human Data (Parents-Offspring Trios and Unrelated Subjects) by Reviewing Current Methods and Software.","Life (Basel)","Genotype imputation has become an essential prerequisite when performing association analysis. It is a computational technique that allows us to infer genetic markers that have not been directly genotyped, thereby increasing statistical power in subsequent association studies, which consequently has a crucial impact on the identification of causal variants. Many features need to be considered when choosing the proper algorithm for imputation, including the target sample on which it is performed, i.e., related individuals, unrelated individuals, or both. Problems could arise when dealing with a target sample made up of mixed data, composed of both related and unrelated individuals, especially since the scientific literature on this topic is not sufficiently clear. To shed light on this issue, we examined existing algorithms and software for performing phasing and imputation on mixed human data from SNP arrays, specifically when related subjects belong to trios. By discussing the advantages and limitations of the current algorithms, we identified LD-based methods as being the most suitable for reconstruction of haplotypes in this specific context, and we proposed a feasible pipeline that can be used for imputing genotypes in both phased and unphased human data."
"36572941","Altered DNA methylation in estrogen-responsive repetitive sequences of spermatozoa of infertile men with shortened anogenital distance.","Clin Epigenetics","It has been suggested that antenatal exposure to environmental endocrine disruptors is responsible for adverse trends in male reproductive health, including male infertility, impaired semen quality, cryptorchidism and testicular cancer, a condition known as testicular dysgenesis syndrome. Anogenital distance (AGD) is an anthropomorphic measure of antenatal exposure to endocrine disruptors, with higher exposure levels leading to shortened AGD. We hypothesized that exposure to endocrine disruptors could lead to changes in DNA methylation during early embryonic development, which could then persist in the sperm of infertile men with shortened AGD.Using fluorescence activated cell sorting based on staining with either YO-PRO-1 (YOPRO) or chromomycin-3 (CMA3), we isolated four sperm fractions from eleven infertile men with short AGD and ten healthy semen donors. We examined DNA methylation in these sorted spermatozoa using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing. We found that fractions of spermatozoa from infertile men stained with CMA3 or YOPRO were more likely to contain transposable elements harboring an estrogen receptor response element (ERE). Abnormal sperm (as judged by high CMA3 or YOPRO staining) from infertile men shows substantial hypomethylation in estrogenic Alu sequences. Conversely, normal sperm fractions (as judged by low CMA3 or YO-PRO-1 staining) of either healthy donors or infertile patients were more likely to contain hypermethylated Alu sequences with ERE.Shortened AGD, as related to previous exposure to endocrine disruptors, and male infertility are accompanied by increased presence of hormonal response elements in the differentially methylated regulatory sequences of the genome of sperm fractions characterized by chromatin decondensation and apoptosis.© 2022.

Here, we review the postnatal dynamic development of OT-system as well as early-life OT functions that are essential for shaping social behaviors. We specifically address the role of OT in neonates, focusing on its role in modulating/adapting sensory input and feeding behavior; both processes are involved in the establishing mother-infant bond, a crucial event for structuring all future social interactions. In patients and rodent models of Prader-Willi and Schaaf-Yang syndromes, two neurodevelopmental diseases characterized by autism-related features, sensory impairments, and feeding difficulties in early infancy are linked to an alteration of OT-system. Successful preclinical studies in mice and a phase I/II clinical trial in Prader-Willi babies constitute a proof of concept that OT-treatment in early life not only improves suckling deficit but has also a positive long-term effect on learning and social behavior. We propose that in early postnatal life, OT plays a pivotal role in stimulating and coordinating the maturation of neuronal networks controlling feeding behavior and the first social interactions. Consequently, OT therapy might be considered to improve feeding behavior and, all over the life, social cognition, and learning capabilities.Copyright © 2022 Muscatelli, Matarazzo and Chini."

Supervised learning-based algorithms to predict the chromatin loops require large priori information to satisfy the model construction, while the prediction sensitivity of unsupervised learning-based algorithms is still unsatisfactory. Therefore, we propose an unsupervised algorithm, Ecomap-loop. It takes advantage of extrusion complex-associated patterns, including CTCF, RAD21, and SMC enrichments, as well as the orientation distribution of CTCF motif of loops to build feature matrices; then the eigen decomposition model is employed to obtain the cell type-specific loops. We compare the performance of Ecomap-loop with the state-of-the-art unsupervised algorithm using Hi-C, ChIA-PET, expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL), and CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) screen data; the results show that Ecomap-loop achieves the best in four cell types. In addition, the functional analysis reveals the ability of Ecomap-loop to predict active functionality-related and cell type-specific loops.© 2022 The Authors."

It is widely known that a variety of autoimmune responses in human diseases depend on PTMs of self-proteins. In this review we summarize the latest findings about the role of PTMs in the generation of autoimmunity and, specifically, we address the most relevant PTMs in rheumatic diseases that occur in synovial tissue. Citrullination, homocitrullination (carbamylation) and acetylation are responsible for the generation of Anti-Modified Protein/Peptide Antibodies (AMPAs family), autoantibodies which have been implicated in the etiopathogenesis, diagnosis and prognosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Synthetic peptides provide complete control over the exact epitopes presented as well as the specific positions in their sequence where post-translationally modified amino acids are located and are key to advancing the detection of serological RA biomarkers that could be useful to stratify RA patients in order to pursue a personalized rheumatology. In this review we specifically address the latest findings regarding synthetic peptides post-translationally modified for the specific detection of autoantibodies in RA patients."

The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential prognostic value of FerLncRNAs and their relationship with the immune microenvironment and immunotherapy response of ccRCC.RNA sequencing data of 526 patients with ccRCC were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. The patients with ccRCC in TCGA were randomly divided (1:1) into a training and testing cohort. ICGC and GEO databases were used for validation. Screening for FerLncRNAs was performed using Pearson's correlation analysis with the reported ferroptosis-related genes. A FerLncRNA signature was constructed using univariate, LASSO, and multivariate Cox regression analyses in the training cohort. Internal and external datasets were performed to verify the FRlncRNA signature. Four major FRlncRNAs were verified throughin vitroexperiment.We identified seven FerLncRNAs (LINC00894, DUXAP8, LINC01426, PVT1, PELATON, LINC02609, and MYG1-AS1), and established a risk signature and nomogram for predicting the prognosis of ccRCC. Four major FRlncRNAs were verified with the prognosis of ccRCC in the GEPIA and K-M Plotter databases, and their expressions were validated by realtime PCR. The risk signature can also effectively reflect the immune environment, immunotherapy response and drug sensitivity of ccRCC.

"36583185","Epigenetics in depression and gut-brain axis: A molecular crosstalk.","Front Aging Neurosci","Gut-brain axis is a dynamic, complex, and bidirectional communication network between the gut and brain. Changes in the microbiota-gut-brain axis are responsible for developing various metabolic, neurodegenerative, and neuropsychiatric disorders. According to clinical and preclinical findings, the gut microbiota is a significant regulator of the gut-brain axis. In addition to interacting with intestinal cells and the enteric nervous system, it has been discovered that microbes in the gut can modify the central nervous system through metabolic and neuroendocrine pathways. The metabolites of the gut microbiome can modulate a number of diseases by inducing epigenetic alteration through DNA methylation, histone modification, and non-coding RNA-associated gene silencing. Short-chain fatty acids, especially butyrate, are well-known histone deacetylases inhibitors. Similarly, other microbial metabolites such as folate, choline, and trimethylamine-N-oxide also regulate epigenetics mechanisms. Furthermore, various studies have revealed the potential role of microbiome dysbiosis and epigenetics in the pathophysiology of depression. Hence, in this review, we have highlighted the role of gut dysbiosis in epigenetic regulation, causal interaction between host epigenetic modification and the gut microbiome in depression and suggest microbiome and epigenome as a possible target for diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of depression.Copyright © 2022 Begum, Mandhare, Tryphena, Srivastava, Shaikh, Singh and Khatri."
"36570009","Genetic analysis of DNA methylation in dyslipidemia: a case-control study.","PeerJ","Coronary heart disease has become the leading cause of death in developed countries, and dyslipidemia is closely associated with the risk of cardiovascular disease. Dyslipidemia is caused by the abnormal regulation of several genes and signaling pathways, and dyslipidemia is influenced mainly by genetic variation.AMFR, FBXW7, INSIG1, INSIG2, andMBTPS1genes are associated with lipid metabolism. In a recent GWAS study, theGRINAgene has been reported to be associated with dyslipidemia, but its molecular mechanism has not been thoroughly investigated. The correlation between the DNA methylation of these genes and lipid metabolism has not been studied. This study aimed to examine the relationship between the DNA methylation of these genes and the risk of dyslipidemia by comparing the methylation levels of dyslipidemia and control samples.A case-control research method was used in this study. The patient's blood samples were collected at the Heart Center of the First Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University. In the Xinjiang Han population, 100 cases of hyperlipidemia and 80 cases of the control group were selected. The two groups were age and gender-matched. Quantitative methylation analysis of CpG sites in the gene promoter regions of six genes was performed by Solexa high-throughput sequencing.The DNA methylation levels of 23 CpG sites in six genes were shown to be associated with hyperlipidemia, and a total of 20 DNA methylation haplotypes showed statistically significant differences between the two groups. When compared with the control group, the dyslipidemia group had significantly higher levels of methylation in theGRINAgene (2.68vs2.36,P= 0.04). Additionally, we also discovered a significant methylation haplotype of GRINA (P= 0.017).The findings of this study reveal that the DNA methylation ofGRINAincreases the risk for dyslipidemia in humans.© 2022 Liu et al."
"36585726","Longitudinal profiling in patients undergoing cardiac surgery reveals postoperative changes in DNA methylation.","Clin Epigenetics","Cardiac surgery and cardiopulmonary bypass induce a substantial immune and inflammatory response, the overactivation of which is associated with significant pulmonary, cardiovascular, and neurologic complications. Commensurate with the immune and inflammatory response are changes in the heart and vasculature itself, which together drive postoperative complications through mechanisms that are poorly understood. Longitudinal DNA methylation profiling has the potential to identify changes in gene regulatory mechanisms that are secondary to surgery and to identify molecular processes that predict and/or cause postoperative complications. In this study, we measure DNA methylation in preoperative and postoperative whole blood samples from 96 patients undergoing cardiac surgery on cardiopulmonary bypass.While the vast majority of DNA methylation is unchanged by surgery after accounting for changes in cell-type composition, we identify several loci with statistically significant postoperative changes in methylation. Additionally, two of these loci are associated with new-onset postoperative atrial fibrillation, a significant complication after cardiac surgery. Paired statistical analysis, use of FACS data to support sufficient control of cell-type heterogeneity, and measurement of IL6 levels in a subset of patients add rigor to this analysis, allowing us to distinguish cell-type variability from actual changes in methylation.This study identifies significant changes in DNA methylation that occur immediately after cardiac surgery and demonstrates that these acute alterations in DNA methylation have the granularity to identify processes associated with major postoperative complications. This research also establishes methods for controlling for cell-type variability in a large human cohort that may be useful to deploy in other longitudinal studies of epigenetic marks in the setting of acute and chronic disease.© 2022.

Recently developed tissue-based molecular biomarkers have refined the risk assessment of the disease. The characterization of tissue biopsy components and subsequent identification of relevant tissue-based molecular alterations have the potential to improve the clinical decision making and patient outcomes. However, tissue biopsies are invasive and spatially restricted due to tumor heterogeneity. Therefore, there is an urgent need for complementary diagnostic and prognostic options. Liquid biopsy approaches are minimally invasive with potential utility for the early detection, risk stratification, and monitoring of tumors. In this review, we focus on tissue and liquid biopsy biomarkers for early diagnosis and risk stratification of prostate cancer, including modifications on the genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic levels. High-risk molecular alterations combined with orthogonal clinical parameters can improve the identification of aggressive tumors and increase patient survival."

Chorionic villus samples from 64 human placentas were profiled with the Illumina MethylationEPIC BeadChip; clinical assessments of maternal mood and SSRI treatment records were collected at multiple time points during pregnancy. Case distribution was 20 SSRI-exposed cases and 44 SSRI non-exposed cases. Maternal depression was defined using a mean maternal Hamilton Depression score > 8 to indicate symptomatic depressed mood (""maternally-depressed""), and we further classified cases into SSRI-exposed, maternally-depressed (n = 14); SSRI-exposed, not maternally-depressed (n = 6); SSRI non-exposed, maternally-depressed (n = 20); and SSRI non-exposed, not maternally-depressed (n = 24). For replication, Illumina 450K DNAme profiles were obtained from 34 additional cases from an independent cohort (n = 17 SSRI-exposed, n = 17 SSRI non-exposed). No CpGs were differentially methylated at FDR < 0.05 comparing SSRI-exposed to non-exposed placentas, in a model adjusted for mean maternal Hamilton Depression score, or in a model restricted to maternally-depressed cases with and without SSRI exposure. However, at a relaxed threshold of FDR < 0.25, five CpGs were differentially methylated (|Δβ| > 0.03) by SSRI exposure status. Four were covered by the replication cohort measured by the 450K array, but none replicated. No CpGs were differentially methylated (FDR < 0.25) comparing maternally depressed to not depressed cases. In sex-stratified analyses for SSRI-exposed versus non-exposed cases (females n = 31; males n = 33), three additional CpGs in females, but none in males, were differentially methylated at the relaxed FDR < 0.25 cut-off. We did not observe large-scale alterations of DNAme in placentas exposed to maternal SSRI treatment, as compared to placentas with no SSRI exposure. We also found no evidence for altered DNAme in maternal depression-exposed versus depression non-exposed placentas. This novel work in a prospectively-recruited cohort with clinician-ascertained SSRI exposure and mood assessments would benefit from future replication.© 2022. The Author(s)."

The aim of this study was to explore the biological characteristics of cfDNA in patients with LN in terms of serology, fragment omics, and epigenetics, and to discuss the possibility of liquid biopsy for cfDNA as an alternative to conventional tissue biopsy.cfDNA was extracted from plasma samples of 127 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (64 with LN, 63 without LN). The cfDNA concentration was determined using the Qubit method. Next-generation sequencing cfDNA methylation profiling was performed for three LN patients and six non-LN patients. The methylation panel was designed based on data from The Cancer Genome Atlas cohort. The fragmentation index, motif score, and DELFI score were calculated to explore the fragmentation profile of cfDNA in patients with LN. Statistical and machine learning methods were used to select features to calculate the methylation scores of the samples.Patients with LN had significantly lower cfDNA concentrations (P = 0.0347) than those without LN. This may be associated with the presence of anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies (r = -0.4189; P = 0.0296). The mean DELFI score (proportion of short fragments of cfDNA) in patients with LN was significantly higher than that in patients without LN (P = 0.0238). Based on the pan-cancer data, 73, 66, 8, and 10 features were selected and used to calculate the methylation scores. The mean methylation scores of these features in patients with LN differed significantly from those in patients without LN (P = 0.0238).The specificity of cfDNA in patients with LN was identified using serological, fragmentomic, and epigenetic analyses.

Ten-eleven translocation (TET) methylcytosine dioxygenase is an essential enzyme of which there are three members, TET1, 2, and 3, involved in hydroxymethylation, a newly uncovered mechanism of active DNA methylation. The epigenomes of gene transcription are regulated by 5-hydroxymethylcytocine (5-hmC) and TETs, leading to dysregulation of the immune system in SLE. The purpose of this study was to investigate the global hydroxymethylation status in SLE peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and to explore the role of TETs in changing the patterns of methylation. (2) Methods: We collected PBMCs from 101 SLE patients and 100 healthy donors. TaqMan real-time polymerase chain-reaction assay was performed for the detection of 5-methylcytosine (5-mC), 5-hmC, and TET2 mRNA expression and single-nucleotide polymorphism genotyping. The methylation rates in different CpG sites of TET2 promoters were examined using next-generation sequencing-based deep bisulfite sequencing. Putative transcription factors were investigated using the UCSC Genome Browser on the Human Dec. 2013 (GRCh38/hg38) Assembly. (3) Results: 5-mC and 5-hmC were both decreased in SLE. The mRNA expression level of TET2 was notably high and found to be correlated with the levels of immunologic biomarkers that are indicative of SLE disease activity. The analysis of methylation rates in the TET2 promoter revealed that SLE patients had significantly higher and lower rates of methylation in TET2 105146072-154 and TET2 105146218-331, respectively. (4) Conclusions: TET2 may play an important role in 5-mC/5-hmC dynamics in the PBMCs of SLE patients. The epigenetic modification of TET2 promoters could contribute to the pathogenesis of SLE and the intensity of the immunologic reaction."

Despite major improvements in early detection and new treatment approaches, the need for better outcomes and quality of life for patients is still high. Extracellular vesicles play an important role in tumor biology, as they are able to transfer information between cells of different origins and locations. Their potential value as biomarkers or for targeted tumor therapy is apparent. In this study, we analyzed the supernatants of MCF-7 breast cancer cells, which were harvested following 5 or 10 days of simulated microgravity on a Random Positioning Machine (RPM). The primary results showed a substantial increase in released vesicles following incubation under simulated microgravity at both time points. The distribution of subpopulations regarding their surface protein expression is also altered; the minimal changes between the time points hint at an early adaption. This is the first step in gaining further insight into the mechanisms of tumor progression, metastasis, the education of the tumor microenvironments, and preparation of the metastatic niche. Additionally, this may lighten up the processes of the rapid cellular adaptions in the organisms of space travelers during spaceflights."

Because DNA methylation can capture the regulatory landscape of tumors and can be measured in body fluids, it provides unparalleled opportunities for the discovery of early diagnostic and prognostics markers predictive of clinical outcomes. Here we investigated use of DNA methylation for the discovery of potential clinically actionable diagnostic and prognostic markers for predicting survival in CRC.We analyzed DNA methylation patterns between tumor and control samples to discover signatures of CpG sites and genes associated with CRC and predictive of survival. We conducted functional analysis to identify molecular networks and signaling pathways driving clinical outcomes.We discovered a signature of aberrantly methylated genes associated with CRC and a signature of thirteen (13) CpG sites predictive of survival. We discovered molecular networks and signaling pathways enriched for CpG sites likely to drive clinical outcomes.The investigation revealed that CpG sites can predict survival in CRC and that DNA methylation can capture the regulatory state of tumors through aberrantly methylated molecular networks and signaling pathways."

However, little is known about the effect of various heavy metal mixtures at relatively low concentrations. Hence, this study aimed to investigate associations between prenatal exposures to a wide range of individual heavy metals and heavy metal mixtures with anthropometric measures of newborns.We recruited 975 mother-term infant pairs from two major hospitals in Israel. Associations between eight heavy metals (arsenic, cadmium, chromium, mercury, nickel, lead, selenium, and thallium) detected in maternal urine samples on the day of delivery with weight, length, and head circumference at birth were estimated using linear and Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) models.Most heavy metals examined in our study were observed in lower concentrations than in other studies, except for selenium. In the linear as well as the BKMR models, birth weight and length were negatively associated with levels of chromium. Birth weight was found to be negatively associated with thallium and positively associated with nickel.By using a large sample size and advanced statistical models, we could examine the association between prenatal exposure to metals in relatively low concentrations and anthropometric measures of newborns. Chromium was suggested to be the most influential metal in the mixture, and its associations with birth weight and length were found negative. Head circumference was neither associated with any of the metals, yet the levels of metals detected in our sample were relatively low. The suggested associations should be further investigated and could shed light on complex biochemical processes involved in intrauterine fetal development.© 2022. The Author(s)."

However, expression is highly variable and can be unstable during prolonged culture. This is often due to epigenetic mechanisms silencing the transgenes. To combat this problem, vectors have been engineered to include ubiquitous chromatin opening elements (UCOEs) that protect against silencing. Here, we recount the evidence that UCOEs can modify chromatin environments and benefit biomanufacturing.© 2022 The Author(s)."

However, the molecular regulatory mechanisms of liver cancer, especially transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms, should be further studied. Here we used chromatin and cross-linking immunoprecipitation with high throughput sequencing methods (ChIP-seq and CLIP-seq) to capture the global binding profiles on RNAs and DNAs of Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) and its partner Jumonji And AT-Rich Interaction Domain Containing 2 (JARID2) in liver carcinoma cell lines (HepG2) and normal liver cell line (THLE-2), respectively. We also integrated HCC transcriptome data from the TCGA to analyze the expression pattern of bound genes. We found that EZH2 and JARID2 both showed distinct binding profiles between HepG2 and THLE-2 cells. By binding to the primary RNAs, bound transcripts of EZH2 and JARID2 in HepG2 showed significantly increased transcriptional levels in HCC patients. By performing gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), the bound transcripts were also highly related to HCC development. We also found EZH2 and JARID2 could specifically bind to several long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), including H19. By exploring the DNA binding profile, we detected a dramatically repressed DNA binding ability of EZH2 in HepG2 cells. We also found that the EZH2-bound genes showed slightly increased transcriptional levels in HepG2 cells. Integrating analysis of the RNA and DNA binding profiles suggests EZH2 and JARID2 shift their binding ability from DNA to RNA in HepG2 cells to promote cancer development in HCC. Our study provided a comprehensive and distinct binding profile on RNAs and DNAs of EZH2 and JARID2 in liver cancer cell lines, suggesting their potential novel functional manners to promote HCC development.Copyright © 2022 Wen, He, Zhan, Li, Liu, He, Wei, Zhao, Zhang, Xue, Xia, Wang, Xia, Xin, Wu, Duan, Xiao, Shen, Feng, Xiang and Lu."

PAQR4 plays an oncogenic role in lung and breast cancer. However, systematic pancancer analyses of PAQR4 have not been performed. The purpose was to investigate the prognostic and immunological significance of PAQR4 across 31 tumor types. Data were obtained from the following sources: TCGA, GEO, UALCAN, TIMER, GEPIA2, KM plotter, and TISIDB databases. The results proved that PAQR4 expression was significantly elevatory in most cancer types. We then explored the utility of PAQR4 as a prognostic indicator across all cancers. Using Cox proportional risk regression models, it has been demonstrated that PAQR4 is an independent risk factor in. High PAQR4 expression was not associated with other prognostic indicators, including overall survival, disease-free interval, disease-specific survival, and progression-free period. Subsequently, we explored the immunological value of PAQR4 and found that PAQR4 expression significantly correlated with tumor mutational burden, microsatellite instability, neoantigen, and immune checkpoint genes in tumors. It also significantly negatively correlated with most tumors' ESTIMATE scores, indicating that PAQR4 can influence the cellular composition of the tumor microenvironment. Our findings suggest the immunotherapeutic potential of PAQR4 in tumors. Finally, we explored the role of PAQR4 in tumor drug resistance and found that PAQR4 expression affected the sensitivity to multiple chemotherapeutic agents. A significant role for PAQR4 in tumor immunity is evident in these studies, as well as its potential role in cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment precision.Copyright © 2022 Ziyue Yang et al."

Lymph node metastasis (LNM) is an important indicator of PTC recurrence and transmembrane 4 superfamily (TM4SF) proteins regulate metastasis by modulating cell adhesion, migration, tissue differentiation, and tumor invasion. However, the diagnostic and prognostic values of TM4SF in PTC remain unclear.Methods:This study aimed to identify TM4SF genes with predictive value for LNM and prognostic value in PTC using bioinformatic analysis. We screened the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of the TM4SF family in PTC using data from TCGA, constructed a PPI network using STRING, and evaluated the predictive role ofTM4SF1in LNMviaa binary logistic regression analysis and ROC curve. We assessed the association betweenTM4SF1expression and DNA methylation, and determined the functional and mechanistic role ofTM4SF1in promoting LNMviaGSEA, KEGG, and GO. We estimated the relationship between each TM4SF gene and overall survival (OS, estimated by Kaplan-Meier analysis) in patients with PTC and established a predictive model of prognostic indicators using a LASSO penalized Cox analysis to identify hub genes. Finally, we explored the correlation between TM4SFs and TMB/MSI.Results:We identified 21 DEGs from the 41 TM4SFs between N0 (without LNM) and N1 (with LNM) patients, withTM4SF1,TM4SF4,UPK1B, andCD151being highly expressed in the N1 group; several DEGs were observed in the TNM, T, and N cancer stages. The ""integrins and other cell-surface receptors"" pathway was the most significantly enriched functional category related to LNM and TM4SFs.TM4SF1was identified as an indicator of LNM (AUC= 0.702). High levels ofTM4SF1might be related to Wnt/β-catenin pathway and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process in PTC. The higher expression ofTM4SF1was also related to DNA promoter hypomethylation.CD9,TM4SF4,TSPAN2, andTSPAN16were associated with OS in PTC patients and TSPAN2 has great potential to become a prognostic marker of PTC progression. For the prognostic model, the riskscore = (-0.0058)*CD82+(-0.4994)*+(0.1584)*TSPAN11+(1.7597)*TSPAN19+(0.2694)*TSPAN2 (lambda.min = 0.0149). The AUCs for 3-year, 5-year, and 10-year OS were 0.81, 0.851, and 0.804.TSPAN18,TSPAN31, andTSPAN32were associated with both TMB and MSI in PTC patients.Conclusion:Our findings identifiedTM4SF1as a potential diagnostic marker of LNM andTSPAN2as a prognostic factor for patients with PTC. Our study provides a novel strategy to assess prognosis and predict effective treatments in PTC.Copyright © 2022 Wang, Li, Zhao, Yao, Lu, Dong, Bai and Liao."

Docetaxel (DTX), a taxoid used to treat breast cancer, is a BCS-class-IV compound (low oral bioavailability, solubility and intestinal permeability). Nanotechnological strategies can improve chemotherapy effectiveness by promoting sustained release and reducing systemic toxicity. Nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) encapsulate hydrophobic drugs in their blend-of-lipids matrix, and imperfections prevent drug expulsion during storage. This work describes the preparation, by design of experiments (23factorial design) of a novel NLC formulation containing copaiba oil (CO) as a functional excipient. The optimized formulation (NLCDTX) showed approximately 100% DTX encapsulation efficiency and was characterized by different techniques (DLS, NTA, TEM/FE-SEM, DSC and XRD) and was stable for 12 months of storage, at 25 °C. Incorporation into the NLC prolonged drug release for 54 h, compared to commercial DTX (10 h). In vitro cytotoxicity tests revealed the antiproliferative effect of CO and NLCDTX, by reducing the cell viability of breast cancer (4T1/MCF-7) and healthy (NIH-3T3) cells more than commercial DTX. NLCDTXthus emerges as a promising drug delivery system of remarkable anticancer effect, (strengthened by CO) and sustained release that, in clinics, may decrease systemic toxicity at lower DTX doses."

The aim of this study was to ascertain serum vitamin B12 and folate levels in order to investigate the correlation among these vitamin levels and disease activation, localization, duration and age at the onset of the disease. Study population included 103 patients with Crohn's disease and a healthy control group of 114 individuals. C-reactive protein, vitamin B12, folate levels were studied along with hemogram analyses. The results were evaluated in statistical comparisons. While serum vitamin B12 levels and serum folate levels were 161.9 ± 63.2(73-496) pg/mL and 4.9 ± 1.4(1.2-9.4) ng/mL in the Crohn's patient group respectively, they were 321.7 ± 126.3(85-680) pg/mL and 7.6 ± 3.8(3-25.1) ng/mL in the control group respectively. Vitamin B12 and folate levels were distinctly lower in patients with Chron's disease than those of the control group (P < .001). The intragroup analysis of the patient group revealed that low vitamin B12 levels were significantly lower in the moderate group classified according to the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (P < .001), along with those in the L1 group with terminal/distal ileal involvement (P < .001). Vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies are quite prevalent in patients with Crohn's disease while this condition can lead to various complications and they prove to be important risk factors associated especially with thrombosis and its complications. Patients must be regularly followed-up for vitamin B12 and folate levels to supplement them where needed.Copyright © 2022 the Author(s). Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc."

There are a number of other disorders of hearing loss that may be relatively neglected due to being underrecognized, poorly understood, lacking robust diagnostic criteria or effective treatments. A few examples of these diseases include autoimmune inner ear disease (AIED) and/or autoinflammatory inner ear disease (AID), Meniere's disease (MD), sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL), and cytomegalovirus (CMV)-related hearing loss (CRHL). Although these diseases may often differ in etiology, there have been recent studies that support the involvement of the SV in the pathogenesis of many of these disorders. We strive to highlight a few prominent examples of these frequently neglected otologic diseases and illustrate the relevance of understanding SV composition, structure and function with regards to these disease processes. In this study, we review the physiology of the SV, lay out the importance of these neglected otologic diseases, highlight the current literature regarding the role of the SV in these disorders, and discuss the current strategies, both approved and investigational, for management of these disorders.Published by Elsevier B.V."

However, little is known about the role of m6A regulator AlkB homolog 5 (ALKBH5) in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). In this study, we analyzed the influence of ALKBH5 on the stemness of TNBC and the molecular mechanism using bioinformatics analysis and in vivo animal experiments.RNA expression data and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data were downloaded from the TCGA and GEO databases. Following intersection analysis, key genes involved in the TNBC cell stemness were determined, which was followed by functional enrichment analysis, PPI and survival analysis. Exosomes were extracted from bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSC-Exos) where ALKBH5 inhibition assay was conducted to verify their function in the biological characteristics of TNBC cells.Bioinformatics analysis revealed 45 key genes of ALKBH5 regulating TNBC cell stemness. In addition, UBE2C was predicted as a key downstream gene and p53 was predicted as a downstream signaling of ALKBH5. In vivo data confirmed that ALKBH5 upregulated UBE2C expression by regulating the m6A modification of UBE2C and reduced p53 expression, thus promoting the stemness, growth and metastasis of TNBC cells. BMSC-Exos suppressed the tumor stemness, growth and metastasis of TNBC cells and ALKBH5 shRNA-loaded BMSC-Exos showed a more significant suppressive role.Taken together, our findings indicated that ALKBH5 shRNA-loaded BMSC-Exos reduced TNBC cell stemness, growth and metastasis and define a promising strategy to treat TNBC."

Ferroptosis is a newly discovered form of regulated cell death that is closely associated with cancer development and immunotherapy. The aim of this study was to establish and validate a ferroptosis-related gene (FRG) DNA methylation signature to predict the prognosis of CM patients using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. A reliable four-FRG DNA methylation prognostic signature was constructed via Cox regression analysis based on TCGA database. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that patients in the high-risk group tended to have a shorter overall survival (OS) than the low-risk group in both training TCGA and validation GEO cohorts. Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis showed the areas under the curve (AUC) at 1, 3, and 5 years were 0.738, 0.730, and 0.770 in TCGA cohort and 0.773, 0.775, and 0.905 in the validation cohort, respectively. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses indicated that the signature was an independent prognostic indicator of OS in patients with CM. Immunogenomic profiling showed the low-risk group of patients had a higher immunophenoscore, and most immune checkpoints were negatively associated with the risk signature. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that immune response and immune-related pathways were enriched in the low-risk group. In conclusion, we established and validated a four-FRG DNA methylation signature that independently predicts prognosis in CM patients. This signature was strongly correlated with the immune landscape, and may serve as a biomarker to guide clinicians in making more precise and personalized treatment decisions for CM patients."
"36552034","Transposons Acting as Competitive Endogenous RNAs: In-Silico Evidence from Datasets Characterised by L1 Overexpression.","Biomedicines","LINE L1 are transposable elements that can replicate within the genome by passing through RNA intermediates. The vast majority of these element copies in the human genome are inactive and just between 100 and 150 copies are still able to mobilize. During evolution, they could have been positively selected for beneficial cellular functions. Nonetheless, L1 deregulation can be detrimental to the cell, causing diseases such as cancer. The activity of miRNAs represents a fundamental mechanism for controlling transcript levels in somatic cells. These are a class of small non-coding RNAs that cause degradation or translational inhibition of their target transcripts. Beyond this, competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs), mostly made by circular and non-coding RNAs, have been seen to compete for the binding of the same set of miRNAs targeting protein coding genes. In this study, we have investigated whether autonomously transcribed L1s may act as ceRNAs by analyzing public dataset in-silico. We observed that genes sharing miRNA target sites with L1 have a tendency to be upregulated when L1 are overexpressed, suggesting the possibility that L1 might act as ceRNAs. This finding will help in the interpretation of transcriptomic responses in contexts characterized by the specific activation of transposons."

The few existing data-driven approaches perform QC at the level of samples or studies without accounting for biological variation.We first demonstrate that QC metrics vary with both tissue and cell types across technologies, study conditions, and species. We then propose data-driven QC (ddqc), an unsupervised adaptive QC framework to perform flexible and data-driven QC at the level of cell types while retaining critical biological insights and improved power for downstream analysis. ddqc applies an adaptive threshold based on the median absolute deviation on four QC metrics (gene and UMI complexity, fraction of reads mapping to mitochondrial and ribosomal genes). ddqc retains over a third more cells when compared to conventional data-agnostic QC filters. Finally, we show that ddqc recovers biologically meaningful trends in gradation of gene complexity among cell types that can help answer questions of biological interest such as which cell types express the least and most number of transcripts overall, and ribosomal transcripts specifically.ddqc retains cell types such as metabolically active parenchymal cells and specialized cells such as neutrophils which are often lost by conventional QC. Taken together, our work proposes a revised paradigm to quality filtering best practices-iterative QC, providing a data-driven QC framework compatible with observed biological diversity.© 2022.

However, the relationships between DDX56 and other tumors are not clear, and the molecular mechanism of its action is not fully understood. Here, we explore the biological functions of DDX56 in 31 solid tumors and clarify that DDX56 can promote oncogenesis and progression in multiple tumor types based on multi-omics data. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that the cancer-promoting effects of DDX56 were achieved by facilitating tumor cell proliferation, inhibiting apoptosis, inducing drug resistance, and influencing immune cell infiltration. Furthermore, we found that copy number alterations and low DNA methylation ofDDX56were likely to be related to aberrantly highDDX56expression. Our results suggest that DDX56 is a potential pan-cancer biomarker that could be used to predict survival and response to therapy, as well as a potential novel therapeutic target. We validated some of our results and illustrated their reliability using CRISPR Screens data. In conclusion, our results clarify the role of DDX56 in the occurrence and development of multiple cancers and provide insight into the molecular mechanisms involved in the process of pathogenesis, indicating a direction for future research on DDX56 in cancers.Copyright © 2022 Ruan, Zhang, Quan, Jiang, Wang, Zhang and Peng."

Maqui berry extract (MBE) and ginseng extract (GE) are two naturally occurring antioxidants that have been shown to reduce oxidative stress. By using an osteoblast and osteoclast three-dimensional co-culture system, we investigated the effects of MBE and GE on bone cells exposed to cigarette smoke extract (CSE). The cell viability and function of the co-culture system were measured on day 14. Markers of bone cell differentiation and oxidative stress were evaluated at gene and protein levels on day 7. The results showed that exposure to CSE induced osteoporotic-like alterations in the co-culture system, while 1.5 µg/mL MBE and 50 µg/mL GE improved CSE-impaired osteoblast function and decreased CSE-induced osteoclast function. The molecular mechanism of MBE and GE in preventing CSE-induced bone cell damage is linked with the inhibition of the NF-κB signaling pathway and the activation of the Nrf2 signaling pathway. Therefore, MBE and GE can reduce CSE-induced detrimental effects on bone cells and, thus, prevent smoking-induced alterations in bone cell homeostasis. These two antioxidants are thus suitable supplements to support bone regeneration in smokers."
"36570043","The longer-term effects of IVF on offspring from childhood to adolescence.","Front Reprod Health","It is well established that there are increased pregnancy-related complications for a woman who conceives through assisted reproductive treatment (ART). Furthermore, it is known that the risk to the child born is greater, believed to be related to prematurity and growth restriction. Studies have also reported epigenetic changes in the DNA of offspring conceived through ART. In addition, it is believed that they have a greater risk of congenital malformations, although some of these risks may relate to underlying infertility, rather than the ART treatmentper se. As a result, it may be expected that there is a greater risk to the longer-term health of the child who is born from ART; however, evidence about the long-term health of children conceived through ART is reassuring. Even though, it is recognised that many of the studies in this field come with limitations. Low numbers of participants is one of the major limitations, which makes subgroup analyses for diverse types of ART, or diverse types of infertility, not feasible. Furthermore, studies are often limited by short follow-up periods because of the difficulty and costs involved in longitudinal study designs. In addition, the rapid changes over time in ART limit the generalisability and significance of long-term findings. Well-designed studies investigating the long-term health outcomes of ART-conceived offspring and the potential influences of various aspects of the ART procedure, as well as studies of the potential underlying epigenetic mechanisms, are imperative. Furthermore, conclusions from childhood hospitalisation data from the United Kingdom, the long-term follow-up and quality of life study from researchers in Melbourne, and the data published from the Western Australian Growing Up Healthy Study will go a long way to help reassure current and prospective parents who may require ART to conceive.© 2022 Hart and Wijs."

To predict the fate of AD and identify distinctive genes, six machine learning algorithms were developed. The output of machine learning models was interpreted using the SHAP and LIME algorithms. For external validation, four separate GEO databases were used. We estimated the subgroups of the immunological microenvironment using unsupervised clustering. Further research was done on the variations in immunological microenvironment, enhanced functions and pathways, and therapeutic medicines between these subtypes. Finally, the expression of characteristic genes was verified using the AlzData and pan-cancer databases and RT-PCR analysis.It was determined that AD is connected to changes in the immunological microenvironment. WGCNA revealed 31 potential immune genes, of which the greenyellow and blue modules were shown to be most associated with infiltrated immune cells. In the testing set, the XGBoost algorithm had the best performance with an AUC of 0.86 and a P-R value of 0.83. Following the screening of the testing set by machine learning algorithms and the verification of independent datasets, five genes (CXCR4, PPP3R1, HSP90AB1, CXCL10, and S100A12) that were closely associated with AD pathological biomarkers and allowed for the accurate prediction of AD progression were found to be immune microenvironment-related genes. The feature gene-based nomogram may provide clinical advantages to patients. Two immune microenvironment subgroups for AD patients were identified, subtype2 was linked to a metabolic phenotype, subtype1 belonged to the immune-active kind. MK-866 and arachidonyltrifluoromethane were identified as the top treatment agents for subtypes 1 and 2, respectively. These five distinguishing genes were found to be intimately linked to the development of the disease, according to the Alzdata database, pan-cancer research, and RT-PCR analysis.The hub genes associated with the immune microenvironment that are most strongly associated with the progression of pathology in AD are CXCR4, PPP3R1, HSP90AB1, CXCL10, and S100A12.

The current study investigates DNA methylation in heart-irradiated rats and radiotherapy-treated breast cancer (BC) patients. Rats received fractionated whole heart X-irradiation (0, 0.92, 6.9 and 27.6 Gy total doses) and blood was collected after 1.5, 3, 7 and 12 months. Global and gene-specific methylation of the samples were evaluated; and gene expression of selected differentially methylated regions (DMRs) was validated in rat and BC patient blood. In rats receiving an absorbed dose of 27.6 Gy, DNA methylation alterations were detected up to 7 months with differential expression of cardiac-relevant DMRs. Of those,SLMAPshowed increased expression at 1.5 months, which correlated with hypomethylation. Furthermore,E2F6inversely correlated with a decreased global longitudinal strain. In BC patients,E2F6andSLMAPexhibited differential expression directly and 6 months after radiotherapy, respectively. This study describes a systemic radiation fingerprint at the DNA methylation level, elucidating a possible association of DNA methylation to RICVD pathophysiology, to be validated in future mechanistic studies."

InSaccharomyces cerevisiae, prions enable heritable responses to environmental conditions through bet-hedging mechanisms. Hence, [PRION+] states may serve as an atypical form of epigenetic control, producing heritable phenotypic change via protein folding. However, the connections between prion states and the epigenome remain unknown. Do [PRION+] states link to canonical epigenetic channels, such as histone post-translational modifications? Here, we map out the histone H3 modification landscape in the context of the [SWI+] and [PIN+] prion states. [SWI+] is propagated by Swi1, a subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, while [PIN+] is propagated by Rnq1, a protein of unknown function. We find [SWI+] yeast display decreases in the levels of H3K36me2 and H3K56ac compared to [swi-] yeast. In contrast, decreases in H3K4me3, H3K36me2, H3K36me3 and H3K79me3 are connected to the [PIN+] state. Curing of the prion state by treatment with guanidine hydrochloride restored histone PTM to [prion-] state levels. We find histone PTMs in the [PRION+] state do not match those in loss-of-function models.

In recent years, advances in omics techniques, including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, paved the way for accelerating plant/crop breeding to cope with the changing climate and enhance food production. Optimized omics and phenotypic plasticity platform integration, exploited by evolving machine learning algorithms will aid in the development of biological interpretations for complex crop traits. The precise and progressive assembly of desire alleles using precise genome editing approaches and enhanced breeding strategies would enable future crops to excel in combating the changing climates. Furthermore, plant breeding and genetic engineering ensures an exclusive approach to developing nutrient sufficient and climate-resilient crops, the productivity of which can sustainably and adequately meet the world's food, nutrition, and energy needs.

The prevalence of GDM increases due to the obesity epidemic. GDM is also associated with an increased risk of gestational hypertension and preeclampsia resulting in elevated maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. Diet is one of the most important environmental factors associated with etiology of GDM. Studies have shown that the consumption of certain bioactive diets and nutrients before and during pregnancy might have preventive effects against GDM leading to a healthy pregnancy outcome as well as beneficial metabolic outcomes later in the offspring's life. Gut microbiome as a biological ecosystem bridges the gap between human health and diseases through diets. Maternal diets affect maternal and fetal gut microbiome and metabolomics profiles, which consequently regulate the host epigenome, thus contributing to later-life metabolic health in both mother and offspring. This review discusses the current knowledge regarding how epigenetic mechanisms mediate the interaction between maternal bioactive diets, the gut microbiome and the metabolome leading to improved metabolic health in both mother and offspring."

These new insights can then help decipher disease mechanisms more deeply. In this review, we describe the different multi-omics tools and approaches currently available and how they have been applied in AD research so far. We discuss how multi-omics can be used to explore molecular alterations related to core features of the AD pathologies and how they interact with comorbid pathological alterations. We further discuss whether the identified pathophysiological changes are relevant for the clinical manifestation of AD, in terms of both cognitive impairment and neuropsychiatric symptoms, and for clinical disease progression over time. Finally, we address the opportunities for multi-omics approaches to help discover novel biomarkers for diagnosis and monitoring of relevant pathophysiological processes, along with personalised intervention strategies in AD.Copyright © 2022 Clark, Rabl, Dayon and Popp."
"36551792","Sexual Dimorphism in Interstitial Lung Disease.","Biomedicines","Interstitial lung diseases (ILD) are a group of heterogeneous progressive pulmonary disorders, characterised by tissue remodelling and/or fibrotic scarring of the lung parenchyma. ILD patients experience lung function decline with progressive symptoms, poor response to treatment, reduced quality of life and high mortality. ILD can be idiopathic or associated with systemic or connective tissue diseases (CTD) but idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is the most common form. While IPF has a male predominance, women are affected more greatly by CTD and therefore associated ILDs. The mechanisms behind biological sex differences in these progressive lung diseases remain unclear. However, differences in environmental exposures, variable expression of X-chromosome related inflammatory genes and sex hormones play a role. Here, we will outline sex-related differences in the incidence, progression and mechanisms of action of these diseases and discuss existing and novel cellular and pre-clinical studies. Furthermore, we will highlight how sex-differences are not adequately considered in pre-clinical disease models, how gender bias exists in clinical diagnosis and how women are underrepresented in clinical trials. Future action on these observations will hopefully shed light on the role of biological sex in disease development, identify potential targets for intervention and increase female participant numbers in clinical trials."

Active smoking and secondhand (passive) smoke (SHS) are related to lung cancer (LC) risk. Oxidative stress (OS) and/or lipid peroxidation (LP) induced by cigarette smoke (CS) are found to be involved in the pathogenesis of LC. Meta-analyses and other case-control/prospective cohort studies are inconclusive and have yielded inconsistent results concerning the protective role of dietary vitamins C and E, retinol, and iron intake against LC risk in smokers and/or non-smokers. Furthermore, the role of vitamins and minerals as antioxidants with the potential in protecting LC cells against CS-induced OS in smokers and non-smokers has not been fully elucidated. Thus, this review aims to summarize the available evidence reporting the relationships between dietary antioxidant intake and LC risk in smokers and non-smokers that may be used to provide suggestions for future research."
"36575660","Association Between Oral Health and Frailty in Older Korean Population: A Cross-Sectional Study.","Clin Interv Aging","Frailty is closely associated with biological age, concurrent medical conditions, morbidity, and decreased survival. Poor oral health is common in older individuals and is associated with frailty. Considering its potential importance, a study on the association between oral health and frailty is meaningful. Therefore, we aimed to analyze the association between major oral health factors and frailty using nationally representative samples of older adults.This cross-sectional study included 3018 older adults (age ≥ 65 years) from the seventh Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Oral examination results, laboratory data, handgrip strength, life style factors derived from questionnaires, and food intake survey results were analyzed. This study used the deficit accumulation model among the main operational definitions of frailty. We constructed a frailty index based on 36 items and classified participants as non-frail, pre-frail, or frail. Oral health factors included chewing difficulty, number of teeth, periodontal disease, and number of carious teeth. Logistic regression analysis was performed to determine significant factors.A total of 1222 (40.5%), 1014 (33.6%), and 782 (25.9%) individuals were classified as non-frail, pre-frail, and frail, respectively. Chewing difficulty was associated with increased risk of frailty after adjusting for age, sex, socioeconomic factors, and comorbidities (odds ratio 2.68, 95% confidence interval 2.08-3.44). Periodontal disease was positively associated with chewing difficulty (odds ratio 1.29, 95% confidence interval 1.07-1.56), and chewing difficulty decreased as the number of teeth increased (odds ratio 0.97, 95% confidence interval 0.96-0.99).Chewing difficulty was significantly associated with frailty in the older population. Considering the negative effect of chewing difficulty on frailty, more attention should be focused on oral health.© 2022 Kang and Jung."
"36558864","Progress of the COVID-19: Persistence, Effectiveness, and Immune Escape of the Neutralizing Antibody in Convalescent Serum.","Pathogens","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a new coronavirus causing Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), is a major topic of global human health concern. The Delta and Omicron variants have caused alarming responses worldwide due to their high transmission rates and a number of mutations. During a one-year follow-up (from June 2020 to June 2021), we included 114 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection to study the long-term dynamics and the correlative factors of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) in convalescent patients. The blood samples were collected at two detection time points (at 6 and 12 months after discharge). We evaluated the NAbs response of discharged patients by performing a micro-neutralization assay using a SARS-CoV-2 wild type. In addition, a total of 62 serum samples from discharged COVID-19 patients with Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Omicron variants of infection were enrolled to perform cross-neutralization tests using the original SARS-CoV-2 strain and VOCs variants (including Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron variants) and to assess the ability of NAbs against the SARS-CoV-2 variants. NAbs seroconversion occurred in 91.46% of patients (n= 82) in the first timepoint and in 89.29% of patients (n= 84) in the second detection point, and three kinds of NAbs kinetics curves were perceived. The NAbs levels in young patients had higher values than those in elder patients. The kinetics of disease duration was accompanied by an opposite trend in NAbs levels. Despite a declining NAbs response, NAbs activity was still detectable in a substantial proportion of recovered patients one year after discharge. Compared to the wild strain, the Omicron strain could lead to a 23.44-, 3.42-, 8.03-, and 2.57-fold reduction in neutralization capacity in ""SAlpha"", ""SBeta"", ""SDelta"", and ""SOmicron"", respectively, and the NAbs levels against the Omicron strain were significantly lower than those of the Beta and Delta variants. Remarkably, the NAbs activity of convalescent serum with Omicron strain infection was most obviously detectable against six SARS-CoV-2 strains in our study. The role of the vaccination history in NAbs levels further confirmed the previous study that reported vaccine-induced NAbs as the convincing protection mechanism against SARS-CoV-2. In conclusion, our findings highlighted the dynamics of the long-term immune responses after the disappearance of symptoms and revealed that NAbs levels varied among all types of convalescent patients with COVID-19 and that NAbs remained detectable for one year, which is reassuring in terms of protection against reinfection. Moreover, a moderate correlation between the duration of disease and Nabs titers was observed, whereas age was negatively correlated with Nabs titers. On the other hand, compared with other VOCs, the Omicron variant was able to escape the defenses of the immune system more significantly, and the convalescent serum infected with the Omicron variant played a critical part in protection against different SARS-CoV-2 variants. Recovery serum from individuals vaccinated with inactivated vaccine preceding infection with the Omicron strain had a high efficacy against the original strain and the VOCs variants, whereas the convalescent serum of persons vaccinated by inactivated vaccine prior to infection with the Delta variant was only potent against the wild-type strain."

According to studies, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients with COVID-19 usually have a high risk of developing severe symptoms and fatality, but limited research has addressed the poor condition of COPD patients during the pandemic. This review focuses on the underlying risk factors including innate immune dysfunction, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression, smoking status, precocious differentiation of T lymphocytes and immunosenescence in COPD patients which might account for their poor outcomes during the COVID-19 crisis. Furthermore, we highlight the role of aging of the immune system, which may be the culprit of COVID-19. In brief, we list the challenges of COPD patients in this national pandemic, aiming to provide immune-related considerations to support critical processes in COPD patients during severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and inspire immune therapy for these patients."

"36551869","Understanding Long COVID; Mitochondrial Health and Adaptation-Old Pathways, New Problems.","Biomedicines","Many people infected with the SARS-CoV-2 suffer long-term symptoms, such as ""brain fog"", fatigue and clotting problems. Explanations for ""long COVID"" include immune imbalance, incomplete viral clearance and potentially, mitochondrial dysfunction. As conditions with sub-optimal mitochondrial function are associated with initial severity of the disease, their prior health could be key in resistance to long COVID and recovery. The SARs virus redirects host metabolism towards replication; in response, the host can metabolically react to control the virus. Resolution is normally achieved after viral clearance as the initial stress activates a hormetic negative feedback mechanism. It is therefore possible that, in some individuals with prior sub-optimal mitochondrial function, the virus can ""tip"" the host into a chronic inflammatory cycle. This might explain the main symptoms, including platelet dysfunction. Long COVID could thus be described as a virally induced chronic and self-perpetuating metabolically imbalanced non-resolving state characterised by mitochondrial dysfunction, where reactive oxygen species continually drive inflammation and a shift towards glycolysis. This would suggest that a sufferer's metabolism needs to be ""tipped"" back using a stimulus, such as physical activity, calorie restriction, or chemical compounds that mimic these by enhancing mitochondrial function, perhaps in combination with inhibitors that quell the inflammatory response."
"36572864","Comparative epigenomics by machine learning approach for neuroblastoma.","BMC Genomics","Neuroblastoma (NB) is the second most common pediatric solid tumor. Because the number of genetic mutations found in tumors are small, even in some patients with unfavorable NB, epigenetic variation is expected to play an important role in NB progression. DNA methylation is a major epigenetic mechanism, and its relationship with NB prognosis has been a concern. One limitation with the analysis of variation in DNA methylation is the lack of a suitable analytical model. Therefore, in this study, we performed a random forest (RF) analysis of the DNA methylome data of NB from multiple databases.RF is a popular machine learning model owing to its simplicity, intuitiveness, and computational cost. RF analysis identified novel intermediate-risk patient groups with characteristic DNA methylation patterns within the low-risk group. Feature selection analysis based on probe annotation revealed that enhancer-annotated regions had strong predictive power, particularly for MYCN-amplified NBs. We developed a gene-based analytical model to identify candidate genes related to disease progression, such as PRDM8 and FAM13A-AS1. RF analysis revealed sufficient predictive power compared to other machine learning models.RF is a useful tool for DNA methylome analysis in cancer epigenetic studies, and has potential to identify a novel cancer-related genes.© 2022.

We also integrate theoretical syntheses with prior studies into these combined epigenomic and epidemiological results.Cannabis dependence not only recapitulates many of the key features of aging, but is characterized by both age-defining and age-generating illnesses including immunomodulation, hepatic inflammation, many psychiatric syndromes with a neuroinflammatory basis, genotoxicity and epigenotoxicity. DNA breaks, chromosomal breakage-fusion-bridge morphologies and likely cycles, and altered intergenerational DNA methylation and disruption of both the histone and tubulin codes in the context of increased clinical congenital anomalies, cancers and heritable tumors imply widespread disruption of the genome and epigenome. Modern epigenomic clocks indicate that, in cannabis-dependent patients, cannabis advances cellular DNA methylation age by 25-30% at age 30 years. Data have implications not only for somatic but also stem cell and germ line tissues including post-fertilization zygotes. This effect is likely increases with the square of chronological age.Recent epigenomic studies of cannabis exposure provide many explanations for the broad spectrum of cannabis-related teratogenicity and carcinogenicity and appear to account for many epidemiologically observed findings. Further research is indicated on the role of cannabinoids in the aging process both developmentally and longitudinally, from stem cell to germ cell to blastocystoids to embryoid bodies and beyond."
"36568761","Medical education and population health-A framework in the design of a new undergraduate program.","Front Public Health","Health sciences curricular planners are challenged to add new content to established education programs. There is increasing pressure for content in public health, health systems, global health, and planetary health. These important areas often compete for curricular time. What is needed is a convergence model that builds a common framework within which students can integrate areas and better align this knowledge to the individual client or patient who they have responsibility to support. A population health framework is proposed for health sciences education programs that supports a common conceptual understanding of population health. The framework links five thematic areas that have influence on health and wellbeing and a sixth element that defines the range of methodologies essential to understanding health and wellbeing, from the individual to the population. The five areas providing convergence are: (1) the biopsychosocial development of the individual, (2) the socioeconomic factors that influence health and wellbeing, (3) the physical natural and built environment including climate, (4) the continuum of public health and health care systems, and (5) the nation state and global relationships. Using this framework, students are encouraged to think and understand individual health and wellbeing in context to the population and to utilize the appropriate methodological tools to explore these relationships. Planning for a new undergraduate medicine program illustrates the curricular elements that will be used to support student learning with foundation knowledge applied and tracked throughout the program. The proposed framework has application across health sciences disciplines and serves to build a common understanding that supports cross professional communication and collaboration.Copyright © 2022 Armstrong, Mantel, Walraven, Atwoli and Ngugi."
"36566737","Co-exposure to urban particulate matter and aircraft noise adversely impacts the cerebro-pulmonary-cardiovascular axis in mice.","Redox Biol","Worldwide, up to 8.8 million excess deaths/year have been attributed to air pollution, mainly due to the exposure to fine particulate matter (PM). Traffic-related noise is an additional contributor to global mortality and morbidity. Both health risk factors substantially contribute to cardiovascular, metabolic and neuropsychiatric sequelae. Studies on the combined exposure are rare and urgently needed because of frequent co-occurrence of both risk factors in urban and industrial settings. To study the synergistic effects of PM and noise, we used an exposure system equipped with aerosol generator and loud-speakers, where C57BL/6 mice were acutely exposed for 3d to either ambient PM (NIST particles) and/or noise (aircraft landing and take-off events). The combination of both stressors caused endothelial dysfunction, increased blood pressure, oxidative stress and inflammation. An additive impairment of endothelial function was observed in isolated aortic rings and even more pronounced in cerebral and retinal arterioles. The increase in oxidative stress and inflammation markers together with RNA sequencing data indicate that noise particularly affects the brain and PM the lungs. The combination of both stressors has additive adverse effects on the cardiovascular system that are based on PM-induced systemic inflammation and noise-triggered stress hormone signaling. We demonstrate an additive upregulation of ACE-2 in the lung, suggesting that there may be an increased vulnerability to COVID-19 infection. The data warrant further mechanistic studies to characterize the propagation of primary target tissue damage (lung, brain) to remote organs such as aorta and heart by combined noise and PM exposure.Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

"36564402","Germline genetic variation and predicting immune checkpoint inhibitor induced toxicity.","NPJ Genom Med","Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy has revolutionised the treatment of various cancer types. ICIs reinstate T-cell function to elicit an anti-cancer immune response. The resulting immune response can however have off-target effects which manifest as autoimmune type serious immune-related adverse events (irAE) in ~10-55% of patients treated. It is currently challenging to predict both who will experience irAEs and to what severity. Identification of patients at high risk of serious irAE would revolutionise patient care. While the pathogenesis driving irAE development is still unclear, host genetic factors are proposed to be key determinants of these events. This review presents current evidence supporting the role of the host genome in determining risk of irAE. We summarise the spectrum and timing of irAEs following treatment with ICIs and describe currently reported germline genetic variation associated with expression of immuno-modulatory factors within the cancer immunity cycle, development of autoimmune disease and irAE occurrence. We propose that germline genetic determinants of host immune function and autoimmune diseases could also explain risk of irAE development. We also endorse genome-wide association studies of patients being treated with ICIs to identify genetic variants that can be used in polygenic risk scores to predict risk of irAE.© 2022.

Various gene variations were analyzed, including single nucleotide variants (SNV), copy number variation (CNV), tumor mutation burden (TMB), copy number instability (CNI) and mutant-allele tumor heterogeneity (MATH). We also identified genes by which CNV level can differentiate the response to nCT. The Cancer Genome Atlas database and the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium database were used to further evaluate the specific role of therapeutic relevant genes and screen out the key genes in multi-omics levels. After the intersection of the screened genes from differential expression analysis, survival analysis and principal components analysis dimensionality reduction cluster analysis, the key genes were finally identified.The genes CNV level of principal component genes in baseline blood and cancer tissues could significantly distinguish the two groups of patients. The CNV of HSP90AA1, EGFR, SRC, MTOR, etc. were relatively gained in the better group compared with the poor group in baseline blood. The CNI and TMB was significantly different between the two groups. The increased expression of HSP90AA1, EGFR, and SRC was associated with increased sensitivity to multiple chemotherapeutic drugs. The nCT predictive score obtained by therapeutic relevant genes could be a potential prognostic indicator, and the combination with TMB could further refine prognostic prediction for patients. After a series of analysis in multi-omics association database, EGFR and HSP90AA1 with significant differences in multiple aspects were identified as the key predictive genes related to prognosis and the sensitivity of nCT.This work revealed that effective combined application and analysis in multi-omics data are critical to search for predictive biomarkers. The key genes EGFR and HSP90AA1 could serve as an effective biomarker to predict prognose and neoadjuvant chemosensitivity.Copyright © 2022 Jiang, Zhang, Du, Guo, Wang, Li, Deng, Cui and Liu."

This review is for clinical oncologists to explain the concept, the terms used, the pros and cons of ctDNA; thus, the technical aspects of the different platforms are not reviewed in detail, but we try to help in navigating the current knowledge in liquid biopsy. Since the validated and adequately sensitive ctDNA assays have utility in identifying actionable mutations to direct targeted therapy, ctDNA may be used for this soon in routine clinical practice and in other different areas as well. The cfDNA fragments can be obtained by liquid biopsy and can be used for diagnosis, prognosis, and selecting among treatment options in cancer patients. A great proportion of cfDNA comes from normal cells of the body or from food uptake. Only a small part (&lt;1%) of it is related to tumors, originating from primary tumors, metastatic sites, or circulating tumor cells (CTCs). Soon the data obtained from ctDNA may routinely be used for finding minimal residual disease, detecting relapse, and determining the sites of metastases. It might also be used for deciding appropriate therapy, and/or emerging resistance to the therapy and the data analysis of ctDNA may be combined with imaging or other markers. However, to achieve this goal, further clinical validations are inevitable. As a result, clinicians should be aware of the limitations of the assays. Of course, several open questions are still under research and because of it cfDNA and ctDNA testing are not part of routine care yet."

The patients received 2-4 cycles of toripalimab (240 mg q3w) plus carboplatin-based chemotherapy. After the second treatment cycle, all patients were re-evaluated by a multidisciplinary team. Candidates eligible for surgery underwent surgery; otherwise, patients received the remaining treatment cycles. The primary endpoints were safety and major pathological response (MPR). Secondary endpoints were R0 resection rate, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). RNA sequencing of baseline and post-treatment samples was conducted to explore the transcriptomic characteristics of the therapeutic response.In total, 50 eligible patients were enrolled, including 12 (24.0%) with resectable disease (RD) and 38 (76.0%) with potentially resectable disease (PRD). Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were recorded in 48 cases (96.0%). Severe TRAEs occurred in 3 (6.0%) cases, including myelosuppression, drug-induced liver injury and death related to haemoptysis. The objective response rate (ORR) was 76.0%, with 8 (16.0%) patients having a complete response (CR), 30 (60.0%) partial response (PR), 10 (20.0%) stable disease (SD) and 2 (4.0%) progressive disease (PD). Surgery could be achieved in 12 (100%) patients with RD and 25 (65.8%) with PRD; 1 (2.0%) with PRD refused surgery. Therefore, R0 resection was performed for all 36 (100%) patients who underwent surgery; 20 (55.6%) achieved MPR, including 10 (27.8%) with a complete pathological response (pCR). The CHI3L1 (chitinase-3-like protein 1) immunohistochemistry (IHC) expression of baseline tumour samples could predict the therapeutic response (AUC=0.732), OS (P=0.017) and PFS (P=0.001).

However, the functional role of iCAFs in BCa has been poorly studied. In our study, two BCa scRNA-seq datasets (GSE130001 and GSE146137) were obtained and integrated by the Seurat pipeline. Based on reported markers (COL1A1 and PDGFRA), iCAFs were identified and the related signature of 278 markers was developed. Following unsupervised consensus clustering, two molecular subtypes of TCGA-BLCA were identified and characterized by distinct dysregulated cancer hallmarks, immunological tumor microenvironments, prognoses, responses to chemotherapy/immunotherapy, and stemness. Subsequently, the robustness of the signature-based clustering, in terms of prognosis and therapeutic response prediction, was validated in a GEO-meta cohort with seven independent GEO datasets of 519 BCa patients, and three immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-treated cohorts. Considering the heterogeneity, re-clustering of iCAFs was performed and a subpopulation, named ""LOXL2+ iCAFs"", was identified. Co-culture CM derived from LOXL2 overexpression/silencing CAFs with T24 cells revealed that overexpression of LOXL2 in CAFs promoted while silencing LOXL2 inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of T24 cells through IL32. Moreover, the positive correlation between LOXL2 and CD206, an M2 macrophage polarization marker, has been observed and validated. Collectively, integrated single-cell and bulk RNA sequencing analyses revealed an iCAF-related signature that can predict prognosis and response to immunotherapy for BCa. Additionally, the hub gene LOXL2 may serve as a promising target for BCa treatment."

However, achieving increased robustness and reproducibility of results remains a main challenge. Although variability in results may be introduced at various stages, e.g., alignment, summarisation or detection of differential expression, one source of variability was systematically omitted: the sequencing design, which propagates through analyses and may introduce an additional layer of technical variation. We illustrate qualitative and quantitative differences arising from splitting samples across lanes on bulk and single-cell sequencing. For bulk mRNAseq data, we focus on differential expression and enrichment analyses; for bulk ChIPseq data, we investigate the effect on peak calling and the peaks' properties. At the single-cell level, we concentrate on identifying cell subpopulations. We rely on markers used for assigning cell identities; both smartSeq and 10× data are presented. The observed reduction in the number of unique sequenced fragments limits the level of detail on which the different prediction approaches depend. Furthermore, the sequencing stochasticity adds in a weighting bias corroborated with variable sequencing depths and (yet unexplained) sequencing bias. Subsequently, we observe an overall reduction in sequencing complexity and a distortion in the biological signal across technologies, experimental contexts, organisms and tissues."

APOBEC3 activity has been identified in a variety of human cancers. Although its involvement in cancer has been studied widely, its influence on the tumor immune microenvironment remains poorly understood. Therefore, this study aimed to focus on the effect of APOBEC3 on tumor immune microenvironment of KIRC.In this study, we comprehensively analyzed the expression and prognostic significance of the APOBEC3 family in pan-cancer using multiple databases. The functions of key APOBEC3 family members were further investigated in KIRC, with APOBEC3G determined to be a candidate biomarker for unfavorable prognosis. We subsequently explored the correlation of APOBEC3G with the tumor immune environment in KIRC by analyzing the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset, then validated the prognostic significance and PD-L1 correlation of APOBEC3G by using tissue microarrays which included 233 primary tumor samples from patients with renal clear cell carcinoma.The APOBEC3 family was overexpressed in KIRC and high APOBEC3 expression predicted poor prognosis. In addition, APOBEC3G was positively correlated with the expression of immunoinhibitors such as TIGIT, LAG3, CD96, PD-1, and CTLA4. In addition, APOBEC3G had a positive correlation with immunosuppressive cells, including regulatory T cell and myeloid-derived suppressor cell. Finally, based on 233 clinical samples, we validated that high expression of APOBEC3G contributed to a poor prognosis for KIRC patients and the positive relationship between APOBEC3G and PD-L1 expression. High APOBEC3G expression was also found to be more common in patients with sarcomatoid histology (P = 0.0026).Our study showed that APOBEC3G was a prognostic biomarker correlated with the immune response in KIRC. In addition, APOBE3G had a positive correlation with PD-L1 expression and sarcomatoid histology, perhaps suggesting the potential impact of APOBEC3G on immunotherapy.© 2022 The Author(s)."

A social contract between healthcare providers and families advocates for accurate diagnoses and effective interventions to treat diseases and toxic stressors. This bio-social model emphasizes reproductive health of women with trimester-specific maternal and pediatric healthcare interactions. Lifelong neuronal connectivity is more likely established across 80% of brain circuitries during the first 1000 days. Maladaptive gene-environment (G x E) interactions begin before conception later presenting as maternal-placental-fetal (MPF) triad, neonatal, or childhood neurologic disorders. Synergy between obstetrical and pediatric healthcare providers can reduce neurologic morbidities. Partnerships between healthcare providers and families should begin during the first 1000 days to address diseases more effectively to moderate maternal and childhood adverse effects. This bio-social model lowers the incidence and lessens the severity of sequalae such as DD. Access to genetic-metabolomic, neurophysiologic and neuroimaging evaluations enhances clinical decision-making for more effective interventions before full expression of neurologic dysfunction. Diagnostic accuracy facilitates developmental interventions for effective preschool planning. A description of a mother-child pair in a HIC emphasizes the time-sensitive importance for early interventions that influenced brain health throughout childhood. Partnership by her parents with healthcare providers and educators provided effective healthcare and lessened adverse effects. Effective educational interventions were later offered through her high school graduation. Healthcare disparities in LMIC and HICMD require that this bio-social model of care begin before the first 1000 days to effectively treat the most vulnerable women and children. Prioritizing family planning followed by prenatal, neonatal and child healthcare improves wellness and brain health. Familiarity with educational neuroscience for teachers applies neurologic diagnoses for effective individual educational plans. Integrating diversity and inclusion into medical and educational services cross socioeconomic, ethnic, racial, and cultural barriers with life-course benefits. Families require knowledge to recognize risks for their children and motivation to sustain relationships with providers and educators for optimal outcomes. The WHO sustainable development goals promote brain health before conception through the first 1000 days. Improved education, employment, and social engagement for all persons will have intergenerational and transgenerational benefits for communities and nations."
"36551423","Exposure to Antibiotics and Neurodevelopmental Disorders: Could Probiotics Modulate the Gut-Brain Axis?","Antibiotics (Basel)","In order to develop properly, the brain requires the intricate interconnection of genetic factors and pre-and postnatal environmental events. The gut-brain axis has recently raised considerable interest for its involvement in regulating the development and functioning of the brain. Consequently, alterations in the gut microbiota composition, due to antibiotic administration, could favor the onset of neurodevelopmental disorders. Literature data suggest that the modulation of gut microbiota is often altered in individuals affected by neurodevelopmental disorders. It has been shown in animal studies that metabolites released by an imbalanced gut-brain axis, leads to alterations in brain function and deficits in social behavior. Here, we report the potential effects of antibiotic administration, before and after birth, in relation to the risk of developing neurodevelopmental disorders. We also review the potential role of probiotics in treating gastrointestinal disorders associated with gut dysbiosis after antibiotic administration, and their possible effect in ameliorating neurodevelopmental disorder symptoms."

Here, we investigated the effect of a methyl-donor nutrient (MS) supplemented to a high-fat, high-sucrose (HFS) diet during pregnancy and lactation on vitamin D (VD) status and inflammatory response in offspring. After mating, 10-week-old female Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats (n= 10/group) were randomly assigned to one of the four dietary groups during pregnancy and lactation: (1) control diet (CON), (2) CON with MS (CON-MS), (3) HFS, and (4) HFS with MS (HFS-MS). Weanling offspring (three weeks old) were euthanized and sacrificed (n= 8-10/sex/group). The remaining offspring (n= 10/sex/group) were randomly assigned to either a CON or an HFS diet for 12 weeks and sacrificed at 15 weeks of age. Our results indicated that prenatal MS supplementation, but not postnatal diet, restored low vitamin D status and suppressed elevation of proinflammatory cytokine induced by maternal HFS in the offspring. Furthermore, both prenatal and postnatal diets modulated the abundance ofLactobacillusspp. andBacteroidesspp. in the offspring, a shift that was independent of vitamin D status. Collectively, our data support a role for MS in restoring the perturbation of VD status and normalizing maternal HFS-induced inflammation in the offspring. Further investigation is warranted to elucidate the methylation status of VD metabolism-related pathways in the offspring, as well as the immunomodulatory role of vitamin D during the progression of obesity."
"36583014","Benchmarking automated cell type annotation tools for single-cell ATAC-seq data.","Front Genet","As single-cell chromatin accessibility profiling methods advance, scATAC-seq has become ever more important in the study of candidate regulatory genomic regions and their roles underlying developmental, evolutionary, and disease processes. At the same time, cell type annotation is critical in understanding the cellular composition of complex tissues and identifying potential novel cell types. However, most existing methods that can perform automated cell type annotation are designed to transfer labels from an annotated scRNA-seq data set to another scRNA-seq data set, and it is not clear whether these methods are adaptable to annotate scATAC-seq data. Several methods have been recently proposed for label transfer from scRNA-seq data to scATAC-seq data, but there is a lack of benchmarking study on the performance of these methods. Here, we evaluated the performance of five scATAC-seq annotation methods on both their classification accuracy and scalability using publicly available single-cell datasets from mouse and human tissues including brain, lung, kidney, PBMC, and BMMC. Using the BMMC data as basis, we further investigated the performance of these methods across different data sizes, mislabeling rates, sequencing depths and the number of cell types unique to scATAC-seq. Bridge integration, which is the only method that requires additional multimodal data and does not need gene activity calculation, was overall the best method and robust to changes in data size, mislabeling rate and sequencing depth. Conos was the most time and memory efficient method but performed the worst in terms of prediction accuracy. scJoint tended to assign cells to similar cell types and performed relatively poorly for complex datasets with deep annotations but performed better for datasets only with major label annotations. The performance of scGCN and Seurat v3 was moderate, but scGCN was the most time-consuming method and had the most similar performance to random classifiers for cell types unique to scATAC-seq.Copyright © 2022 Wang, Sun and Zhao."
"36578319","Distance covariance entropy reveals primed states and bifurcation dynamics in single-cell RNA-Seq data.","iScience","Cell-fate transitions are fundamental to development and differentiation. Studying them with single-cell omic data is important to advance our understanding of the cell-fate commitment process, yet this remains challenging. Here we present a computational method called DICE, which analyzes the entropy of expression covariation patterns and which is applicable to static and dynamically changing cell populations. Using only single-cell RNA-Seq data, DICE is able to predict multipotent primed states and their regulatory factors, which we subsequently validate with single-cell epigenomic data. DICE reveals that primed states are often defined by epigenetic regulators or pioneer factors alongside lineage-specific transcription factors. In developmental time course single-cell RNA-Seq datasets, DICE can pinpoint the timing of bifurcations more precisely than lineage-trajectory inference algorithms or competing variance-based methods. In summary, by studying the dynamic changes of expression covariation entropy, DICE can help elucidate primed states and bifurcation dynamics without the need for single-cell epigenomic data.© 2022 The Author(s)."

The recognition that oxidative stress (OS) plays a key role in BPD pathogenesis has been widely accepted since at least the 1980s. In this article, we examine the interplay between OS and genetic regulation and review 'omics' data related to OS in BPD. Data from animal models (largely models of hyperoxic lung injury) and from human studies are presented. Epigenetic and transcriptomic analyses have demonstrated several genes related to OS to be differentially expressed in murine models that mimic BPD as well as in premature infants at risk of BPD development and infants with established lung disease. Alterations in the genetic regulation of antioxidant enzymes is a common theme in these studies. Data from metabolomics and proteomics have also demonstrated the potential involvement of OS-related pathways in BPD. A limitation of many studies includes the difficulty of obtaining timely and appropriate samples from human patients. Additional 'omics' studies could further our understanding of the role of OS in BPD pathogenesis, which may prove beneficial for prevention and timely diagnosis, and aid in the development of targeted therapies."

Numerous experimental data accumulated over the past fifty years have brought us closer to understanding the molecular and cell mechanisms responsible for their development. However, these data are not enough for a complete understanding of the genesis of these diseases, nor to suggest treatment methods. It turns out that many cellular pathologies developing during neurodegeneration coincide from disease to disease. These observations give hope to finding a common intracellular target(s) and to offering a universal method of treatment. In this review, we attempt to analyze data on similar cellular disorders among neurodegenerative diseases in general, and polyglutamine neurodegenerative diseases in particular, focusing on the interaction of various proteins involved in the development of neurodegenerative diseases with various cellular organelles. The main purposes of this review are: (1) to outline the spectrum of common intracellular pathologies and to answer the question of whether it is possible to find potential universal target(s) for therapeutic intervention; (2) to identify specific intracellular pathologies and to speculate about a possible general approach for their treatment."

The role of traditional clinicopathological prognostic factors, including classification systems, is also being refined, and several attempts have been made to predict a more accurate prognosis through novel serum biomarkers, genetic factors, and epigenetic factors that have been identified through various state-of-the-art molecular techniques with multiomics sequencing. In this review article, the latest research results including the traditional approach to prognostic factors and recent advanced strategies for risk stratification of pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms based on clinical, pathological, and molecular characteristics are summarized.

"36550951","Enhancing Molecular Testing for Effective Delivery of Actionable Gene Diagnostics.","Bioengineering (Basel)","There is a deep need to navigate within our genomic data to find, understand and pave the way for disease-specific treatments, as the clinical diagnostic journey provides only limited guidance. The human genome is enclosed in every nucleated cell, and yet at the single-cell resolution many unanswered questions remain, as most of the sequencing techniques use a bulk approach. Therefore, heterogeneity, mosaicism and many complex structural variants remain partially uncovered. As a conceptual approach, nanopore-based sequencing holds the promise of being a single-molecule-based, long-read and high-resolution technique, with the ability of uncovering the nucleic acid sequence and methylation almost in real time. A key limiting factor of current clinical genetics is the deciphering of key disease-causing genomic sequences. As the technological revolution is expanding regarding genetic data, the interpretation of genotype-phenotype correlations should be made with fine caution, as more and more evidence points toward the presence of more than one pathogenic variant acting together as a result of intergenic interplay in the background of a certain phenotype observed in a patient. This is in conjunction with the observation that many inheritable disorders manifest in a phenotypic spectrum, even in an intra-familial way. In the present review, we summarized the relevant data on nanopore sequencing regarding clinical genomics as well as highlighted the importance and content of pre-test and post-test genetic counselling, yielding a complex approach to phenotype-driven molecular diagnosis. This should significantly lower the time-to-right diagnosis as well lower the time required to complete a currently incomplete genotype-phenotype axis, which will boost the chance of establishing a new actionable diagnosis followed by therapeutical approach."

Previous studies have proposed controversial theories about whether in situ retinal stem cells (RSCs) are present in adult human eye tissue. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has emerged as one of the most powerful tools to reveal the heterogeneity of tissue cells. By using scRNA-seq, we explored the cell heterogeneity of different subregions of adult human eyes, including pars plicata, pars plana, retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), iris, and neural retina (NR). We identified one subpopulation expressing SRY-box transcription factor 2 (SOX2) as RSCs, which were present in the pars plicata of the adult human eye. Further analysis showed the identified subpopulation of RSCs expressed specific markers aquaporin 1 (AQP1) and tetraspanin 12 (TSPAN12). We, therefore, isolated this subpopulation using these two markers by flow sorting and found that the isolated RSCs could proliferate and differentiate into some retinal cell types, including photoreceptors, neurons, RPE cells, microglia, astrocytes, horizontal cells, bipolar cells, and ganglion cells; whereas, AQP1-TSPAN12-cells did not have this differentiation potential. In conclusion, our results showed that SOX2-positive RSCs are present in the pars plicata and may be valuable for treating human retinal diseases due to their proliferation and differentiation potential.© 2022 The Authors.

"36577373","Secreted phosphoprotein 1 slows neurodegeneration and rescues visual function in mouse models of aging and glaucoma.","Cell Rep","Aging causes an irreversible, cumulative decline in neuronal function. Using the visual system as a model, we show that astrocytes play a critical role in maintaining retinal ganglion cell health and that deletion of SPP1 (secreted phosphoprotein 1, or osteopontin) from astrocytes leads to increased vulnerability of ganglion cells to age, elevated intraocular pressure, and traumatic optic nerve damage. Overexpression of SPP1 slows the age-related decline in ganglion cell numbers and is highly protective of visual function in a mouse model of glaucoma. SPP1 acts by promoting phagocytosis and secretion of neurotrophic factors while inhibiting production of neurotoxic and pro-inflammatory factors. SPP1 up-regulates transcription of genes related to oxidative phosphorylation, functionally enhances mitochondrial respiration, and promotes the integrity of mitochondrial microstructure.

"36558176","Phytochemical Compounds and Nanoparticles as Phytochemical Delivery Systems for Alzheimer's Disease Management.","Molecules","Alzheimer's disease remains one of the most widespread neurodegenerative reasons for dementia worldwide and is associated with considerable mortality and morbidity. Therefore, it has been considered a priority for research. Indeed, several risk factors are involved in the complexity of the therapeutic ways of this pathology, including age, traumatic brain injury, genetics, exposure to aluminum, infections, diabetes, vascular diseases, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obesity. The pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease is mostly associated with hyperphosphorylated protein in the neuronal cytoplasm and extracellular plaques of the insoluble β-amyloid peptide. Therefore, the management of this pathology needs the screening of drugs targeting different pathological levels, such as acetylcholinesterase (AchE), amyloidβformation, and lipoxygenase inhibitors. Among the pharmacological strategies used for the management of Alzheimer's disease, natural drugs are considered a promising therapeutic strategy. Indeed, bioactive compounds isolated from different natural sources exhibit important anti-Alzheimer effects by their effectiveness in promoting neuroplasticity and protecting against neurodegeneration as well as neuroinflammation and oxidative stress in the brain. These effects involve different sub-cellular, cellular, and/or molecular mechanisms, such as the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AchE), the modulation of signaling pathways, and the inhibition of oxidative stress. Moreover, some nanoparticles were recently used as phytochemical delivery systems to improve the effects of phytochemical compounds against Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, the present work aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the key advances concerning nano-drug delivery applications of phytochemicals for Alzheimer's disease management."

In this regard, the exact molecular mechanisms are not well understood. Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common age-related neurodegenerative disease. Emerging evidence supports the hypothesis that PD is the result of complex interactions between genetic abnormalities, environmental toxins, mitochondrial dysfunction, and other cellular processes, such as DNA methylation. In this context, BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) and GDNF (glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor) have a pivotal role because they are both involved in neuron differentiation, survival, and synaptogenesis. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the potential role of two PUFAs, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and their effects on BDNF and GDNF expression in the SH-SY5Y cell line. Cell viability was determined using the MTT assay, and flow cytometry analysis was used to verify the level of apoptosis. Transmission electron microscopy was performed to observe the cell ultrastructure and mitochondria morphology. BDNF and GDNF protein levels and mRNA were assayed by Western blotting and RT-PCR, respectively. Finally, methylated and hydroxymethylated DNA immunoprecipitation were performed in the BDNF and GDNF promoter regions. EPA, but not DHA, is able (i) to reduce the neurotoxic effect of neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) in vitro, (ii) to re-establish mitochondrial function, and (iii) to increase BNDF and GDNF expression via epigenetic mechanisms."

Initial CRISPRi-mediated genetic screens have showcased the potential to address basic questions in cell biology, genetics, and biotechnology, but wider deployment of CRISPRi screening has been constrained by the large size of single guide RNA (sgRNA) libraries and challenges in generating cell models with consistent CRISPRi-mediated knockdown. Here, we present next-generation CRISPRi sgRNA libraries and effector expression constructs that enable strong and consistent knockdown across mammalian cell models. First, we combine empirical sgRNA selection with a dual-sgRNA library design to generate an ultra-compact (1-3 elements per gene), highly active CRISPRi sgRNA library. Next, we compare CRISPRi effectors to show that the recently published Zim3-dCas9 provides an excellent balance between strong on-target knockdown and minimal non-specific effects on cell growth or the transcriptome. Finally, we engineer a suite of cell lines with stable expression of Zim3-dCas9 and robust on-target knockdown.

"36552836","Innate Immune Memory in Monocytes and Macrophages: The Potential Therapeutic Strategies for Atherosclerosis.","Cells","Atherosclerosis is a complex metabolic disease characterized by the dysfunction of lipid metabolism and chronic inflammation in the intimal space of the vessel. As the most abundant innate immune cells, monocyte-derived macrophages play a pivotal role in the inflammatory response, cholesterol metabolism, and foam cell formation. In recent decades, it has been demonstrated that monocytes and macrophages can establish innate immune memory (also termed trained immunity) via endogenous and exogenous atherogenic stimuli and exhibit a long-lasting proinflammatory phenotype. The important cellular metabolism processes, including glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, fatty acid synthesis, and cholesterol synthesis, are reprogrammed. Trained monocytes/macrophages with innate immune memory can be persistently hyperactivated and can undergo extensive epigenetic rewiring, which contributes to the pathophysiological development of atherosclerosis via increased proinflammatory cytokine production and lipid accumulation. Here, we provide an overview of the regulation of cellular metabolic processes and epigenetic modifications of innate immune memory in monocytes/macrophages as well as the potential endogenous and exogenous stimulations involved in the progression of atherosclerosis that have been reported recently. These elucidations might be beneficial for further understanding innate immune memory and the development of therapeutic strategies for inflammatory diseases and atherosclerosis."

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is reported to induce DNA hypermethylation, but whether this prior DNA methylation in DM I/R heart inflicts a beneficial or detrimental effect is not known and is addressed in this study. DM was induced in 6-week-old male Wistar rats with streptozotocin (65 mg/kg b.wt). After 24 weeks on a normal diet, I/R was induced in rat heart using a Langendorff perfusion system and analyzed the myocardium for different parameters to measure hemodynamics, infarct size, DNA methylation and mitochondrial function. Diabetic heart exhibited DNA hypermethylation of 39% compared to the control, along with DNMT expression elevated by 41%. I/R induction in diabetic heart promoted further DNA hypermethylation (24%) with aggravated infarct size (21%) and reduced the cardiac rate pressure product (43%) from I/R heart. Importantly, diabetic I/R hearts also experienced a decline in the mitochondrial copy number (60%); downregulation in the expression of mitochondrial bioenergetics (ND1,ND2,ND3,ND4,ND5,ND6) and mitofusion (MFN1,MFN2) genes and the upregulation of mitophagy (PINK,PARKIN,OPTN) and mitofission (MFF,DNM1,FIS1) genes that reduce the dp/dt contribute to the contractile dysfunction in DM I/R hearts. Besides, a negative correlation was obtained between mitochondrialPGC1α,POLGA,TFAMgenes and DNA hypermethylation in DM I/R hearts. Based on the above data, the elevated global DNA methylation level in diabetic I/R rat hearts deteriorated the mitochondrial function by downregulating the expression ofPOLGA,TFAMandPGC1αgenes and negatively contributed to I/R-associated increased infarct size and altered hemodynamics."

Metabolomics allows the identification of several metabolites and may contribute to clarifying the aging-regulated metabolic pathways. We aimed to investigate aging-related serum metabolic changes using a metabolomics approach. Fasting blood serum samples from 138 apparently healthy individuals (20-70 years old, 56% men) were analyzed by Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy (1H NMR) and Liquid Chromatography-High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry (LC-HRMS), and for clinical markers. Associations of the metabolic profile with age were explored via Correlations (r); Metabolite Set Enrichment Analysis; Multiple Linear Regression; and Aging Metabolism Breakpoint. The age increase was positively correlated (0.212 ≤ r ≤ 0.370,p&lt; 0.05) with the clinical markers (total cholesterol, HDL, LDL, VLDL, triacylglyceride, and glucose levels); negatively correlated (-0.285 ≤ r ≤ -0.214,p&lt; 0.05) with tryptophan, 3-hydroxyisobutyrate, asparagine, isoleucine, leucine, and valine levels, but positively (0.237 ≤ r ≤ 0.269,p&lt; 0.05) with aspartate and ornithine levels. These metabolites resulted in three enriched pathways: valine, leucine, and isoleucine degradation, urea cycle, and ammonia recycling. Additionally, serum metabolic levels of 3-hydroxyisobutyrate, isoleucine, aspartate, and ornithine explained 27.3% of the age variation, with the aging metabolism breakpoint occurring after the third decade of life. These results indicate that the aging process is potentially associated with reduced serum branched-chain amino acid levels (especially after the third decade of life) and progressively increased levels of serum metabolites indicative of the urea cycle."

Secondary outcomes included mechanical ventilation, vasopressor use, sudden cardiac arrest, cardiogenic shock, acute kidney injury requiring hemodialysis, length of stay, health care utilization costs, and disposition. We conducted a secondary analysis with propensity matching to confirm results obtained by traditional multivariate analysis. COVID-19 patients with Myocarditis had significantly higher in-hospital mortality compared to COVID-19 patients without Myocarditis (30.5% vs. 13.1%, adjusted OR: 3 [95% CI 2.1-4.2],p< 0.001). This cohort also had significantly increased cardiogenic shock, acute kidney injury requiring hemodialysis, sudden cardiac death, required more mechanical ventilation and vasopressor support and higher hospitalization cost. Vaccination and more research for treatment strategies will be critical for reducing worse outcomes in patients with COVID-19-related Myocarditis."

We aimed to examine associations between maternal zinc levels during pregnancy and DNA methylation in LINE-1 and Alu repetitive sequences in young adult offspring, as well as anthropometry and cardiometabolic parameters.Participants were 74 pregnant women from the Chiang Mai Low Birth Weight cohort, and their offspring followed up at 20 years of age. Maternal plasma zinc concentrations were measured at approximately 36 weeks of gestation. DNA methylation levels in LINE-1 and Alu repetitive sequences were measured in the offspring, as well as anthropometry and cardiometabolic parameters (lipid profile, blood pressure, and glucose metabolism).Over half of mothers (39/74; 53%) were zinc deficient (<50 μg/dL) during their third trimester of pregnancy. Maternal zinc concentrations during pregnancy were associated with LINE-1 DNA methylation levels in adult offspring. Specifically, lower prenatal zinc concentrations were associated with: 1) lower levels of total LINE-1 methylation; 2) lower levels of LINE-1 hypermethylation loci; and 3) higher levels of LINE-1 partial methylation loci. Prenatal zinc concentrations were not associated with Alu methylation levels, nor with any anthropometric or cardiometabolic parameters in adult offspring. However, we observed associations between Alu and LINE-1 methylation patterns and cardiometabolic outcomes in offspring, namely total cholesterol levels and diastolic blood pressure, respectively.Lower maternal zinc concentrations late in gestation were associated with changes in DNA methylation in later life. Thus, zinc deficiency during pregnancy may induce alterations in total LINE-1 methylation and LINE-1 hypermethylation loci. These results suggest a possible epigenetic link between zinc deficiency during pregnancy and long-term outcomes in the offspring.Copyright: © 2022 Rerkasem et al.

The MR analysis demonstrated evidence of a causal effect of higher BMI on the risk of T2D (odds ratio (OR) > 1.0,p< 0.05). In addition, TG showed a protective effect on the risk of T2D (ORs 0.68-0.85). However, HDL, LDL, and TCHL showed little genetic evidence supporting a causal association between dyslipidemia and T2D. We found strong genetic evidence supporting a causal association of BMI with T2D. Although HDL, LDL, and TCHL did not show a causal association with T2D, TG had a causal relationship with the decrease of T2D. Although it was predicted that TG would be linked to a higher risk of T2D, it actually exhibited a paradoxical protective effect against T2D, which requires further investigation."

Despite this, multi-omics data have rarely been applied to non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) diagnosis. We developed a multi-omics data-affinitive artificial intelligence algorithm based on the graph convolutional network that integrates mRNA expression, DNA methylation, and DNA sequencing data. This NSCLC prediction model achieved a 93.7% macro F1-score, indicating that values for false positives and negatives were substantially low, which is desirable for accurate classification. Gene ontology enrichment and pathway analysis of features revealed that two major subtypes of NSCLC, lung adenocarcinoma and lung squamous cell carcinoma, have both specific and common GO biological processes. Numerous biomarkers (i.e., microRNA, long non-coding RNA, differentially methylated regions) were newly identified, whereas some biomarkers were consistent with previous findings in NSCLC (e.g.,SPRR1B). Thus, using multi-omics data integration, we developed a promising cancer prediction algorithm."
"36582436","Novel biological insights revealed from the investigation of multiscale genome architecture.","Comput Struct Biotechnol J","Gene expression and cell fate determination require precise and coordinated epigenetic regulation. The complex three-dimensional (3D) genome organization plays a critical role in transcription in myriad biological processes. A wide range of architectural features of the 3D genome, including chromatin loops, topologically associated domains (TADs), chromatin compartments, and phase separation, together regulate the chromatin state and transcriptional activity at multiple levels. With the help of 3D genome informatics, recent biochemistry and imaging approaches based on different strategies have revealed functional interactions among biomacromolecules, even at the single-cell level. Here, we review the occurrence, mechanistic basis, and functional implications of dynamic genome organization, and outline recent experimental and computational approaches for profiling multiscale genome architecture to provide robust tools for studying the 3D genome.© 2022 The Authors."
"36556254","The Soluble Folate Receptor in Autism Spectrum Disorder: Relation to Autism Severity and Leucovorin Treatment.","J Pers Med","Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder with life-long consequences that affects up to 1 in 44 children. Treatment with leucovorin (folinic acid), a reduced form of folate, has been shown to improve symptoms in those with ASD and folate pathway abnormalities in controlled clinical trials. Although soluble folate binding proteins (sFBPs) have been observed in the serum of some patients with ASD, the significance of this finding has not been studied. Here, we present a cohort of ASD patients with sFBPs. These patients had severe ASD and were medically complex. Using baseline controlled open-label methodology and standardized assessments, these patients were found to improve in both core and associated ASD symptoms with leucovorin treatment. No adverse effects were related to leucovorin treatment. This is the first report of the sFBPs in ASD. This study complements ongoing controlled clinical trials and suggests that leucovorin may be effective for children with ASD who are positive for sFBPs. Further, sFBPs might be important biomarkers for treatment response to leucovorin in children with ASD. This study paves the way for further controlled studies for patients with sFBPs."
"36568378","Analysis of miRNA rare variants in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and in silico prediction of their biological effects.","Front Genet","Background:Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease affecting upper and/or lower motor neurons and characterized by complex etiology. Familial cases show high genetic heterogeneity and sporadic cases (90%) are associated with several genetic and environmental risk factors. Among the genetic risk factors, the contribution of non-coding elements, such as microRNAs (miRNAs), to ALS disease susceptibility remains largely unexplored.Aim:This work aims to identify rare variants in miRNA genes in sporadic ALS (sALS) patients which may cause a defective miRNA maturation or altered target gene recognition by changing miRNA secondary structure or seed sequence, respectively.Methods:Rare variants located in miRNA loci with a minor allele frequency (MAF) < 0.01 were extracted from whole genome sequencing (WGS) data of 100 sALS patients. The secondary pre-miRNA structures were predicted using MiRVas to evaluate the impact of the variants on RNA folding process. Human TargetScan was used to retrieve all the potential target genes of miRNAs with variants in the seed region. Over Representation Analysis (ORA) was conducted to compare the lists of target genes for the reference and mutated miRNAs in the seed sequence.Results:Our analysis identified 86 rare variants in 77 distinct miRNAs and distributed in different parts of the miRNA precursors. The presence of these variants changed miRNA secondary structures in ∼70% of MiRVas predictions. By focusing on the 6 rare variants mapping within the seed sequence, the predicted target genes increased in number compared to the reference miRNA and included novel targets in a proportion ranging from 30 to 82%. Interestingly, ORA revealed significant changes in gene set enrichment only for mutated miR-509-1 and miR-941-3 for which the Gene Ontology term related to ""nervous system development"" was absent and present, respectively, compared to target lists of the reference miRNA.Conclusion:We here developed a workflow to study miRNA rare variants from WGS data and to predict their biological effects on miRNA folding, maturation and target gene recognition. Although thisin silicoapproach certainly needs functional validationin vitroandin vivo, it may help define the role of miRNA variability in ALS and complex diseases.Copyright © 2022 Brusati, Ratti, Pensato, Peverelli, Gentilini, Dalla Bella, Sorce, Meneri, Gagliardi, Corti, Gellera, Lauria Pinter, Ticozzi and Silani."
"36551685","Tumoricidal, Temozolomide- and Radiation-Sensitizing Effects of K(Ca)3.1 K(+) Channel Targeting In Vitro Are Dependent on Glioma Cell Line and Stem Cell Fraction.","Cancers (Basel)","Reportedly, the intermediate-conductance Ca2+-activated potassium channel KCa3.1 contributes to the invasion of glioma cells into healthy brain tissue and resistance to temozolomide and ionizing radiation. Therefore, KCa3.1 has been proposed as a potential target in glioma therapy. The aim of the present study was to assess the variability of the temozolomide- and radiation-sensitizing effects conferred by the KCa3.1 blocking agent TRAM-34 between five different glioma cell lines grown as differentiated bulk tumor cells or under glioma stem cell-enriching conditions. As a result, cultures grown under stem cell-enriching conditions exhibited indeed higher abundances of mRNAs encoding for stem cell markers compared to differentiated bulk tumor cultures. In addition, stem cell enrichment was paralleled by an increased resistance to ionizing radiation in three out of the five glioma cell lines tested. Finally, TRAM-34 led to inconsistent results regarding its tumoricidal but also temozolomide- and radiation-sensitizing effects, which were dependent on both cell line and culture condition. In conclusion, these findings underscore the importance of testing new drug interventions in multiple cell lines and different culture conditions to partially mimic the in vivo inter- and intra-tumor heterogeneity."
"36552277","A Unified Model of Age-Related Cardiovascular Disease.","Biology (Basel)","Despite progress in biomedical technologies, cardiovascular disease remains the main cause of mortality. This is at least in part because current clinical interventions do not adequately take into account aging as a driver and are hence aimed at suboptimal targets. To achieve progress, consideration needs to be given to the role of cell aging in disease pathogenesis. We propose a model unifying the fundamental processes underlying most age-associated cardiovascular pathologies. According to this model, cell aging, leading to cell senescence, is responsible for tissue changes leading to age-related cardiovascular disease. This process, occurring due to telomerase inactivation and telomere attrition, affects all components of the cardiovascular system, including cardiomyocytes, vascular endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, cardiac fibroblasts, and immune cells. The unified model offers insights into the relationship between upstream risk factors and downstream clinical outcomes and explains why interventions aimed at either of these components have limited success. Potential therapeutic approaches are considered based on this model. Because telomerase activity can prevent and reverse cell senescence, telomerase gene therapy is discussed as a promising intervention. Telomerase gene therapy and similar systems interventions based on the unified model are expected to be transformational in cardiovascular medicine."

The aim of the present study was to validate DNA methylation biomarkers for non-invasive SRM detection and prognosis. The levels of methylated genesTFAP2B,TAC1,PCDH8,ZNF677,FLRT2,andFBN2were evaluated in 165 serial urine samples prospectively collected from 39 patients diagnosed with SRM, specifically renal cell carcinoma (RCC), before and during the AS via quantitative methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. Voided urine samples from 92 asymptomatic volunteers were used as the control. Significantly higher methylatedTFAP2B,TAC1,PCDH8,ZNF677,andFLRT2levels and/or frequencies were detected in SRM patients' urine samples as compared to the control. The highest diagnostic power (AUC = 0.74) was observed for the four biomarkers panel with 92% sensitivity and 52% specificity. MethylatedPCDH8level positively correlated with SRM size at diagnosis, whileTFAP2Bhad the opposite effect and was related to SRM progression. To sum up, SRMs contribute significantly to the amount of methylated DNA detectable in urine, which might be used for very early RCC detection. Moreover,PCDH8andTFAP2Bmethylation have the potential to be prognostic biomarkers for SRMs."

However, the biological pathways underlying these associations are frequently unknown, limiting understanding of these findings and hindering downstream translational efforts such as drug target discovery.To expand our understanding of the underlying biological pathways and mechanisms controlling blood lipid levels, we leverage a large multi-ancestry meta-analysis (N = 1,654,960) of blood lipids to prioritize putative causal genes for 2286 lipid associations using six gene prediction approaches. Using phenome-wide association (PheWAS) scans, we identify relationships of genetically predicted lipid levels to other diseases and conditions. We confirm known pleiotropic associations with cardiovascular phenotypes and determine novel associations, notably with cholelithiasis risk. We perform sex-stratified GWAS meta-analysis of lipid levels and show that 3-5% of autosomal lipid-associated loci demonstrate sex-biased effects. Finally, we report 21 novel lipid loci identified on the X chromosome. Many of the sex-biased autosomal and X chromosome lipid loci show pleiotropic associations with sex hormones, emphasizing the role of hormone regulation in lipid metabolism.Taken together, our findings provide insights into the biological mechanisms through which associated variants lead to altered lipid levels and potentially cardiovascular disease risk.© 2022.

"36570690","The Novel Prognostic Index Model of Combining Circulating Tumor DNA and PINK-E Predicts the Clinical Outcomes for Newly Diagnosed Extranodal NK/T-cell Lymphoma.","Hemasphere","Extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma (ENKTL) is a highly aggressive and heterogeneous disease with poor clinical outcome. Our previous work had demonstrated that circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analyses were feasible in ENKTL, and dynamic tracing of ctDNA could be used to monitor the disease status. However, the prognostic value of ctDNA in ENKTL has not been fully investigated. Patients with newly diagnosed ENKTL from February 2017 to December 2021 (n = 70) were enrolled. The pretreatment ctDNA concentration (hGE/mL) was measured. The prognostic value of ctDNA, international prognostic index (IPI), Korean prognostic index (KPI), PINK-E, and the combination of PINK-E and ctDNA (PINK-EC) were investigated in our cohort. The IPI and PINK-E risk categories had a significant difference in progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) between the low-risk and intermediate-risk groups. The KPI risk category had a difference in PFS and OS between the intermediate-risk and high-risk groups. Furthermore, integrating ctDNA into the PINK-E model could overcome the shortcomings of other prognostic models, which could significantly distinguish the different-risk groups. Overall, our results demonstrated that PINK-EC showed a superior prognostic prediction value and stability compared with IPI, KPI, and PINK-E. The integration of molecular features of the tumor into classic risk categories might better characterize a high-risk group where novel treatment approaches are most needed.Copyright © 2022 the Author(s).
