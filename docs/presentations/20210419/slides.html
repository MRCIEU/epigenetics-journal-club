## Prediction: review of clinical epigenetics

> Epigenetics. 2021 Mar 30;13(1):66.

'Network medicine' is based on molecular perturbations of pathways.

--

> *"The historically limited success in the discovery of epigenetic biomarkers and epi-drugs using a reductionist approach calls for a paradigm shift toward network medicine (NM), which combines big data, advanced bioinformatic tools, network science, systems biology, artificial intelligence, and clinical biometric data to investigate the pathogenesis of complex diseases such as cancer and CVDs."*

--

> *"By its’ very nature, epigenetics is integrative of genetic networks."*
