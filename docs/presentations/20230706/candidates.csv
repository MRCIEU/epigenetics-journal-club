"37407733","Germline pathogenic variants in HNRNPU are associated with alterations in blood methylome.","Eur J Hum Genet","HNRNPU encodes a multifunctional RNA-binding protein that plays critical roles in regulating pre-mRNA splicing, mRNA stability, and translation. Aberrant expression and dysregulation of HNRNPU have been implicated in various human diseases, including cancers and neurological disorders. We applied a next generation sequencing based assay (EPIC-NGS) to investigate genome-wide methylation profiling for >2 M CpGs for 7 individuals with a neurodevelopmental disorder associated with HNRNPU germline pathogenic loss-of-function variants. Compared to healthy individuals, 227 HNRNPU-associated differentially methylated positions were detected. Both hyper- and hypomethylation alterations were identified but the former predominated. The identification of a methylation episignature for HNRNPU-associated neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD) implicates HNPRNPU-related chromatin alterations in the aetiopathogenesis of this disorder and suggests that episignature profiling should have clinical utility as a predictor for the pathogenicity of HNRNPU variants of uncertain significance. The detection of a methylation episignaure for HNRNPU-associated NDD is consistent with a recent report of a methylation episignature for HNRNPK-associated NDD.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37407562","UHRF1 is a mediator of KRAS driven oncogenesis in lung adenocarcinoma.","Nat Commun","KRAS is a frequent driver in lung cancer. To identify KRAS-specific vulnerabilities in lung cancer, we performed RNAi screens in primary spheroids derived from a Kras mutant mouse lung cancer model and discovered an epigenetic regulator Ubiquitin-like containing PHD and RING finger domains 1 (UHRF1). In human lung cancer models UHRF1 knock-out selectively impaired growth and induced apoptosis only in KRAS mutant cells. Genome-wide methylation and gene expression analysis of UHRF1-depleted KRAS mutant cells revealed global DNA hypomethylation leading to upregulation of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs). A focused CRISPR/Cas9 screen validated several of these TSGs as mediators of UHRF1-driven tumorigenesis. In vivo, UHRF1 knock-out inhibited tumor growth of KRAS-driven mouse lung cancer models. Finally, in lung cancer patients high UHRF1 expression is anti-correlated with TSG expression and predicts worse outcomes for patients with KRAS mutant tumors. These results nominate UHRF1 as a KRAS-specific vulnerability and potential target for therapeutic intervention.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37405801","No association between war-related trauma or PTSD symptom severity and epigenome-wide DNA methylation in Burundian refugees.","Eur J Psychotraumatol","Background:War-related trauma is associated with varying posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) prevalence rates in refugees. In PTSD development, differential DNA methylation (DNAm) levels associated with trauma exposure might be involved in risk versus resilience processes. Studies investigating DNAm profiles related to trauma exposure and PTSD among refugees remain sparse.Objective:The present epigenome-wide association study investigated associations between war-related trauma, PTSD, and altered DNAm patterns in Burundian refugee families with 110 children and their 207 female and male caregivers.Method:War-related trauma load and PTSD symptom severity were assessed in structured clinical interviews with standardised instruments. Epigenome-wide DNAm levels were quantified from buccal epithelia using the Illumina EPIC beadchip.Results:Controlling for biological confounders, no significant epigenome-wide DNAm alterations associated with trauma exposure or PTSD were identified in children or caregivers (FDRs > .05). Co-methylated positions derived as modules from weighted gene correlation network analyses were not significantly associated with either war-related trauma experience in children or caregivers or with PTSD.Conclusions:These results do not provide evidence for altered DNAm patterns associated with exposure to war-related trauma or PTSD."

It has been confirmed that tissue-specific differential methylation markers could be used to identify the tissue origins of different body fluids. To select suitable tissue-specific differential methylation markers and establish the efficient typing system which could be applied to the identifications of body fluids in forensic cases involving Chinese Han individuals of young and middle-aged group, a total of 125 body fluids (venous blood, semen, vaginal fluid, saliva, and menstrual blood) were collected from healthy Chinese Han volunteers aged 20-45 years old. After genome-wide explorations of DNA methylation patterns in these five kinds of body fluids based on the Illumina Infinium Methylation EPIC BeadChip, 15 novel body fluid-specific differential CpGs were selected and verified based on the pyrosequencing method. And these identification efficiencies for target body fluids were verified by ROC curves. The pyrosequencing results indicated that the average methylation rates of nine CpGs were consistent with those of DNA methylation chip detection results, and the other five CpGs (except for cg12152558) were still helpful for the tissue origin identifications of target body fluids. Finally, a random forest classification prediction model based on these 14 CpGs was constructed to successfully identify five kinds of body fluids, and the tested accuracy rates all reached 100%.© 2023.

"37404673","New insights on the interplays between m(6)A modifications and microRNA or lncRNA in gastrointestinal cancers.","Front Cell Dev Biol","N6-Methyladenosine (m6A) methylation is one of the most extremely examined RNA modifications. M6A modification evidently impacts cancer development by effecting RNA metabolism. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in multiple essential biological processes by regulating gene expression at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. Accumulated evidences indicated that m6A is involved in regulating the cleavage, stability, structure, transcription, and transport of lncRNAs or miRNAs. Additionally, ncRNAs also play significant roles in modulating m6A levels of malignant cells by participating in the regulation of m6A methyltransferases, the m6A demethylases and the m6A binding proteins. In this review, we systematically summarize the new insight on the interactions between m6A and lncRNAs or miRNAs, as well as their impacts on gastrointestinal cancer progression. Although there are still extensive studies on genome-wide screening of crucial lncRNAs or miRNAs involved in regulating m6A levels of mRNAs and disclosing differences on mechanisms of regulating m6A modification of lncRNAs, miRNAs or mRNAs in cancer cells, we believe that targeting m6A-related lncRNAs and miRNAs may provide novel options for gastrointestinal cancer treatments.Copyright © 2023 Su, Liu, Zhang, Wang, Han, Wang and Yang."

The SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells and 6-OHDA combo is one of the many neurotoxininduced neuronal cell models employed in numerous neuroscience-related research for discovering neuroprotective drug compounds. Emerging studies have reported a significant correlation between PD and epigenetic alterations, particularly DNA methylation. However, the DNA methylation changes of PD-related CpG sites on the 6-OHDA-induced toxicity on human neuronal cells have not yet been reported. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using Infinium Epic beadchip array surveying 850000 CpG sites in differentiated human neuroblastoma cells exposed to 6-OHDA. We identified 236 differentially methylated probes (DMPs) or 163 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in 6-OHDA treated differentiated neuroblastoma cells than the untreated reference group with p<0.01, Δbeta cut-off of 0.1. Among 236 DMPs, hypermethylated DMPs are 110 (47%), whereas 126 (53%) are hypomethylated. Our bioinformatic analysis revealed 3 DMRs that are significantly hypermethylated and associated with neurological disorders, namely AKT1, ITPR1 and GNG7. This preliminary study demonstrates the methylation status of PD-related CpGs in the 6-OHDA-induced toxicity in the differentiated neuroblastoma cells model."

Here, genome-wide identification, classification, conserved motifs, cis-elements, chromosomal locations, evolution and expression patterns of the PtGLK genes in the woody model plant Populus trichocarpa were analyzed in detail. In total, 55 putative PtGLKs (PtGLK1-PtGLK55) were identified and divided into 11 distinct subfamilies according to the gene structure, motif composition and phylogenetic analysis. Synteny analysis showed that 22 orthologous pairs and highly conservation between regions of GLK genes across P. trichocarpa and Arabidopsis were identified. Furthermore, analysis of the duplication events and divergence times provided insight into the evolutionary patterns of GLK genes. The previously published transcriptome data indicated that PtGLK genes exhibited distinct expression patterns in various tissues and different stages. Additionally, several PtGLKs were significantly upregulated under the responses of cold stress, osmotic stress, and methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and gibberellic acid (GA) treatments, implying that they might take part in abiotic stress and phytohormone responses. Overall, our results provide comprehensive information on the PtGLK gene family and elucidate the potential functional characterization of PtGLK genes in P. trichocarpa.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37398583","Large epigenome-wide association study identifies multiple novel differentially methylated CpG sites associated with suicidal thoughts and behaviors in veterans.","Front Psychiatry","The U.S. suicide mortality rate has steadily increased during the past two decades, particularly among military veterans; however, the epigenetic basis of suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STB) remains largely unknown.To address this issue, we conducted an epigenome-wide association study of DNA methylation (DNAm) of peripheral blood samples obtained from 2,712 U.S. military veterans.Three DNAm probes were significantly associated with suicide attempts, surpassing the multiple testing threshold (FDRq-value <0.05), including cg13301722 on chromosome 7, which lies between the genesSLC4A2andCDK5; cg04724646 inPDE3A; and cg04999352 inRARRES3.cg13301722 was also found to be differentially methylated in the cerebral cortex of suicide decedents in a publicly-available dataset (p = 0.03). Trait enrichment analysis revealed that the CpG sites most strongly associated with STB in the present sample were also associated with smoking, alcohol consumption, maternal smoking, and maternal alcohol consumption, whereas pathway enrichment analysis revealed significant associations with circadian rhythm, adherens junction, insulin secretion, and RAP-1 signaling, each of which was recently associated with suicide attempts in a large, independent genome-wide association study of suicide attempts of veterans.Taken together, the present findings suggest thatSLC4A2,CDK5,PDE3A, andRARRES3may play a role in STB. CDK5, a member of the cyclin-dependent kinase family that is highly expressed in the brain and essential for learning and memory, appears to be a particularly promising candidate worthy of future study; however, additional work is still needed to replicate these finding in independent samples.Copyright © 2023 Kimbrel, Garrett, Evans, Mellows, Dennis, Hair, Hauser, the VA Mid-Atlantic MIRECC Workgroup, Ashley-Koch and Beckham."
"37398435","Incomplete Reprogramming of DNA Replication Timing in Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells.","bioRxiv","Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) are a widely used cell system and a foundation for cell therapy. Differences in gene expression, DNA methylation, and chromatin conformation, which have the potential to affect differentiation capacity, have been identified between iPSCs and embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Less is known about whether DNA replication timing - a process linked to both genome regulation and genome stability - is efficiently reprogrammed to the embryonic state. To answer this, we profiled and compared genome-wide replication timing between ESCs, iPSCs, and cells reprogrammed by somatic cell nuclear transfer (NT-ESCs). While NT-ESCs replicated their DNA in a manner indistinguishable from ESCs, a subset of iPSCs exhibit delayed replication at heterochromatic regions containing genes downregulated in iPSC with incompletely reprogrammed DNA methylation. DNA replication delays were not the result of gene expression and DNA methylation aberrations and persisted after differentiating cells to neuronal precursors. Thus, DNA replication timing can be resistant to reprogramming and lead to undesirable phenotypes in iPSCs, establishing it as an important genomic feature to consider when evaluating iPSC lines."

For instance, we and others have reported associations between prenatal paracetamol exposure and offspring DNA methylation (DNAm). Additionally, folic acid (FA) intake during pregnancy has been associated with DNAm in genes linked to developmental abnormalities. In this study, we aimed to: (i) expand on our previous findings showing differential DNAm associated with long-term prenatal paracetamol exposure in offspring with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and (ii) examine if there is an interaction effect of FA and paracetamol on DNAm in children with ADHD. We used data from the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) and the Medical Birth Registry of Norway (MBRN). We did not identify any impact of paracetamol or any interaction effect of paracetamol and FA on cord blood DNAm in children with ADHD. Our results contribute to the growing literature on prenatal pharmacoepigenetics, but should be replicated in other cohorts. Replication of pharmacoepigenetic studies is essential to ensure robust findings and to increase the clinical relevance of such studies.Copyright © 2023 Olstad, Nordeng, Lyle and Gervin."
"37396036","Integrative analysis of DNA methylomes reveals novel cell-free biomarkers in lung adenocarcinoma.","Front Genet","Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, with a low 5-year survival rate due in part to a lack of clinically useful biomarkers. Recent studies have identified DNA methylation changes as potential cancer biomarkers. The present study identified cancer-specific CpG methylation changes by comparing genome-wide methylation data of cfDNA from lung adenocarcinomas (LUAD) patients and healthy donors in the discovery cohort. A total of 725 cell-free CpGs associated with LUAD risk were identified. Then XGBoost algorithm was performed to identify seven CpGs associated with LUAD risk. In the training phase, the 7-CpGs methylation panel was established to classify two different prognostic subgroups and showed a significant association with overall survival (OS) in LUAD patients. We found that the methylation of cg02261780 was negatively correlated with the expression of its representing gene GNA11. The methylation and expression of GNA11 were significantly associated with LAUD prognosis. Based on bisulfite PCR, the methylation levels of five CpGs (cg02261780, cg09595050, cg20193802, cg15309457, and cg05726109) were further validated in tumor tissues and matched non-malignant tissues from 20 LUAD patients. Finally, validation of the seven CpGs with RRBS data of cfDNA methylation was conducted and further proved the reliability of the 7-CpGs methylation panel. In conclusion, our study identified seven novel methylation markers from cfDNA methylation data which may contribute to better prognosis for LUAD patients.Copyright © 2023 Chen, Ma, Lin, Zhu, Bai, Yin, Sun, Mao, Xue and Ma."
"37394940","Rice transformation treatments leave specific epigenome changes beyond tissue culture.","Plant Physiol","During transgenic plant production, tissue culture often carries epigenetic and genetic changes that underlie somaclonal variations, leading to unpredictable phenotypes. Additionally, specific treatments for rice (Oryza sativa) transformation processes may individually or jointly contribute to somaclonal variations, but their specific impacts on rice epigenomes towards transcriptional variations remain unknown. Here, the impact from individual transformation treatments on genome-wide DNA methylation and the transcriptome were examined. In addition to activating stress-responsive genes, individual transformation components targeted different gene expression modules that were enriched in specific functional categories. The transformation treatments strongly impacted DNA methylation and expression; 75% were independent of tissue culture. Furthermore, our genome-wide analysis showed that the transformation treatments consistently resulted in global hypo-CHH methylation enriched at promoters highly associated with downregulation, particularly when the promoters were co-localized with miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements. Our results clearly highlight the specificity of impacts triggered by individual transformation treatments during rice transformation with the potential association between DNA methylation and gene expression. These changes in gene expression and DNA methylation resulting from rice transformation treatments explain a significant portion of somaclonal variations, that is way beyond the tissue culture effect.© American Society of Plant Biologists 2023.

By performing a genome-wide methylation association analysis of whole peripheral blood from 60 Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease (VKH) patients and 60 healthy controls, we depicted the global DNA methylation status of VKH disease. Further pyrosequencing validation in 160 patients and 159 controls identified 3 aberrant CpG sites in HLA gene regions including cg04026937 and cg18052547 (located in HLA-DRB1 region), and cg13778567 (HLA-DQA1). We also identified 9 aberrant CpG sites in non-HLA gene regions including cg13979407, cg21075643, cg24290586, cg10135747 and cg22707857 (BTNL2), cg22155039 (NOTCH4), cg02605387 (TNXB), cg06255004 (AGPAT2) and cg18855195 (RIBC2). Increased mRNA levels of BTNL2, NOTCH4 and TNXB were identified in VKH patients when compared with healthy controls, consistent with the hypomethylated CpG status in these gene regions.

"37393582","Pan-precancer and cancer DNA methylation profiles revealed significant tissue specificity of interrupted biological processes in tumorigenesis.","Epigenetics","DNA methylation (DNAme) alterations are known to initiate from the precancerous stage of tumorigenesis. Herein, we investigated the global and local patterns of DNAme perturbations in tumorigenesis by analysing the genome-wide DNAme profiles of the cervix, colorectum, stomach, prostate, and liver at precancerous and cancer stages. We observed global hypomethylation in tissues of both two stages, except for the cervix, whose global DNAme level in normal tissue was lower than that of the other four tumour types. For alterations shared by both stages, there were common hyper-methylation (sHyperMethyl) and hypo-methylation (sHypoMethyl) changes, of which the latter type was more frequently identified in all tissues. Biological pathways interrupted by sHyperMethyl and sHypoMethyl alterations demonstrated significant tissue specificity. DNAme bidirectional chaos indicated by the enrichment of both sHyperMethyl and sHypoMethyl changes in the same pathway was observed in most tissues and was a common phenomenon, particularly in liver lesions. Moreover, for the same enriched pathways, different tissues may be affected by distinct DNAme types. For the PI3K-Akt signalling pathway, sHyperMethyl enrichment was observed in the prostate dataset, but sHypoMethyl enrichment was observed in the colorectum and liver datasets. Nevertheless, they did not show an increased possibility in survival prediction of patients in comparison with other DNAme types. Additionally, our study demonstrated that gene-body DNAme changes of tumour suppressor genes and oncogenes may persist from precancerous lesions to the tumour. Overall, we demonstrate the tissue specificity and commonality of cross-stage alterations in DNA methylation profiles in multi-tissue tumorigenesis."

Novel DNAm biomarkers were generated with epigenome-wide LMMs, and Sparse Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis applied at pre- (10-16 years), and post-AD-onset time-points.EAA did not differentiate cases from controls during the follow-up time (p > 0.05).

Previous studies have mostly focused on change in DNAm following weight-loss interventions, yet whether DNAm prior to intervention can explain the variability in glycemic outcomes has not been investigated. Here, we aim to examine whether baseline DNAm is differentially associated with glycemic outcomes induced by different types of weight-loss interventions.Participants were 75 adults with severe obesity who underwent non-surgical intensive medical intervention (IMI), adjustable gastric band (BAND) or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) (n = 25 each). Changes in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) were measured at 1-year after intervention. DNAm was quantified by Illumina 450 K arrays in baseline peripheral blood DNA. Epigenome-wide association studies were performed to identify CpG probes that modify the effects of different weight-loss interventions on glycemic outcomes, i.e., changes in FPG and HbA1c, by including an interaction term between types of intervention and DNAm. Models were adjusted for weight loss and baseline clinical factors.Baseline DNAm levels at 3216 and 117 CpGs were differentially associated with changes in FPG and HbA1c, respectively, when comparing RYGB versus IMI. Of these, 79 CpGs were significant for both FPG and HbA1c. The identified genes are enriched in adaptive thermogenesis, temperature homeostasis and regulation of cell population proliferation. Additionally, DNAm at 6 CpGs was differentially associated with changes in HbA1c when comparing RYGB versus BAND.Baseline DNAm is differentially associated with glycemic outcomes in response to different types of weight-loss interventions, independent of weight loss and other clinical factors. Such findings provided initial evidence that baseline DNAm levels may serve as potential biomarkers predictive of differential glycemic outcomes in response to different types of weight-loss interventions.© 2023.

Inference about Causation Through Examination Of Familial Confounding was used to explore the evidence of a causal relationship. Gene expression analysis was further performed to validate the results of differentially methylated genes.We identified 32, 22 and 28 differentially methylated CpG sites (p < 10-5) as well as 20, 17 and eight differentially methylated regions (slk-corrected p < 0.05) significantly associated with BF%, FM and LBM which were annotated to 65 genes, showing partially overlapping. Causal inference demonstrated bidirectional causality between DNA methylation and body composition (p < 0.05). Gene expression analysis revealed significant correlations between expression levels of five differentially methylated genes and body composition (p < 0.05).These DNA methylation signatures will contribute to increased knowledge about the epigenetic basis of body composition and provide new strategies for early prevention and treatment of obesity and its related diseases.© 2023 Stichting European Society for Clinical Investigation Journal Foundation.

It has been proved that BaP reduced genome-wide DNA methylation, and activated proto-oncogene by hypomethylation in the promoter region, but silenced tumor suppressor genes by promoter hypermethylation, resulting in cancer initiation and progression.

"37390920","Identification of Lipoxygenase gene repertoire of Cannabis sativa and functional characterization of CsLOX13 gene.","Plant Sci","Lipoxygenase (LOX) enzymes play a pivotal role in the biosynthesis of oxylipins. The phyto-oxilipins have been implicated in diverse aspects of plant biology, from regulating plant growth and development to providing tolerance against biotic and abiotic stresses. C. sativa is renowned for its bioactive secondary metabolites, namely cannabinoids. LOX route is assumed to be involved in the biosynthesis of hexanoic acid, which is one of the precursors of cannabinoids of C. sativa. For obvious reasons, the LOX gene family deserves thorough investigation in the C. sativa. Genome-wide analysis revealed the presence of 21 LOX genes in C. sativa, which can be further grouped into 13-LOX and 9-LOX depending upon their phylogeny as well as the enzyme activity. The promoter regions of the CsLOX genes were predicted to contain cis-acting elements involved in phytohormones responsiveness and stress response. The qRT-PCR-based expression analysis of 21 LOX genes revealed their differential expression in different plant parts (root, stem, young leaf, mature leaf, sugar leaf, and female flower). The majority of CsLOX genes displayed preferential expression in the female flower, which is the primary site for the biosynthesis of cannabinoids. The highest LOX activity and expression level of a jasmonate marker gene were reported in the female flowers among all the plant parts. Several CsLOX genes were found to be upregulated by MeJA treatment. Based on the transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana and the development of stable Nicotiana tabacum transgenic lines, we demonstrate that CsLOX13 encodes functional lipoxygenase and play an important role in the biosynthesis of oxylipins.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

"37389288","Exploring the crop epigenome: a comparison of DNA methylation profiling techniques.","Front Plant Sci","Epigenetic modifications play a vital role in the preservation of genome integrity and in the regulation of gene expression. DNA methylation, one of the key mechanisms of epigenetic control, impacts growth, development, stress response and adaptability of all organisms, including plants. The detection of DNA methylation marks is crucial for understanding the mechanisms underlying these processes and for developing strategies to improve productivity and stress resistance of crop plants. There are different methods for detecting plant DNA methylation, such as bisulfite sequencing, methylation-sensitive amplified polymorphism, genome-wide DNA methylation analysis, methylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing, reduced representation bisulfite sequencing, MS and immuno-based techniques. These profiling approaches vary in many aspects, including DNA input, resolution, genomic region coverage, and bioinformatics analysis. Selecting an appropriate methylation screening approach requires an understanding of all these techniques. This review provides an overview of DNA methylation profiling methods in crop plants, along with comparisons of the efficacy of these techniques between model and crop plants. The strengths and limitations of each methodological approach are outlined, and the importance of considering both technical and biological factors are highlighted. Additionally, methods for modulating DNA methylation in model and crop species are presented. Overall, this review will assist scientists in making informed decisions when selecting an appropriate DNA methylation profiling method.Copyright © 2023 Agius, Kapazoglou, Avramidou, Baranek, Carneros, Caro, Castiglione, Cicatelli, Radanovic, Ebejer, Gackowski, Guarino, Gulyás, Hidvégi, Hoenicka, Inácio, Johannes, Karalija, Lieberman-Lazarovich, Martinelli, Maury, Mladenov, Morais-Cecílio, Pecinka, Tani, Testillano, Todorov, Valledor and Vassileva."

Symptoms varied from gastrointestinal distress to lethargy, memory loss, inability to concentrate, depression, respiratory, and reproductive problems. The symptoms have persisted for 30 years in those afflicted but the basis of the illness remains largely unknown. Nerve agents and other chemical exposures in the war zone have been implicated but the long-term effects of these acute exposures have left few if any identifiable signatures. The major aim of this study is to elucidate the possible genomic basis for the persistence of symptoms, especially of the neurological and behavioral effects. To address this, we performed a whole genome epigenetic analysis of the proposed cause of GWI, viz., exposure to organophosphate neurotoxicants combined with high circulating glucocorticoids in two inbred mouse strains, C57BL/6J and DBA/2J. The animals received corticosterone in their drinking water for 7 days followed by injection of diisopropylfluorophosphate, a nerve agent surrogate. Six weeks after DFP injection, the animals were euthanized and medial prefrontal cortex harvested for genome-wide DNA methylation analysis using high-throughput sequencing. We observed 67 differentially methylated genes, notably among them,Ttll7, Akr1c14, Slc44a4,andRusc2,all related to different symptoms of GWI. Our results support proof of principle of genetic differences in the chronic effects of GWI-related exposures and may reveal why the disease has persisted in many of the now aging Gulf War veterans.Copyright © 2023 Mozhui, O’Callaghan, Ashbrook, Prins, Zhao, Lu and Jones."

"37388464","Whole-genome DNA methylation profiling reveals epigenetic signatures in developing muscle in Tan and Hu sheep and their offspring.","Front Vet Sci","The Tan sheep is a popular local breed in China because of its tenderness and flavor. The Hu sheep breed is also famous for its high litter size, and its muscle growth rate is faster than that of Tan sheep. However, the epigenetic mechanism behind these muscle-related phenotypes is unknown.In this study, the longissimus dorsi tissue from 18 6 month-old Tan sheep, Hu sheep, and Tan-Hu F2 generation (6 sheep per population) were collected. After genomic DNA extraction, whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) and bioinformatics analysis were performed to construct genome-wide DNA methylome maps for the Tan sheep, Hu sheep and their Tan-Hu F2 generation.Distinct genome-wide DNA methylation patterns were observed between Tan sheep and Hu sheep. Moreover, DNA methylated regions were significantly increased in the skeletal muscle from Tan sheep vs. the F2 generation compared to the Hu sheep vs. F2 generation and the Tan sheep vs. Hu sheep. Compared with Hu sheep, the methylation levels of actin alpha 1 (ACTA1), myosin heavy chain 11 (MYH11), Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WAS), vav guanine nucleotide exchange factor 1 (VAV1), fibronectin 1 (FN1) and Rho-associated protein kinase 2 (ROCK2) genes were markedly distinct in the Tan sheep. Furthermore, Gene Ontology analysis indicated that these genes were involved in myotube differentiation, myotube cell development, smooth muscle cell differentiation and striated muscle cell differentiation.The findings from this study, in addition to data from previous research, demonstrated that theACTA1,MYH11,WAS,VAV1,FN1, andROCK2genes may exert regulatory effects on muscle development.Copyright © 2023 Yue, Wang, Shen, Zhang, Liu, Xiao, Liu, Eer and Zhang."
"37356726","DNA methylation partially mediates antidiabetic effects of metformin on HbA1c levels in individuals with type 2 diabetes.","Diabetes Res Clin Pract","Despite metformin being used as first-line pharmacological therapy for type 2 diabetes, its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We aimed to determine whether metformin altered DNA methylation in newly-diagnosed individuals with type 2 diabetes.We found that metformin therapy is associated with altered methylation of 26 sites in blood from Scandinavian discovery and replication cohorts (FDR < 0.05), using MethylationEPIC arrays. The majority (88%) of these 26 sites were hypermethylated in patients taking metformin for ∼ 3 months compared to controls, who had diabetes but had not taken any diabetes medication. Two of these blood-based methylation markers mirrored the epigenetic pattern in muscle and adipose tissue (FDR < 0.05). Four type 2 diabetes-associated SNPs were annotated to genes with differential methylation between metformin cases and controls, e.g., GRB10, RPTOR, SLC22A18AS and TH2LCRR. Methylation correlated with expression in human islets for two of these genes. Three metformin-associated methylation sites (PKNOX2, WDTC1 and MICB) partially mediate effects of metformin on follow-up HbA1c levels. When combining methylation of these three sites into a score, which was used in a causal mediation analysis, methylation was suggested to mediate up to 32% of metformin's effects on HbA1c.Metformin-associated alterations in DNA methylation partially mediates metformin's antidiabetic effects on HbA1c in newly-diagnosed individuals with type 2 diabetes.Copyright © 2023.

"37386259","The meaning of adaptation in aging: insights from cellular senescence, epigenetic clocks and stem cell alterations.","Nat Aging","With recent rapid progress in research on aging, there is increasing evidence that many features commonly considered to be mechanisms or drivers of aging in fact represent adaptations. Here, we examine several such features, including cellular senescence, epigenetic aging and stem cell alterations. We draw a distinction between the causes and consequences of aging and define short-term consequences as 'responses' and long-term ones as 'adaptations'. We also discuss 'damaging adaptations', which despite having beneficial effects in the short term, lead to exacerbation of the initial insult and acceleration of aging. Features commonly recognized as 'basic mechanisms of the aging process' are critically examined for the possibility of their adaptation-driven emergence from processes such as cell competition and the wound-like features of the aging body. Finally, we speculate on the meaning of these interactions for the aging process and their relevance for the development of antiaging interventions.© 2023. Springer Nature America, Inc."

Epigenetic reprogramming of CSCs has emerged as a promising strategy for inducing the transition from malignancy to benignity. Ubiquitin-like with PHD and ring finger domains 1 (UHRF1) is required for DNA methylation inheritance. Here, we investigated the role and mechanism of UHRF1 in regulating CSC properties and evaluated the impact of UHRF1 targeting on HCC. Hepatocyte-specific Uhrf1 knockout (Uhrf1HKO) strongly suppressed tumor initiation and CSC self-renewal in both diethylnitrosamine (DEN)/CCl4-induced and Myc-transgenic HCC mouse models. Ablation of UHRF1 in human HCC cell lines yielded consistent phenotypes. Integrated RNA-seq and whole genome bisulfite sequencing revealed widespread hypomethylation induced by UHRF1 silencing epigenetically reprogrammed cancer cells toward differentiation and tumor suppression. Mechanistically, UHRF1 deficiency upregulated CEBPA and subsequently inhibited GLI1 and Hedgehog signaling. Administration of hinokitiol, a potential UHRF1 inhibitor, significantly reduced tumor growth and CSC phenotypes in mice with Myc-driven HCC. Of pathophysiological significance, the expression levels of UHRF1, GLI1, and key axis proteins consistently increased in the livers of mice and patients with HCC. These findings highlight the regulatory mechanism of UHRF1 in liver CSCs and have important implications for the development of therapeutic strategies for HCC.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37393564","Biological stability of DNA methylation measurements over varying intervals of time and in the presence of acute stress.","Epigenetics","Identifying factors that influence the stability of DNA methylation measurements across biological replicates is of critical importance in basic and clinical research. Using a within-person between-group experimental design (n = 31, number of observations = 192), we report the stability of biological replicates over a variety of unique temporal scenarios, both in the absence and presence of acute psychosocial stress, and between individuals who have experienced early life adversity (ELA) and non-exposed individuals. We found that varying time intervals, acute stress, and ELA exposure influenced the stability of repeated DNA methylation measurements. In the absence of acute stress, probes were less stable as time passed; however, stress exerted a stabilizing influence on probes over longer time intervals. Compared to non-exposed individuals, ELA-exposed individuals had significantly lower probe stability immediately following acute stress. Additionally, we found that across all scenarios, probes used in most epigenetic-based algorithms for estimating epigenetic age or immune cell proportions had average or below-average stability, except for the Principal Component and DunedinPACE epigenetic ageing clocks, which were enriched for more stable probes. Finally, using highly stable probes in the absence of stress, we identified multiple probes that were hypomethylated in the presence of acute stress, regardless of ELA status. Two hypomethylated probes are located near the transcription start site of the glutathione-disulfide reductase gene (GSR), which has previously been shown to be an integral part of the stress response to environmental toxins. We discuss implications for future studies concerning the reliability and reproducibility of DNA methylation measurements.Abbreviations:DNAm - DNA methylation, CpG - 5'-cytosine-phosphate-guanine-3,' ICC - Interclass correlation coefficient, ELA - Early-life adversity, PBMCs - Peripheral blood mononuclear cells, mQTL - Methylation quantitative trait loci, TSS - Transcription start site, GSR - Glutathione-disulfide reductase gene, TSST - Trier social stress test, PC - Principal component."
"37388735","High DNA methylation age deceleration defines an aggressive phenotype with immunoexclusion environments in endometrial carcinoma.","Front Immunol","Like telomere shortening, global DNA hypomethylation occurs progressively with cellular divisions orin vivoaging and functions as a mitotic clock to restrain malignant transformation/progression. Several DNA-methylation (DNAm) age clocks have been established to precisely predict chronological age using normal tissues, but show DNAm age drift in tumors, which suggests disruption of this mitotic clock during carcinogenesis. Little is known about DNAm age alterations and biological/clinical implications in endometrial cancer (EC). Here we address these issues by analyzing TCGA and GSE67116 cohorts of ECs. Horvath clock analysis of these tumors unexpectedly revealed that almost 90% of them exhibited DNAm age deceleration (DNAmad) compared to patient chronological age. Combined with an additional clock named Phenoage, we identified a subset of tumors (82/429) with high DNAmad (hDNAmad+) as assessed by both clocks. Clinically, hDNAmad+ tumors were associated with advanced diseases and shorter patient survival, compared to hDNAmad- ones. Genetically, hDNAmad+ tumors were characterized by higher copy number alterations (CNAs) whereas lower tumor mutation burden. Functionally, hDNAmad+ tumors were enriched with cell cycle and DNA mismatch repair pathways. Increased PIK3CA alterations and downregulation of SCGB2A1, the inhibitor of PI3K kinase, in hDNAmad+ tumors, might promote tumor growth/proliferation and stemness. In addition, the inactivation of aging drivers/tumor suppressors (TP53, RB1, and CDKN2A) while enhanced telomere maintenance occurred more frequently in hDNAmad+ tumors, which supports sustained tumor growth. Prominently, hDNAmad+ tumors were featured with immunoexclusion microenvironments, accompanied by significantly higher levels of VTCN1 expression while lower PD-L1 and CTLA4 expression, which indicates their poor response to immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-based immunotherapy. We further showed significantly higher levels of DNMT3A and 3B expression in hDNAmad+ than in hDNAmad- tumors. Thus, the tumor suppressive function of aging-like DNA hypomethylation is severely impaired in hDNAmad+ tumors, likely due to enhanced expression of DNMT3A/3B and dysregulated aging regulators. Our findings not only enrich biological knowledge of EC pathogenesis but also help improve EC risk stratification and precision ICI immunotherapy.Copyright © 2023 Hao, Liu, Xiu, Yuan and Xu."
"37400433","Causal associations between cardiorespiratory fitness and type 2 diabetes.","Nat Commun","Higher cardiorespiratory fitness is associated with lower risk of type 2 diabetes. However, the causality of this relationship and the biological mechanisms that underlie it are unclear. Here, we examine genetic determinants of cardiorespiratory fitness in 450k European-ancestry individuals in UK Biobank, by leveraging the genetic overlap between fitness measured by an exercise test and resting heart rate. We identified 160 fitness-associated loci which we validated in an independent cohort, the Fenland study. Gene-based analyses prioritised candidate genes, such as CACNA1C, SCN10A, MYH11 and MYH6, that are enriched in biological processes related to cardiac muscle development and muscle contractility. In a Mendelian Randomisation framework, we demonstrate that higher genetically predicted fitness is causally associated with lower risk of type 2 diabetes independent of adiposity. Integration with proteomic data identified N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide, hepatocyte growth factor-like protein and sex hormone-binding globulin as potential mediators of this relationship. Collectively, our findings provide insights into the biological mechanisms underpinning cardiorespiratory fitness and highlight the importance of improving fitness for diabetes prevention.© 2023.

We apply Huatuo to generate a comprehensive cell type-specific genetic variation landscape across human tissues and further evaluate their potential roles in complex diseases and traits. Finally, we show that Huatuo's inferences permit prioritizations of driver cell types associated with complex traits and diseases and allow for systematic insights into the mechanisms of phenotype-causal genetic variation.© 2023.

"37386106","Patterns of item nonresponse behaviour to survey questionnaires are systematic and associated with genetic loci.","Nat Hum Behav","Response to survey questionnaires is vital for social and behavioural research, and most analyses assume full and accurate response by participants. However, nonresponse is common and impedes proper interpretation and generalizability of results. We examined item nonresponse behaviour across 109 questionnaire items in the UK Biobank (N = 360,628). Phenotypic factor scores for two participant-selected nonresponse answers, 'Prefer not to answer' (PNA) and 'I don't know' (IDK), each predicted participant nonresponse in follow-up surveys (incremental pseudo-R2 = 0.056), even when controlling for education and self-reported health (incremental pseudo-R2 = 0.046). After performing genome-wide association studies of our factors, PNA and IDK were highly genetically correlated with one another (rg = 0.73 (s.e. = 0.03)) and with education (rg,PNA = -0.51 (s.e. = 0.03); rg,IDK = -0.38 (s.e. = 0.02)), health (rg,PNA = 0.51 (s.e. = 0.03); rg,IDK = 0.49 (s.e. = 0.02)) and income (rg,PNA = -0.57 (s.e. = 0.04); rg,IDK = -0.46 (s.e. = 0.02)), with additional unique genetic associations observed for both PNA and IDK (P < 5 × 10-8). We discuss how these associations may bias studies of traits correlated with item nonresponse and demonstrate how this bias may substantially affect genome-wide association studies. While the UK Biobank data are deidentified, we further protected participant privacy by avoiding exploring non-response behaviour to single questions, assuring that no information can be used to associate results with any particular respondents.© 2023.

Here, to provide insight into the potential mechanisms involved in progression, we conducted a genome-wide association study of the age-related MS severity score in 12,584 cases and replicated our findings in a further 9,805 cases. We identified a significant association with rs10191329 in the DYSF-ZNF638 locus, the risk allele of which is associated with a shortening in the median time to requiring a walking aid of a median of 3.7 years in homozygous carriers and with increased brainstem and cortical pathology in brain tissue. We also identified suggestive association with rs149097173 in the DNM3-PIGC locus and significant heritability enrichment in CNS tissues. Mendelian randomization analyses suggested a potential protective role for higher educational attainment. In contrast to immune-driven susceptibility3, these findings suggest a key role for CNS resilience and potentially neurocognitive reserve in determining outcome in MS.© 2023.

We identified 21 TAAD risk loci, 17 of which have not been previously reported. We leverage multiple downstream analytic methods to identify causal TAAD risk genes and cell types and provide human genetic evidence that TAAD is a non-atherosclerotic aortic disorder distinct from other forms of vascular disease. Our results demonstrate that the genetic architecture of TAAD mirrors that of other complex traits and that it is not solely inherited through protein-altering variants of large effect size.© 2023.

"37380974","Chronic social defeat alters brain vascular-associated cell gene expression patterns leading to vascular dysfunction and immune system activation.","J Neuroinflammation","Brain vascular integrity is critical for brain health, and its disruption is implicated in many brain pathologies, including psychiatric disorders. Brain-vascular barriers are a complex cellular landscape composed of endothelial, glial, mural, and immune cells. Yet currently, little is known about these brain vascular-associated cells (BVACs) in health and disease. Previously, we demonstrated that 14 days of chronic social defeat (CSD), a mouse paradigm that produces anxiety and depressive-like behaviors, causes cerebrovascular damage in the form of scattered microbleeds. Here, we developed a technique to isolate barrier-related cells from the mouse brain and subjected the isolated cells to single-cell RNA sequencing. Using this isolation technique, we found an enrichment in BVAC populations, including distinct subsets of endothelial and microglial cells. In CSD compared to non-stress, home-cage control, differential gene expression patterns disclosed biological pathways involving vascular dysfunction, vascular healing, and immune system activation. Overall, our work demonstrates a unique technique to study BVAC populations from fresh brain tissue and suggests that neurovascular dysfunction is a key driver of psychosocial stress-induced brain pathology.© 2023.

A control group of participants of African ancestry who did not use heroin was recruited and matched to heroin users on sex, age, socioeconomic level, and smoking status. Methylation data were assessed in an epigenetic clock to determined and compare Epigenetic Age to Chronological Age (i.e., age acceleration or deceleration). Data were obtained from 32 controls [mean age 36.3 (±7.5) years] and 64 heroin users [mean age 48.1 (±6.6) years]. The experimental group used heroin for an average of 18.1 (±10.6) years, reported use of 6.4 (±6.1) bags of heroin/day, with a mean DAST-10 score of 7.0 (±2.6) and ASI Score of 0.33 (±0.19).

A previous meta-analysis found that PPD prevalence varies widely across countries. One potential underexplored contributor to this cross-national variation in PPD is diet, which contributes to mental health and varies significantly around the world. Here, we sought to update the global and national estimates of PPD prevalence using systematic review and meta-analysis. Further, we examined whether cross-national variation in PPD prevalence is associated with cross-national variation in diet using meta-regression.To estimate national rates of PPD prevalence, we conducted an updated systematic review of all papers reporting PPD prevalence using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale between 2016-2021 and combined our findings with a previous meta-analysis of articles published between 1985-2015. PPD prevalence and methods were extracted from each study. Random effects meta-analysis was used to estimate global and national PPD prevalence. To examine dietary predictors, we extracted data on sugar-sweetened beverage, fruit, vegetable, total fiber, yogurt, and seafood consumption from the Global Dietary Database. Random effects meta-regression was used to test whether between-country and within-country variation in dietary factors predicted variation in PPD prevalence, controlling for economic and methodological variables.412 studies of 792,055 women from 46 countries were identified. The global pooled prevalence of PPD was 19.18% (95% confidence interval: 18.02 to 20.34%), ranging from 3% in Singapore to 44% in South Africa. Countries that consumed more sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) had higher rates of PPD (Coef. = 0.325,p= 0.044, CI:0.010-0.680); Moreover, in years when higher rates of sugar-sweetened beverages were consumed in a country, there were correspondingly higher rates of PPD in that country (Coef. = 0.129,p= 0.026, CI: 0.016-0.242).The global prevalence of PPD is greater than previous calculations, and drastically varies by country. Sugar-sweetened beverage consumption explained some of the national variation in PPD prevalence.Copyright © 2023 Fish-Williamson and Hahn-Holbrook."

It is known that activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) are the primary producers of extracellular matrix (ECM) in the liver, and the Wnt/β-catenin pathway participates in the activation of HSCs. We aimed to explore whether PPD inhibits liver fibrosis is associated with the Wnt/β-catenin pathway inactivation.The anti-fibrotic roles of PPD were examined bothin vitroandin vivo.We also examined the levels of Wnt inhibitory factor 1 (WIF1), DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) and WIF1 methylation.PPD obviously ameliorated liver fibrosis in carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-treated mice and reduced collagen deposition. PPD also suppressed the activation and proliferation of primary HSCs. Notably, PPD inhibited the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, reduced TCF activity, and increasedP-β-catenin and GSK-3β levels. Interestingly, WIF1 was found to mediate the inactivation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in PPD-treated HSCs. WIF1 silencing suppressed the inhibitory effects of PPD on HSC activation and also restored α-SMA and type I collagen levels. The downregulation of WIF1 expression was associated with the methylation of its promoter. PPD induced WIF1 demethylation and restored WIF1 expression. Further experiments confirmed that DNMT1 overexpression blocked the effects of PPD on WIF1 expression and demethylation and enhanced HSC activation.PPD up-regulates WIF1 levels and impairs Wnt/β-catenin pathway activation via the down-regulation of DNMT1-mediated WIF1 methylation, leading to HSC inactivation. Therefore, PPD may be a promising therapeutic drug for patients with liver fibrosis.© 2022 The Korean Society of Ginseng. Publishing services by Elsevier B.V."

High Sugar Diet (HSD) induction of obesity in flies has been associated with fly hyperosmolarity and glucotoxicity, while High Fat Diet (HFD) induction has been associated with lipotoxicity. The objective of this study was to assess for a healthy obesity phenotype by comparison of fly survival, physio-chemical and biochemical changes associated with HSD, HFD and Protein Restricted Diet (PRD) obesity induction models of maleDrosophila melanogaster. Here, we provide information on a PRD as the plausible option in obesity research not involving cancer, diabetes, glucotoxicity and lipotoxicity studies.Obesity was induced by exposingDrosophila melanogasterwhite mutantw1118to four experimental diets for four weeks. Group 1 was fed regular food (control), group 2 was fed a 0.5% less yeast than in regular feed (PRD), group 3 was fed a 30% w/v sucrose to regular cornmeal food (HSD) and group 4 was fed a 10% w/v food-grade coconut oil to regular cornmeal food (HFD). Peristaltic waves were measured on 3rd instar larvae of all experimental groups. Negative geotaxis, fly survival, body mass, catalase activity, triglycerides (TG/TP), sterol, and total protein were measured in adultDrosophila melanogasterafter four weeks.Triglycerides (TG/TP) and total protein levels were significantly higher in HSD phenotype. Sterols were higher in HFD phenotype. Though catalase enzyme activity was highest in PRD phenotype, this activity was not statistically significant when compared to that of HSD and HFD phenotypes. However, PRD phenotype had the lowest mass, highest survival rate and the highest negative geotaxis, thus demonstrating a balanced, stable and more viable metabolic status in the experimental model.A protein restricted diet induces a stable increased fat storage phenotype inDrosophila melanogaster.© 2023 The Authors."

Here, we perform high-resolution comparisons of mutational landscapes between lymphoblastoid cell lines, chronic lymphocytic leukemia tumors, and three colon adenocarcinoma cell lines, including two with mismatch repair deficiency. Using cell-type-matched replication timing profiles, we demonstrate that mutation rates exhibit heterogeneous replication timing associations among cell types. This cell-type heterogeneity extends to the underlying mutational pathways, as mutational signatures show inconsistent replication timing bias between cell types. Moreover, replicative strand asymmetries exhibit similar cell-type specificity, albeit with different relationships to replication timing than mutation rates. Overall, we reveal an underappreciated complexity and cell-type specificity of mutational pathways and their relationship to replication timing.© 2023 The Author(s)."
"37388907","The landscape of somatic mutations in lymphoblastoid cell lines.","Cell Genom","Somatic mutations have important biological ramifications while exerting substantial rate, type, and genomic location heterogeneity. Yet, their sporadic occurrence makes them difficult to study at scale and across individuals. Lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs), a model system for human population and functional genomics, harbor large numbers of somatic mutations and have been extensively genotyped. By comparing 1,662 LCLs, we report that the mutational landscape of the genome varies across individuals in terms of the number of mutations, their genomic locations, and their spectra; this variation may itself be modulated by somatictrans-acting mutations. Mutations attributed to the translesion DNA polymerase η follow two different modes of formation, with one mode accounting for the hypermutability of the inactive X chromosome. Nonetheless, the distribution of mutations along the inactive X chromosome appears to follow an epigenetic memory of the active form.© 2023 The Author(s)."

However, to understand the etiology of cancer signatures, they need to be compared with experimental signatures, which are obtained from the isogenic cell lines or organisms under controlled conditions.

Here we design and test ~200,000 RfxCas13d guide RNAs targeting essential genes in human cells with systematically designed mismatches and insertions and deletions (indels). We find that mismatches and indels have a position- and context-dependent impact on Cas13d activity, and mismatches that result in G-U wobble pairings are better tolerated than other single-base mismatches. Using this large-scale dataset, we train a convolutional neural network that we term targeted inhibition of gene expression via gRNA design (TIGER) to predict efficacy from guide sequence and context. TIGER outperforms the existing models at predicting on-target and off-target activity on our dataset and published datasets. We show that TIGER scoring combined with specific mismatches yields the first general framework to modulate transcript expression, enabling the use of RNA-targeting CRISPRs to precisely control gene dosage.© 2023.

(total sample size over 2.8 million; 296 loci replicated at P < 0.05, 240 after Bonferroni correction). Leveraging multiomics datasets, we identified many potential druggable genes, including neuro-protection targets likely to act via the optic nerve, a key advance for glaucoma because all existing drugs only target intraocular pressure. We further used Mendelian randomization and genetic correlation-based approaches to identify novel links to other complex traits, including immune-related diseases such as multiple sclerosis and systemic lupus erythematosus.© 2023.

"37369724","Integrating GWAS and proteome data to identify novel drug targets for MU.","Sci Rep","Mouth ulcers have been associated with numerous loci in genome wide association studies (GWAS). Nonetheless, it remains unclear what mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of mouth ulcers at these loci, as well as what the most effective ulcer drugs are. Thus, we aimed to screen hub genes responsible for mouth ulcer pathogenesis. We conducted an imputed/in-silico proteome-wide association study to discover candidate genes that impact the development of mouth ulcers and affect the expression and concentration of associated proteins in the bloodstream. The integrative analysis revealed that 35 genes play a significant role in the development of mouth ulcers, both in terms of their protein and transcriptional levels. Following this analysis, the researchers identified 6 key genes, namely BTN3A3, IL12B, BPI, FAM213A, PLXNB2, and IL22RA2, which were related to the onset of mouth ulcers. By combining with multidimensional data, six genes were found to correlate with mouth ulcer pathogenesis, which can be useful for further biological and therapeutic research.© 2023. The Author(s)."

With the application of techniques as ChIP-seq and Hi-C, the annotations of cis-regulatory elements in the pig genome have been established, which offers a new opportunity to elucidate the genetic mechanisms and identify major genetic variants and candidate genes that are significantly associated with important economic traits. Among these traits, loin muscle depth (LMD) is an important one as it impacts the lean meat content. In this study, we integrated cis-regulatory elements and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to identify candidate genes and genetic variants regulating LMD.Five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located on porcine chromosome 17 were significantly associated with LMD in Yorkshire pigs. A 10 kb quantitative trait locus (QTL) was identified as a candidate functional genomic region through the integration of linkage disequilibrium and linkage analysis (LDLA) and high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) analysis. The BMP2 gene was identified as a candidate gene for LMD based on the integrated results of GWAS, Hi-C meta-analysis, and cis-regulatory element data. The identified QTL region was further verified through target region sequencing. Furthermore, through using dual-luciferase assays and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA), two SNPs, including SNP rs321846600, located in the enhancer region, and SNP rs1111440035, located in the promoter region, were identified as candidate SNPs that may be functionally related to the LMD.Based on the results of GWAS, Hi-C, and cis-regulatory elements, the BMP2 gene was identified as an important candidate gene regulating variation in LMD. The SNPs rs321846600 and rs1111440035 were identified as candidate SNPs that are functionally related to the LMD of Yorkshire pigs. Our results shed light on the advantages of integrating GWAS with 3D epigenomics in identifying candidate genes for quantitative traits. This study is a pioneering work for the identification of candidate genes and related genetic variants regulating one key production trait (LMD) in pigs by integrating genome-wide association studies and 3D epigenomics.Copyright: © 2023 Miao et al.

A growing body of GWAS focuses on quantitative and transdiagnostic phenotypic targets, such as symptom severity or biological markers, to enhance gene discovery and the translational utility of genetic findings. The current review discusses such phenotypic approaches in GWAS across major psychiatric disorders. We identify themes and recommendations that emerge from the literature to date, including issues of sample size, reliability, convergent validity, sources of phenotypic information, phenotypes based on biological and behavioral markers such as neuroimaging and chronotype, and longitudinal phenotypes. We also discuss insights from multi-trait methods such as genomic structural equation modelling. These provide insight into how hierarchical 'splitting' and 'lumping' approaches can be applied to both diagnostic and dimensional phenotypes to model clinical heterogeneity and comorbidity. Overall, dimensional and transdiagnostic phenotypes have enhanced gene discovery in many psychiatric conditions and promises to yield fruitful GWAS targets in the years to come.© 2023.

"37208114","The relationship between cannabis use, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder: a genetically informed study.","Lancet Psychiatry","The relationship between psychotic disorders and cannabis use is heavily debated. Shared underlying genetic risk is one potential explanation. We investigated the genetic association between psychotic disorders (schizophrenia and bipolar disorder) and cannabis phenotypes (lifetime cannabis use and cannabis use disorder).We used genome-wide association summary statistics from individuals with European ancestry from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, UK Biobank, and International Cannabis Consortium. We estimated heritability, polygenicity, and discoverability of each phenotype. We performed genome-wide and local genetic correlations. Shared loci were identified and mapped to genes, which were tested for functional enrichment. Shared genetic liabilities to psychotic disorders and cannabis phenotypes were explored using causal analyses and polygenic scores, using the Norwegian Thematically Organized Psychosis cohort.Psychotic disorders were more heritable than cannabis phenotypes and more polygenic than cannabis use disorder. We observed positive genome-wide genetic correlations between psychotic disorders and cannabis phenotypes (range 0·22-0·35) with a mixture of positive and negative local genetic correlations. Three to 27 shared loci were identified for the psychotic disorder and cannabis phenotype pairs. Enrichment of mapped genes implicated neuronal and olfactory cells as well as drug-gene targets for nicotine, alcohol, and duloxetine. Psychotic disorders showed a causal effect on cannabis phenotypes, and lifetime cannabis use had a causal effect on bipolar disorder. Of 2181 European participants from the Norwegian Thematically Organized Psychosis cohort applied in polygenic risk score analyses, 1060 (48·6%) were females and 1121 (51·4%) were males (mean age 33·1 years [SD 11·8]). 400 participants had bipolar disorder, 697 had schizophrenia, and 1044 were healthy controls. Within this sample, polygenic scores for cannabis phenotypes predicted psychotic disorders independently and improved prediction beyond the polygenic score for the psychotic disorders.A subgroup of individuals might have a high genetic risk of developing a psychotic disorder and using cannabis. This finding supports public health efforts to reduce cannabis use, particularly in individuals at high risk or patients with psychotic disorders. Identified shared loci and their functional implications could facilitate development of novel treatments.US National Institutes of Health, the Research Council Norway, the South-East Regional Health Authority, Stiftelsen Kristian Gerhard Jebsen, EEA-RO-NO-2018-0535, European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme, the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions, and University of Oslo Life Science.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

"37197974","Genetic and epidemiological analyses of infection load and its relationship with psychiatric disorders.","Epidemiol Infect","Severe infections and psychiatric disorders have a large impact on both society and the individual. Studies investigating these conditions and the links between them are therefore important. Most past studies have focused on binary phenotypes of particular infections or overall infection, thereby losing some information regarding susceptibility to infection as reflected in the number of specific infection types, or sites, which we term infection load. In this study we found that infection load was associated with increased risk for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, bipolar disorder, depression, schizophrenia and overall psychiatric diagnosis. We obtained a modest but significant heritability for infection load (h2= 0.0221), and a high degree of genetic correlation between it and overall psychiatric diagnosis (rg= 0.4298). We also found evidence supporting a genetic causality for overall infection on overall psychiatric diagnosis. Our genome-wide association study for infection load identified 138 suggestive associations. Our study provides further evidence for genetic links between susceptibility to infection and psychiatric disorders, and suggests that a higher infection load may have a cumulative association with psychiatric disorders, beyond what has been described for individual infections."

GCTs represent 2-5% of ovarian cancers, with a yearly incidence of 4:100,000, and they usually affect young women and adolescents. Precursory germ cells of the ovary form the basis of GCT. They are histologically classified into primitive GCT, teratomas, and monodermal and somatic-type tumours associated with dermoid cysts. A primitive GCT can be either a yolk sac tumour (YST), dysgerminoma, or mixed germ cell neoplasm. Teratomas are either mature (benign) or immature (malignant). Given that malignant GCTs occur rarely compared to epithelial ovarian tumours (EOC), greater focus is required in their diagnosis and treatment. In this article, we review the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and molecular biology, along with the management and therapeutic challenges."

Apart from drug repurposing in cancer treatments, cardiovascular pharmacology is another attractive field for this approach. Patients with angina pectoris without obstructive coronary artery disease (ANOCA) report refractory angina despite standard medications in up to 40% of cases. Drug repurposing also appears to be an auspicious option for this indication. From a pathophysiological point of view ANOCA patients frequently suffer from vasomotor disorders such as coronary spasm and/or impaired microvascular vasodilatation. Consequently, we carefully screened the literature and identified two potential therapeutic targets: the blockade of the endothelin-1 (ET-1) receptor and the stimulation of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC). Genetically increased endothelin expression results in elevated levels of ET-1, justifying ET-1 receptor blockers as drug candidates to treat coronary spasm. sGC stimulators may be beneficial as they stimulate the NO-sGC-cGMP pathway leading to GMP-mediated vasodilatation.© 2023 McChord, Pereyra, Froebel, Bekeredjian, Schwab and Ong."
"37387160","Supervised biological network alignment with graph neural networks.","Bioinformatics","Despite the advances in sequencing technology, massive proteins with known sequences remain functionally unannotated. Biological network alignment (NA), which aims to find the node correspondence between species' protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks, has been a popular strategy to uncover missing annotations by transferring functional knowledge across species. Traditional NA methods assumed that topologically similar proteins in PPIs are functionally similar. However, it was recently reported that functionally unrelated proteins can be as topologically similar as functionally related pairs, and a new data-driven or supervised NA paradigm has been proposed, which uses protein function data to discern which topological features correspond to functional relatedness.Here, we propose GraNA, a deep learning framework for the supervised NA paradigm for the pairwise NA problem. Employing graph neural networks, GraNA utilizes within-network interactions and across-network anchor links for learning protein representations and predicting functional correspondence between across-species proteins. A major strength of GraNA is its flexibility to integrate multi-faceted non-functional relationship data, such as sequence similarity and ortholog relationships, as anchor links to guide the mapping of functionally related proteins across species. Evaluating GraNA on a benchmark dataset composed of several NA tasks between different pairs of species, we observed that GraNA accurately predicted the functional relatedness of proteins and robustly transferred functional annotations across species, outperforming a number of existing NA methods. When applied to a case study on a humanized yeast network, GraNA also successfully discovered functionally replaceable human-yeast protein pairs that were documented in previous studies.The code of GraNA is available at https://github.com/luo-group/GraNA.© The Author(s) 2023.

Insufficient information exists to interpret the effects of most variants, limiting opportunities for precision medicine and comprehension of genome function. A solution lies in experimental assessment of the functional effect of variants, which can reveal their biological and clinical impact. However, variant effect assays have generally been undertaken reactively for individual variants only after and, in most cases long after, their first observation. Now, multiplexed assays of variant effect can characterise massive numbers of variants simultaneously, yielding variant effect maps that reveal the function of every possible single nucleotide change in a gene or regulatory element. Generating maps for every protein encoding gene and regulatory element in the human genome would create an 'Atlas' of variant effect maps and transform our understanding of genetics and usher in a new era of nucleotide-resolution functional knowledge of the genome. An Atlas would reveal the fundamental biology of the human genome, inform human evolution, empower the development and use of therapeutics and maximize the utility of genomics for diagnosing and treating disease.

"37388821","Cardiovascular disease biomarkers derived from circulating cell-free DNA methylation.","NAR Genom Bioinform","Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) remains a major cause of worldwide mortality. The syndrome occurs when blood flow to the heart muscle is decreased or blocked, causing muscle tissues to die or malfunction. There are three main types of ACS: Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, ST-elevation myocardial infarction, and unstable angina. The treatment depends on the type of ACS, and this is decided by a combination of clinical findings, such as electrocardiogram and plasma biomarkers. Circulating cell-free DNA (ccfDNA) is proposed as an additional marker for ACS since the damaged tissues can release DNA to the bloodstream. We used ccfDNA methylation profiles for differentiating between the ACS types and provided computational tools to repeat similar analysis for other diseases. We leveraged cell type specificity of DNA methylation to deconvolute the ccfDNA cell types of origin and to find methylation-based biomarkers that stratify patients. We identified hundreds of methylation markers associated with ACS types and validated them in an independent cohort. Many such markers were associated with genes involved in cardiovascular conditions and inflammation. ccfDNA methylation showed promise as a non-invasive diagnostic for acute coronary events. These methods are not limited to acute events, and may be used for chronic cardiovascular diseases as well.© The Author(s) 2023.

Conventional genome browsers display data/annotations on a single reference genome/assembly; there are also genomic alignment viewer/browsers that help users visualize alignment, mismatch, and rearrangement between syntenic regions. However, there is a growing need for a comparative epigenome browser that can display genomic and epigenomic data sets across different species and enable users to compare them between syntenic regions. Here, we present the WashU Comparative Epigenome Browser. It allows users to load functional genomic data sets/annotations mapped to different genomes and display them over syntenic regions simultaneously. The browser also displays genetic differences between the genomes from single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) to structural variants (SVs) to visualize the association between epigenomic differences and genetic differences. Instead of anchoring all data sets to the reference genome coordinates, it creates independent coordinates of different genome assemblies to faithfully present features and data mapped to different genomes. It uses a simple, intuitive genome-align track to illustrate the syntenic relationship between different species. It extends the widely used WashU Epigenome Browser infrastructure and can be expanded to support multiple species. This new browser function will greatly facilitate comparative genomic/epigenomic research, as well as support the recent growing needs to directly compare and benchmark the T2T CHM13 assembly and other human genome assemblies.© 2023 Zhuo et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press."

This inflammatory response was associated with beta-cell dysfunction and glucose intolerance. So far, it remains unclear whether gut inflammatory changes upon oral air pollution exposure are causally linked to the development of diabetes. Hence, our aim was to assess the role of immune cells in mediating glucose intolerance instigated by orally administered air pollutants.To assess immune-mediated mechanisms underlying air pollution-induced glucose intolerance, we administered diesel exhaust particles (DEP; NIST 1650b, 12 µg five days/week) or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) via gavage for up to 10 months to wild-type mice and mice with genetic or pharmacological depletion of innate or adaptive immune cells. We performed unbiased RNA-sequencing of intestinal macrophages to elucidate signaling pathways that could be pharmacologically targeted and applied an in vitro approach to confirm these pathways.Oral exposure to air pollution particles induced an interferon and inflammatory signature in colon macrophages together with a decrease of CCR2-anti-inflammatory/resident macrophages. Depletion of macrophages, NLRP3 or IL-1β protected mice from air pollution-induced glucose intolerance. On the contrary, Rag2-/- mice lacking adaptive immune cells developed pronounced gut inflammation and glucose intolerance upon oral DEP exposure.In mice, oral exposure to air pollution particles triggers an immune-mediated response in intestinal macrophages that contributes to the development of a diabetes-like phenotype. These findings point towards new pharmacologic targets in diabetes instigated by air pollution particles.© 2023. The Author(s)."

The pathogenic mechanisms underlying these diseases are not fully understood. However, a central feature consists of regional aggregation of proteins in the brain, such as the accumulation of β-amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD), inclusions of hyperphosphorylated microtubule-binding tau in AD and other tauopathies, or inclusions containing α-synuclein in Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and multiple system atrophy (MSA). Various pathogenic mechanisms are thought to contribute to disease, and an increasing number of studies implicate dysfunction of oligodendrocytes (the myelin producing cells of the central nervous system) and myelin loss. Aberrant DNA methylation, the most widely studied epigenetic modification, has been associated with many neurodegenerative diseases, including AD, PD, DLB and MSA, and recent findings highlight aberrant DNA methylation in oligodendrocyte/myelin-related genes. Here we briefly review the evidence showing that changes to oligodendrocytes and myelin are key in neurodegeneration, and explore the relevance of DNA methylation in oligodendrocyte (dys)function. As DNA methylation is reversible, elucidating its involvement in pathogenic mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases and in dysfunction of specific cell-types such as oligodendrocytes may bring opportunities for therapeutic interventions for these diseases.© 2023.

"37398566","Recent insights into autophagy and metals/nanoparticles exposure.","Toxicol Res","Some anthropogenic pollutants, such as heavy metals and nanoparticles (NPs), are widely distributed and a major threat to environmental safety and public health. In particular, lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), arsenic (As), and mercury (Hg) have systemic toxicity even at extremely low concentrations, so they are listed as priority metals in relation to their significant public health burden. Aluminum (Al) is also toxic to multiple organs and is linked to Alzheimer's disease. As the utilization of many metal nanoparticles (MNPs) gradually gain traction in industrial and medical applications, they are increasingly being investigated to address potential toxicity by impairing certain biological barriers. The dominant toxic mechanism of these metals and MNPs is the induction of oxidative stress, which subsequently triggers lipid peroxidation, protein modification, and DNA damage. Notably, a growing body of research has revealed the linkage between dysregulated autophagy and some diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases and cancers. Among them, some metals or metal mixtures can act as environmental stimuli and disturb basal autophagic activity, which has an underlying adverse health effect. Some studies also revealed that specific autophagy inhibitors or activators could modify the abnormal autophagic flux attributed to continuous exposure to metals. In this review, we have gathered recent data about the contribution of the autophagy/mitophagy mediated toxic effects and focused on the involvement of some key regulatory factors of autophagic signaling during exposure to selected metals, metal mixtures, as well as MNPs in the real world. Besides this, we summarized the potential significance of interactions between autophagy and excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated oxidative damage in the regulation of cell survival response to metals/NPs. A critical view is given on the application of autophagy activators/inhibitors to modulate the systematic toxicity of various metals/MNPs.© The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Korean Society of Toxicology 2023.

Immunologically, dendritic cells (DCs) are the key players in linking innate and adaptive immune responses. Their distinct and optimized differentiation and maturation phases play a critical role in presenting antigens and mounting effective lymphocyte responses for long-term immunity. Despite their importance, no studies to date have effectively investigated the effects of microgravity on DCs in their native microenvironment, which is primarily located within tissues. Here, we address a significantly outstanding research gap by examining the effects of simulated microgravity via a random positioning machine on both immature and mature DCs cultured in biomimetic collagen hydrogels, a surrogate for tissue matrices. Furthermore, we explored the effects of loose and dense tissues via differences in collagen concentration. Under these various environmental conditions, the DC phenotype was characterized using surface markers, cytokines, function, and transcriptomic profiles. Our data indicate that aged or loose tissue and exposure to RPM-induced simulated microgravity both independently alter the immunogenicity of immature and mature DCs. Interestingly, cells cultured in denser matrices experience fewer effects of simulated microgravity at the transcriptome level. Our findings are a step forward to better facilitate healthier future space travel and enhance our understanding of the aging immune system on Earth.© 2023. The Author(s)."

This makes it difficult to study the combined long-term effects of space stressors such as radiation and microgravity. In particular, exposure to microgravity and cosmic radiation may produce changes in the performance of the immune system at the cellular and molecular levels and in the major physiological systems of the body. Consequently, abnormal immune responses induced in the space environment may have serious health consequences, especially in future long-term space missions. In particular, radiation-induced immune effects pose significant health challenges for long-duration space exploration missions with potential risks to reduce the organism's ability to respond to injuries, infections, and vaccines, and predispose astronauts to the onset of chronic diseases (e.g., immunosuppression, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, gut dysbiosis).

The mechanisms by which fusion proteins contribute to oncogenesis are largely unknown, and effective therapies for fusion-associated cancers are lacking. Here we comprehensively scrutinized fusion proteins found in various cancers. We found that many fusion proteins are composed of phase separation-prone domains (PSs) and DNA-binding domains (DBDs), and these fusions have strong correlations with aberrant gene expression patterns. Furthermore, we established a high-throughput screening method, named DropScan, to screen drugs capable of modulating aberrant condensates. One of the drugs identified via DropScan, LY2835219, effectively dissolved condensates in reporter cell lines expressing Ewing sarcoma fusions and partially rescued the abnormal expression of target genes. Our results indicate that aberrant phase separation is likely a common mechanism for these PS-DBD fusion-related cancers and suggest that modulating aberrant phase separation is a potential route to treat these diseases.© 2023.

The expression level of miR663AHG was positively correlated with the level of miR663a (r = 0.179, P = 0.015) and significantly downregulated in colon cancer tissues relative to paired normal tissues from 119 patients (P < 0.008). Colon cancers with low miR663AHG expression were associated with advanced pTNM stage (P = 0.021), lymph metastasis (P = 0.041), and shorter overall survival (hazard ratio = 2.026; P = 0.021). Experimentally, miR663AHG inhibited colon cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. The growth of xenografts from RKO cells overexpressing miR663AHG was slower than that of xenografts from vector control cells in BALB/c nude mice (P = 0.007). Interestingly, either RNA-interfering or resveratrol-inducing expression changes of miR663AHG or miR663a can trigger negative feedback regulation of transcription of the MIR663AHG gene. Mechanistically, miR663AHG could bind to miR663a and its precursor pre-miR663a, and prevent the degradation of miR663a target mRNAs. Disruption of the negative feedback by knockout of the MIR663AHG promoter, exon-1, and pri-miR663A-coding sequence entirely blocked these effects of miR663AHG, which was restored in cells transfected with miR663a expression vector in rescue experiment. In conclusion, miR663AHG functions as a tumor suppressor that inhibits the development of colon cancer through its cis-binding to miR663a/pre-miR663a. The cross talk between miR663AHG and miR663a expression may play dominant roles in maintaining the functions of miR663AHG in colon cancer development.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37380628","A landscape of response to drug combinations in non-small cell lung cancer.","Nat Commun","Combination of anti-cancer drugs is broadly seen as way to overcome the often-limited efficacy of single agents. The design and testing of combinations are however very challenging. Here we present a uniquely large dataset screening over 5000 targeted agent combinations across 81 non-small cell lung cancer cell lines. Our analysis reveals a profound heterogeneity of response across the tumor models. Notably, combinations very rarely result in a strong gain in efficacy over the range of response observable with single agents. Importantly, gain of activity over single agents is more often seen when co-targeting functionally proximal genes, offering a strategy for designing more efficient combinations. Because combinatorial effect is strongly context specific, tumor specificity should be achievable. The resource provided, together with an additional validation screen sheds light on major challenges and opportunities in building efficacious combinations against cancer and provides an opportunity for training computational models for synergy prediction.© 2023.

The outcome of MDS is poor, so alternative therapeutic approaches are needed to improve survival. The inhibition of the DNA damage response pathway, including poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1), has been approved to treat several cancers. In addition, WEE1, a nuclear kinase, is overexpressed in many cancers. Therefore, a WEE1 inhibitor combined with a PARP-1 inhibitor could inhibit the proliferation of MDS and AML.We analyzed whether WEE1 was regulated in the progression of MDS and AML. We also evaluated the efficacy of MK-1775 (WEE1 inhibitor) and talazoparib (PARP-1 inhibitor).PARP-1 expression was higher in the AML cells than in the MDS cells. However, WEE1 expression remained unchanged. MK-1775 or talazoparib alone inhibited MDS and AML cells after 72 h, and cellular cytotoxicity and caspase 3/7 activity were increased. The combined use of MK-1775 and talazoparib produced superior efficacy than either drug alone and SKM-1 colony formation was reduced. Significant cell populations in the sub-G1 phase were found in the cell-cycle analyses. Additionally, γ-H2AX expression and caspase 3 activity were increased. The combined treatment also changed the mitochondrial membrane potential.The combination of a WEE1 inhibitor and PARP-1 inhibitor had enhanced efficacy and is proposed as a new therapeutic option for patients with MDS or AML. Our findings have clinical implications for a potential novel therapeutic strategy for MDS and AML patients.© 2023. The Author(s)."

In this study, we sought to explore the effects of hyperglycemia on human pancreatic islet (HPI) gene expression by exposing HPIs from two donors to low (2.8mM) and high (15.0mM) glucose concentrations over 24 hours, assaying the transcriptome at seven time points using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). We modeled time as both a discrete and continuous variable to determine momentary and longitudinal changes in transcription associated with islet time in culture or glucose exposure. Across all cell types, we identified 1,528 genes associated with time, 1,185 genes associated with glucose exposure, and 845 genes associated with interaction effects between time and glucose. We clustered differentially expressed genes across cell types and found 347 modules of genes with similar expression patterns across time and glucose conditions, including two beta cell modules enriched in genes associated with T2D. Finally, by integrating genomic features from this study and genetic summary statistics for T2D and related traits, we nominate 374 candidate effector genes that may underlie genetic associations for T2D and related traits."

However, present approaches are unable to integrate diverse data sets from various biological conditions effectively because of the confounding effects of biological and technical differences. We introduce single-cell integration (scInt), an integration method based on accurate, robust cell-cell similarity construction and unified contrastive biological variation learning from multiple scRNA-seq data sets. scInt provides a flexible and effective approach to transfer knowledge from the already integrated reference to the query. We show that scInt outperforms 10 other cutting-edge approaches using both simulated and real data sets, particularly in the case of complex experimental designs. Application of scInt to mouse developing tracheal epithelial data shows its ability to integrate development trajectories from different developmental stages. Furthermore, scInt successfully identifies functionally distinct condition-specific cell subpopulations in single-cell heterogeneous samples from a variety of biological conditions.© 2023 Zhou et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press."
"37381037","Exploratory analysis of L1 retrotransposons expression in autismï»¿.","Mol Autism","Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a set of highly heterogeneous neurodevelopmental diseases whose genetic etiology is not completely understood. Several investigations have relied on transcriptome analysis from peripheral tissues to dissect ASD into homogenous molecular phenotypes. Recently, analysis of changes in gene expression from postmortem brain tissues has identified sets of genes that are involved in pathways previously associated with ASD etiology. In addition to protein-coding transcripts, the human transcriptome is composed by a large set of non-coding RNAs and transposable elements (TEs). Advancements in sequencing technologies have proven that TEs can be transcribed in a regulated fashion, and their dysregulation might have a role in brain diseases.We exploited published datasets comprising RNA-seq data from (1) postmortem brain of ASD subjects, (2) in vitro cell cultures where ten different ASD-relevant genes were knocked out and (3) blood of discordant siblings. We measured the expression levels of evolutionarily young full-length transposable L1 elements and characterized the genomic location of deregulated L1s assessing their potential impact on the transcription of ASD-relevant genes. We analyzed every sample independently, avoiding to pool together the disease subjects to unmask the heterogeneity of the molecular phenotypes.We detected a strong upregulation of intronic full-length L1s in a subset of postmortem brain samples and in in vitro differentiated neurons from iPSC knocked out for ATRX. L1 upregulation correlated with an high number of deregulated genes and retained introns. In the anterior cingulate cortex of one subject, a small number of significantly upregulated L1s overlapped with ASD-relevant genes that were significantly downregulated, suggesting the possible existence of a negative effect of L1 transcription on host transcripts.Our analyses must be considered exploratory and will need to be validated in bigger cohorts. The main limitation is given by the small sample size and by the lack of replicates for postmortem brain samples. Measuring the transcription of locus-specific TEs is complicated by the repetitive nature of their sequence, which reduces the accuracy in mapping sequencing reads to the correct genomic locus.L1 upregulation in ASD appears to be limited to a subset of subjects that are also characterized by a general deregulation of the expression of canonical genes and an increase in intron retention. In some samples from the anterior cingulate cortex, L1s upregulation seems to directly impair the expression of some ASD-relevant genes by a still unknown mechanism. L1s upregulation may therefore identify a group of ASD subjects with common molecular features and helps stratifying individuals for novel strategies of therapeutic intervention.© 2023.

"37308292","Characterizing the targets of transcription regulators by aggregating ChIP-seq and perturbation expression data sets.","Genome Res","Mapping the gene targets of chromatin-associated transcription regulators (TRs) is a major goal of genomics research. ChIP-seq of TRs and experiments that perturb a TR and measure the differential abundance of gene transcripts are a primary means by which direct relationships are tested on a genomic scale. It has been reported that there is a poor overlap in the evidence across gene regulation strategies, emphasizing the need for integrating results from multiple experiments. Although research consortia interested in gene regulation have produced a valuable trove of high-quality data, there is an even greater volume of TR-specific data throughout the literature. In this study, we show a workflow for the identification, uniform processing, and aggregation of ChIP-seq and TR perturbation experiments for the ultimate purpose of ranking human and mouse TR-target interactions. Focusing on an initial set of eight regulators (ASCL1, HES1, MECP2, MEF2C, NEUROD1, PAX6, RUNX1, and TCF4), we identified 497 experiments suitable for analysis. We used this corpus to examine data concordance, to identify systematic patterns of the two data types, and to identify putative orthologous interactions between human and mouse. We build upon commonly used strategies to forward a procedure for aggregating and combining these two genomic methodologies, assessing these rankings against independent literature-curated evidence. Beyond a framework extensible to other TRs, our work also provides empirically ranked TR-target listings, as well as transparent experiment-level gene summaries for community use.© 2023 Morin et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press."

The use of omics methods in prevention and cessation studies are intended to identify new biomarkers for risk, compared risks related to other products and never use, and compliance for cessation and reinitation. to assess the relative effects of tobacco products to each other. They are important for the prediction of reinitiation of tobacco use and relapse prevention. In the research setting, both technical and clinical validation is required, which presents a number of complexities in the omics methodologies from biospecimen collection and sample preparation to data collection and analysis. When the results identify differences in omics features, networks or pathways, it is unclear if the results are toxic effects, a healthy response to a toxic exposure or neither. The use of surrogate biospecimens (e.g., urine, blood, sputum or nasal) may or may not reflect target organs such as the lung or bladder. This review describes the approaches for the use of omics in tobacco research and provides examples of prior studies, along with the strengths and limitations of the various methods. To date, there is little consistency in results, likely due to small number of studies, limitations in study size, the variability in the analytic platforms and bioinformatic pipelines, differences in biospecimen collection and/or human subject study design. Given the demonstrated value for the use of omics in clinical medicine, it is anticipated that the use in tobacco research will be similarly productive."

These predispositions may be programmed by fetal DNA methylation (DNAm) changes that persist postnatally. However, although some studies have associated fetal exposure to gestational hyperglycemia with DNAm variations at birth, and metabolic phenotypes in childhood, no study has yet examined how maternal hyperglycemia during pregnancy may be associated with offspring DNAm from birth to five years of age.Maternal hyperglycemia is associated with variation in offspring DNAm from birth to 5 years of age.We estimated maternal hyperglycemia using the area under the curve for glucose (AUCglu) following an oral glucose tolerance test conducted at 24-30 weeks of pregnancy. We quantified DNAm levels in cord blood (n = 440) and peripheral blood at five years of age (n = 293) using the Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip (Illumina). Our total sample included 539 unique dyads (mother-child) with 194 dyads having DNAm at both time-points. We first regressed DNAm M-values against the cell types and child age for each time-point separately to account for the difference by time of measurement for these variables. We then used a random intercept model from the linear mixed model (LMM) framework to assess the longitudinal association between maternal AUCglu and the repeated measures of residuals of DNAm. We adjusted for the following covariates as fixed effects in the random intercept model: maternal age, gravidity, smoking status, child sex, maternal body mass index (BMI) (measured at first trimester of pregnancy), and a binary variable for time-point.In utero exposure to higher maternal AUCgluwas associated with lower offspring blood DNAm levels at cg00967989 located in FSD1L gene (β = - 0.0267, P = 2.13 × 10-8) in adjusted linear regression mixed models. Our study also reports other CpG sites for which DNAm levels were suggestively associated (P < 1.0 × 10-5) with in utero exposure to gestational hyperglycemia.

In the present study, we aimed to identify an EMT-related lncRNA signature and evaluate its prognostic value in EC. We obtained the expression profile of lncRNAs and clinical information of patients with endometrioid EC from The Cancer Genome Atlas database (N = 401). We identified a signature of 5 EMT-related lncRNAs and calculated the risk score of each patient. Next, we validated the independence of the prognostic value of the EMT-related lncRNA signature. Furthermore, we performed Gene Set Enrichment Analysis to identify potential molecular function and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways related to the EMT-related lncRNA signature. Tumor microenvironment analysis and immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) response prediction were also assessed. Survival analysis revealed that the high-risk group, based on the EMT-related lncRNA signature, had a poorer prognosis than the low-risk group in the training, testing, and entire sets. The predictive value of the EMT-related lncRNA signature was independent of age, The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage, tumor grade, and body mass index. Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curves also demonstrate the prognostic accuracy of this risk model. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis showed that cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, and IL-17 signaling pathway were significantly enriched. Furthermore, tumor microenvironment analysis indicated a significant negative correlation between the immune score and EMT-related lncRNA signature risks core, while the low-risk group was more likely to respond to ICB therapy than the high-risk group. A reliable EMT-related lncRNA signature of endometrioid EC was identified that could be utilized as an independent prognostic biomarker to predict patient survival outcomes and provide references for the option of ICB therapy.Copyright © 2023 the Author(s).

"37386280","Identification of hypoxia-related genes and exploration of their relationship with immune cells in ischemic stroke.","Sci Rep","Ischemic stroke (IS) is a major threat to human health, and it is the second leading cause of long-term disability and death in the world. Impaired cerebral perfusion leads to acute hypoxia and glucose deficiency, which in turn induces a stroke cascade response that ultimately leads to cell death. Screening and identifying hypoxia-related genes (HRGs) and therapeutic targets is important for neuroprotection before and during brain recanalization to protect against injury and extend the time window to further improve functional outcomes before pharmacological and mechanical thrombolysis. First, we downloaded the GSE16561 and GSE58294 datasets from the NCBI GEO database. Bioinformatics analysis of the GSE16561 dataset using the limma package identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in ischemic stroke using adj. p. values < 0.05 and a fold change of 0.5 as thresholds. The Molecular Signature database and Genecards database were pooled to obtain hypoxia-related genes. 19 HRGs associated with ischemic stroke were obtained after taking the intersection. LASSO regression and multivariate logistic regression were applied to identify critical biomarkers with independent diagnostic values. ROC curves were constructed to validate their diagnostic efficacy. We used CIBERSORT to analyze the differences in the immune microenvironment between IS patients and controls. Finally, we investigated the correlation between HRGs and infiltrating immune cells to understand molecular immune mechanisms better. Our study analyzed the role of HRGs in ischemic stroke. Nineteen hypoxia-related genes were obtained. Enrichment analysis showed that 19 HRGs were involved in response to hypoxia, HIF-1 signaling pathway, autophagy, autophagy of mitochondrion, and AMPK signaling pathway. Because of the good diagnostic properties of SLC2A3, we further investigated the function of SLC2A3 and found that it is closely related to immunity. We have also explored the relevance of other critical genes to immune cells. Our findings suggest that hypoxia-related genes play a crucial role in the diversity and complexity of the IS immune microenvironment. Exploring the association between hypoxia-related critical genes and immune cells provides innovative insights into the therapeutic targets for ischemic stroke.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Cases were divided into low-risk (LR) and high-risk (HR) groups based on the risk score of the model, and differences in immune gene sets and pathways between these two groups were compared. Finally, a ceRNA network was constructed by integrating long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), DEMs, and DEGs.A diagnostic model containing 15 apoptosis-related genes was developed and its diagnostic efficiency was found to be robust. The HR group was correlated with higher immune scores of chemokines, cytokines, and interleukins; it was also significantly involved in pathways such as pancreatic beta cells and early estrogen response.

Differentially expressed ZNF protein genes (DE-ZNFs) in PAAD and normal control tissues were screened using the ""lemma"" package in R. An optimal risk model and an independent prognostic value were established by univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. Survival analyses were performed to assess the prognostic ability of the model.Results:We constructed a ZNF family genes-related risk score model that is based on the 10 DE-ZNFs (ZNF185, PRKCI, RTP4, SERTAD2, DEF8, ZMAT1, SP110, U2AF1L4, CXXC1, and RMND5B). The risk score was found to be a significant independent prognostic factor for PAAD patients. Seven significantly differentially expressed immune cells were identified between the high- and low-risk patients. Then, based on the prognostic genes, we constructed a ceRNA regulatory network that includes 5 prognostic genes, 7 miRNAs and 35 lncRNAs. Expression analysis showed ZNF185, PRKCI and RTP4 were significantly upregulated, while ZMAT1 and CXXC1 were significantly downregulated in the PAAD samples in all TCGA - PAAD, GSE28735 and GSE15471 datasets.

Although NT1 showed a strong association with human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQB1*06:02, the responsible antigens remain unidentified. We analyzed array-based DNA methylation and gene expression data for the HLA region in CD4+and CD8+T cells that were separated from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of Japanese subjects (NT1, N = 42; control, N = 42). As the large number of SNPs in the HLA region might interfere with the affinity of the array probes, we conducted a comprehensive assessment of the reliability of each probe. The criteria were based on a previous study reporting that the presence of frequent SNPs, especially on the 3' side of the probe, makes the probe unreliable. We confirmed that 90.3% of the probes after general filtering in the HLA region do not include frequent SNPs, and are thus suitable for analysis, particularly in Japanese subjects. We then performed an association analysis, and found that several CpG sites in the HLA class II region of the patients were significantly hypomethylated in CD4+and CD8+T cells. This association was not detected when the effect of HLA-DQB1*06:02 was considered, suggesting that the hypomethylation was possibly derived from HLA-DQB1*06:02. Further RNA sequencing revealed reduced expression levels of HLA-DQB1 alleles other than HLA-DQB1*06:02 in the patients with NT1. Our results suggest the involvement of epigenetic and expressional changes in HLA-DQB1 in the pathogenesis of NT1.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Identified biomarker expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and multiplex immunofluorescence (IF) in 104 LN patients, 12 diabetic kidney disease (DKD) patients, 12 minimal change disease (MCD) patients, 12 IgA nephropathy (IgAN) patients and 14 normal controls (NC). The association of biomarker expression with clinicopathologic indices and prognosis was analyzed. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) were utilized to explore potential mechanisms.Interferon-inducible protein 16 (IFI16) was identified as a potential biomarker for LN. IFI16 was highly expressed in the kidneys of LN patients compared to those with MCD, DKD, IgAN or NC. IFI16 co-localized with certain renal and inflammatory cells. Glomerular IFI16 expression was correlated with pathological activity indices of LN, while tubulointerstitial IFI16 expression was correlated with pathological chronicity indices. Renal IFI16 expression was positively associated with systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity index (SLEDAI) and serum creatinine while negatively related to baseline eGFR and serum complement C3. Additionally, higher IFI16 expression was closely related to poorer prognosis of LN patients. GSEA and GSVA suggested that IFI16 expression was involved in adaptive immune-related processes of LN.Renal IFI16 expression is a potential biomarker for disease activity and clinical prognosis in LN patients.

However, little attention has been paid to the organic solvents frequently used in dactyloscopic laboratories to facilitate the separation of adhesive evidence prior to fingerprint development and downstream effects on subsequent DNA profiling. In the present study, we tested a selection of adhesive removers (n = 9) and assessed their potential impact on DNA recovery and amplification by PCR. Thereby, we identified and characterized novel PCR inhibitors. All investigated chemicals contain volatile organic compounds that evaporate under normal indoor atmospheric conditions. Exposure to certain solvents resulted in increased DNA degradation, but only if evaporation was prevented. A series of adhesive-removal experiments were conducted with prepared mock evidence (self-adhesive postage stamps affixed to paper envelope) to investigate the impact of treatment time and the location of applied traces on DNA recovery and dactyloscopy, respectively. Due to the early onset of print decomposition, we found that only a short treatment time was compatible with the development of fingerprints on the adhesive side of a stamp. Solvents also removed DNA from the adhesive surface, thus resulting in a marked shift in the substrate distribution of recovered DNA from the stamp to the envelope, but not in the reverse direction. Furthermore, we observed that treatment with conventional fingerprint reagents lead to a significant reduction in the amounts of DNA recovered from stamps, while the additional use of adhesive removers did not significantly enhance this effect.© 2023.

Using an untargeted, large-scale proteomic profiling, we aimed to (1) identify proteins mediating the association between healthy dietary patterns varying in the proportion of macronutrient and lipoproteins, and (2) validate the associations between diet-related proteins and lipoproteins in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study.In 140 adults from the OmniHeart trial, a randomized, cross-over, controlled feeding study with 3 intervention periods (carbohydrate-rich; protein-rich; unsaturated fat-rich dietary patterns), 4,958 proteins were quantified at the end of each diet intervention period using an aptamer assay (SomaLogic). We assessed differences in log2-transformed proteins in 3 between-diet comparisons using paired t-tests, examined the associations between diet-related proteins and lipoproteins using linear regression, and identified proteins mediating these associations using a causal mediation analysis. Levels of diet-related proteins and lipoprotein associations were validated in the ARIC study (n = 11,201) using multivariable linear regression models, adjusting for important confounders.Three between-diet comparisons identified 497 significantly different proteins (protein-rich vs. carbohydrate-rich = 18; unsaturated fat-rich vs. carbohydrate-rich = 335; protein-rich vs. unsaturated fat-rich dietary patterns = 398). Of these, 9 proteins [apolipoprotein M, afamin, collagen alpha-3(VI) chain, chitinase-3-like protein 1, inhibin beta A chain, palmitoleoyl-protein carboxylesterase NOTUM, cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide, guanylate-binding protein 2, COP9 signalosome complex subunit 7b] were positively associated with lipoproteins [high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol (C) = 2; triglyceride = 5; non-HDL-C = 3; total cholesterol to HDL-C ratio = 1]. Another protein, sodium-coupled monocarboxylate transporter 1, was inversely associated with HDL-C and positively associated with total cholesterol to HDL-C ratio. The proportion of the association between diet and lipoproteins mediated by these 10 proteins ranged from 21 to 98%. All of the associations between diet-related proteins and lipoproteins were significant in the ARIC study, except for afamin.We identified proteins that mediate the association between healthy dietary patterns varying in macronutrients and lipoproteins in a randomized feeding study and an observational study.NCT00051350 at clinicaltrials.gov.© 2023.

Targeting of disease-defining markers in conditions such as Alzheimer disease (amyloid-β and tau) or Parkinson disease (α-synuclein) has been met with limited success, suggesting that these proteins do not act in isolation but form part of a pathological network. This network could involve phenotypic alteration of multiple cell types in the CNS, including astrocytes, which have a major neurosupportive, homeostatic role in the healthy CNS but adopt reactive states under acute or chronic adverse conditions. Transcriptomic studies in human patients and disease models have revealed the co-existence of many putative reactive sub-states of astrocytes. Inter-disease and even intra-disease heterogeneity of reactive astrocytic sub-states are well established, but the extent to which specific sub-states are shared across different diseases is unclear. In this Review, we highlight how single-cell and single-nuclei RNA sequencing and other 'omics' technologies can enable the functional characterization of defined reactive astrocyte states in various pathological scenarios. We provide an integrated perspective, advocating cross-modal validation of key findings to define functionally important sub-states of astrocytes and their triggers as tractable therapeutic targets with cross-disease relevance.© 2023.

Due to the high-dimensional small-sample nature of omics data, current deep-learning models end up with many parameters and have to be fitted with a limited training set. Furthermore, interactions between molecular entities inside an omics profile are not patient specific but are the same for all patients.In this article, we propose AttOmics, a new deep-learning architecture based on the self-attention mechanism. First, we decompose each omics profile into a set of groups, where each group contains related features. Then, by applying the self-attention mechanism to the set of groups, we can capture the different interactions specific to a patient. The results of different experiments carried out in this article show that our model can accurately predict the phenotype of a patient with fewer parameters than deep neural networks. Visualizing the attention maps can provide new insights into the essential groups for a particular phenotype.The code and data are available at https://forge.ibisc.univ-evry.fr/abeaude/AttOmics.

These factors have the potential to directly suppress the immune system and activate hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the sympathetic nervous system with a consequent further immunosuppressive effect.Anesthetics and analgesics used during the perioperative period may modulate the innate and adaptive immune system, inflammatory system, and angiogenesis, with a possible impact on cancer recurrence and long-term outcome. Even if the current data are controversial and contrasting, it is crucial to increase awareness about this topic among healthcare professionals for a future better and conscious choice of anesthetic techniques.In this article, we aimed to provide an overview regarding the relationship between anesthesia and cancer recurrence. We reviewed the effects of surgery, perioperative factors, and anesthetic agents on tumor cell survival and tumor recurrence.© 2022. The Author(s)."

Cancer epidemiologic data provide helpful information for cancer prevention, diagnosis, and management, supporting health-care interventions. Global cancer mortality projections from 2016 to 2060 show that cancer will overtake ischemic heart diseases (IHD) as the leading cause of death (18.9 million) immediately after 2030, surpassing non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which accounts for 85 percent of lung cancers. The clinical stage at the diagnosis is the main prognostic factor in NSCLC therapies. Advanced early diagnostic methods are essential as the initial stages of cancer show reduced mortality compared to the advanced stages. Sophisticated approaches to proper histological classification and NSCLC management have improved clinical efficiency. Although immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and targeted molecular therapies have refined the therapeutic management of late-stage NSCLC, the specificity and sensitivity of cancer biomarkers should be improved by focusing on prospective studies, followed by their use as therapeutic tools. The liquid biopsy candidates such as circulating tumor cells (CTCs), circulating cell-free tumor DNA (cfDNA), tumor educated platelets (TEP), and extracellular vesicles (EVs) possess cancer-derived biomolecules and aid in tracing: driver mutations leading to cancer, acquired resistance caused by various generations of therapeutic agents, refractory disease, prognosis, and surveillance.© 2022 The Authors.

We investigated whether HFD promote abnormal adipose tissue formation caused by early exposure to 4-NP in life and preliminarily explore the possible mechanisms involved.The first-generation rats were treated with HFD on postnatal day after pregnant rats exposure to 5 ug/kg/day 4-NP. Then, the second generation rats started to only receive normal diet without 4-NP or HFD. We analyzed organ coefficient and histopathology of fat tissues, biochemical index, and gene level involved in lipid metabolism in female offspring rats.HFD and 4-NP interaction synergistically increased birth weight, body weight, and organ coefficients of adipose tissue in offspring female rats. HFD accelerately aggravated abnormal lipid metabolism and increased the adipocyte mean areas around the uterus of the offspring female rats induced by prenatal exposure to 4-NP. HFD also facilitate the regulation of gene expression involved lipid metabolism in offspring female rats induced by perinatal exposure to 4-NP, even passed on to the second generation of female rats. Moreover, HFD and 4-NP interaction synergistically declined the gene and protein expression of estrogen receptor (ER) in the adipose tissue of second-generation female rats.HFD and 4-NP synergistically regulate the expression of lipid metabolism genes in adipose tissue of F2 female rats and promote adipose tissue generation, leading to obesity in offspring rats, which is closely related to low expression of ER. Therefore, ER genes and proteins may be involved in the synergistic effect of HFD and 4-NP.Copyright © 2023 Hongyu Zhang et al."
"37382627","Single-cell chromatin accessibility profiling reveals a self-renewing muscle satellite cell state.","J Cell Biol","A balance between self-renewal and differentiation is critical for the regenerative capacity of tissue-resident stem cells. In skeletal muscle, successful regeneration requires the orchestrated activation, proliferation, and differentiation of muscle satellite cells (MuSCs) that are normally quiescent. A subset of MuSCs undergoes self-renewal to replenish the stem cell pool, but the features that identify and define self-renewing MuSCs remain to be elucidated. Here, through single-cell chromatin accessibility analysis, we reveal the self-renewal versus differentiation trajectories of MuSCs over the course of regeneration in vivo. We identify Betaglycan as a unique marker of self-renewing MuSCs that can be purified and efficiently contributes to regeneration after transplantation. We also show that SMAD4 and downstream genes are genetically required for self-renewal in vivo by restricting differentiation. Our study unveils the identity and mechanisms of self-renewing MuSCs, while providing a key resource for comprehensive analysis of muscle regeneration.© 2023 Okafor et al."
"37396986","Epigenetic Inheritance and Transgenerational Environmental Justice.","Yale J Biol Med","Many chemicals and toxicants are released into our ecosystem and environment every day, which can cause harmful effects on human populations. Agricultural compounds are used in most crop production and have been shown to cause negative health impacts, including effects on reproduction and other pathologies. Although these chemicals can be helpful for pest and weed control, the compounds indirectly impact humans. Several compounds have been banned in the European Union but continue to be used in the United States. Recent work has shown most toxicants affect transgenerational generations more than the directly exposed generations through epigenetic inheritance. While some toxicants do not impact the directly exposed generation, the later generations that are transgenerational or ancestrally exposed suffer health impacts. Due to impacts to future generations, exposure becomes an environmental justice concern. The term ""environmental justice"" denotes the application of fair strategies when resolving unjust environmental contamination. Fair treatment means that no group should bear a disproportionate share of negative environmental consequences resulting from industrial, municipal, and commercial operations. This article illustrates how research on directly exposed generations is often prioritized over studies on transgenerational generations. However, research on the latter generations suggests the need to take environmental justice concerns seriously moving forward, as future generations could be unduly shouldering harms, while not enjoying benefits of production.Copyright ©2023, Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine."
"37397254","Epigenetic mechanisms of MÃ¼ller glial reprogramming mediating retinal regeneration.","Front Cell Dev Biol","Retinal degenerative diseases, characterized by retinal neuronal death and severe vision loss, affect millions of people worldwide. One of the most promising treatment methods for retinal degenerative diseases is to reprogram non-neuronal cells into stem or progenitor cells, which then have the potential to re-differentiate to replace the dead neurons, thereby promoting retinal regeneration. Müller glia are the major glial cell type and play an important regulatory role in retinal metabolism and retinal cell regeneration. Müller glia can serve as a source of neurogenic progenitor cells in organisms with the ability to regenerate the nervous system. Current evidence points toward the reprogramming process of Müller glia, involving changes in the expression of pluripotent factors and other key signaling molecules that may be regulated by epigenetic mechanisms. This review summarizes recent knowledge of epigenetic modifications involved in the reprogramming process of Müller glia and the subsequent changes to gene expression and the outcomes. In living organisms, epigenetic mechanisms mainly include DNA methylation, histone modification, and microRNA-mediated miRNA degradation, all of which play a crucial role in the reprogramming process of Müller glia. The information presented in this review will improve the understanding of the mechanisms underlying the Müller glial reprogramming process and provide a research basis for the development of Müller glial reprogramming therapy for retinal degenerative diseases.Copyright © 2023 Si, Li, Zhang, Su, Liu, Chen, Peng, Cao and Zang."

However, the sequence patterns and epigenomic features that collectively influence chromatin spatial positioning in a genome-wide manner are not well understood.Here, we develop a new transformer-based deep learning model called UNADON, which predicts the genome-wide cytological distance to a specific type of nuclear body, as measured by TSA-seq, using both sequence features and epigenomic signals. Evaluations of UNADON in four cell lines (K562, H1, HFFc6, HCT116) show high accuracy in predicting chromatin spatial positioning to nuclear bodies when trained on a single cell line. UNADON also performed well in an unseen cell type. Importantly, we reveal potential sequence and epigenomic factors that affect large-scale chromatin compartmentalization in nuclear bodies. Together, UNADON provides new insights into the principles between sequence features and large-scale chromatin spatial localization, which has important implications for understanding nuclear structure and function.The source code of UNADON can be found at https://github.com/ma-compbio/UNADON.© The Author(s) 2023.

The emergence of new symptoms and dysregulation of multiple organs resulted in high disease severity during the second wave which led to increased difficulties in understanding the molecular mechanisms behind the disease pathology. Exploring the underlying factors can help to relieve the burden on the medical communities to some extent by prioritizing the patients and, at the same time, opening avenues for improved treatments. In the current study, we have performed a mass-spectrometry-based proteomic analysis to investigate the disease pathology using nasopharyngeal swab samples collected from the COVID-19 patients in the Mumbai region of Maharashtra over the period of March-June 2021, the peak of the second wave. A total of 59 patients, including 32 non-severe and 27 severe cases, were considered for this proteomic study. We identified 23 differentially regulated proteins in severe patients as a host response to infection. In addition to the previously identified innate mechanisms of neutrophil and platelet degranulation, this study revealed significant alterations of anti-microbial peptide pathways in severe conditions, illustrating its role in the severity of the infectious strain of COVID-19 during the second wave. Furthermore, myeloperoxidase, cathepsin G, and profilin-1 were identified as potential therapeutic targets of the FDA-approved drugs dabrafenib, ZINC4097343, and ritonavir.

The T2T-CHM13 genome assembly extends our understanding of telomeres, centromeres, segmental duplication, and other complex regions. The current human genome reference (GRCh38) has been widely used in various human genomic studies. However, the large-scale genomic differences between these two important genome assemblies are not characterized in detail yet.Here, in addition to the previously reported ""non-syntenic"" regions, we find 67 additional large-scale discrepant regions and precisely categorize them into four structural types with a newly developed website tool called SynPlotter. The discrepant regions (~ 21.6 Mbp) excluding telomeric and centromeric regions are highly structurally polymorphic in humans, where the deletions or duplications are likely associated with various human diseases, such as immune and neurodevelopmental disorders. The analyses of a newly identified discrepant region-the KLRC gene cluster-show that the depletion of KLRC2 by a single-deletion event is associated with natural killer cell differentiation in ~ 20% of humans. Meanwhile, the rapid amino acid replacements observed within KLRC3 are probably a result of natural selection in primate evolution.Our study provides a foundation for understanding the large-scale structural genomic differences between the two crucial human reference genomes, and is thereby important for future human genomics studies.© 2023.

"37386214","Readout of histone methylation by Trim24 locally restricts chromatin opening by p53.","Nat Struct Mol Biol","The genomic binding sites of the transcription factor (TF) and tumor suppressor p53 are unusually diverse with regard to their chromatin features, including histone modifications, raising the possibility that the local chromatin environment can contextualize p53 regulation. Here, we show that epigenetic characteristics of closed chromatin, such as DNA methylation, do not influence the binding of p53 across the genome. Instead, the ability of p53 to open chromatin and activate its target genes is locally restricted by its cofactor Trim24. Trim24 binds to both p53 and unmethylated histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4), thereby preferentially localizing to those p53 sites that reside in closed chromatin, whereas it is deterred from accessible chromatin by H3K4 methylation. The presence of Trim24 increases cell viability upon stress and enables p53 to affect gene expression as a function of the local chromatin state. These findings link H3K4 methylation to p53 function and illustrate how specificity in chromatin can be achieved, not by TF-intrinsic sensitivity to histone modifications, but by employing chromatin-sensitive cofactors that locally modulate TF function.© 2023.

MSI-H is driven by defective mismatch repair (dMMR), and approximately 15% of nonhereditary CRCs also exhibit MSI-H. Here, we aimed to better define mechanisms underlying tumor initiation in LS and MSI-H cancers through multi-omic analyses of LS normal colon organoids and MSI-H tumors.Right (n = 35) and left (n = 23) colon organoids generated from normal colon biopsies at routine colonoscopy of LS and healthy individuals were subjected to Illumina EPIC array. Differentially methylated region (DMR) analysis was performed by DMRcate. RNA-sequencing (n = 16) and bisulfite-sequencing (n = 15) were performed on a subset of right colon organoids. CRISPR-cas9-mediated editing of MMR genes in colon organoids of healthy individuals was followed by quantitative PCR of MSH4. The relationship between MSH4 expression and tumor mutational burden was further explored in three independent tumor data sets.We identified a hypermethylated region of MSH4 in both the right and left colon organoids of LS versus healthy controls, which we validated using bisulfite-sequencing. DMR analysis in three gastrointestinal and one endometrial data set revealed that this region was also hypermethylated in MSI-H versus microsatellite stable (MSS) tumors. MSH4 expression was increased in colon organoids of LS versus healthy subjects and in publicly available MSI-H versus MSS tumors across four RNA-seq and four microarray data sets. CRISPR-cas9 editing of MLH1 and MSH2, but not MSH6, in normal colon organoids significantly increased MSH4 expression. MSH4 expression was significantly associated with tumor mutational burden in three publicly available data sets.Our findings implicate DNA methylation and gene expression differences of MSH4 as a marker of dMMR and as a potential novel biomarker of LS.

Here, we explore the SVs of Escherichia coli by running 67 wild-type (WT) and 37 mismatch repair (MMR)-deficient (ΔmutS) mutation accumulation lines, each experiencing more than 4,000 cell divisions, by applying Nanopore long-read sequencing and Illumina PE150 sequencing and verifying the results by Sanger sequencing. In addition to precisely repeating previous mutation rates of base-pair substitutions and insertion and deletion (indel) mutation rates, we do find significant improvement in insertion and deletion detection using long-read sequencing. The long-read sequencing and corresponding software can particularly detect bacterial SVs in both simulated and real data sets with high accuracy. These lead to SV rates of 2.77 × 10-4 (WT) and 5.26 × 10-4 (MMR-deficient) per cell division per genome, which is comparable with previous reports.

Here, we investigated genetically mimicked ASGR1 inhibitors on all-cause mortality and any possible adverse effects.We conducted a drug-target Mendelian randomization study to assess genetically mimicked effects of ASGR1 inhibitors on all-cause mortality and 25 a priori outcomes relevant to lipid traits, CAD, and possible adverse effects, i.e. liver function, cholelithiasis, adiposity and type 2 diabetes. We also performed a phenome-wide association study of 1951 health-related phenotypes to identify any novel effects. Associations found were compared with those for currently used lipid modifiers, assessed using colocalization, and replicated where possible.Genetically mimicked ASGR1 inhibitors were associated with a longer lifespan (3.31 years per standard deviation reduction in LDL-cholesterol, 95% confidence interval 1.01 to 5.62). Genetically mimicked ASGR1 inhibitors were inversely associated with apolipoprotein B (apoB), triglycerides (TG) and CAD risk. Genetically mimicked ASGR1 inhibitors were positively associated with alkaline phosphatase, gamma glutamyltransferase, erythrocyte traits, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and C-reactive protein (CRP), but were inversely associated with albumin and calcium. Genetically mimicked ASGR1 inhibitors were not associated with cholelithiasis, adiposity or type 2 diabetes. Associations with apoB and TG were stronger for ASGR1 inhibitors compared with currently used lipid modifiers, and most non-lipid effects were specific to ASGR1 inhibitors. The probabilities for colocalization were > 0.80 for most of these associations, but were 0.42 for lifespan and 0.30 for CAD. These associations were replicated using alternative genetic instruments and other publicly available genetic summary statistics.Genetically mimicked ASGR1 inhibitors reduced all-cause mortality.

However, little is known about the heritability of meat cut proportions (MCP) and their correlations with other traits. The aims of this study were to assess the heritability and genetic correlation of MCP with carcass and meat quality traits using single nucleotide polymorphism chips and conduct a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify candidate genes for MCP.Seventeen MCP, 12 carcass, and seven meat quality traits were measured in 2012 pigs from four populations (Landrace; Yorkshire; Landrace and Yorkshire hybrid pigs; Duroc, and Landrace and Yorkshire hybrid pigs). Estimates of the heritability for MCP ranged from 0.10 to 0.55, with most estimates being moderate to high and highly consistent across populations. In the combined population, the heritability estimates for the proportions of scapula bone, loin, back fat, leg bones, and boneless picnic shoulder were 0.44 ± 0.04, 0.36 ± 0.04, 0.44 ± 0.04, 0.38 ± 0.04, and 0.39 ± 0.04, respectively. Proportion of middle cuts was genetically significantly positively correlated with intramuscular fat content and backfat depth. Proportion of ribs was genetically positively correlated with carcass oblique length and straight length (0.35 ± 0.08 to 0.45 ± 0.07) and negatively correlated with backfat depth (- 0.26 ± 0.10 to - 0.45 ± 0.10). However, weak or nonsignificant genetic correlations were observed between most MCP, indicating their independence. Twenty-eight quantitative trait loci (QTL) for MCP were detected by GWAS, and 24 new candidate genes related to MCP were identified, which are involved with growth, height, and skeletal development. Most importantly, we found that the development of the bones in different parts of the body may be regulated by different genes, among which HMGA1 may be the strongest candidate gene affecting forelimb bone development. Moreover, as previously shown, VRTN is a causal gene affecting vertebra number, and BMP2 may be the strongest candidate gene affecting hindlimb bone development.Our results indicate that breeding programs for MCP have the potential to enhance carcass composition by increasing the proportion of expensive cuts and decreasing the proportion of inexpensive cuts. Since MCP are post-slaughter traits, the QTL and candidate genes related to these traits can be used for marker-assisted and genomic selection.© 2023. The Author(s)."

We aimed to investigate the association between different obesity patterns and hypertension risk in a large male population in the US. Male participants from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) (2007-2018) were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. Social demographic information, lifestyle factors, anthropometric measurements and biochemical measurements were collected. Three obesity patterns were classified according to the body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC), including overweight and general obesity, abdominal obesity, and compound obesity. We adopted multivariate logistic regression to investigate the associations between hypertension and different obesity patterns after adjusting for cofounding factors. Subgroup analysis, stratified by age, smoking, drinking and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), was also conducted to explore the associations between obesity patterns and hypertension risk among different populations. Moreover, the association between WC and hypertension among male individuals was also explored using restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) was used to evaluate the discriminatory power of WC for screening hypertension risk. 13,859 male participants from NHANES survey (2007-2018) were enrolled. Comparing with the normal-weight group, the odds ratios (ORs) [95% confidence interval (CI)] for hypertension in individuals with overweight and general obesity, abdominal obesity and compound obesity were 1.41 [1.17-1.70], 1.97 [1.53-2.54] and 3.28 [2.70-3.99], respectively. Subgroup analysis showed that the effect of different obesity patterns on hypertension risk was highly stable among individuals with different clinical conditions. In addition, WC had a positive correlation with the risk of hypertension (OR: 1.43; 95% CI 1.37-1.52; P < 0.001) in fully adjusted multivariate logistic regression model. RCS analysis showed that the association between WC and hypertension risk was in a nonlinear pattern, and WC had a good discriminatory power for hypertension in ROC analysis. Different patterns of obesity have a great impact on the risk of hypertension among male individuals. Increment of WC significantly increased the hypertension risk. More attention should be paid to the prevention of obesity, especially abdominal obesity and compound obesity in male individuals.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37363945","Clinical and Genetic Atrial Fibrillation Risk and Discrimination of Cardioembolic From Noncardioembolic Stroke.","Stroke","Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common cause of stroke but may not be detectable at the time of stroke. We hypothesized that an AF polygenic risk score (PRS) can discriminate between cardioembolic stroke and noncardioembolic strokes.We evaluated AF and stroke risk in 26 145 individuals of European descent from the Stroke Genetics Network case-control study. AF genetic risk was estimated using 3 recently developed PRS methods (LDpred-funct-inf, sBayesR, and PRS-CS) and 2 previously validated PRSs. We performed logistic regression of each AF PRS on AF status and separately cardioembolic stroke, adjusting for clinical risk score (CRS), imputation group, and principal components. We calculated model discrimination of AF and cardioembolic stroke using the concordance statistic (c-statistic) and compared c-statistics using 2000-iteration bootstrapping. We also assessed reclassification of cardioembolic stroke with the addition of PRS to either CRS or a modified CHA2DS2-VASc score alone.Each AF PRS was significantly associated with AF and with cardioembolic stroke after adjustment for CRS. Addition of each AF PRS significantly improved discrimination as compared with CRS alone (P<0.01). When combined with the CRS, both PRS-CS and LDpred scores discriminated both AF and cardioembolic stroke (c-statistic 0.84 for AF; 0.74 for cardioembolic stroke) better than 3 other PRS scores (P<0.01). Using PRS-CS PRS and CRS in combination resulted in more appropriate reclassification of stroke events as compared with CRS alone (event reclassification [net reclassification indices]+=14% [95% CI, 10%-18%]; nonevent reclassification [net reclassification indices]-=17% [95% CI, 15%-0.19%]) or the modified CHA2DS2-VASc score (net reclassification indices+=11% [95% CI, 7%-15%]; net reclassification indices-=14% [95% CI, 12%-16%]) alone.Addition of polygenic risk of AF to clinical risk factors modestly improves the discrimination of cardioembolic from noncardioembolic strokes, as well as reclassification of stroke subtype. Polygenic risk of AF may be a useful biomarker for identifying strokes caused by AF."

In this review, we highlight existing, MS-specific mathematical research and discuss the outstanding challenges and open problems that remain for mathematicians. We focus on how both non-spatial and spatial deterministic models have been used to successfully further our understanding of T cell responses and treatment in MS. We also review how agent-based models and other stochastic modelling techniques have begun to shed light on the highly stochastic and oscillatory nature of this disease. Reviewing the current mathematical work in MS, alongside the biology specific to MS immunology, it is clear that mathematical research dedicated to understanding immunotherapies in cancer or the immune responses to viral infections could be readily translatable to MS and might hold the key to unlocking some of its mysteries.© 2023.

The relative risk of colorectal cancer after cholecystectomy was calculated using STATA 14.0 software. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were used to examine the source of heterogeneity. Funnel plots and Egger's test were finally performed to assess the publication bias.This meta-analysis included 14 studies comprising 2,283,616 subjects. Pooled analysis indicated that cholecystectomy was not a risk factor for colorectal cancer (Colorectal: RR 1.06; 95% CI 0.75-1.51, p = 0.739 Colon: RR 1.30; 95% CI 0.88-1.93, p = 0.182 Rectal: RR 0.99; 95% CI 0.74-1.32, p = 0.932). Subgroup showed that patients are at an increased risk of sigmoid colon following cholecystectomy (RR 1.42; 95% CI 1.27-1.58, p = 0.000). Furthermore, it was shown that both females and males undergoing cholecystectomy may have higher risks of colon cancer (Female: RR = 1.47, 95% CI 1.01-2.14, P = 0.042 Male: RR = 1.32; 95% CI 1.07-1.63, P = 0.010), which is similarly observed in the right colon (Female: RR 1.99; 95% CI 1.31-3.03, p = 0.001, P = 0.017 Male: RR 1.68; 95% CI 0.81-3.49, p = 0.166).No clear evidence to support the association between cholecystectomy and an increased risk of colorectal cancer. For patients with valid indications, timely cholecystectomy could be performed without the risk of colorectal cancer.© 2023.

To improve outcomes, timely diagnosis and effective treatments are needed. Genomic sequencing has transformed the traditional diagnostic process, providing rapid, accurate and cost-effective genetic diagnoses to many. Incorporating genomic sequencing into newborn screening programmes at the population scale holds the promise of substantially expanding the early detection of treatable rare diseases, with stored genomic data potentially benefitting health over a lifetime and supporting further research. As several large-scale newborn genomic screening projects launch internationally, we review the challenges and opportunities presented, particularly the need to generate evidence of benefit and to address the ethical, legal and psychosocial issues that genomic newborn screening raises.© 2023.

"37386011","Imprinting disorders.","Nat Rev Dis Primers","Imprinting disorders (ImpDis) are congenital conditions that are characterized by disturbances of genomic imprinting. The most common individual ImpDis are Prader-Willi syndrome, Angelman syndrome and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. Individual ImpDis have similar clinical features, such as growth disturbances and developmental delay, but the disorders are heterogeneous and the key clinical manifestations are often non-specific, rendering diagnosis difficult. Four types of genomic and imprinting defect (ImpDef) affecting differentially methylated regions (DMRs) can cause ImpDis. These defects affect the monoallelic and parent-of-origin-specific expression of imprinted genes. The regulation within DMRs as well as their functional consequences are mainly unknown, but functional cross-talk between imprinted genes and functional pathways has been identified, giving insight into the pathophysiology of ImpDefs. Treatment of ImpDis is symptomatic. Targeted therapies are lacking owing to the rarity of these disorders; however, personalized treatments are in development. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of ImpDis, and improving diagnosis and treatment of these disorders, requires a multidisciplinary approach with input from patient representatives.© 2023.

"37349125","Genomic approaches to cancer and minimal residual disease detection using circulating tumor DNA.","J Immunother Cancer","Liquid biopsies using cell-free circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) are being used frequently in both research and clinical settings. ctDNA can be used to identify actionable mutations to personalize systemic therapy, detect post-treatment minimal residual disease (MRD), and predict responses to immunotherapy. ctDNA can also be isolated from a range of different biofluids, with the possibility of detecting locoregional MRD with increased sensitivity if sampling more proximally than blood plasma. However, ctDNA detection remains challenging in early-stage and post-treatment MRD settings where ctDNA levels are minuscule giving a high risk for false negative results, which is balanced with the risk of false positive results from clonal hematopoiesis. To address these challenges, researchers have developed ever-more elegant approaches to lower the limit of detection (LOD) of ctDNA assays toward the part-per-million range and boost assay sensitivity and specificity by reducing sources of low-level technical and biological noise, and by harnessing specific genomic and epigenomic features of ctDNA. In this review, we highlight a range of modern assays for ctDNA analysis, including advancements made to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. We further highlight the challenge of detecting ultra-rare tumor-associated variants, overcoming which will improve the sensitivity of post-treatment MRD detection and open a new frontier of personalized adjuvant treatment decision-making.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023.

"37396305","DNA structural properties of DNA binding sites for 21 transcription factors in the mycobacterial genome.","Front Cell Infect Microbiol","Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis, has evolved over time into a multidrug resistance strain that poses a serious global pandemic health threat. The ability to survive and remain dormant within the host macrophage relies on multiple transcription factors contributing to virulence. To date, very limited structural insights from crystallographic and NMR studies are available for TFs and TF-DNA binding events. Understanding the role of DNA structure in TF binding is critical to deciphering MTB pathogenicity and has yet to be resolved at the genome scale. In this work, we analyzed the compositional and conformational preference of 21 mycobacterial TFs, evident at their DNA binding sites, in local and global scales. Results suggest that most TFs prefer binding to genomic regions characterized by unique DNA structural signatures, namely, high electrostatic potential, narrow minor grooves, high propeller twist, helical twist, intrinsic curvature, and DNA rigidity compared to the flanking sequences. Additionally, preference for specific trinucleotide motifs, with clear periodic signals of tetranucleotide motifs, are observed in the vicinity of the TF-DNA interactions. Altogether, our study reports nuanced DNA shape and structural preferences of 21 TFs.Copyright © 2023 Dey, Olymon, Banik, Abbas, Yella and Kumar."
"37400615","G4access identifies G-quadruplexes and their associations with open chromatin and imprinting control regions.","Nat Genet","Metazoan promoters are enriched in secondary DNA structure-forming motifs, such as G-quadruplexes (G4s). Here we describe 'G4access', an approach to isolate and sequence G4s associated with open chromatin via nuclease digestion. G4access is antibody- and crosslinking-independent and enriches for computationally predicted G4s (pG4s), most of which are confirmed in vitro. Using G4access in human and mouse cells, we identify cell-type-specific G4 enrichment correlated with nucleosome exclusion and promoter transcription. G4access allows measurement of variations in G4 repertoire usage following G4 ligand treatment, HDAC and G4 helicases inhibitors. Applying G4access to cells from reciprocal hybrid mouse crosses suggests a role for G4s in the control of active imprinting regions. Consistently, we also observed that G4access peaks are unmethylated, while methylation at pG4s correlates with nucleosome repositioning on DNA. Overall, our study provides a new tool for studying G4s in cellular dynamics and highlights their association with open chromatin, transcription and their antagonism to DNA methylation.© 2023.

"37382793","Identification of Key lncRNAs, circRNAs, and mRNAs in Osteoarthritis via Bioinformatics Analysis.","Mol Biotechnol","Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common degenerative joint disorder that adversely affects the quality of life of patients. Identification of novel diagnostic biomarkers is pivotal for the early detection and prevention of OA. Dataset GSE185059 was selected from Gene Expression Omnibus database to obtain differentially expressed lncRNAs (DE-lncRNAs), mRNAs (DE-mRNAs), and circRNAs (DE-circRNAs) between OA and normal samples. The Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses as well as protein-protein interaction (PPI) network construction of DE-mRNAs were conducted. Hub genes were identified from PPI networks and validated by RT-qPCR. starBase database was utilized for predicting miRNAs binding with hub genes, selected DE-lncRNAs and DE-circRNAs, respectively. The competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks were constructed. A total of 818 DE-mRNAs, 191 DE-lncRNAs, and 2053 DE-circRNAs were identified. The DE-mRNAs were significantly enriched in several inflammation-related GO terms and KEGG pathways such as positive regulation of cell-cell adhesion, TNF-alpha signaling pathway and NF-kappa B signaling pathway. Thirteen hub genes were identified, which were CFTR, GART, SMAD2, NCK1, TJP1, UBE2D1, EFTUD2, PRKACB, IL10, SNRPG, CHD4, RPS24, and SRSF6. OA-related DE-lncRNA/circRNA-miRNA-hub gene networks were constructed. We identified 13 hub genes and constructed the ceRNA networks related to OA, providing a theoretical basis for further research.© 2023.

"37391666","Tutorial: integrative computational analysis of bulk RNA-sequencing data to characterize tumor immunity using RIMA.","Nat Protoc","RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) has become an increasingly cost-effective technique for molecular profiling and immune characterization of tumors. In the past decade, many computational tools have been developed to characterize tumor immunity from gene expression data. However, the analysis of large-scale RNA-seq data requires bioinformatics proficiency, large computational resources and cancer genomics and immunology knowledge. In this tutorial, we provide an overview of computational analysis of bulk RNA-seq data for immune characterization of tumors and introduce commonly used computational tools with relevance to cancer immunology and immunotherapy. These tools have diverse functions such as evaluation of expression signatures, estimation of immune infiltration, inference of the immune repertoire, prediction of immunotherapy response, neoantigen detection and microbiome quantification. We describe the RNA-seq IMmune Analysis (RIMA) pipeline integrating many of these tools to streamline RNA-seq analysis. We also developed a comprehensive and user-friendly guide in the form of a GitBook with text and video demos to assist users in analyzing bulk RNA-seq data for immune characterization at both individual sample and cohort levels by using RIMA.© 2023.

"37400761","Gene expression profiling unveils the temporal dynamics of CIGB-300-regulated transcriptome in AML cell lines.","BMC Genomics","Protein kinase CK2 activity is implicated in the pathogenesis of various hematological malignancies like Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) that remains challenging concerning treatment. This kinase has emerged as an attractive molecular target in therapeutic. Antitumoral peptide CIGB-300 blocks CK2 phospho-acceptor sites on their substrates but it also binds to CK2α catalytic subunit. Previous proteomic and phosphoproteomic experiments showed molecular and cellular processes with relevance for the peptide action in diverse AML backgrounds but earlier transcriptional level events might also support the CIGB-300 anti-leukemic effect. Here we used a Clariom S HT assay for gene expression profiling to study the molecular events supporting the anti-leukemic effect of CIGB-300 peptide on HL-60 and OCI-AML3 cell lines.We found 183 and 802 genes appeared significantly modulated in HL-60 cells at 30 min and 3 h of incubation with CIGB-300 for p < 0.01 and FC >  = │1.5│, respectively; while 221 and 332 genes appeared modulated in OCI-AML3 cells. Importantly, functional enrichment analysis evidenced that genes and transcription factors related to apoptosis, cell cycle, leukocyte differentiation, signaling by cytokines/interleukins, and NF-kB, TNF signaling pathways were significantly represented in AML cells transcriptomic profiles. The influence of CIGB-300 on these biological processes and pathways is dependent on the cellular background, in the first place, and treatment duration. Of note, the impact of the peptide on NF-kB signaling was corroborated by the quantification of selected NF-kB target genes, as well as the measurement of p50 binding activity and soluble TNF-α induction. Quantification of CSF1/M-CSF and CDKN1A/P21 by qPCR supports peptide effects on differentiation and cell cycle.We explored for the first time the temporal dynamics of the gene expression profile regulated by CIGB-300 which, along with the antiproliferative mechanism, can stimulate immune responses by increasing immunomodulatory cytokines. We provided fresh molecular clues concerning the antiproliferative effect of CIGB-300 in two relevant AML backgrounds.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37400428","Seasonal effect-an overlooked factor in neuroimaging research.","Transl Psychiatry","In neuroimaging research, seasonal effects are often neglected or controlled as confounding factors. However, seasonal fluctuations in mood and behavior have been observed in both psychiatric disorders and healthy participants. There are vast opportunities for neuroimaging studies to understand seasonal variations in brain function. In this study, we used two longitudinal single-subject datasets with weekly measures over more than a year to investigate seasonal effects on intrinsic brain networks. We found that the sensorimotor network displayed a strong seasonal pattern. The sensorimotor network is not only relevant for integrating sensory inputs and coordinating movement, but it also affects emotion regulation and executive function. Therefore, the observed seasonality effects in the sensorimotor network could contribute to seasonal variations in mood and behavior. Genetic analyses revealed seasonal modulation of biological processes and pathways relevant to immune function, RNA metabolism, centrosome separation, and mitochondrial translation that have a significant impact on human physiology and pathology. In addition, we revealed critical factors such as head motion, caffeine use, and scan time that could interfere with seasonal effects and need to be considered in future studies.© 2023.

"37333288","The human Y and inactive X chromosomes similarly modulate autosomal gene expression.","bioRxiv","Somatic cells of human males and females have 45 chromosomes in common, including the ""active"" X chromosome. In males the 46thchromosome is a Y; in females it is an ""inactive"" X (Xi). Through linear modeling of autosomal gene expression in cells from individuals with zero to three Xi and zero to four Y chromosomes, we found that Xi and Y impact autosomal expression broadly and with remarkably similar effects. Studying sex-chromosome structural anomalies, promoters of Xi- and Y-responsive genes, and CRISPR inhibition, we traced part of this shared effect to homologous transcription factors -ZFXandZFY- encoded by Chr X and Y. This demonstrates sex-shared mechanisms by which Xi and Y modulate autosomal expression. Combined with earlier analyses of sex-linked gene expression, our studies show that 21% of all genes expressed in lymphoblastoid cells or fibroblasts change expression significantly in response to Xi or Y chromosomes."
"37378675","Molecular subtypes of lung adenocarcinoma patients for prognosis and therapeutic response prediction with machine learning on 13 programmed cell death patterns.","J Cancer Res Clin Oncol","Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) seriously threatens people's health worldwide. Programmed cell death (PCD) plays a critical role in regulating LUAD growth and metastasis as well as in therapeutic response. However, currently, there is a lack of integrative analysis of PCD-related signatures of LUAD for accurate prediction of prognosis and therapeutic response.The bulk transcriptome and clinical information of LUAD were obtained from TCGA and GEO databases. A total of 1382 genes involved in regulating 13 various PCD patterns (apoptosis, necroptosis, pyroptosis, ferroptosis, cuproptosis, netotic cell death, entotic cell death, lysosome-dependent cell death, parthanatos, autophagy-dependent cell death, oxeiptosis, alkaliptosis and disulfidptosis) were included in the study. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and differential expression analysis were performed to identify PCD-associated differential expression genes (DEGs). An unsupervised consensus clustering algorithm was used to explore the potential subtypes of LUAD based on the expression profiles of PCD-associated DEGs. Univariate Cox regression analysis, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression, Random Forest (RF) analysis and stepwise multivariate Cox analysis were performed to construct a prognostic gene signature. The ""oncoPredict"" algorithm was utilized for drug-sensitive analysis. GSVA and GSEA were utilized to perform function enrichment analysis. MCPcounter, quanTIseq, Xcell and ssGSEA algorithms were used for tumor immune microenvironment analysis. A nomogram incorporating PCDI and clinicopathological characteristics was established to predict the prognosis of LUAD patients.Forty PCD-associated DEGs related to LUAD were obtained by WGCNA analysis and differential expression analysis, followed by unsupervised clustering to identify two LUAD molecular subtypes. A programmed cell death index (PCDI) with a five-gene signature was established by machine learning algorithms. LUAD patients were then divided into a high PCDI group and a low PCDI group using the median PCDI as a cutoff. Survival and therapeutic analysis revealed that the high PCDI group had a poor prognosis and was more sensitive to targeted drugs but less sensitive to immunotherapy compared to the low PCDI group. Further enrichment analysis showed that B cell-related pathways were significantly downregulated in the high PCDI group. Accordingly, the decreased tumor immune cell infiltration and the lower tumor tertiary lymphoid structure (TLS) scores were also found in the high PCDI group. Finally, a nomogram with reliable predictive performance PCDI was constructed by incorporating PCDI and clinicopathological characteristics, and a user-friendly online website was established for clinical reference ( https://nomogramiv.shinyapps.io/NomogramPCDI/ ).We performed the first comprehensive analysis of the clinical relevance of genes regulating 13 PCD patterns in LUAD and identified two LUAD molecular subtypes with distinct PCD-related gene signature which indicated differential prognosis and treatment sensitivity. Our study provided a new index to predict the efficacy of therapeutic interventions and the prognosis of LUAD patients for guiding personalized treatments.© 2023.
