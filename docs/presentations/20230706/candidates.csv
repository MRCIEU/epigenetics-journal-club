,Yes,20230706,ewas,37405801,No association between war-related trauma or PTSD symptom severity and epigenome-wide DNA methylation in Burundian refugees.,Eur J Psychotraumatol,"Background:War-related trauma is associated with varying posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) prevalence rates in refugees. In PTSD development, differential DNA methylation (DNAm) levels associated with trauma exposure might be involved in risk versus resilience processes. Studies investigating DNAm profiles related to trauma exposure and PTSD among refugees remain sparse.Objective:The present epigenome-wide association study investigated associations between war-related trauma, PTSD, and altered DNAm patterns in Burundian refugee families with 110 children and their 207 female and male caregivers.Method:War-related trauma load and PTSD symptom severity were assessed in structured clinical interviews with standardised instruments. Epigenome-wide DNAm levels were quantified from buccal epithelia using the Illumina EPIC beadchip.Results:Controlling for biological confounders, no significant epigenome-wide DNAm alterations associated with trauma exposure or PTSD were identified in children or caregivers (FDRs > .05). Co-methylated positions derived as modules from weighted gene correlation network analyses were not significantly associated with either war-related trauma experience in children or caregivers or with PTSD.Conclusions:These results do not provide evidence for altered DNAm patterns associated with exposure to war-related trauma or PTSD."

Trait enrichment analysis revealed that the CpG sites most strongly associated with STB in the present sample were also associated with smoking, alcohol consumption, maternal smoking, and maternal alcohol consumption, whereas pathway enrichment analysis revealed significant associations with circadian rhythm, adherens junction, insulin secretion, and RAP-1 signaling, each of which was recently associated with suicide attempts in a large, independent genome-wide association study of suicide attempts of veterans.Taken together, the present findings suggest thatSLC4A2,CDK5,PDE3A, andRARRES3may play a role in STB. CDK5, a member of the cyclin-dependent kinase family that is highly expressed in the brain and essential for learning and memory, appears to be a particularly promising candidate worthy of future study; however, additional work is still needed to replicate these finding in independent samples.Copyright © 2023 Kimbrel, Garrett, Evans, Mellows, Dennis, Hair, Hauser, the VA Mid-Atlantic MIRECC Workgroup, Ashley-Koch and Beckham."

By performing a genome-wide methylation association analysis of whole peripheral blood from 60 Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease (VKH) patients and 60 healthy controls, we depicted the global DNA methylation status of VKH disease. Further pyrosequencing validation in 160 patients and 159 controls identified 3 aberrant CpG sites in HLA gene regions including cg04026937 and cg18052547 (located in HLA-DRB1 region), and cg13778567 (HLA-DQA1). We also identified 9 aberrant CpG sites in non-HLA gene regions including cg13979407, cg21075643, cg24290586, cg10135747 and cg22707857 (BTNL2), cg22155039 (NOTCH4), cg02605387 (TNXB), cg06255004 (AGPAT2) and cg18855195 (RIBC2). Increased mRNA levels of BTNL2, NOTCH4 and TNXB were identified in VKH patients when compared with healthy controls, consistent with the hypomethylated CpG status in these gene regions. Moreover, seven aberrantly methylated CpG sites may serve as a diagnostic marker for VKH disease (AUC = 84.95%, 95%CI: 79.49%-90.41%).Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
,Yes,20230706,ewas,37393498,Sixteen-Year Longitudinal Evaluation of Blood-Based DNA Methylation Biomarkers for Early Prediction of Alzheimer's Disease.,J Alzheimers Dis,"DNA methylation (DNAm), an epigenetic mark reflecting both inherited and environmental influences, has shown promise for Alzheimer's disease (AD) prediction.Testing long-term predictive ability (>15 years) of existing DNAm-based epigenetic age acceleration (EAA) measures and identifying novel early blood-based DNAm AD-prediction biomarkers.EAA measures calculated from Illumina EPIC data from blood were tested with linear mixed-effects models (LMMs) in a longitudinal case-control sample (50 late-onset AD cases; 51 matched controls) with prospective data up to 16 years before clinical onset, and post-onset follow-up. Novel DNAm biomarkers were generated with epigenome-wide LMMs, and Sparse Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis applied at pre- (10-16 years), and post-AD-onset time-points.EAA did not differentiate cases from controls during the follow-up time (p > 0.05). Three new DNA biomarkers showed in-sample predictive ability on average 8 years pre-onset, after adjustment for age, sex, and white blood cell proportions (ps: 0.022-<0.00001). Our longitudinally-derived panel replicated nominally (p = 0.012) in an external cohort (n = 146 cases, 324 controls). However, its effect size and discriminatory accuracy were limited compared to APOEɛ4-carriership (OR = 1.38 per 1 SD DNAm score increase versus OR = 13.58 for ɛ4-allele carriage; AUCs = 77.2% versus 87.0%). Literature review showed low overlap (n = 4) across 3275 AD-associated CpGs from 8 published studies, and no overlap with our identified CpGs."
,Yes,20230706,ewas,37393279,DNA methylation is differentially associated with glycemic outcomes by different types of weight-loss interventions: an epigenome-wide association study.,Clin Epigenetics,"Alterations in DNA methylation (DNAm) have been reported to be a mechanism by which bariatric surgeries resulted in considerable metabolic improvements. Previous studies have mostly focused on change in DNAm following weight-loss interventions, yet whether DNAm prior to intervention can explain the variability in glycemic outcomes has not been investigated. Here, we aim to examine whether baseline DNAm is differentially associated with glycemic outcomes induced by different types of weight-loss interventions.Participants were 75 adults with severe obesity who underwent non-surgical intensive medical intervention (IMI), adjustable gastric band (BAND) or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) (n = 25 each). Changes in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) were measured at 1-year after intervention. DNAm was quantified by Illumina 450 K arrays in baseline peripheral blood DNA. Epigenome-wide association studies were performed to identify CpG probes that modify the effects of different weight-loss interventions on glycemic outcomes, i.e., changes in FPG and HbA1c, by including an interaction term between types of intervention and DNAm. Models were adjusted for weight loss and baseline clinical factors.Baseline DNAm levels at 3216 and 117 CpGs were differentially associated with changes in FPG and HbA1c, respectively, when comparing RYGB versus IMI. Of these, 79 CpGs were significant for both FPG and HbA1c. The identified genes are enriched in adaptive thermogenesis, temperature homeostasis and regulation of cell population proliferation. Additionally, DNAm at 6 CpGs was differentially associated with changes in HbA1c when comparing RYGB versus BAND.Baseline DNAm is differentially associated with glycemic outcomes in response to different types of weight-loss interventions, independent of weight loss and other clinical factors. Such findings provided initial evidence that baseline DNAm levels may serve as potential biomarkers predictive of differential glycemic outcomes in response to different types of weight-loss interventions.© 2023.

,Yes,20230706,ewas,37356726,DNA methylation partially mediates antidiabetic effects of metformin on HbA1c levels in individuals with type 2 diabetes.,Diabetes Res Clin Pract,"Despite metformin being used as first-line pharmacological therapy for type 2 diabetes, its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We aimed to determine whether metformin altered DNA methylation in newly-diagnosed individuals with type 2 diabetes.We found that metformin therapy is associated with altered methylation of 26 sites in blood from Scandinavian discovery and replication cohorts (FDR < 0.05), using MethylationEPIC arrays. The majority (88%) of these 26 sites were hypermethylated in patients taking metformin for ∼ 3 months compared to controls, who had diabetes but had not taken any diabetes medication. Two of these blood-based methylation markers mirrored the epigenetic pattern in muscle and adipose tissue (FDR < 0.05). Four type 2 diabetes-associated SNPs were annotated to genes with differential methylation between metformin cases and controls, e.g., GRB10, RPTOR, SLC22A18AS and TH2LCRR. Methylation correlated with expression in human islets for two of these genes. Three metformin-associated methylation sites (PKNOX2, WDTC1 and MICB) partially mediate effects of metformin on follow-up HbA1c levels. When combining methylation of these three sites into a score, which was used in a causal mediation analysis, methylation was suggested to mediate up to 32% of metformin's effects on HbA1c.Metformin-associated alterations in DNA methylation partially mediates metformin's antidiabetic effects on HbA1c in newly-diagnosed individuals with type 2 diabetes.Copyright © 2023.

,No,20230706,dnamage,37386259,"The meaning of adaptation in aging: insights from cellular senescence, epigenetic clocks and stem cell alterations.",Nat Aging,"With recent rapid progress in research on aging, there is increasing evidence that many features commonly considered to be mechanisms or drivers of aging in fact represent adaptations. Here, we examine several such features, including cellular senescence, epigenetic aging and stem cell alterations. We draw a distinction between the causes and consequences of aging and define short-term consequences as 'responses' and long-term ones as 'adaptations'. We also discuss 'damaging adaptations', which despite having beneficial effects in the short term, lead to exacerbation of the initial insult and acceleration of aging. Features commonly recognized as 'basic mechanisms of the aging process' are critically examined for the possibility of their adaptation-driven emergence from processes such as cell competition and the wound-like features of the aging body. Finally, we speculate on the meaning of these interactions for the aging process and their relevance for the development of antiaging interventions.© 2023. Springer Nature America, Inc."
,No,20230706,epigenetics,37393564,Biological stability of DNA methylation measurements over varying intervals of time and in the presence of acute stress.,Epigenetics,"Identifying factors that influence the stability of DNA methylation measurements across biological replicates is of critical importance in basic and clinical research. Using a within-person between-group experimental design (n = 31, number of observations = 192), we report the stability of biological replicates over a variety of unique temporal scenarios, both in the absence and presence of acute psychosocial stress, and between individuals who have experienced early life adversity (ELA) and non-exposed individuals. We found that varying time intervals, acute stress, and ELA exposure influenced the stability of repeated DNA methylation measurements. In the absence of acute stress, probes were less stable as time passed; however, stress exerted a stabilizing influence on probes over longer time intervals. Compared to non-exposed individuals, ELA-exposed individuals had significantly lower probe stability immediately following acute stress. Additionally, we found that across all scenarios, probes used in most epigenetic-based algorithms for estimating epigenetic age or immune cell proportions had average or below-average stability, except for the Principal Component and DunedinPACE epigenetic ageing clocks, which were enriched for more stable probes. Finally, using highly stable probes in the absence of stress, we identified multiple probes that were hypomethylated in the presence of acute stress, regardless of ELA status. Two hypomethylated probes are located near the transcription start site of the glutathione-disulfide reductase gene (GSR), which has previously been shown to be an integral part of the stress response to environmental toxins. We discuss implications for future studies concerning the reliability and reproducibility of DNA methylation measurements.Abbreviations:DNAm - DNA methylation, CpG - 5'-cytosine-phosphate-guanine-3,' ICC - Interclass correlation coefficient, ELA - Early-life adversity, PBMCs - Peripheral blood mononuclear cells, mQTL - Methylation quantitative trait loci, TSS - Transcription start site, GSR - Glutathione-disulfide reductase gene, TSST - Trier social stress test, PC - Principal component."
,No,20230706,dnamage,37388854,No evidence of accelerated epigenetic aging among black heroin users: A case vs control analysis.,Addict Neurosci,"This study sought to assess the association between illicit opioid use and accelerated epigenetic aging (A.K.A. DNAm Age) among people of African ancestry who use heroin. DNA was obtained from participants with opioid use disorder (OUD) who confirmed heroin as their primary drug of choice. Clinical inventories of drug use included: the Addiction Severity Index (ASI) Drug-Composite Score (range: 0-1), and Drug Abuse Screening Test (DAST-10; range: 0-10). A control group of participants of African ancestry who did not use heroin was recruited and matched to heroin users on sex, age, socioeconomic level, and smoking status. Methylation data were assessed in an epigenetic clock to determined and compare Epigenetic Age to Chronological Age (i.e., age acceleration or deceleration). Data were obtained from 32 controls [mean age 36.3 (±7.5) years] and 64 heroin users [mean age 48.1 (±6.6) years]. The experimental group used heroin for an average of 18.1 (±10.6) years, reported use of 6.4 (±6.1) bags of heroin/day, with a mean DAST-10 score of 7.0 (±2.6) and ASI Score of 0.33 (±0.19). Mean age acceleration for heroin users [+0.56 (± 9.5) years] was significantly (p< 0.05) lower than controls [+5.19 (± 9.1) years]. This study did not find evidence that heroin use causes epigenetic age acceleration."

However, the biological pathways underlying healthy diet-disease associations are poorly understood. Using an untargeted, large-scale proteomic profiling, we aimed to (1) identify proteins mediating the association between healthy dietary patterns varying in the proportion of macronutrient and lipoproteins, and (2) validate the associations between diet-related proteins and lipoproteins in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study.In 140 adults from the OmniHeart trial, a randomized, cross-over, controlled feeding study with 3 intervention periods (carbohydrate-rich; protein-rich; unsaturated fat-rich dietary patterns), 4,958 proteins were quantified at the end of each diet intervention period using an aptamer assay (SomaLogic). We assessed differences in log2-transformed proteins in 3 between-diet comparisons using paired t-tests, examined the associations between diet-related proteins and lipoproteins using linear regression, and identified proteins mediating these associations using a causal mediation analysis. Levels of diet-related proteins and lipoprotein associations were validated in the ARIC study (n = 11,201) using multivariable linear regression models, adjusting for important confounders.Three between-diet comparisons identified 497 significantly different proteins (protein-rich vs. carbohydrate-rich = 18; unsaturated fat-rich vs. carbohydrate-rich = 335; protein-rich vs. unsaturated fat-rich dietary patterns = 398). Of these, 9 proteins [apolipoprotein M, afamin, collagen alpha-3(VI) chain, chitinase-3-like protein 1, inhibin beta A chain, palmitoleoyl-protein carboxylesterase NOTUM, cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide, guanylate-binding protein 2, COP9 signalosome complex subunit 7b] were positively associated with lipoproteins [high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol (C) = 2; triglyceride = 5; non-HDL-C = 3; total cholesterol to HDL-C ratio = 1]. Another protein, sodium-coupled monocarboxylate transporter 1, was inversely associated with HDL-C and positively associated with total cholesterol to HDL-C ratio. The proportion of the association between diet and lipoproteins mediated by these 10 proteins ranged from 21 to 98%. All of the associations between diet-related proteins and lipoproteins were significant in the ARIC study, except for afamin.We identified proteins that mediate the association between healthy dietary patterns varying in macronutrients and lipoproteins in a randomized feeding study and an observational study.NCT00051350 at clinicaltrials.gov.© 2023.

,No,20230706,methods,37387182,AttOmics: attention-based architecture for diagnosis and prognosis from omics data.,Bioinformatics,"The increasing availability of high-throughput omics data allows for considering a new medicine centered on individual patients. Precision medicine relies on exploiting these high-throughput data with machine-learning models, especially the ones based on deep-learning approaches, to improve diagnosis. Due to the high-dimensional small-sample nature of omics data, current deep-learning models end up with many parameters and have to be fitted with a limited training set. Furthermore, interactions between molecular entities inside an omics profile are not patient specific but are the same for all patients.In this article, we propose AttOmics, a new deep-learning architecture based on the self-attention mechanism. First, we decompose each omics profile into a set of groups, where each group contains related features. Then, by applying the self-attention mechanism to the set of groups, we can capture the different interactions specific to a patient. The results of different experiments carried out in this article show that our model can accurately predict the phenotype of a patient with fewer parameters than deep neural networks. Visualizing the attention maps can provide new insights into the essential groups for a particular phenotype.The code and data are available at https://forge.ibisc.univ-evry.fr/abeaude/AttOmics.

,No,20230706,transgenerational,37396986,Epigenetic Inheritance and Transgenerational Environmental Justice.,Yale J Biol Med,"Many chemicals and toxicants are released into our ecosystem and environment every day, which can cause harmful effects on human populations. Agricultural compounds are used in most crop production and have been shown to cause negative health impacts, including effects on reproduction and other pathologies. Although these chemicals can be helpful for pest and weed control, the compounds indirectly impact humans. Several compounds have been banned in the European Union but continue to be used in the United States. Recent work has shown most toxicants affect transgenerational generations more than the directly exposed generations through epigenetic inheritance. While some toxicants do not impact the directly exposed generation, the later generations that are transgenerational or ancestrally exposed suffer health impacts. Due to impacts to future generations, exposure becomes an environmental justice concern. The term ""environmental justice"" denotes the application of fair strategies when resolving unjust environmental contamination. Fair treatment means that no group should bear a disproportionate share of negative environmental consequences resulting from industrial, municipal, and commercial operations. This article illustrates how research on directly exposed generations is often prioritized over studies on transgenerational generations. However, research on the latter generations suggests the need to take environmental justice concerns seriously moving forward, as future generations could be unduly shouldering harms, while not enjoying benefits of production.Copyright ©2023, Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine."
