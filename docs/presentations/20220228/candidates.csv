"35213289","Pharmacoepigenetics of hypertension: genome-wide methylation analysis of responsiveness to four classes of antihypertensive drugs using a double-blind crossover study design.","Epigenetics","Essential hypertension remains the leading risk factor of global disease burden, but its treatment goals are often not met. We investigated whether DNA methylation is associated with antihypertensive responses to a diuretic, a beta-blocker, a calcium channel blocker or an angiotensin receptor antagonist. In addition, since we previously showed an SNP at the transcription start site (TSS) of the catecholamine biosynthesis-relatedACY3gene to associate with blood pressure (BP) response to beta-blockers, we specifically analysed the association of methylation sites close to theACY3TSS with BP responses to beta-blockers. We conducted an epigenome-wide association study between leukocyte DNA methylation and BP responses to antihypertensive monotherapies in two hypertensive Finnish cohorts: the GENRES (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03276598; amlodipine 5 mg, bisoprolol 5 mg, hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg, or losartan 50 mg daily) and the LIFE-Fin studies (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00338260; atenolol 50 mg or losartan 50 mg daily). The monotherapy groups consisted of approximately 200 individuals each. We identified 64 methylation sites to suggestively associate (P < 1E-5) with either systolic or diastolic BP responses to a particular study drug in GENRES. These associations did not replicate in LIFE-Fin . Three methylation sites close to theACY3TSS were associated with systolic BP responses to bisoprolol in GENRES but not genome-wide significantly (P < 0.05). No robust associations between DNA methylation and BP responses to four different antihypertensive drugs were identified. However, the findings on the methylation sites close to theACY3TSS may support the role ofACY3genetic and epigenetic variation in BP response to bisoprolol."
"35212360","Decoding the sorghum methylome: understanding epigenetic contributions to agronomic traits.","Biochem Soc Trans","DNA methylation is a chromatin modification that plays an essential role in regulating gene expression and genome stability and it is typically associated with gene silencing and heterochromatin. Owing to its heritability, alterations in the patterns of DNA methylation have the potential to provide for epigenetic inheritance of traits. Contemporary epigenomic technologies provide information beyond sequence variation and could supply alternative sources of trait variation for improvement in crops such as sorghum. Yet, compared with other species such as maize and rice, the sorghum DNA methylome is far less well understood. The distribution of CG, CHG, and CHH methylation in the genome is different compared with other species. CG and CHG methylation levels peak around centromeric segments in the sorghum genome and are far more depleted in the gene dense chromosome arms. The genes regulating DNA methylation in sorghum are also yet to be functionally characterised; better understanding of their identity and functional analysis of DNA methylation machinery mutants in diverse genotypes will be important to better characterise the sorghum methylome. Here, we catalogue homologous genes encoding methylation regulatory enzymes in sorghum based on genes in Arabidopsis, maize, and rice. Discovering variation in the methylome may uncover epialleles that provide extra information to explain trait variation and has the potential to be applied in epigenome-wide association studies or genomic prediction. DNA methylation can also improve genome annotations and discover regulatory elements underlying traits. Thus, improving our knowledge of the sorghum methylome can enhance our understanding of the molecular basis of traits and may be useful to improve sorghum performance.© 2022 The Author(s)."
"35210398","Multi-omic characterization of genome-wide abnormal DNA methylation reveals diagnostic and prognostic markers for esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma.","Signal Transduct Target Ther","This study investigates aberrant DNA methylations as potential diagnosis and prognosis markers for esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma (ESCC), which if diagnosed at advanced stages has <30% five-year survival rate. Comparing genome-wide methylation sites of 91 ESCC and matched adjacent normal tissues, we identified 35,577 differentially methylated CpG sites (DMCs) and characterized their distribution patterns. Integrating whole-genome DNA and RNA-sequencing data of the same samples, we found multiple dysregulated transcription factors and ESCC-specific genomic correlates of identified DMCs. Using featured DMCs, we developed a 12-marker diagnostic panel with high accuracy in our dataset and the TCGA ESCC dataset, and a 4-marker prognostic panel distinguishing high-risk patients. In-vitro experiments validated the functions of 4 marker host genes. Together these results provide additional evidence for the important roles of aberrant DNA methylations in ESCC development and progression. Our DMC-based diagnostic and prognostic panels have potential values for clinical care of ESCC, laying foundations for developing targeted methylation assays for future non-invasive cancer detection methods.© 2022.

"35207690","DNA Methylation and Asthma Acquisition during Adolescence and Post-Adolescence, an Epigenome-Wide Longitudinal Study.","J Pers Med","The role of epigenetics in the pathogenesis of asthma acquisition in adolescence and post-adolescence has been unknown. We carried out a longitudinal epigenome-wide association study, using data from the Isle of Wight Birth Cohort (IOWBC). To improve statistical power, we first screened CpGs based on associations of DNA methylation (DNAm) at an age of 10 years (pre-adolescence) with asthma acquisition at 10-18 years (during adolescence). A logistic regression with repeated measures was applied to CpGs that passed screening to examine the associations of pre-adolescence DNAm with asthma acquisition from 10-18 years and 18-26 years, with an interaction term to evaluate transition period specificity. Findings were further tested in an independent birth cohort, ALSPAC. In total, 205 CpGs (with 150 being females) showed associations with asthma acquisition (main or interaction effects) at FDR = 0.05 in IOWBC, of which 112 (90 being females) showed consistent associations in the ALSPAC. Genes that the identified CpGs were mapped to, e.g.,AKAP1andENO1, have been shown to be associated with the risk of asthma. Our findings indicated that DNAm at specific CpGs was associated with asthma acquisition. CpGs showing such associations were likely to be different between males and females and, at certain CpGs, were unique to a specific transition period."
"35205751","Identification of Tissue-Specific Gene Clusters Induced by DNA Demethylation in Lung Adenocarcinoma: More Than Germline Genes.","Cancers (Basel)","Genome-wide loss of DNA methylation is commonly observed in human cancers, but its impact on the tumor transcriptome remains ill-defined. Previous studies demonstrated that this epigenetic alteration causes aberrant activation of a germline-specific gene expression program. Here, we examined if DNA hypomethylation in tumors also leads to de-repression of gene clusters with other tissue specificities. To this end, we explored transcriptomic and methylomic datasets from human lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) cell lines, normal lung, and lung alveolar type II cells, considered as the origin of LUAD. Interestingly, DNA demethylation in LUAD cell lines was associated with activation of not only germline-specific (CG) genes, but also gene clusters displaying specific expression in the gastrointestinal tract (GI), or in stratified epithelia (SE). Consistently, genes from all three clusters showed highly specific patterns of promoter methylation among normal tissues and cell types, and were generally sensitive to induction by a DNA demethylating agent. Analysis of TCGA datasets confirmed that demethylation and activation of CG, GI and SE genes also occurs in vivo in LUAD tumor tissues, in association with global genome hypomethylation. For genes of the GI cluster, we demonstrated that HNF4A is a necessary factor for transcriptional activation following promoter demethylation. Interestingly, expression of several SE genes, in particularFAM83A, correlated with both tumor grade and reduced patient survival. Together, our study uncovers novel cell-type specific gene clusters that become aberrantly activated in LUAD tumors in association with genome-wide hypomethylation."
"35205223","Epigenomic Modifications in Modern and Ancient Genomes.","Genes (Basel)","Epigenetic changes have been identified as a major driver of fundamental metabolic pathways. More specifically, the importance of epigenetic regulatory mechanisms for biological processes like speciation and embryogenesis has been well documented and revealed the direct link between epigenetic modifications and various diseases. In this review, we focus on epigenetic changes in animals with special attention on human DNA methylation utilizing ancient and modern genomes. Acknowledging the latest developments in ancient DNA research, we further discuss paleoepigenomic approaches as the only means to infer epigenetic changes in the past. Investigating genome-wide methylation patterns of ancient humans may ultimately yield in a more comprehensive understanding of how our ancestors have adapted to the changing environment, and modified their lifestyles accordingly. We discuss the difficulties of working with ancient DNA in particular utilizing paleoepigenomic approaches, and assess new paleoepigenomic data, which might be helpful in future studies."
"35205218","Variation in Genotype and DNA Methylation Patterns Based on Alcohol Use and CVD in the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study (KoGES).","Genes (Basel)","Alcohol consumption can increase the risk of chronic diseases, such as myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension. We aimed to assess the association between genotype, DNA methylation patterns, alcohol consumption, and chronic diseases in Korean population. We analyzed 8840 subjects for genotypes and 446 for DNA methylation among the 9351 subjects from the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study (KoGES). We further divided both groups into two sub-groups according to the presence/absence of chronic diseases. We selected genes whose methylation varied significantly with alcohol consumption, and visualized genotype and DNA methylation patterns specific to each group. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) revealed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)rs2074356andrs11066280in HECT domain E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 4 (HECTD4) to be significantly associated with alcohol consumption in both the presence. Thers12229654genotype also displayed significantly different patterns with alcohol consumption. Furthermore, we retrieved differentially methylated regions (DMRs) from four groups based on sex and chronic diseases and compared them by drinking status. In genotype analysis, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) showed a higher proportion in drinker than in non-drinker, but not in DMR analysis. Additionally, we analyzed the enriched Gene Ontology terms and Kyoto Gene and Genome Encyclopedia (KEGG) pathways and visualized the network, heatmap, and upset plot. We show that the pattern of DNA methylation associated with CVD is strongly influenced by alcoholism. Overall, this study identified genetic and epigenetic variants influenced by alcohol consumption and chronic diseases."
"35202405","Stage-differentiated ensemble modeling of DNA methylation landscapes uncovers salient biomarkers and prognostic signatures in colorectal cancer progression.","PLoS One","Aberrant DNA methylation acts epigenetically to skew the gene transcription rate up or down, contributing to cancer etiology. A gap in our understanding concerns the epigenomics of stagewise cancer progression. In this study, we have developed a comprehensive computational framework for the stage-differentiated modelling of DNA methylation landscapes in colorectal cancer (CRC).The methylation β-matrix was derived from the public-domain TCGA data, converted into M-value matrix, annotated with AJCC stages, and analysed for stage-salient genes using an ensemble of approaches involving stage-differentiated modelling of methylation patterns and/or expression patterns. Differentially methylated genes (DMGs) were identified using a contrast against controls (adjusted p-value <0.001 and |log fold-change of M-value| >2), and then filtered using a series of all possible pairwise stage contrasts (p-value <0.05) to obtain stage-salient DMGs. These were then subjected to a consensus analysis, followed by matching with clinical data and performing Kaplan-Meier survival analysis to evaluate the impact of methylation patterns of consensus stage-salient biomarkers on disease prognosis.We found significant genome-wide changes in methylation patterns in cancer cases relative to controls agnostic of stage. The stage-differentiated models yielded the following consensus salient genes: one stage-I gene (FBN1), one stage-II gene (FOXG1), one stage-III gene (HCN1) and four stage-IV genes (NELL1, ZNF135, FAM123A, LAMA1). All the biomarkers were significantly hypermethylated in the promoter regions, indicating down-regulation of expression and implying a putative CpG island Methylator Phenotype (CIMP) manifestation. A prognostic signature consisting of FBN1 and FOXG1 survived all the analytical filters, and represents a novel early-stage epigenetic biomarker / target.We have designed and executed a workflow for stage-differentiated epigenomic analysis of colorectal cancer progression, and identified several stage-salient diagnostic biomarkers, and an early-stage prognostic biomarker panel. The study has led to the discovery of an alternative CIMP-like signature in colorectal cancer, reinforcing the role of CIMP drivers in tumor pathophysiology."
"35199155","Epigenomic and enhancer dysregulation in uterine leiomyomas.","Hum Reprod Update","Uterine leiomyomas, also known as uterine fibroids or myomas, are the most common benign gynecological tumors and are found in women of reproductive and postmenopausal age. There is an exceptionally high prevalence of this tumor in women by the age of 50 years. Black women are particularly affected, with an increased incidence, earlier age of onset, larger and faster growing fibroids and greater severity of symptoms as compared to White women. Although advances in identifying genetic and environmental factors to delineate these fibroids have already been made, only recently has the role of epigenomics in the pathogenesis of this disease been considered.Over recent years, studies have identified multiple epigenomic aberrations that may contribute to leiomyoma development and growth. This review will focus on the most recent discoveries in three categories of epigenomic changes found in uterine fibroids, namely aberrant DNA methylation, histone tail modifications and histone variant exchange, and their translation into altered target gene architecture and transcriptional outcome. The findings demonstrating how the altered 3D shape of the enhancer can regulate gene expression from millions of base pairs away will be discussed. Additionally, translational implications of these discoveries and potential roadblocks in leiomyoma treatment will be addressed.A comprehensive PubMed search was performed to identify published articles containing keywords relevant to the focus of the review, such as: uterine leiomyoma, uterine fibroids, epigenetic alterations, epigenomics, stem cells, chromatin modifications, extracellular matrix [ECM] organization, DNA methylation, enhancer, histone post-translational modifications and dysregulated gene expression. Articles until September 2021 were explored and evaluated to identify relevant updates in the field. Most of the articles focused on in the discussion were published between 2015 and 2021, although some key discoveries made before 2015 were included for background information and foundational purposes. We apologize to the authors whose work was not included because of space restrictions or inadvertent omission.Chemical alterations to the DNA structure and of nucleosomal histones, without changing the underlying DNA sequence, have now been implicated in the phenotypic manifestation of uterine leiomyomas. Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis has revealed subsets of either suppressed or overexpressed genes accompanied by aberrant promoter methylation. Furthermore, differential promoter access resulting from altered 3D chromatin structure and histone modifications plays a role in regulating transcription of key genes thought to be involved in leiomyoma etiology. The dysregulated genes function in tumor suppression, apoptosis, angiogenesis, ECM formation, a variety of cancer-related signaling pathways and stem cell differentiation. Aberrant DNA methylation or histone modification is also observed in altering enhancer architecture, which leads to changes in enhancer-promoter contact strength, producing novel explanations for the overexpression of high mobility group AT-hook 2 and gene dysregulation found in mediator complex subunit 12 mutant fibroids. While many molecular mechanisms and epigenomic features have been investigated, the basis for the racial disparity observed among those in the Black population remains unclear.A comprehensive understanding of the exact pathogenesis of uterine leiomyoma is lacking and requires attention as it can provide clues for prevention and viable non-surgical treatment. These findings will widen our knowledge of the role epigenomics plays in the mechanisms related to uterine leiomyoma development and highlight novel approaches for the prevention and identification of epigenome targets for long-term non-invasive treatment options of this significantly common disease.© The Author(s) 2022.

"35196023","Genome-wide study of DNA methylation shows alterations in metabolic, inflammatory, and cholesterol pathways in ALS.","Sci Transl Med","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease with an estimated heritability between 40 and 50%. DNA methylation patterns can serve as proxies of (past) exposures and disease progression, as well as providing a potential mechanism that mediates genetic or environmental risk. Here, we present a blood-based epigenome-wide association study meta-analysis in 9706 samples passing stringent quality control (6763 patients, 2943 controls). We identified a total of 45 differentially methylated positions (DMPs) annotated to 42 genes, which are enriched for pathways and traits related to metabolism, cholesterol biosynthesis, and immunity. We then tested 39 DNA methylation-based proxies of putative ALS risk factors and found that high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, body mass index, white blood cell proportions, and alcohol intake were independently associated with ALS. Integration of these results with our latest genome-wide association study showed that cholesterol biosynthesis was potentially causally related to ALS. Last, DNA methylation at several DMPs and blood cell proportion estimates derived from DNA methylation data were associated with survival rate in patients, suggesting that they might represent indicators of underlying disease processes potentially amenable to therapeutic interventions."
"35195779","DNA methylation marker to estimate ovarian cancer cell fraction.","Med Oncol","Evaluation of a cancer cell fraction is important for accurate molecular analysis, and pathological analysis is the gold standard for evaluation. Despite the potential convenience, no established molecular markers for evaluation are available. In this study, we aimed to identify ovarian cancer cell fraction markers using DNA methylation highly specific to ovarian cancer cells. Using genome-wide DNA methylation data, we screened candidate marker genes methylated in 30 ovarian cancer FFPE samples and 12 high-grade serous ovarian cancer cell lines, and unmethylated in two female leucocytes and two normal fallopian epithelial cell samples. Methylation levels of two genes, SIM1, and ZNF154, showed high correlation with pathological cancer cell fractions among the 30 ovarian cancer FFPE samples (R = 0.61 for SIM1, 0.71 for ZNF154). For cost-effective analysis of FFPE samples, pyrosequencing primers were designed, and successfully established for SIM1 and ZNF154. Correlation between a pathological cancer cell fraction and methylation levels obtained by pyrosequencing was confirmed to be high (R = 0.53 for SIM1, 0.64 for ZNF154). Finally, an independent validation cohort of 29 ovarian cancer FFPE samples was analyzed. ZNF154 methylation showed a high correlation with the pathological cancer cell fraction (R = 0.77, P < 0.0001). Therefore, the ZNF154 methylation level was considered to be useful for the estimation of ovarian cancer cell fraction, and is expected to help accurate molecular analysis.© 2022.

"35190856","Epimutation in inherited metabolic disorders: the influence of aberrant transcription in adjacent genes.","Hum Genet","Epigenetic diseases can be produced by a stable alteration, called an epimutation, in DNA methylation, in which epigenome alterations are directly involved in the underlying molecular mechanisms of the disease. This review focuses on the epigenetics of two inherited metabolic diseases, epi-cblC, an inherited metabolic disorder of cobalamin (vitamin B12) metabolism, and alpha-thalassemia type α-ZF, an inherited disorder of α2-globin synthesis, with a particular interest in the role of aberrant antisense transcription of flanking genes in the generation of epimutations in CpG islands of gene promoters. In both disorders, the epimutation is triggered by an aberrant antisense transcription through the promoter, which produces an H3K36me3 histone mark involved in the recruitment of DNA methyltransferases. It results from diverse genetic alterations. In alpha-thalassemia type α-ZF, a deletion removes HBA1 and HBQ1 genes and juxtaposes the antisense LUC7L gene to the HBA2 gene. In epi-cblC, the epimutation in the MMACHC promoter is produced by mutations in the antisense flanking gene PRDX1, which induces a prolonged antisense transcription through the MMACHC promoter. The presence of the epimutation in sperm, its transgenerational inheritance via the mutated PRDX1, and the high expression of PRDX1 in spermatogonia but its nearly undetectable transcription in spermatids and spermatocytes, suggest that the epimutation could be maintained during germline reprogramming and despite removal of aberrant transcription. The epivariation seen in the MMACHC promoter (0.95 × 10-3) is highly frequent compared to epivariations affecting other genes of the Online Catalog of Human Genes and Genetic Disorders in an epigenome-wide dataset of 23,116 individuals. This and the comparison of epigrams of two monozygotic twins suggest that the aberrant transcription could also be influenced by post-zygotic environmental exposures.© 2022.

"35188565","Genome-wide characterization of i-motifs and their potential roles in the stability and evolution of transposable elements in rice.","Nucleic Acids Res","I-motifs (iMs) are non-canonical DNA secondary structures that fold from cytosine (C)-rich genomic DNA regions termed putative i-motif forming sequences (PiMFSs). The structure of iMs is stabilized by hemiprotonated C-C base pairs, and their functions are now suspected in key cellular processes in human cells such as genome stability and regulation of gene transcription. In plants, their biological relevance is still largely unknown. Here, we characterized PiMFSs with high potential for i-motif formation in the rice genome by developing and applying a protocol hinging on an iMab antibody-based immunoprecipitation (IP) coupled with high-throughput sequencing (seq), consequently termed iM-IP-seq. We found that PiMFSs had intrinsic subgenomic distributions, cis-regulatory functions and an intricate relationship with DNA methylation. We indeed found that the coordination of PiMFSs with DNA methylation may affect dynamics of transposable elements (TEs) among different cultivated Oryza subpopulations or during evolution of wild rice species. Collectively, our study provides first and unique insights into the biology of iMs in plants, with potential applications in plant biotechnology for improving important agronomic rice traits.© The Author(s) 2022.

However, how DNA methylation regulates phenotypic variation in Hu sheep remains unclear. Therefore, we generated genome-wide DNA methylation and transcriptomic profiles in the ovaries of Hu sheep with different prolificacies and genotypes (FecBB and FecB+). Results showed that ovary DNA methylome and transcriptome were significantly different between high prolificacy and low prolificacy Hu sheep. Comparative methylome analyses identified 10,644, 9,594, and 12,214 differentially methylated regions and 87, 1,121, and 2,375 genes, respectively, showing differential expression levels in three different comparison groups. Female reproduction-associated differentially methylated regions-related genes and differentially expressed genes were enriched, thereby the respective interaction networks were constructed. Furthermore, systematical integrative analyses revealed a negative correlation between DNA methylation around the transcriptional start site and gene expression levels, which was confirmed by testing the expression of integrin β2 subunit (ITGB2) and lysosome-associated protein transmembrane-4 beta (LAPTM4B)in vivoandin vitro. These findings demonstrated that DNA methylation influences the propensity for prolificacy by affecting gene expression in the ovaries, which may contribute to a greater understanding of the epigenome and transcriptome that will be useful for animal breeding.Copyright © 2022 Yao, Li, Wei, EI-Samahy, Feng, Yang and Wang."

In the present study, we constructed two DNA methylomes from pearl oysters with and without conditioning to investigate the molecular mechanism of the pearl oyster Pinctada fucata martensii underlying the pre-grafting condition. A total of 4,594,997 and 4,930,813 methyl CG in the control (Con) and pre-grafting group (PT) were detected, resulting in the whole genome methylation profile and methylation pattern in P. f. martensii. Results reveal that the promoter, especially the CpG island-rich region, was more infrequently methylated than the gene function elements in P. f. martensii. A total of 51,957 differently methylated regions (DMRs) between Con and PT were obtained, including 3789 DMR in the promoter and 16,021 in the gene body. Based on gene ontology and pathway enrichment analyses, these DMRs were mainly related to ""cellular process"", ""metabolic process"", ""Epstein-Barr virus infection"", and ""Fanconi anemia pathway"". The methylation site in the promoter region may be associated with the promoter activity and transcription factor binding. These results help our understanding of the mechanism of pre-grafting condition, thereby providing key information in guiding to improve the conditioning methods for enhanced pearl oyster survival rate after transplantation.Copyright © 2022.

Hence, DNA demethylating agents are promising candidate drugs for chemotherapy against these tumors. The salicylic acid derived anti-inflammatory agent, olsalazine, reportedly suppresses DNA methyltransferase in human cells and has the potential to be clinically applied as a DNA demethylating agent. In this study, we investigated the effects of olsalazine on cell proliferation and DNA methylation using canine lymphoid tumor cell lines (CLBL-1, GL-1, and UL-1). Treatment with olsalazine led to significant cell growth inhibition and increased the apoptotic rate in all three cell lines. Treatment with olsalazine reduced the total amount of 5-methylcytosine in genomic DNA, as assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation revealed that 1,801 to 5,626 CpG sites showed decreased DNA methylation levels in three cell lines, including the promoter regions of ADAM23, FES, and CREB3L1 genes. The outcomes of the present study demonstrate that a DNA demethylating agent olsalazine, inhibits cell proliferation and DNA methylation in canine lymphoid tumor cells, suggesting that it can be a candidate drug for the treatment of lymphoid tumors in dogs.Copyright© by the Polish Academy of Sciences."

"35177605","A late-stage assembly checkpoint of the human mitochondrial ribosome large subunit.","Nat Commun","Many cellular processes, including ribosome biogenesis, are regulated through post-transcriptional RNA modifications. Here, a genome-wide analysis of the human mitochondrial transcriptome shows that 2'-O-methylation is limited to residues of the mitoribosomal large subunit (mtLSU) 16S mt-rRNA, introduced by MRM1, MRM2 and MRM3, with the modifications installed by the latter two proteins being interdependent. MRM2 controls mitochondrial respiration by regulating mitoribosome biogenesis. In its absence, mtLSU particles (visualized by cryo-EM at the resolution of 2.6 Å) present disordered RNA domains, partial occupancy of bL36m and bound MALSU1:L0R8F8:mtACP anti-association module, allowing five mtLSU biogenesis intermediates with different intersubunit interface configurations to be placed along the assembly pathway. However, mitoribosome biogenesis does not depend on the methyltransferase activity of MRM2. Disruption of the MRM2 Drosophila melanogaster orthologue leads to mitochondria-related developmental arrest. This work identifies a key checkpoint during mtLSU assembly, essential to maintain mitochondrial homeostasis.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35177594","Epigenome-wide association study of posttraumatic stress disorder identifies novel loci in U.S. military veterans.","Transl Psychiatry","Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a chronic and disabling psychiatric disorder prevalent in military veterans. Epigenetic mechanisms have been implicated in the etiology of PTSD, with DNA methylation being the most studied to identify novel molecular biomarkers associated with this disorder. We performed one of the largest single-sample epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) of PTSD to date. Our sample included 1135 male European-American U.S. veterans who participated in the National Health and Resilience in Veterans Study (NHRVS). DNA was collected from saliva samples and the Illumina HumanMethylation EPIC BeadChip was used for the methylation analysis. PTSD was assessed using the PTSD Checklist. An EWAS was conducted using linear regression adjusted for age, cell-type proportions, first 10 principal components, and smoking status. After Bonferroni correction, we identified six genome-wide significant (GWS) CpG sites associated with past-month PTSD and three CpGs with lifetime PTSD (prange = 10-10-10-8). These CpG sites map to genes involved in immune function, transcription regulation, axonal guidance, cell signaling, and protein binding. Among these, SENP7, which is involved in transcription regulation and has been linked to risk-taking behavior and alcohol consumption in genome-wide association studies, replicated in an independent veteran cohort and was downregulated in medial orbitofrontal cortex of PTSD postmortem brain tissue. These findings suggest potential epigenetic biomarkers of PTSD that may help inform the pathophysiology of this disorder in veterans and other trauma-affected populations.© 2022.

"35177243","Genetic Evidence Supporting a Causal Role of Depression in Alzheimer's Disease.","Biol Psychiatry","Depression has been associated with a higher risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in several prospective studies; however, mechanisms underlying this association remain unclear.We examined genetic correlation between depression and AD using linkage disequilibrium score regression. We then tested for evidence of causality between depression and AD using Mendelian randomization and genome-wide association study results. Subsequently, cis and trans quantitative trait locus analyses for the depression genome-wide association study signals were performed to resolve the genetic signals to specific DNA methylation sites, brain transcripts, and proteins. These transcripts and proteins were then examined for associations with AD and its endophenotypes. Finally, the associations between depression polygenic risk score and AD endophenotypes were examined.We detected a significant genetic correlation between depression and AD, suggesting that they have a shared genetic basis. Furthermore, we found that depression had a causal role in AD through Mendelian randomization but did not find evidence for a causal role of AD on depression. Moreover, we identified 75 brain transcripts and 28 brain proteins regulated by the depression genome-wide association study signals through quantitative trait locus analyses. Of these, 46 transcripts and seven proteins were associated with rates of cognitive decline over time, AD pathologies, and AD diagnosis in two separate cohorts, thus implicating them in AD. In addition, we found that a higher depression polygenic risk score was associated with a faster decline of episodic memory over time.Depression appears to have a causal role in AD, and this causal relationship is likely driven, in part, by the 53 brain transcripts and proteins identified in this study.Published by Elsevier Inc."
"35177097","Gender-affirming hormone therapy induces specific DNA methylation changes in blood.","Clin Epigenetics","DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark that is influenced by underlying genetic profile, environment, and ageing. In addition to X-linked DNA methylation, sex-specific methylation patterns are widespread across autosomal chromosomes and can be present from birth or arise over time. In individuals where gender identity and sex assigned at birth are markedly incongruent, as in the case of transgender people, feminization or masculinization may be sought through gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT). GAHT is a cornerstone of transgender care, yet no studies to date have investigated its effect on genome-wide methylation. We profiled genome-wide DNA methylation in blood of transgender women (n = 13) and transgender men (n = 13) before and during GAHT (6 months and 12 months into feminizing or masculinizing hormone therapy).We identified several thousand differentially methylated CpG sites (DMPs) (Δβ ≥ 0.02, unadjusted p value < 0.05) and several differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in both people undergoing feminizing and masculinizing GAHT, the vast majority of which were progressive changes over time. X chromosome and sex-specific autosomal DNA methylation patterns established in early development are largely refractory to change in association with GAHT, with only 3% affected (Δβ ≥ 0.02, unadjusted p value < 0.05). The small number of sex-specific DMPs that were affected by GAHT were those that become sex-specific during the lifetime, known as sex-and-age DMPs, including DMRs in PRR4 and VMP1 genes. The GAHT-induced changes at these sex-associated probes consistently demonstrated a shift towards the methylation signature of the GAHT-naïve opposite sex, and we observed enrichment of previously reported adolescence-associated methylation changes.We provide evidence for GAHT inducing a unique blood methylation signature in transgender people. This study advances our understanding of the complex interplay between sex hormones, sex chromosomes, and DNA methylation in the context of immunity. We highlight the need to broaden the field of 'sex-specific' immunity beyond cisgender males and cisgender females, as transgender people on GAHT exhibit a unique molecular profile.© 2022.

"35176993","Multi-omics data integration reveals link between epigenetic modifications and gene expression in sugar beet (Beta vulgaris subsp. vulgaris) in response to cold.","BMC Genomics","DNA methylation is thought to influence the expression of genes, especially in response to changing environmental conditions and developmental changes. Sugar beet (Beta vulgaris ssp. vulgaris), and other biennial or perennial plants are inevitably exposed to fluctuating temperatures throughout their lifecycle and might even require such stimulus to acquire floral competence. Therefore, plants such as beets, need to fine-tune their epigenetic makeup to ensure phenotypic plasticity towards changing environmental conditions while at the same time steering essential developmental processes. Different crop species may show opposing reactions towards the same abiotic stress, or, vice versa, identical species may respond differently depending on the specific kind of stress.In this study, we investigated common effects of cold treatment on genome-wide DNA methylation and gene expression of two Beta vulgaris accessions via multi-omics data analysis. Cold exposure resulted in a pronounced reduction of DNA methylation levels, which particularly affected methylation in CHH context (and to a lesser extent CHG) and was accompanied by transcriptional downregulation of the chromomethyltransferase CMT2 and strong upregulation of several genes mediating active DNA demethylation.Integration of methylomic and transcriptomic data revealed that, rather than methylation having directly influenced expression, epigenetic modifications correlated with changes in expression of known players involved in DNA (de)methylation. In particular, cold triggered upregulation of genes putatively contributing to DNA demethylation via the ROS1 pathway. Our observations suggest that these transcriptional responses precede the cold-induced global DNA-hypomethylation in non-CpG, preparing beets for additional transcriptional alterations necessary for adapting to upcoming environmental changes.© 2022.

Therefore, exploring the relevant genes of pulmonary injury is an important basis for the improvement of survival. In recent years, with the massive production of omics data, a large number of computational methods have been applied in the field of biomedicine. Most of these computational methods are devel-oped for a certain type of diseases or whole diseases. Algorithms that specifically identify genes associated with pulmonary injury have not yet been developed. To fill this gap, we developed a novel method, named AdaRVM, to identify pulmonary injury-related genes in large scale. AdaRVM is the fusion of Adaboost and Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) to achieve fast and high-precision pattern recognition of pulmonary injury genetic mechanism. AdaRVM found that Cavin-2 gene has strong potential to be related to pulmonary injury. As we known, the formation and function of Caveolae are mediated by two family proteins: Caveolin and Cavin. Many studies have explored the role of Caveolin proteins, but people still knew little about Cavin family members. To verify our method and reveal the functions of cavin-2, we integrated six genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data related to lung function traits, four expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTL) data, and one methylation Quantitative Trait Loci (mQTL) data by Summary data level Mendelian Randomization (SMR). We found strong relationship between cavin-2 and canonical signaling pathways ERK1/2, AKT, and STAT3 which are all known to be related to lung injury.Copyright © 2022 Li, Huang, Tang, Liu and Zhou."

Here we examined associations between DNAm and genetic variants to identify methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTLs) across disease states in (i) 402 blood samples from 164 newly diagnosed pediatric CD patients taken at two time points (diagnosis and follow-up), and 74 non-IBD controls (ii) 780 blood samples from a non-CD adult population and (iii) 40 ileal biopsies (17 CD cases and 23 non-IBD controls) from group (i). Genome-wide DNAm profiling and genotyping were performed using the Illumina MethylationEPIC and Illumina Multi-Ethnic arrays. SNP-CpG associations were identified via linear models adjusted for age, sex, disease status, disease subtype, estimated cell proportions, and genotype-based principal components. In total, we observed 535,448 SNP-CpG associations between 287,881 SNPs and 12,843 CpG sites (P<8.21 × 10-14). Associations were highly consistent across different ages, races, disease states, and tissue types, suggesting that the majority of these mQTLs participate in common gene regulation. However, genes near CpGs associated with IBD SNPs were enriched for 18 KEGG pathways relevant to IBD-linked immune function and inflammatory responses. We observed suggestive evidence for a small number of tissue-specific associations and disease-specific associations in ileum, though larger studies will be needed to confirm these results. Our study concludes that the vast majority of blood-derived mQTLs are common across individuals, though a subset may be involved in processes related to CD. Independent cohort studies will be required to validate these findings.© The Author(s) (2022) . Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Genetics Society of America."

Human candidate gene studies (150) and epigenome-wide association studies (68) were systematically evaluated to assess how DNA methylation is impacted by stress during the prenatal period, early childhood and adulthood. The association between DNA methylation ofNR3C1exon 1F and child maltreatment and early life adversity was well demonstrated, but other genes did not exhibit a clear association. The reproducibility of individual CpG sites in epigenome-wide association studies was also poor. However, biological pathways, including stress response, brain development and immunity, have been consistently identified across different stressors throughout the life span. Future studies would benefit from the increased sample size, longitudinal design, standardized methodology, optimal quality control, and improved statistical procedures."

Improving the prediction of incident type 2 diabetes using epigenetic markers could help tailor prevention efforts to those at the highest risk. The aim of this study was to identify predictive methylation markers for incident type 2 diabetes by combining epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) results from five prospective European cohorts.We conducted a meta-analysis of EWASs in blood collected 7-10 years prior to type 2 diabetes diagnosis. DNA methylation was measured with Illumina Infinium Methylation arrays. A total of 1250 cases and 1950 controls from five longitudinal cohorts were included: Doetinchem, ESTHER, KORA1, KORA2 and EPIC-Norfolk. Associations between DNA methylation and incident type 2 diabetes were examined using robust linear regression with adjustment for potential confounders. Inverse-variance fixed-effects meta-analysis of cohort-level individual CpG EWAS estimates was performed using METAL. The methylGSA R package was used for gene set enrichment analysis. Confirmation of genome-wide significant CpG sites was performed in a cohort of Indian Asians (LOLIPOP, UK).The meta-analysis identified 76 CpG sites that were differentially methylated in individuals with incident type 2 diabetes compared with control individuals (p values <1.1 × 10-7). Sixty-four out of 76 (84.2%) CpG sites were confirmed by directionally consistent effects and p values <0.05 in an independent cohort of Indian Asians. However, on adjustment for baseline BMI only four CpG sites remained genome-wide significant, and addition of the 76 CpG methylation risk score to a prediction model including established predictors of type 2 diabetes (age, sex, BMI and HbA1c) showed no improvement (AUC 0.757 vs 0.753). Gene set enrichment analysis of the full epigenome-wide results clearly showed enrichment of processes linked to insulin signalling, lipid homeostasis and inflammation.By combining results from five European cohorts, and thus significantly increasing study sample size, we identified 76 CpG sites associated with incident type 2 diabetes. Replication of 64 CpGs in an independent cohort of Indian Asians suggests that the association between DNA methylation levels and incident type 2 diabetes is robust and independent of ethnicity. Our data also indicate that BMI partly explains the association between DNA methylation and incident type 2 diabetes. Further studies are required to elucidate the underlying biological mechanisms and to determine potential causal roles of the differentially methylated CpG sites in type 2 diabetes development.© 2022.

Clinical features can be inconclusive in mild and unusual WDSTS presentations with variable ID (mild to severe), facies (typical or not) and other associated malformations (bone, cerebral, renal, cardiac and ophthalmological anomalies). Interpretation and classification of rareKMT2Avariants can be challenging. A genome-wide DNA methylation episignature forKMT2A-related syndrome could allow functional classification of variants and provide insights into the pathophysiology of WDSTS. Therefore, we assessed genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in a cohort of 60 patients with clinical diagnosis for WDSTS or Kabuki and identified a unique highly sensitive and specific DNA methylation episignature as a molecular biomarker of WDSTS. WDSTS episignature enabled classification of variants of uncertain significance in theKMT2Agene as well as confirmation of diagnosis in patients with clinical presentation of WDSTS without known genetic variants. The changes in the methylation profile resulting fromKMT2Amutations involve global reduction in methylation in various genes, including homeobox gene promoters. These findings provide novel insights into the molecular etiology of WDSTS and explain the broad phenotypic spectrum of the disease."

This study focused on DNA methylation profiles in a human cohort, comprising 125 nonsmoking city policemen (sampled twice), living and working in three localities (Prague, Ostrava and Ceske Budejovice) of the Czech Republic, who spent the majority of their working time outdoors. The main characterization of the localities, differing by major sources of air pollution, was defined by the stationary air pollution monitoring of PM2.5, B[a]P and NO2. DNA methylation was analyzed by a genome-wide microarray method. No season-specific DNA methylation pattern was discovered; however, we identified 13,643 differentially methylated CpG loci (DML) for a comparison between the Prague and Ostrava groups. The most significant DML was cg10123377 (log2FC = -1.92,p= 8.30 × 10-4) and loci annotated toRPTOR(total 20 CpG loci). We also found two hypomethylated loci annotated to the DNA repair geneXRCC5.Groups of DML annotated to the same gene were linked to diabetes mellitus (KCNQ1), respiratory diseases (PTPRN2), the dopaminergic system of the brain and neurodegenerative diseases (NR4A2). The most significant possibly affected pathway was Axon guidance, with 86 potentially deregulated genes near DML. The cluster of gene sets that could be affected by DNA methylation in the Ostrava groups mainly includes the neuronal functions and biological processes of cell junctions and adhesion assembly. The study demonstrates that the differences in the type of air pollution between localities can affect a unique change in DNA methylation profiles across the human genome."

In addition, recently, the interest in the role of epigenetics has grown significantly, since the exploration of these mechanisms might allow the elucidation of the gene-environment interactions and explanation of missing heritability. In this article, we provide an overview of the most relevant findings regarding the pharmacogenomics and pharmacoepigenomics of lithium response in BD. We describe the most replicated findings among candidate gene studies, results from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) as well as post-GWAS approaches supporting an association between high genetic load for schizophrenia, major depressive disorder or attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder and poor lithium response. Next, we describe results from studies investigating epigenetic mechanisms, such as changes in methylation or noncoding RNA levels, which play a relevant role as regulators of gene expression. Finally, we discuss challenges related to the search for the molecular determinants of lithium response and potential future research directions to pave the path towards a biomarker guided approach in lithium treatment."

There are no generally accepted criteria that distinguish benign, borderline, malignant PT and fibroadenomas. Combined genome-wide DNA methylation and copy number variant (CNV) profiling is an emerging strategy to classify tumors. We compiled a series of patient-derived archival biopsy specimens reflecting the FL spectrum and histological mimickers including clinical follow-up data. DNA methylation and CNVs were determined by well-established microarrays. Comparison of the patterns with a pan-cancer dataset assembled from public resources including ""The Cancer Genome Atlas"" (TCGA) and ""Gene Expression Omnibus"" (GEO) suggests that FLs form a methylation class distinct from both control breast tissue as well as common breast cancers. Complex CNVs were enriched in clinically aggressive FLs. Subsequent fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis detected respective aberrations in the neoplastic mesenchymal component of FLs only, confirming that the epithelial component is non-neoplastic. Of note, our approach could lead to the elimination of the diagnostically problematic category of borderline PT and allow for optimized prognostic patient stratification. Furthermore, the identified recurrent genomic aberrations such as 1q gains (including MDM4), CDKN2a/b deletions, and EGFR amplifications may inform therapeutic decision-making."

Since consortia preprocess data prior to distribution, new processing pipelines can lead to different versions of the same dataset. Similarly, analytic frameworks evolve to incorporate cutting-edge methods and best practices. However, it remains unknown how different data and analytic versions alter the results of epigenome-wide analyses, which could influence the replicability of epigenetic associations. Thus, we assessed the impact of these changes using data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) cohort. We analysed DNA methylation from two data versions, processed using separate preprocessing and analytic pipelines, examining associations between seven childhood adversities or prenatal smoking exposure and DNA methylation at age 7. We performed two sets of analyses: (1) epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS); (2) Structured Life Course Modelling Approach (SLCMA), a two-stage method that models time-dependent effects. SLCMA results were also compared across two analytic versions. Data version changes impacted both EWAS and SLCMA analyses, yielding different associations at conventional p-value thresholds. However, the magnitude and direction of associations was generally consistent between data versions, regardless of p-values. Differences were especially apparent in analyses of childhood adversity, while smoking associations were more consistent using significance thresholds. SLCMA analytic versions similarly altered top associations, but time-dependent effects remained concordant. Alterations to data and analytic versions influenced the results of epigenome-wide analyses. Our findings highlight that magnitude and direction are better measures for replication and stability than p-value thresholds."

Immunological changes originating during reproduction may help explain some of these relationships.To explore the potential role of the immune system in female CoR, we characterized leukocyte composition and regulatory processes using DNA methylation (DNAm) in a cross-sectional cohort of young (20-22 years old) women differing in reproductive status.Compared to nulliparity, pregnancy was characterized by differential methylation at 828 sites, 96% of which were hypomethylated and enriched for genes associated with T-cell activation, innate immunity, pre-eclampsia and neoplasia. Breastfeeding was associated with differential methylation at 1107 sites (71% hypermethylated), enriched for genes involved in metabolism, immune self-recognition and neurogenesis. There were no significant differences in DNAm between nulliparous and parous women. However, compared to nullipara, pregnant women had lower proportions of B, CD4T, CD8T and natural killer (NK) cells, and higher proportions of granulocytes and monocytes. Monocyte counts were lower and NK counts higher among breastfeeding women, and remained so among parous women.Our findings point to widespread differences in DNAm during pregnancy and lactation. These effects appear largely transient, but may accumulate with gravidity become detectable as women age. Nulliparous and parous women differed in leukocyte composition, consistent with more persistent effects of reproduction on cell type. These findings support transient (leukocyte DNAm) and persistent (cell composition) changes associated with reproduction in women, illuminating potential pathways contributing to CoR.Lay Summary:Evolutionary theory and epidemiology support costs of reproduction (CoR) to women's health that may involve changes in immune function. We report differences in immune cell composition and gene regulation during pregnancy and breastfeeding. While many of these differences appear transient, immune cell composition may remain, suggesting mechanisms for female CoR.© The Author(s) 2022.

A systematic analysis of how this variation impacts epigenetic states and expression of the rDNA has thus far not been performed.Using a combination of long- and short-read sequencing, we establish that 45S rDNA units in the C57BL/6J mouse strain exist as distinct genetic haplotypes that influence the epigenetic state and transcriptional output of any given unit. DNA methylation dynamics at these haplotypes are dichotomous and life-stage specific: at one haplotype, the DNA methylation state is sensitive to the in utero environment, but refractory to post-weaning influences, whereas other haplotypes entropically gain DNA methylation during aging only. On the other hand, individual rDNA units in human show limited evidence of genetic haplotypes, and hence little discernible correlation between genetic and epigenetic states. However, in both species, adjacent units show similar epigenetic profiles, and the overall epigenetic state at rDNA is strongly positively correlated with the total rDNA copy number. Analysis of different mouse inbred strains reveals that in some strains, such as 129S1/SvImJ, the rDNA copy number is only approximately 150 copies per diploid genome and DNA methylation levels are < 5%.Our work demonstrates that rDNA-associated genetic variation has a considerable influence on rDNA epigenetic state and consequently rRNA expression outcomes.

Several environmental and physiological factors contribute to the aging process. However, about 40% human life expectancy is inherited among generations, many lifespan associated genes, genetic mechanisms and pathways have been demonstrated during last decades. In the present review, we have evaluated many human genes and their non-human orthologs established for their role in the regulation of lifespan. The study has included more than fifty genes reported in the literature for their contributions to the longevity of life. Intact genomic DNA is essential for the life activities at the level of cell, tissue, and organ. Nucleic acids are vulnerable to oxidative stress, chemotherapies, and exposure to radiations. Efficient DNA repair mechanisms are essential for the maintenance of genomic integrity, damaged DNA is not replicated and transferred to next generations rather the presence of deleterious DNA initiates signaling cascades leading to the cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. DNA modifications, DNA methylation, histone methylation, histone acetylation and DNA damage can eventually lead towards apoptosis. The importance of calorie restriction therapy in the extension of lifespan has also been discussed. The role of pathways involved in the regulation of lifespan such as DAF-16/FOXO (forkhead box protein O1), TOR and JNK pathways has also been particularized.

In this context, epigenetic modifications are discussed as potential regulators explaining how prenatal exposure to GCs might translate into persistent changes of HPA axis ""functioning"". The purpose of this study was to investigate whether DNA methylation and gene expression profiles of stress-associated genes (NR3C1; FKBP5; SLC6A4) may mediate the persistent effects of sGC on cortisol stress reactivity that have been previously observed. In addition, hair cortisol concentrations (hairC) were investigated as a valid biomarker of long-term HPA axis activity. This cross-sectional study comprised 108 term-born children and adolescents, including individuals with antenatal GC treatment and controls. From whole blood, DNA methylation was analyzed by targeted deep bisulfite sequencing. Relative mRNA expression was determined by RT-qPCR experiments and qBase analysis. Acute stress reactivity was assessed by the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) measuring salivary cortisol by ELISA and hairC concentrations were determined from hair samples by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. First, no differences in DNA methylation and mRNA expression levels of the stress-associated genes between individuals treated with antenatal sGC compared to controls were found. Second, DNA methylation and mRNA expression levels were neither associated with cortisol stress reactivity nor with hairC. These findings do not corroborate the belief that DNA methylation and mRNA expression profiles of stress-associated genes (NR3C1; FKBP5; SLC6A4) play a key mediating role of the persistent effects of sGC on HPA axis functioning.© 2022.

First, we used monozygotic (MZ) twins discordant (2 pairs of 4 individuals, 2 boys, mean age 12.5 years) for ADHD to identify candidate DNA methylation sites involved in the development of ADHD. Next, we tried to replicate these candidates in a case-control study (ADHD:N= 18, 15 boys, mean age 10.0 years; Controls:N= 62, 40 boys, mean age 13.9 years). Finally, we examined how methylation rates at those sites relate to the degree of local structural alterations where significant differences were observed between cases and controls. As a result, we identified 61 candidate DNA methylation sites involved in ADHD development in two pairs of discordant MZ twins, among which elevated methylation at a site in the sortilin-related Vps10p domain containing receptor 2 (SorCS2) gene was replicated in the case-control study. We also observed that the ADHD group had significantly reduced gray matter volume (GMV) in the precentral and posterior orbital gyri compared to the control group and that this volume reduction was positively associated withSorCS2methylation. Furthermore, the reduced GMV regions in children with ADHD are involved in language processing and emotional control, whileSorCS2methylation is also negatively associated with emotional behavioral problems in children. These results indicate thatSorCS2methylation might mediate a reduced GMV in the precentral and posterior orbital gyri and therefore influence the pathology of children with ADHD.Copyright © 2022 Fujisawa, Nishitani, Makita, Yao, Takiguchi, Hamamura, Shimada, Okazawa, Matsuzaki and Tomoda."

To test this, we serially passaged mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and assessed changes in DNAm at each time point via reduced representation bisulfite sequencing. By developing a measure that tracked cellular aging in vitro, we tested whether it tracked physiological aging in various mouse tissues and whether anti-aging interventions modulate this measure. Our measure, termed CultureAGE, was shown to strongly increase with age when examined in multiple tissues (liver, lung, kidney, blood, and adipose). As a control, we confirmed that the measure was not a marker of cellular senescence, suggesting that it reflects a distinct yet progressive cellular aging phenomena that can be induced in vitro. Furthermore, we demonstrated slower epigenetic aging in animals undergoing caloric restriction and a resetting of our measure in lung and kidney fibroblasts when re-programmed to iPSCs. Enrichment and clustering analysis implicated EED and Polycomb group (PcG) factors as potentially important chromatin regulators in translational culture aging phenotypes. Overall, this study supports the concept that physiologically relevant aging changes can be induced in vitro and used to uncover mechanistic insights into epigenetic aging.© 2022 The Authors.

"35145550","DNA Epigenetics in Addiction Susceptibility.","Front Genet","Addiction is a chronically relapsing neuropsychiatric disease that occurs in some, but not all, individuals who use substances of abuse. Relatively little is known about the mechanisms which contribute to individual differences in susceptibility to addiction. Neural gene expression regulation underlies the pathogenesis of addiction, which is mediated by epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA modifications. A growing body of work has demonstrated distinct DNA epigenetic signatures in brain reward regions that may be associated with addiction susceptibility. Furthermore, factors that influence addiction susceptibility are also known to have a DNA epigenetic basis. In the present review, we discuss the notion that addiction susceptibility has an underlying DNA epigenetic basis. We focus on major phenotypes of addiction susceptibility and review evidence of cell type-specific, time dependent, and sex biased effects of drug use. We highlight the role of DNA epigenetics in these diverse processes and propose its contribution to addiction susceptibility differences. Given the prevalence and lack of effective treatments for addiction, elucidating the DNA epigenetic mechanism of addiction vulnerability may represent an expeditious approach to relieving the addiction disease burden.Copyright © 2022 Kaplan, Xu, Abreu and Feng."
"35160156","Hematopoiesis, Inflammation and Aging-The Biological Background and Clinical Impact of Anemia and Increased C-Reactive Protein Levels on Elderly Individuals.","J Clin Med","Anemia and systemic signs of inflammation are common in elderly individuals and are associated with decreased survival. The common biological context for these two states is then the hallmarks of aging, i.e., genomic instability, telomere shortening, epigenetic alterations, loss of proteostasis, deregulated nutrient sensing, mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular senescence, stem cell exhaustion and altered intercellular communication. Such aging-associated alterations of hematopoietic stem cells are probably caused by complex mechanisms and depend on both the aging of hematopoietic (stem) cells and on the supporting stromal cells. The function of inflammatory or immunocompetent cells is also altered by aging. The intracellular signaling initiated by soluble proinflammatory mediators (e.g., IL1, IL6 and TNFα) is altered during aging and contributes to the development of both the inhibition of erythropoiesis with anemia as well as to the development of the acute-phase reaction as a systemic sign of inflammation with increased CRP levels. Both anemia and increased CRP levels are associated with decreased overall survival and increased cardiovascular mortality. The handling of elderly patients with inflammation and/or anemia should in our opinion be individualized; all of them should have a limited evaluation with regard to the cause of the abnormalities, but the extent of additional and especially invasive diagnostic evaluation should be based on an overall clinical evaluation and the possible therapeutic consequences."

While OCGB negative patients are unlikely to develop clinically definite (CD) MS, OCGB positivity may lead to an erroneous diagnosis in conditions that present similarly, such as neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD) or neurosarcoidosis.To identify specific, OCGB-complementary, biomarkers to improve diagnostic accuracy in OCGB positive patients.We analysed the CSF metabolome and proteome of CDMS (n=41) and confirmed non-MS patients (n=64) comprising a range of CNS conditions routinely encountered in neurology clinics.OCGB discriminated between CDMS and non-MS with high sensitivity (85%), but low specificity (67%), as previously described. Machine learning methods revealed CCN5 levels provide greater accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity than OCGB (79%, +5%; 90%, +5%; and 72%, +5% respectively) while glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) identified CDMS with 100% specificity (+33%). A multiomics approach improved accuracy further to 90% (+16%).The measurement of a few additional CSF biomarkers could be used to complement OCGB and improve the specificity of MS diagnosis when clinical and radiological evidence of DIT is absent.Copyright © 2022 Probert, Yeo, Zhou, Sealey, Arora, Palace, Claridge, Hillenbrand, Oechtering, Kuhle, Leppert and Anthony."
"35198566","Strategies for High-Efficiency Mutation Using the CRISPR/Cas System.","Front Cell Dev Biol","Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated systems have revolutionized traditional gene-editing tools and are a significant tool for ameliorating gene defects. Characterized by high target specificity, extraordinary efficiency, and cost-effectiveness, CRISPR/Cas systems have displayed tremendous potential for genetic manipulation in almost any organism and cell type. Despite their numerous advantages, however, CRISPR/Cas systems have some inherent limitations, such as off-target effects, unsatisfactory efficiency of delivery, and unwanted adverse effects, thereby resulting in a desire to explore approaches to address these issues. Strategies for improving the efficiency of CRISPR/Cas-induced mutations, such as reducing off-target effects, improving the design and modification of sgRNA, optimizing the editing time and the temperature, choice of delivery system, and enrichment of sgRNA, are comprehensively described in this review. Additionally, several newly emerging approaches, including the use of Cas variants, anti-CRISPR proteins, and mutant enrichment, are discussed in detail. Furthermore, the authors provide a deep analysis of the current challenges in the utilization of CRISPR/Cas systems and the future applications of CRISPR/Cas systems in various scenarios. This review not only serves as a reference for improving the maturity of CRISPR/Cas systems but also supplies practical guidance for expanding the applicability of this technology.Copyright © 2022 Feng, Wang, Li, Xie, Liu, Li, Li, Wang, Hu, Yang and Guo."
"35163268","An Overview of Epigenetics in Obesity: The Role of Lifestyle and Therapeutic Interventions.","Int J Mol Sci","Obesity has become a global epidemic that has a negative impact on population health and the economy of nations. Genetic predispositions have been demonstrated to have a substantial role in the unbalanced energy metabolism seen in obesity. However, these genetic variations cannot entirely explain the massive growth in obesity over the last few decades. Accumulating evidence suggests that modern lifestyle characteristics such as the intake of energy-dense foods, adopting sedentary behavior, or exposure to environmental factors such as industrial endocrine disruptors all contribute to the rising obesity epidemic. Recent advances in the study of DNA and its alterations have considerably increased our understanding of the function of epigenetics in regulating energy metabolism and expenditure in obesity and metabolic diseases. These epigenetic modifications influence how DNA is transcribed without altering its sequence. They are dynamic, reflecting the interplay between the body and its surroundings. Notably, these epigenetic changes are reversible, making them appealing targets for therapeutic and corrective interventions. In this review, I discuss how these epigenetic modifications contribute to the disordered energy metabolism in obesity and to what degree lifestyle and weight reduction strategies and pharmacological drugs can restore energy balance by restoring normal epigenetic profiles."
"35189945","Susceptibility to hormone-mediated cancer is reflected by different tick rates of the epithelial and general epigenetic clock.","Genome Biol","A variety of epigenetic clocks utilizing DNA methylation changes have been developed; these clocks are either tissue-independent or designed to predict chronological age based on blood or saliva samples. Whether discordant tick rates between tissue-specific and general epigenetic clocks play a role in health and disease has not yet been explored.Here we analyze 1941 cervical cytology samples, which contain a mixture of hormone-sensitive cervical epithelial cells and immune cells, and develop the WID general clock (Women's IDentification of risk), an epigenetic clock that is shared by epithelial and immune cells and optimized for cervical samples. We then develop the WID epithelial clock and WID immune clock, which define epithelial- and immune-specific clocks, respectively. We find that the WID-relative-epithelial-age (WID-REA), defined as the difference between the epithelial and general clocks, is significantly reduced in cervical samples from pre-menopausal women with breast cancer (OR 2.7, 95% CI 1.28-5.72). We find the same effect in normal breast tissue samples from pre-menopausal women at high risk of breast cancer and show that potential risk reducing anti-progesterone drugs can reverse this. In post-menopausal women, this directionality is reversed. Hormone replacement therapy consistently leads to a significantly lower WID-REA in cancer-free women, but not in post-menopausal women with breast or ovarian cancer.Our findings imply that there are multiple epigenetic clocks, many of which are tissue-specific, and that the differential tick rate between these clocks may be an informative surrogate measure of disease risk.© 2022.

"35164838","Novel epigenetic network biomarkers for early detection of esophageal cancer.","Clin Epigenetics","Early detection of esophageal cancer is critical to improve survival. Whilst studies have identified biomarkers, their interpretation and validity is often confounded by cell-type heterogeneity.Here we applied systems-epigenomic and cell-type deconvolution algorithms to a discovery set encompassing RNA-Seq and DNA methylation data from esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) patients and matched normal-adjacent tissue, in order to identify robust biomarkers, free from the confounding effect posed by cell-type heterogeneity. We identify 12 gene-modules that are epigenetically deregulated in EAC, and are able to validate all 12 modules in 4 independent EAC cohorts. We demonstrate that the epigenetic deregulation is present in the epithelial compartment of EAC-tissue. Using single-cell RNA-Seq data we show that one of these modules, a proto-cadherin module centered around CTNND2, is inactivated in Barrett's Esophagus, a precursor lesion to EAC. By measuring DNA methylation in saliva from EAC cases and controls, we identify a chemokine module centered around CCL20, whose methylation patterns in saliva correlate with EAC status.Given our observations that a CCL20 chemokine network is overactivated in EAC tissue and saliva from EAC patients, and that in independent studies CCL20 has been found to be overactivated in EAC tissue infected with the bacterium F. nucleatum, a bacterium that normally inhabits the oral cavity, our results highlight the possibility of using DNAm measurements in saliva as a proxy for changes occurring in the esophageal epithelium. Both the CTNND2/CCL20 modules represent novel promising network biomarkers for EAC that merit further investigation.© 2022. The Author(s)."

The accumulation of knowledge about gene function in human and laboratory animals can provide substantial advantage for genomic research in livestock species.In this study, 201,388 pigs from three commercial Danish breeds genotyped with low to medium (8.5k to 70k) SNP arrays were imputed to whole genome sequence variants using a two-step approach. Both imputation steps achieved high accuracies, and in total this yielded 26,447,434 markers on 18 autosomes. The average estimated imputation accuracy of markers with minor allele frequency ≥ 0.05 was 0.94. To overcome the memory consumption of running genome-wide association study (GWAS) for each breed, we performed within-breed subpopulation GWAS then within-breed meta-analysis for average daily weight gain (ADG), followed by a multi-breed meta-analysis of GWAS summary statistics. We identified 15 quantitative trait loci (QTL). Our post-GWAS analysis strategy to prioritize of candidate genes including information like gene ontology, mammalian phenotype database, differential expression gene analysis of high and low feed efficiency pig and human GWAS catalog for height, obesity, and body mass index, we proposed MRAP2, LEPROT, PMAIP1, ENSSSCG00000036234, BMP2, ELFN1, LIG4 and FAM155A as the candidate genes with biological support for ADG in pigs.Our post-GWAS analysis strategy helped to identify candidate genes not just by distance to the lead SNP but also by multiple sources of biological evidence. Besides, the identified QTL overlap with genes which are known for their association with human growth-related traits. The GWAS with this large data set showed the power to map the genetic factors associated with ADG in pigs and have added to our understanding of the genetics of growth across mammalian species.© 2022.

With the exception of SCN5A, encoding the cardiac sodium channel NaV1.5, susceptibility genes remain largely unknown. Here we performed a genome-wide association meta-analysis comprising 2,820 unrelated cases with BrS and 10,001 controls, and identified 21 association signals at 12 loci (10 new). Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-heritability estimates indicate a strong polygenic influence. Polygenic risk score analyses based on the 21 susceptibility variants demonstrate varying cumulative contribution of common risk alleles among different patient subgroups, as well as genetic associations with cardiac electrical traits and disorders in the general population. The predominance of cardiac transcription factor loci indicates that transcriptional regulation is a key feature of BrS pathogenesis. Furthermore, functional studies conducted on MAPRE2, encoding the microtubule plus-end binding protein EB2, point to microtubule-related trafficking effects on NaV1.5 expression as a new underlying molecular mechanism. Taken together, these findings broaden our understanding of the genetic architecture of BrS and provide new insights into its molecular underpinnings.© 2022.

Alterations of immune responses in peripheral blood mononuclear cells play a crucial role in the detrimental progression of COVID-19. However, the effects of host genetic factors on immune responses for severe COVID-19 remain largely unknown.We constructed a computational framework to characterize the host genetics that influence immune cell subpopulations for severe COVID-19 by integrating GWAS summary statistics (N = 969,689 samples) with four independent scRNA-seq datasets containing healthy controls and patients with mild, moderate, and severe symptom (N = 606,534 cells). We collected 10 predefined gene sets including inflammatory and cytokine genes to calculate cell state score for evaluating the immunological features of individual immune cells.We found that 34 risk genes were significantly associated with severe COVID-19, and the number of highly expressed genes increased with the severity of COVID-19. Three cell subtypes that are CD16+monocytes, megakaryocytes, and memory CD8+T cells were significantly enriched by COVID-19-related genetic association signals. Notably, three causal risk genes of CCR1, CXCR6, and ABO were highly expressed in these three cell types, respectively. CCR1+CD16+monocytes and ABO+megakaryocytes with significantly up-regulated genes, including S100A12, S100A8, S100A9, and IFITM1, confer higher risk to the dysregulated immune response among severe patients. CXCR6+memory CD8+ T cells exhibit a notable polyfunctionality including elevation of proliferation, migration, and chemotaxis. Moreover, we observed an increase in cell-cell interactions of both CCR1+CD16+monocytes and CXCR6+memory CD8+T cells in severe patients compared to normal controls among both PBMCs and lung tissues. The enhanced interactions of CXCR6+memory CD8+T cells with epithelial cells facilitate the recruitment of this specific population of T cells to airways, promoting CD8+T cell-mediated immunity against COVID-19 infection.We uncover a major genetics-modulated immunological shift between mild and severe infection, including an elevated expression of genetics-risk genes, increase in inflammatory cytokines, and of functional immune cell subsets aggravating disease severity, which provides novel insights into parsing the host genetic determinants that influence peripheral immune cells in severe COVID-19.© 2022.

However, it remains unclear whether distinct microglia subpopulations or states contribute to different stages of pain development and maintenance. Using single-cell RNA-sequencing, we show that peripheral nerve injury induces the generation of a male-specific inflammatory microglia subtype, and demonstrate increased proliferation of microglia in male as compared to female mice. We also show time- and sex-specific transcriptional changes in different microglial subpopulations following peripheral nerve injury. Apolipoprotein E (Apoe) is the top upregulated gene in spinal cord microglia at chronic time points after peripheral nerve injury in mice. Furthermore, polymorphisms in the APOE gene in humans are associated with chronic pain. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of human spinal cord microglia reveals a subpopulation with a disease-related transcriptional signature. Our data provide a detailed analysis of transcriptional states of mouse and human spinal cord microglia, and identify a link between ApoE and chronic pain in humans.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35181865","Integrating DNA Methylation Measures of Biological Aging into Social Determinants of Health Research.","Curr Environ Health Rep","Acceleration of biological processes of aging is hypothesized to drive excess morbidity and mortality in socially disadvantaged populations. DNA methylation measures of biological aging provide tools for testing this hypothesis.Next-generation DNA methylation measures of biological aging developed to predict mortality risk and physiological decline are more predictive of morbidity and mortality than the original epigenetic clocks developed to predict chronological age. These new measures show consistent evidence of more advanced and faster biological aging in people exposed to socioeconomic disadvantage and may be able to record the emergence of socially determined health inequalities as early as childhood. Next-generation DNA methylation measures of biological aging also indicate race/ethnic disparities in biological aging. More research is needed on these measures in samples of non-Western and non-White populations. New DNA methylation measures of biological aging open opportunities for refining inference about the causes of social disparities in health and devising policies to eliminate them.

However, identifying the functional (or potential causal) variants in the reported risk loci and elucidating their roles in PD pathogenesis remain major challenges. To identify the potential causal (or functional) variants in the reported PD risk loci and to elucidate their regulatory mechanisms, we report a functional genomics study of PD.We first integrated chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) (from neuronal cells and human brain tissues) data and GWAS-identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in PD risk loci. We then conducted a series of experiments and analyses to validate the regulatory effects of these (i.e., functional) SNPs, including reporter gene assays, allele-specific expression (ASE), transcription factor (TF) knockdown, CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome editing, and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis.We identified 44 SNPs (from 11 risk loci) affecting the binding of 12 TFs and we validated the regulatory effects of 15 TF binding-disrupting SNPs. In addition, we also identified the potential target genes regulated by these TF binding-disrupting SNPs through eQTL analysis. Finally, we showed that 4 eQTL genes of these TF binding-disrupting SNPs were dysregulated in PD cases compared with controls.Our study systematically reveals the gene regulatory mechanisms of PD risk variants (including widespread disruption of CTCF binding), generates the landscape of potential PD causal variants, and pinpoints promising candidate genes for further functional characterization and drug development.© 2022.

The risk factors of PTSD included genetic factors; alterations in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis; neurotrophic, serotonergic, dopaminergic, and catecholaminergic systems; and a variety of environmental factors, such as war, accident, natural disaster, pandemic, physical, or sexual abuse, that cause stress or trauma in individuals. To be able to understand the molecular background of PTSD, rodent animal models are widely used by researchers. When looking for a solution for PTSD, it is important to consider preexisting genetic risk factors and physiological, molecular, and biochemical processes caused by trauma that may cause susceptibility to this disorder. In studies, it is reported that epigenetic mechanisms play important roles in the biological response affected by environmental factors, as well as the task of programming cell identity. In this article, we provided an overview of the role of epigenetic modifications in understanding the biology of PTSD. We also summarized the data from animal studies and their importance during the investigation of PTSD. This study shed light on the epigenetic background of stress and PTSD.The Author(s).

This review examines how the authors of MR studies address bias due to pleiotropy in practice. We reviewed Pubmed, Medline, Embase and Web of Science for MR studies published before 21 May 2020 that used at least one single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) gene as instrumental variable (IV) for body mass index, irrespective of the outcome. We reviewed: 1) the approaches used to prevent pleiotropy, 2) the methods cited to detect or control the independence or the exclusion restriction assumption highlighting whether pleiotropy assessment was explicitly stated to justify the use of these methods, and 3) the discussion of findings related to pleiotropy. We included 128 studies, of which thirty-three reported one approach to prevent pleiotropy, such as the use of multiple (independent) SNPs combined in a genetic risk score as IVs. One hundred and twenty studies cited at least one method to detect or account for pleiotropy, including robust and other IV estimation methods (n= 70), methods for detection of heterogeneity between estimated causal effects across IVs (n= 72), methods to detect or account associations between IV and outcome outside thought the exposure (n= 85), and other methods (n= 5). Twenty-one studies suspected IV invalidity, of which 16 explicitly referred to pleiotropy, and six incriminatingFTOSNPs. Most reviewed MR studies have cited methods to prevent or to detect or control bias due to pleiotropy. These methods are heterogeneous, their triangulation should increase the reliability of causal inference.Copyright © 2022 Mbutiwi, Dessy and Sylvestre."
"35165176","Molecular parallelism in signaling function across different sexually selected ornaments in a warbler.","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","Extravagant ornaments are thought to signal male quality to females choosing mates, but the evidence linking ornament size to male quality is controversial, particularly in cases in which females prefer different ornaments in different populations. Here, we use whole-genome sequencing and transcriptomics to determine the genetic basis of ornament size in two populations of a widespread warbler, the common yellowthroat (Geothlypis trichas). Within a single subspecies, females in a Wisconsin population prefer males with larger black masks as mates, while females in a New York population prefer males with larger yellow bibs. Despite being produced by different pigments in different patches on the body, the size of the ornament preferred by females in each population was linked to numerous genes that function in many of the same core aspects of male quality (e.g., immunity and oxidative balance). These relationships confirm recent hypotheses linking the signaling function of ornaments to male quality. Furthermore, the parallelism in signaling function provides the flexibility for different types of ornaments to be used as signals of similar aspects of male quality. This could facilitate switches in female preference for different ornaments, a potentially important step in the early stages of divergence among populations.Copyright © 2022 the Author(s).

"35186169","The Role of ANRIL in Atherosclerosis.","Dis Markers","There is a huge number of noncoding RNA (ncRNA) transcripts in the cell with important roles in modulation of different mechanisms. ANRIL is a long ncRNA with 3.8 kb length that is transcribed in the opposite direction of the INK4/ARF locus in chromosome 9p21. It was shown that polymorphisms within this locus are associated with vascular disorders, notably coronary artery disease (CAD), which is considered as a risk factor for life-threatening events like myocardial infarction and stroke. ANRIL is subjected to a variety of splicing patterns producing multiple isoforms. Linear isoforms could be further transformed into circular ones by back-splicing. ANRIL regulates genes in atherogenic network in a positive or negative manner. This regulation is implemented both locally and remotely. While CAD is known as a proliferative disorder and cell proliferation plays a crucial role in the progression of atherosclerosis, the functions of ANRIL and CAD development are intertwined remarkably. This makes ANRIL a suitable target for diagnostic, prognostic, and even therapeutic aims. In this review, we tried to present a comprehensive appraisal on different aspects of ANRIL including its location, structure, isoforms, expression, and functions. In each step, the contribution of ANRIL to atherosclerosis is discussed.Copyright © 2022 Iman Razeghian-Jahromi et al."

However, its key molecular drivers remain obscure. Here, we perform integrative genomic and clinical profiling of acral melanomas from 104 patients ﻿treated in North America (n = 37) or China (n = 67). We find that recurrent, late-arising focal amplifications of cytoband 22q11.21 are a leading determinant of inferior survival, strongly associated with metastasis, and linked to downregulation of immunomodulatory genes associated with response to immune checkpoint blockade. Unexpectedly, LZTR1 - a known tumor suppressor in other cancers - is a key candidate oncogene in this cytoband. Silencing of LZTR1 in melanoma cell lines causes apoptotic cell death independent of major hotspot mutations or melanoma subtypes. Conversely, overexpression of LZTR1 in normal human melanocytes initiates processes associated with metastasis, including anchorage-independent growth, formation of spheroids, and an increase in MAPK and SRC activities. Our results provide insights into the etiology of acral melanoma and implicate LZTR1 as a key tumor promoter and therapeutic target.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35190730","Sequence determinants of human gene regulatory elements.","Nat Genet","DNA can determine where and when genes are expressed, but the full set of sequence determinants that control gene expression is unknown. Here, we measured the transcriptional activity of DNA sequences that represent an ~100 times larger sequence space than the human genome using massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs). Machine learning models revealed that transcription factors (TFs) generally act in an additive manner with weak grammar and that most enhancers increase expression from a promoter by a mechanism that does not appear to involve specific TF-TF interactions. The enhancers themselves can be classified into three types: classical, closed chromatin and chromatin dependent. We also show that few TFs are strongly active in a cell, with most activities being similar between cell types. Individual TFs can have multiple gene regulatory activities, including chromatin opening and enhancing, promoting and determining transcription start site (TSS) activity, consistent with the view that the TF binding motif is the key atomic unit of gene expression.© 2022.

"35158828","Alternative Splicing, Epigenetic Modifications and Cancer: A Dangerous Triangle, or a Hopeful One?","Cancers (Basel)","The alteration of epigenetic modifications often causes cancer onset and development. In a similar way, aberrant alternative splicing may result in oncogenic products. These issues have often been individually reviewed, but there is a growing body of evidence for the interconnection of both causes of cancer. Actually, aberrant splicing may result from abnormal epigenetic signalization and epigenetic factors may be altered by alternative splicing. In this way, the interrelation between epigenetic marks and alternative splicing form the base of a triangle, while cancer may be placed at the vertex. The present review centers on the interconnections at the triangle base, i.e., between alternative splicing and epigenetic modifications, which may result in neoplastic transformations. The effects of different epigenetic factors, including DNA and histone modifications, the binding of non-coding RNAs and the alterations of chromatin organization on alternative splicing resulting in cancer are first considered. Other less-frequently considered questions, such as the epigenetic regulation of the splicing machinery, the aberrant splicing of epigenetic writers, readers and erasers, etc., are next reviewed in their connection with cancer. The knowledge of the above-mentioned relationships has allowed increasing the collection of biomarkers potentially useful as cancer diagnostic and/or prognostic tools. Finally, taking into account on one hand that epigenetic changes are reversible, and some epigenetic drugs already exist and, on the other hand, that drugs intended for reversing aberrations in alternative splicing, therapeutic possibilities for breaking the mentioned cancer-related triangle are discussed."
"35198660","Epigenetic mechanisms impacted by chronic stress across the rodent lifespan.","Neurobiol Stress","Exposures to stress at all stages of development can lead to long-term behavioural effects, in part through changes in the epigenome. This review describes rodent research suggesting that stress in prenatal, postnatal, adolescent and adult stages leads to long-term changes in epigenetic regulation in the brain which have causal impacts on rodent behaviour. We focus on stress-induced epigenetic changes that have been linked to behavioural deficits including poor learning and memory, and increased anxiety-like and depressive-like behaviours. Interestingly, aspects of these stress-induced behavioural changes can be transmitted to offspring across several generations, a phenomenon that has been proposed to result via epigenetic mechanisms in the germline. Here, we also discuss evidence for the differential impact of stress on the epigenome in males and females, conscious of the fact that the majority of published studies have only investigated males. This has led to a limited picture of the epigenetic impact of stress, highlighting the need for future studies to investigate females as well as males.© 2022 The Authors."

They also exhibited increased levels of Cu and decreased of Zn, well represented by the Cu:Zn ratio which was higher in the acute patients than in both non-acute patients (p = 0.001) and healthy controls (p < 0.001), with no statistical difference between the last two groups. The Cu:Zn ratio (log scale) positively correlated with CRP (log scale; r = 0.581, p < 0.001) and NLR (r = 0.436, p = 0.003).Current results demonstrate that abnormal dynamics of Cu and Zn levels in serum occur early during the course of COVID-19 disease, and are mainly associated with the inflammation response.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier GmbH.

Outcomes were measured using House-Brackmann (H-B) grade for least 6 months after treatment was finished and conducted until full recovery was achieved. (3) Results: There was no significant difference in the rate of favorable recovery (H-B grade 1 or 2) between the surgery group and the conservative treatment group (75% vs. 70.0%,p> 0.05). Although H-B grade improvement occurred in both groups, the degree of improvement was not significantly different between groups. (4) Conclusions: Facial nerve decompression surgery in severe Bell's palsy patients did not significantly improve prognosis beyond that offered by conservative treatment alone. Additional surgical decompression may not be necessary in patients with severe Bell's palsy if they receive sufficient conservative treatment."
"35187179","Senescence in chronic wounds and potential targeted therapies.","Burns Trauma","Chronic wounds (e.g. diabetic wounds, pressure wounds, vascular ulcers, etc.) do not usually heal in a timely and orderly manner but rather last for years and may lead to irreversible adverse events, resulting in a substantial financial burden for patients and society. Recently, a large amount of evidence has proven that cellular senescence has a crucial influence on chronic nonhealing wounds. As a defensive mechanism, cell senescence is a manner of cell-cycle arrest with increased secretory phenotype to resist death, preventing cells from stress-induced damage in cancer and noncancer diseases. A growing amount of research has advanced the perception of cell senescence in various chronic wounds and focuses on pathological and physiological processes and therapies targeting senescent cells. However, previous reviews have failed to sum up novel understandings of senescence in chronic wounds and emerging strategies targeting senescence. Herein, we discuss the characteristics and mechanisms of cellular senescence and the link between senescence and chronic wounds as well as some novel antisenescence strategies targeting other diseases that may be applied for chronic wounds.© The Author(s) 2022.

STIL has been found disordered in multiple cancers and driven carcinogenesis. However, the molecular mechanisms and biological functions of STIL in cancers remain ambiguous. Here, we systematically analyzed the genetic alterations, molecular mechanisms, and clinical relevance of STIL across >10,000 samples representing 33 cancer types in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset. We found that STIL expression is up-regulated in most cancer types compared with their adjacent normal tissues. The expression dysregulation of STIL was affected by copy number variation, mutation, and DNA methylation. High STIL expression was associated with worse outcomes and promoted the progression of cancers. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) further revealed that STIL is involved in cell cycle progression, Mitotic spindle, G2M checkpoint, and E2F targets pathways across cancer types. STIL expression was negatively correlated with multiple genes taking part in ciliogenesis and was positively correlated with several genes which participated with centrosomal duplication or cilia degradation. Moreover, STIL silencing could promote primary cilia formation and inhibit cell cycle protein expression in prostate and kidney cancer cell lines. The phenotype and protein expression alteration due to STIL silencing could be reversed by IFT88 silencing in cancer cells. These results revealed that STIL could regulate the cell cycle through primary cilia in tumor cells. In summary, our results revealed the importance of STIL in cancers. Targeting STIL might be a novel therapeutic approach for cancers.Copyright © 2022 Li, Yang, Qi, Liu, Liu, Gao, Li, Zhu, Zhang, Du and Zhang."

However, the potential roles of the crosstalk between these RNA modification ""writers"" in the tumor microenvironment (TME) remain unclear. The RNA modification patterns were identified using an unsupervised clustering method. Subsequently, based on differentially expressed genes responsible for the aforementioned RNA modification patterns, an RNA modification ""writer"" scoring model (W_Score) was constructed to quantify the RNA modification-associated subtypes in individual patients. Moreover, a correlation analysis for W_Score and the TME characteristics, clinical features, molecular subtypes, drug sensitivities, immune responses, and prognosis was performed. We identified three RNA modification patterns, corresponding to distinct tumor immune microenvironment characteristics and survival outcomes. Based on the W_Score score, which was extracted from the RNA modification-related signature genes, patients with SKCM were divided into high- and low-W_Score groups. The low-W_Score group was characterized by better survival outcomes and strengthened immunocyte infiltration. Further analysis showed that the low-W_Score group was positively associated with higher tumor mutation burden and PD-L1 expression. Of note, two immunotherapy cohorts demonstrated that patients with low W_Score exhibited long-term clinical benefits and an enhanced immune response. This study is the first to systematically analyze four types of A-related RNA modifications in SKCM, revealing that these ""writers"" essentially contribute to TME complexity and diversity. We quantitatively evaluated the RNA modification patterns in individual tumors, which could aid in developing personalized immunotherapy strategies for patients.Copyright © 2022 Zhang, Xiong, Zheng, Long, Zhou, Zeng, Ouyang and Tang."

Although known as a tumor suppressor, KDM6A's therapeutic potential in the metastasis of BCa remains elusive. It also remains difficult to fulfill the effective up-regulation of KDM6A levels in bladder tumor tissues in situ to verify its potential in treating BCa metastasis. Here, we report a mucoadhesive messenger RNA (mRNA) nanoparticle (NP) strategy for the intravesical delivery ofKDM6A-mRNA in mice bearing orthotopicKdm6a-null BCa and show evidence of KDM6A's therapeutic potential in inhibiting the metastasis of BCa. Through this mucoadhesive mRNA NP strategy, the exposure ofKDM6A-mRNA to the in situ BCa tumors can be greatly prolonged for effective expression, and the penetration can be also enhanced by adhering to the bladder for sustained delivery. This mRNA NP strategy is also demonstrated to be effective for combination cancer therapy with other clinically approved drugs (e.g., elemene), which could further enhance therapeutic outcomes. Our findings not only report intravesical delivery of mRNA via a mucoadhesive mRNA NP strategy but also provide the proof-of-concept for the usefulness of these mRNA NPs as tools in both mechanistic understanding and translational study of bladder-related diseases.Copyright © 2022 the Author(s).

"35130723","Local Rather than Global H3K27me3 Dynamics Are Associated with Differential Gene Expression in Verticillium dahliae.","mBio","Differential growth conditions typically trigger global transcriptional responses in filamentous fungi. Such fungal responses to environmental cues involve epigenetic regulation, including chemical histone modifications. It has been proposed that conditionally expressed genes, such as those that encode secondary metabolites but also effectors in pathogenic species, are often associated with a specific histone modification, lysine27 methylation of H3 (H3K27me3). However, thus far, no analyses on the global H3K27me3 profiles have been reported under differential growth conditions in order to assess if H3K27me3 dynamics govern differential transcription. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) and RNA sequencing data from the plant-pathogenic fungus Verticillium dahliae grown in threein vitrocultivation media, we now show that a substantial number of the identified H3K27me3 domains globally display stable profiles among these growth conditions. However, we observe local quantitative differences in H3K27me3 ChIP-seq signals that are associated with a subset of differentially transcribed genes between media. Comparing thein vitroresults to expression during plant infection suggests thatin planta-induced genes may require chromatin remodeling to achieve expression. Overall, our results demonstrate that some loci display H3K27me3 dynamics associated with concomitant transcriptional variation, but many differentially expressed genes are associated with stable H3K27me3 domains. Thus, we conclude that while H3K27me3 is required for transcriptional repression, it does not appear that transcriptional activation requires the global erasure of H3K27me3. We propose that the H3K27me3 domains that do not undergo dynamic methylation may contribute to transcription through other mechanisms or may serve additional genomic regulatory functions.IMPORTANCEIn many organisms, including filamentous fungi, epigenetic mechanisms that involve chemical and physical modifications of DNA without changing the genetic sequence have been implicated in transcriptional responses upon developmental or environmental cues. In fungi, facultative heterochromatin that can decondense to allow transcription in response to developmental changes or environmental stimuli is characterized by the trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27me3), and H3K27me3 has been implicated in transcriptional regulation, although the precise mechanisms and functions remain enigmatic. Based on ChIP and RNA sequencing data, we show for the soilborne broad-host-range vascular wilt plant-pathogenic fungus Verticillium dahliae that although some loci display H3K27me3 dynamics that can contribute to transcriptional variation, other loci do not show such a dependence. Thus, although we recognize that H3K27me3 is required for transcriptional repression, we also conclude that this mark is not a conditionally responsive global regulator of differential transcription upon responses to environmental cues."

Intriguingly, Arg457Gln variant carriers also demonstrate paradoxical reductions in diabetes risk, indicating that the gene has a critical role in whole-body metabolism. To study the function of this variant in more detail, we generated mice on an FVB/N background with theCrebrfArg458Gln variant knocked in to replace the endogenousCrebrf. The whole-body metabolic phenotype was characterized for male and female mice on a regular chow diet or an 8-week high-fat challenge. Regular assessment of body composition found that theCrebrfvariant had no influence on total body weight or fat mass at any time point. Glucose tolerance tests demonstrated no obvious genotype effect on glucose homeostasis, with indirect calorimetry measures of whole-body energy expenditure likewise unaffected. Male chow-fed variant carriers displayed a trend towards increased lean mass and significantly reduced sensitivity to insulin administration. Overall, this novel mouse model showed only limited phenotypic effects associated with theCrebrfmissense variant. The inability to recapitulate results of human association studies may invite reconsideration of the precise mechanistic link between CREBRF function and the risks of obesity and diabetes in variant allele carriers."
"35177608","Spatiotemporal dynamics of clonal selection and diversification in normal endometrial epithelium.","Nat Commun","It has become evident that somatic mutations in cancer-associated genes accumulate in the normal endometrium, but spatiotemporal understanding of the evolution and expansion of mutant clones is limited. To elucidate the timing and mechanism of the clonal expansion of somatic mutations in cancer-associated genes in the normal endometrium, we sequence 1311 endometrial glands from 37 women. By collecting endometrial glands from different parts of the endometrium, we show that multiple glands with the same somatic mutations occupy substantial areas of the endometrium. We demonstrate that ""rhizome structures"", in which the basal glands run horizontally along the muscular layer and multiple vertical glands rise from the basal gland, originate from the same ancestral clone. Moreover, mutant clones detected in the vertical glands diversify by acquiring additional mutations. These results suggest that clonal expansions through the rhizome structures are involved in the mechanism by which mutant clones extend their territories. Furthermore, we show clonal expansions and copy neutral loss-of-heterozygosity events occur early in life, suggesting such events can be tolerated many years in the normal endometrium. Our results of the evolutionary dynamics of mutant clones in the human endometrium will lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms of endometrial regeneration during the menstrual cycle and the development of therapies for the prevention and treatment of endometrium-related diseases.© 2022.

These processes can be investigated by extracting relevant mutational patterns from sequencing data.Here, we present the next version of MutationalPatterns, an R/Bioconductor package, which allows in-depth mutational analysis of catalogues of single and double base substitutions as well as small insertions and deletions. Major features of the package include the possibility to perform regional mutation spectra analyses and the possibility to detect strand asymmetry phenomena, such as lesion segregation. On top of this, the package also contains functions to determine how likely it is that a signature can cause damaging mutations (i.e., mutations that affect protein function). This updated package supports stricter signature refitting on known signatures in order to prevent overfitting. Using simulated mutation matrices containing varied signature contributions, we showed that reliable refitting can be achieved even when only 50 mutations are present per signature. Additionally, we incorporated bootstrapped signature refitting to assess the robustness of the signature analyses. Finally, we applied the package on genome mutation data of cell lines in which we deleted specific DNA repair processes and on large cancer datasets, to show how the package can be used to generate novel biological insights.This novel version of MutationalPatterns allows for more comprehensive analyses and visualization of mutational patterns in order to study the underlying processes. Ultimately, in-depth mutational analyses may contribute to improved biological insights in mechanisms of mutation accumulation as well as aid cancer diagnostics.

We need to better understand the collective characteristics and behaviours of those who are overweight or have obesity and how these differ from those who maintain a healthy weight.Using the UK Biobank cohort we develop an obesity classification system using k-means clustering. Variable selection from the UK Biobank cohort is informed by the Foresight obesity system map across key domains (Societal Influences, Individual Psychology, Individual Physiology, Individual Physical Activity, Physical Activity Environment).Our classification identifies eight groups of people, similar in respect to their exposure to known drivers of obesity: 'Younger, urban hard-pressed', 'Comfortable, fit families', 'Healthy, active and retirees', 'Content, rural and retirees', 'Comfortable professionals', 'Stressed and not in work', 'Deprived with less healthy lifestyles' and 'Active manual workers'. Pen portraits are developed to describe the characteristics of these different groups. Multinomial logistic regression is used to demonstrate that the classification can effectively detect groups of individuals more likely to be living with overweight or obesity. The group identified as 'Comfortable, fit families' are observed to have a higher proportion of healthy weight, while three groups have increased relative risk of being overweight or having obesity: 'Active manual workers', 'Stressed and not in work' and 'Deprived with less healthy lifestyles'.This paper presents the first study of UK Biobank participants to adopt this obesity system approach to characterising participants. It provides an innovative new approach to better understand the complex drivers of obesity which has the potential to produce meaningful tools for policy makers to better target interventions across the whole system to reduce overweight and obesity.© 2022.

They often target the nuclear receptor family of transcription factors modulating their levels and activity. Many high-throughput assays have been developed to query such toxicants; however, single-cell analysis of EDC effects on endogenous receptors has been missing, in part due to the lack of quality control metrics to reproducibly measure cell-to-cell variability in responses.We began by developing single-cell imaging and informatic workflows to query whether the single cell distribution of the estrogenreceptor-α(ER), used as a model system, can be used to measure effects of EDCs in a sensitive and reproducible manner.We used high-throughput microscopy, coupled with image analytics to measure changes in single cell ER nuclear levels on treatment with∼100toxicants, over a large number of biological and technical replicates.We developed a two-tiered quality control pipeline for single cell analysis and tested it against a large set of biological replicates, and toxicants from the EPA and Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry lists. We also identified a subset of potentially novel EDCs that were active only on the endogenous ER level and activity as measured by single molecule RNA fluorescencein situhybridization (RNA FISH).We demonstrated that the distribution of ER levels per cell, and the changes upon chemical challenges were remarkably stable features; and importantly, these features could be used for quality control and identification of endocrine disruptor toxicants with high sensitivity. When coupled with orthogonal assays, ER single cell distribution is a valuable resource for high-throughput screening of environmental toxicants. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP9297."

However, the relationship between slow nucleosome unwrapping dynamics and bulk transcriptional properties has not been thoroughly explored. Here, an agent-based model that we call the dynamic defect Totally Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process (ddTASEP) was constructed to investigate the effects of nucleosome-induced pausing on transcriptional dynamics. Pausing due to slow nucleosome dynamics induced RNAPII convoy formation, which would cooperatively prevent nucleosome rebinding leading to bursts of transcription. The mean first passage time (MFPT) and the variance of first passage time (VFPT) were analytically expressed in terms of the nucleosome rate constants, allowing for the direct quantification of the effects of nucleosome-induced pausing on pioneering polymerase dynamics. The mean first passage elongation rate γ(hc, ho) is inversely proportional to the MFPT and can be considered to be a new axis of the ddTASEP phase diagram, orthogonal to the classical αβ-plane (where α and β are the initiation and termination rates). Subsequently, we showed that, for β = 1, there is a novel jamming transition in the αγ-plane that separates the ddTASEP dynamics into initiation-limited and nucleosome pausing-limited regions. We propose analytical estimates for the RNAPII density ρ, average elongation rate v, and transcription flux J and verified them numerically. We demonstrate that the intra-burst RNAPII waiting times tin follow the time-headway distribution of a max flux TASEP and that the average inter-burst interval [Formula: see text] correlates with the index of dispersion De. In the limit γ→0, the average burst size reaches a maximum set by the closing rate hc. When α≪1, the burst sizes are geometrically distributed, allowing large bursts even while the average burst size [Formula: see text] is small. Last, preliminary results on the relative effects of static and dynamic defects are presented to show that dynamic defects can induce equal or greater pausing than static bottle necks."

The origin of MDSCs is debated, and the regulatory pattern responsible for gMDSC differentiation remains unknown. Since DNA methylation (DNAm) contributes to lineage differentiation, we have investigated whether it contributes to the acquisition of the gMDSC phenotype.Using the Illumina EPIC array to measure DNAm of gMDSCs and neutrophils from diverse neonatal and adult blood sources, we found 189 differentially methylated CpGs between gMDSCs and neutrophils with a core of ten differentially methylated CpGs that were consistent across both sources of cells. Genes associated with these loci that are involved in immune responses include VCL, FATS, YAP1, KREMEN2, UBTF, MCC-1, and EFCC1. In two cancer patient groups that reflected those used to develop the methylation markers (head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and glioma), all of the CpG loci were differentially methylated, reaching statistical significance in glioma cases and controls, while one was significantly different in the smaller HNSCC group.Our findings indicate that gMDSCs have a core of distinct DNAm alterations, informing future research on gMDSC differentiation and function.© 2022.

While evidence for gene × parental behavior interactions on children's early EF is growing, researchers have called the quality of evidence provided by gene × environment interaction studies into question. For this reason, this review comprehensively examined the literature and evaluated the evidence for gene × parental behavior interactions on children's early EF abilities. Psychology and psychiatry databases were searched for published peer-reviewed studies. A total of 18 studies met inclusion criteria. Twenty-nine of 89 (33%) examined interactions were significant. However, a p-curve analysis did not find the significant interactions to be of evidential value. A high rate of false positives, due to the continued use of candidate gene and haplotype measures of child genotype and small sample sizes, likely contributed to the high rate of significant interactions and low evidential value. The use of contemporary molecular genetic measures and larger sample sizes are necessary to advance our understanding of child genotype as a moderator of parental effects on children's EF during early childhood and the biopsychosocial mechanisms underlying children's EF development during this critical period. Without these changes, future research is likely to be stymied by the same limitations as current research.© 2022.

However, connection between the emerging regulatory complexity and expression and phenotypic diversity in polyploid crops remains elusive. Here, we use diverse wheat accessions to map expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and evaluate their effects on the population-scale variation in homoeolog expression dosage. The relative contribution of cis- and trans-eQTL to homoeolog expression variation is strongly affected by both selection and demographic events. Though trans-acting effects play major role in expression regulation, the expression dosage of homoeologs is largely influenced by cis-acting variants, which appear to be subjected to selection. The frequency and expression of homoeologous gene alleles showing strong expression dosage bias are predictive of variation in yield-related traits, and have likely been impacted by breeding for increased productivity. Our study highlights the importance of genomic variants affecting homoeolog expression dosage in shaping agronomic phenotypes and points at their potential utility for improving yield in polyploid crops.© 2022.

Early diagnosis of AMI and interventional treatment can significantly reduce myocardial damage. However, owing to limitations in sensitivity and specificity, existing myocardial markers are not efficient for early identification of AMI. Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWASs) have shown excellent performance in identifying significant gene-trait associations and several cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Furthermore, ferroptosis is a major driver of ischaemic injury in the heart. However, its specific regulatory mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we screened three Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets of peripheral blood samples to assess the efficiency of ferroptosis-related genes (FRGs) for early diagnosis of AMI. To the best of our knowledge, for the first time, TWAS and mRNA expression data were integrated in this study to identify 11 FRGs specifically expressed in the peripheral blood of patients with AMI. Subsequently, using multiple machine learning algorithms, an optimal prediction model for AMI was constructed, which demonstrated satisfactory diagnostic efficiency in the training cohort (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.794) and two external validation cohorts (AUC = 0.745 and 0.711).

The β (p-value) was 0.8082 (0.255) for Q2-Q3, 1.6930 (0.022) for Q1-Q2, and 2.2190 (0.004) for < Q1 compared to the reference quartile (≥ Q3). The ptrendwas 0.002.Summarily, methylation at cg19693031 was inversely associated with fasting blood glucose in a dose-dependent manner. The inverse association was more prominent in rs841853-CC individuals, suggesting that rs841853 could modulate the association between cg19693031 methylation and FBG. Our results suggest that genetic variants may be involved in epigenetic mechanisms associated with FBG, a hallmark of diabetes. Therefore, integrating genetic and epigenetic data may provide more insight into the early-onset of diabetes.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35086934","Cis-regulatory hubs: a new 3D model of complex disease genetics with an application to schizophrenia.","Life Sci Alliance","The 3D conformation of the chromatin creates complex networks of noncoding regulatory regions (distal elements) and promoters impacting gene regulation. Despite the importance of the role of noncoding regions in complex diseases, little is known about their interplay within regulatory hubs and implication in multigenic diseases such as schizophrenia. Here we show that cis-regulatory hubs (CRHs) in neurons highlight functional interactions between distal elements and promoters, providing a model to explain epigenetic mechanisms involved in complex diseases. CRHs represent a new 3D model, where distal elements interact to create a complex network of active genes. In a disease context, CRHs highlighted strong enrichments in schizophrenia-associated genes, schizophrenia-associated SNPs, and schizophrenia heritability compared with equivalent structures. Finally, CRHs exhibit larger proportions of genes differentially expressed in schizophrenia compared with promoter-distal element pairs or TADs. CRHs thus capture causal regulatory processes improving the understanding of complex disease etiology such as schizophrenia. These multiple lines of genetic and statistical evidence support CRHs as 3D models to study dysregulation of gene expression in complex diseases more generally.© 2022 Mangnier et al."
"35199043","Stability of polygenic scores across discovery genome-wide association studies.","HGG Adv","Polygenic scores (PGS) are commonly evaluated in terms of their predictive accuracy at the population level by the proportion of phenotypic variance they explain. To be useful for precision medicine applications, they also need to be evaluated at the individual level when phenotypes are not necessarily already known. We investigated the stability of PGS in European American (EUR) and African American (AFR)-ancestry individuals from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort and the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study using different discovery genome-wide association study (GWAS) results for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), type 2 diabetes (T2D), and height. We found that pairs of EUR-ancestry GWAS for the same trait had genetic correlations >0.92. However, PGS calculated from pairs of same-ancestry and different-ancestry GWAS had correlations that ranged from <0.01 to 0.74. PGS stability was greater for height than for PTSD or T2D. A series of height GWAS in the UK Biobank suggested that correlation between PGS is strongly dependent on the extent of sample overlap between the discovery GWAS. Focusing on the upper end of the PGS distribution, different discovery GWAS do not consistently identify the same individuals in the upper quantiles, with the best case being 60% of individuals above the 80th percentile of PGS overlapping from one height GWAS to another. The degree of overlap decreases sharply as higher quantiles, less heritable traits, and different-ancestry GWAS are considered. PGS computed from different discovery GWAS have only modest correlation at the individual level, underscoring the need to proceed cautiously with integrating PGS into precision medicine applications.© 2022 The Authors."

Genome-wide association studies using large population cohorts can be a first step towards identifying patients prone to infectious diseases and targets for new therapies. Genetic variants associated with clinically relevant entities of bacterial and viral infections (e.g., abdominal infections, respiratory infections, and sepsis) in 337,484 participants of the UK Biobank cohort were explored by genome-wide association analyses. Cases (n = 81,179) were identified based on ICD-10 diagnosis codes of hospital inpatient and death registries. Functional annotation was performed using gene expression (eQTL) data. Fifty-seven unique genome-wide significant loci were found, many of which are novel in the context of infectious diseases. Some of the detected genetic variants were previously reported associated with infectious, inflammatory, autoimmune, and malignant diseases or key components of the immune system (e.g., white blood cells, cytokines). Fine mapping of the HLA region revealed significant associations with HLA-DQA1, HLA-DRB1, and HLA-DRB4 locus alleles. PPP1R14A showed strong colocalization with abdominal infections and gene expression in sigmoid and transverse colon, suggesting causality. Shared significant loci across infections and non-infectious phenotypes in the UK Biobank cohort were found, suggesting associations for example between SNPs identified for abdominal infections and CRP, rheumatoid arthritis, and diabetes mellitus. We report multiple loci associated with bacterial and viral infections. A better understanding of the genetic determinants of bacterial and viral infections can be useful to identify patients at risk and in the development of new drugs.© 2022. The Author(s)."

It is unclear to what extent the comorbidity could be explained by shared genetic aetiology.We used GWAS data to estimate shared genetic aetiology between schizophrenia, cardiometabolic, and inflammation-related traits: fasting insulin (FI), fasting glucose, glycated haemoglobin, glucose tolerance, type 2 diabetes (T2D), lipids, body mass index (BMI), coronary artery disease (CAD), and C-reactive protein (CRP). We examined genome-wide correlation using linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC); stratified by minor-allele frequency using genetic covariance analyzer (GNOVA); then refined to locus-level using heritability estimation from summary statistics (ρ-HESS). Regions with local correlation were used in hypothesis prioritization multi-trait colocalization to examine for colocalisation, implying common genetic aetiology.We found evidence for weak genome-wide negative correlation of schizophrenia with T2D (rg= -0.07; 95% C.I., -0.03,0.12;P= .002) and BMI (rg= -0.09; 95% C.I., -0.06, -0.12;P= 1.83 × 10-5). We found a trend of evidence for positive genetic correlation between schizophrenia and cardiometabolic traits confined to lower-frequency variants. This was underpinned by 85 regions of locus-level correlation with evidence of opposing mechanisms. Ten loci showed strong evidence of colocalization. Four of those (rs6265 (BDNF); rs8192675 (SLC2A2); rs3800229 (FOXO3); rs17514846 (FURIN)) are implicated in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-related pathways.LDSC may lead to downwardly-biased genetic correlation estimates between schizophrenia, cardiometabolic, and inflammation-related traits. Common genetic aetiology for these traits could be confined to lower-frequency common variants and involve opposing mechanisms. Genes related to BDNF and glucose transport amongst others may partly explain the comorbidity between schizophrenia and cardiometabolic disorders.© The Author(s) 2022.

In this study, we estimate the genetic parameters of five milk-related traits of cows-namely, milk yield (MY), milk fat percentage (MFP), milk fat yield (MFY), milk protein percentage (MPP), and milk protein yield (MPY)-based on a random regression test-day model. A total of 95,375 test-day records of 9,834 cows in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River were used for the estimation. In addition, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) for these traits were conducted, based on adjusted phenotypes. The heritability, as well as the standard errors, of MY, MFP, MFY, MPP, and MPY during lactation ranged from 0.22 ± 0.02 to 0.31 ± 0.04, 0.06 ± 0.02 to 0.15 ± 0.03, 0.09 ± 0.02 to 0.28 ± 0.04, 0.07 ± 0.01 to 0.16 ± 0.03, and 0.14 ± 0.02 to 0.27 ± 0.03, respectively, and the genetic correlations between different days in milk (DIM) within lactations decreased as the time interval increased. Two, six, four, six, and three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected, which explained 5.44, 12.39, 8.89, 10.65, and 7.09% of the phenotypic variation in MY, MFP, MFY, MPP, and MPY, respectively. Ten Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways and 25 Gene Ontology terms were enriched by analyzing the nearest genes and genes within 200 kb of the detected SNPs. Moreover, 17 genes in the enrichment results that may play roles in milk production and quality were selected as candidates, includingCAMK2G,WNT3A,WNT9A,PLCB4,SMAD9,PLA2G4A,ARF1,OPLAH,MGST1,CLIP1,DGAT1,PRMT6,VPS28,HSF1,MAF1,TMEM98, andF7.

We derived automated estimates of mitral valve annular diameter in the 4-chamber view from 32,220 MRI images from the UK Biobank at ventricular systole and diastole as the basis for GWAS. Mitral annular dimensions corresponded to previously described anatomical norms, and GWAS inclusive of 4 population strata identified 10 loci, including possibly novel loci (GOSR2, ERBB4, MCTP2, MCPH1) and genes related to cardiac contractility (BAG3, TTN, RBFOX1). ATAC-Seq of primary mitral valve tissue localized multiple variants to regions of open chromatin in biologically relevant cell types and rs17608766 to an algorithmically predicted enhancer element in GOSR2. We observed strong genetic correlation with measures of contractility and mitral valve disease and clinical correlations with heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, and ventricular arrhythmias. Polygenic scoring of mitral valve annular diameter in systole was predictive of risk mitral valve prolapse across 4 cohorts. In summary, genetic and clinical studies of mitral valve annular diameter revealed genetic determinants of mitral valve biology, while highlighting clinical associations. Polygenic determinants of mitral valve annular diameter may represent an independent risk factor for mitral prolapse. Overall, computationally estimated phenotypes derived at scale from medical imaging represent an important substrate for genetic discovery and clinical risk prediction."
"35197631","Ancient DNA and deep population structure in sub-Saharan African foragers.","Nature","Multiple lines of genetic and archaeological evidence suggest that there were major demographic changes in the terminal Late Pleistocene epoch and early Holocene epoch of sub-Saharan Africa1-4. Inferences about this period are challenging to make because demographic shifts in the past 5,000 years have obscured the structures of more ancient populations3,5. Here we present genome-wide ancient DNA data for six individuals from eastern and south-central Africa spanning the past approximately 18,000 years (doubling the time depth of sub-Saharan African ancient DNA), increase the data quality for 15 previously published ancient individuals and analyse these alongside data from 13 other published ancient individuals. The ancestry of the individuals in our study area can be modelled as a geographically structured mixture of three highly divergent source populations, probably reflecting Pleistocene interactions around 80-20 thousand years ago, including deeply diverged eastern and southern African lineages, plus a previously unappreciated ubiquitous distribution of ancestry that occurs in highest proportion today in central African rainforest hunter-gatherers. Once established, this structure remained highly stable, with limited long-range gene flow. These results provide a new line of genetic evidence in support of hypotheses that have emerged from archaeological analyses but remain contested, suggesting increasing regionalization at the end of the Pleistocene epoch.© 2022.

This effectively evaluates the number of ancestral and derived alleles present on each branch and reports the most likely placement of an ancient sample in the phylogeny and a haplogroup assignment, together with alternatives and supporting evidence. To illustrate the application of pathPhynder, we show improved Y chromosome assignments for published aDNA sequences, using a newly compiled Y variation data set (120,908 markers from 2,014 samples) that significantly enhances Y haplogroup assignment for low coverage samples. We apply the method to all published male aDNA samples from Africa, giving new insights into ancient migrations and the relationships between ancient and modern populations.

We apply both approaches to the same twin sample, considering both Alzheimer's disease polygenic risk scores and heritability from twin models, to provide insight into the role of measured genetic variants and to quantify uncaptured genetic risk. A population-based heritability and polygenic association study of Alzheimer's disease was conducted between 1986 and 2016 and is the first study to incorporate polygenic risk scores into biometrical twin models of Alzheimer's disease. The sample included 1586 twins drawn from the Swedish Twin Registry which were nested within 1137 twin pairs (449 complete pairs and 688 incomplete pairs) with clinically based diagnoses and registry follow-up (Mage = 85.28, SD = 7.02; 44% male; 431 cases and 1155 controls). We report contributions of polygenic risk scores atP < 1 × 10-5, considering a full polygenic risk score (PRS), PRS without theAPOEregion (PRS.no.APOE) and PRS.no.APOE plus directly measuredAPOEalleles. Biometric twin models estimated the contribution of environmental influences and measured (PRS) and unmeasured genes to Alzheimer's disease risk. The full PRS and PRS.no.APOE contributed 10.1 and 2.4% to Alzheimer's disease risk, respectively. WhenAPOEɛ4 alleles were added to the model with the PRS.no.APOE, the total contribution was 11.4% to Alzheimer's disease risk, whereAPOEɛ4 explained 9.3% and PRS.no.APOE dropped from 2.4 to 2.1%. The total genetic contribution to Alzheimer's disease risk, measured and unmeasured, was 71% while environmental influences unique to each twin accounted for 29% of the risk. TheAPOEregion accounts for much of the measurable genetic contribution to Alzheimer's disease, with a smaller contribution from other measured polygenic influences. Importantly, substantial background genetic influences remain to be understood.© The Author(s) 2022. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Guarantors of Brain."

"35186326","Role of epigenetic transgenerational inheritance in generational toxicology.","Environ Epigenet","Many environmental toxicants have been shown to be associated with the transgenerational inheritance of increased disease susceptibility. This review describes the generational toxicity of some of these chemicals and their role in the induction of epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease. Epigenetic factors include DNA methylation, histone modifications, retention of histones in sperm, changes to chromatin structure, and expression of non-coding RNAs. For toxicant-induced epigenetic transgenerational inheritance to occur, exposure to a toxicant must result in epigenetic changes to germ cells (sperm or eggs) since it is the germ cells that carry molecular information to subsequent generations. In addition, the epigenetic changes induced in transgenerational generation animals must cause alterations in gene expression in these animals' somatic cells. In some cases of generational toxicology, negligible changes are seen in the directly exposed generations, but increased disease rates are seen in transgenerational descendants. Governmental policies regulating toxicant exposure should take generational effects into account. A new approach that takes into consideration generational toxicity will be needed to protect our future populations.© The Author(s) 2022. Published by Oxford University Press."

Developmental alterations and stage-specific DNA methylation during gametogenesis from primordial germ cells (PGCs) to mature sperm are investigated. Individual developmental stage germ cells were isolated and analyzed for differential DNA methylation regions (DMRs). The number of DMRs was highest in the first three comparisons with mature PGCs, prospermatogonia, and spermatogonia. The most statistically significant DMRs were present at all stages of development and had variations involving both increases or decreases in DNA methylation. DMR-associated genes were identified and correlated with gene functional categories, pathways, and cellular processes. Observations identified a dynamic cascade of epigenetic changes during development that is dramatic during the early developmental stages. Complex epigenetic alterations are required to regulate genome biology and gene expression during gametogenesis.© 2022 The Authors."

Social Baseline Theory suggests that, for humans, social context and the social resources therein are a central ecology in human phylogeny. In ontogeny, this manifests in flexible bioenergetic strategies that vary in the population based on social history. We introduce yielding, a conservation process wherein we relax physiological investment in response to a challenge when in the presence of a relational partner. The availability of these conserved resources then impact response to subsequent challenges while alone and if this pattern is habitual, it can reciprocally influence strategies used to solve or cope with typical stress. We discuss neural targets of this resource conservation and reframe our lab's previous studies on the social regulation of neural threat responding within this framework. We then show functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data indicating the presence of relational partners decreases blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) response to threat in key targets of resource conservation (e.g, dlPFC, dACC, and insula) and that stronger signal reduction in these areas coincide with less BOLD in pre-frontal (vmPFC, dlPFC) and visuo-sensory integration (occipital cortex, precuneus, superior parietal lobule) regions during ostracism. Finally, we show that these neural relationships are associated with less use of self-regulation-based coping strategiestwo yearspost scanning. Taken together, we show the utility of yielding both as a concept and as a bioenergetic process which helps to conserve energy in this social primate."

We investigated associations between three single nucleotide polymorphisms in the MOR geneOPRM1(rs1799971, rs2281617, and rs510769) and subjective responses to smoked cannabis. Fifty-two regular cannabis users (1-4 days/week) were given a cannabis cigarette (12.5% THC) and rated their subjective responses on visual analog scales at baseline and at multiple time points after smoking. Blood samples were collected for THC quantification. There was a significant impact of the intronic variant rs510769 on subjective cannabis effects and THC blood levels. The influence of this gene variant may thus be mediated by pharmacodynamics and/or pharmacokinetic factors. We provide novel evidence that variability inOPRM1contributes to individual responses to cannabis and may affect risk of cannabis use disorder. Our findings add to the growing body of literature on the genetic basis of individual responses to cannabis and may have implications for targeting the endogenous opioid system in the treatment of cannabis use disorder.AJTR Copyright © 2022."

The epigenetic layer of DNA methylation shows dynamic developmental changes and molecular memory of in utero experiences, particularly in placenta, a fetal tissue discarded at birth. However, current array-based methods to identify novel ASD risk genes lack coverage of the most structurally and epigenetically variable regions of the human genome.We use whole genome bisulfite sequencing in placenta samples from prospective ASD studies to discover a previously uncharacterized ASD risk gene, LOC105373085, renamed NHIP. Out of 134 differentially methylated regions associated with ASD in placental samples, a cluster at 22q13.33 corresponds to a 118-kb hypomethylated block that replicates in two additional cohorts. Within this locus, NHIP is functionally characterized as a nuclear peptide-encoding transcript with high expression in brain, and increased expression following neuronal differentiation or hypoxia, but decreased expression in ASD placenta and brain. NHIP overexpression increases cellular proliferation and alters expression of genes regulating synapses and neurogenesis, overlapping significantly with known ASD risk genes and NHIP-associated genes in ASD brain. A common structural variant disrupting the proximity of NHIP to a fetal brain enhancer is associated with NHIP expression and methylation levels and ASD risk, demonstrating a common genetic influence.Together, these results identify and initially characterize a novel environmentally responsive ASD risk gene relevant to brain development in a hitherto under-characterized region of the human genome.© 2022.

Recently, new chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) techniques have been developed to allow the analysis of histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) and transcription factor (TF) distribution in FFPE tissues. The application of ChIP to genome-wide chromatin studies using real archival samples represents an unprecedented opportunity to conduct retrospective clinical studies thanks to the possibility of accessing large cohorts of samples and their associated diagnostic records. However, although recent attempts to standardize have been made, fixation and storage conditions of clinical specimens are still extremely variable and can affect the success of chromatin studies.

We performed a joint study of gene expression and DNA methylation of brain tissue originating from the human prefrontal cortex of individuals across the lifespan to describe changes in cellular programs and their regulation by epigenetic mechanisms. The analysis considers previous knowledge in terms of functional gene signatures and chromatin states derived from independent studies, aging profiles of a battery of chromatin modifying enzymes, and data of gliomas and neuropsychological disorders for a holistic view on the development and aging of the brain. Expression and methylation changes from babies to elderly adults decompose into different modes associated with the serial activation of (brain) developmental, learning, metabolic and inflammatory functions, where methylation in gene promoters mostly represses transcription. Expression of genes encoding methylome modifying enzymes is very diverse reflecting complex regulations during lifetime which also associates with the marked remodeling of chromatin between permissive and restrictive states. Data of brain cancer and psychotic disorders reveal footprints of pathophysiologies related to brain development and aging. Comparison of aging brains with gliomas supports the view that glioblastoma-like and astrocytoma-like tumors exhibit higher cellular plasticity activated in the developing healthy brain while oligodendrogliomas have a more stable differentiation hierarchy more resembling the aged brain. The balance and specific shifts between volatile and stable and between more irreversible and more plastic epigenomic networks govern the development and aging of healthy and diseased brain."

We reveal that the formation of heterochromatin domains requires cohesin turnover on DNA. Stabilization of cohesin on DNA through depletion of its release factor WAPL leads to a near-complete loss of heterochromatin domains. We observe the opposite phenotype in cells deficient for subunits of the Mediator-CDK module, with an almost binary partition of the genome into dense H3K9me3 domains, and regions devoid of H3K9me3 spanning the rest of the genome. We suggest that the Mediator-CDK module might contribute to gene expression by limiting the formation of dense heterochromatin domains. WAPL deficiency prevents the formation of heterochromatin domains, and allows for gene expression even in the absence of the Mediator-CDK subunit MED12. We propose that cohesin and Mediator affect heterochromatin in different ways to enable the correct distribution of epigenetic marks, and thus to ensure proper gene expression.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35124428","The independent prognostic value of global epigenetic alterations: An analysis of single-cell ATAC-seq of circulating leukocytes from trauma patients followed by validation in whole blood leukocyte transcriptomes across three etiologies of critical illness.","EBioMedicine","While bulk and single cell transcriptomic patterns in circulating leukocytes from trauma patients have been reported, how these relate to changes in open chromatin patterns remain unstudied. Here, we investigated whether single-cell ATAC-seq would provide further resolution of transcriptomic patterns that align with patient outcomes.We performed scATAC-seq on peripheral blood mononuclear cells from four trauma patients at <4 h, 24 h, 72 h post-injury and four matched healthy controls, and extracted the features associated with the global epigenetic alterations. Three large-scale bulk transcriptomic datasets from trauma, burn and sepsis patients were used to validate the scATAC-seq derived signature, explore patient epigenetic heterogeneity (Epigenetic Groups: EG_hi vs. EG_lo), and associate patterns with clinical outcomes in critical illness.Patient subsets with gene expression patterns in blood leukocytes representative of a high global epigenetic signature (EG_hi) had worse outcomes across three etiologies of critical illness. EG_hi designation contributed independent of the known immune leukocyte transcriptomic responses to patient prognosis (Trauma: HR=0.62 [95% CI: 0.43-0.89, event set as recovery], p=0.01, n=167; Burns: HR=4.35 [95% CI: 0.816-23.2, event set as death], p=0.085, n=121; Sepsis: HR=1.60 [95% CI: 1.10-2.33, event set as death], p=0.013, n=479; Cox proportional hazards regression).The inclusion of gene expression patterns that associate with global epigenetic changes in circulating leukocytes improves the resolution of transcriptome-based patient classification in acute critical illnesses. Early detection of both the global epigenetic signature and the known immune transcriptomic patterns associates with the worse prognosis in trauma, burns and sepsis.Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

"35108261","Identification of potential functional variants and genes at 18q21.1 associated with the carcinogenesis of colorectal cancer.","PLoS Genet","Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified more than 160 susceptibility loci for colorectal cancer (CRC). The effects of these variants, particularly their mechanisms, however, remain unclear. In this study, a comprehensive functional annotation of CRC-related GWAS signals was firstly conducted to identify the potential causal variants. We found that the SNP rs7229639 in intron 3 of SMAD7 at 18q21.1 might serve as a putative functional variant in CRC. The SNP rs7229639 is located in a region with evidence of regulatory potential. Dual-luciferase reporter assays revealed that three other SNPs (rs77544449, rs60385309 and rs72917785), in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) with rs7229639, exhibited allele-specific enhancer activity, of which one of the target genes may conceivably be LIPG, as suggested by eQTL association data and Hi-C data. We also verified that LIPG promoted malignancy of CRC cells in vitro, with supporting clinical data indicating that LIPG is upregulated and correlated with a poor prognosis in CRC. Finally, pitavastatin was observed to exhibit an anti-CRC activity and modest inhibition of LIPG mRNA levels. Collectively, our data suggest that these functional variants at 18q21.1 are involved in the pathogenesis of CRC by modulating enhancer activity, and possibly LIPG expression, thus indicating a promising therapeutic target for CRC. The results of functional annotation in our investigation could also serve as an inventory for CRC susceptibility SNPs and offer guides for post-GWAS downstream functional studies."
"35163689","Chronic Inflammation as the Underlying Mechanism of the Development of Lung Diseases in Psoriasis: A Systematic Review.","Int J Mol Sci","Psoriasis is a systemic inflammatory disease caused by dysfunctional interactions between the innate and adaptive immune responses. The systemic inflammation in psoriasis may be associated with the development of comorbidities, including lung diseases. In this review, we aimed to provide a summary of the evidence regarding the prevalence of lung diseases in patients with psoriasis and the potential underlying mechanisms. Twenty-three articles published between March 2010 and June 2021 were selected from 195 initially identified records. The findings are discussed in terms of the prevalence of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, interstitial lung disease, obstructive sleep apnea, pulmonary hypertension, and sarcoidosis in psoriasis. A higher prevalence of lung diseases in psoriasis has been confirmed in asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, obstructive sleep apnea, and pulmonary hypertension. These conditions are important as they are previously unrecognized causes of morbidity and mortality in psoriasis. The development of lung diseases in patients with psoriasis can be explained by several mechanisms, including common risk factors, shared immune and molecular characteristics associated with chronic inflammation, as well as other mechanisms. Understanding the prevalence of lung diseases in psoriasis and their underlying mechanisms can help implement appropriate preventative and therapeutic strategies to address respiratory diseases in patients with psoriasis."

Here, we used single-cell multiomics sequencing to simultaneously analyze the DNA methylome, chromatin accessibility and transcriptome in individual tumor cells of PDAC patients. We identified normal epithelial cells in the tumor lesion, which have euploid genomes, normal patterns of DNA methylation, and chromatin accessibility. Using all these normal epithelial cells as controls, we determined that DNA demethylation in the cancer genome was strongly enriched in heterochromatin regions but depleted in euchromatin regions. There were stronger negative correlations between RNA expression and promoter DNA methylation in cancer cells compared to those in normal epithelial cells. Through in-depth integrated analyses, a set of novel candidate biomarkers were identified, including ZNF667 and ZNF667-AS1, whose expressions were linked to a better prognosis for PDAC patients by affecting the proliferation of cancer cells. Our work systematically revealed the critical epigenomic features of cancer cells in PDAC patients at the single-cell level.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35198879","p53-mediated neurodegeneration in the absence of the nuclear protein Akirin2.","iScience","Proper gene regulation is critical for both neuronal development and maintenance as the brain matures. We previously demonstrated that Akirin2, an essential nuclear protein that interacts with transcription factors and chromatin remodeling complexes, is required for the embryonic formation of the cerebral cortex. Here we show that Akirin2 plays a mechanistically distinct role in maintaining healthy neurons during cortical maturation. Restricting Akirin2 loss to excitatory cortical neurons resulted in progressive neurodegeneration via necroptosis and severe cortical atrophy with age. Comparing transcriptomes from Akirin2-null postnatal neurons and cortical progenitors revealed that targets of the tumor suppressor p53, a regulator of both proliferation and cell death encoded byTrp53, were consistently upregulated. Reduction ofTrp53rescued neurodegeneration in Akirin2-null neurons. These data: (1) implicate Akirin2 as a critical neuronal maintenance protein, (2) identify p53 pathways as mediators of Akirin2 functions, and (3) suggest Akirin2 dysfunction may be relevant to neurodegenerative diseases.© 2022 The Author(s)."
"35154497","Dysfunction of striatal MeCP2 is associated with cognitive decline in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.","Theranostics","Rationale:Cerebral Methyl-CpG binding Protein 2 (MeCP2) is involved in several psychiatric disorders that are concomitant with cognitive dysfunction. However, the regulatory function of striatal MeCP2 and its association with Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been largely neglected due to the absence of amyloid plaque accumulation in the striatal region until the later stages of AD progression. Considerable evidence indicates that neuropsychiatric symptoms related to cognitive decline are involved with striatal dysfunction. To this respect, we investigated the epigenetic function of striatal MeCP2 paralleling the pathogenesis of AD.Methods:We investigated the brain from amyloid precursor protein (APP)/presenilin1 (PS1) transgenic mice and postmortem brain samples from normal subjects and AD patients. The molecular changes in the brain, particularly in the striatal regions, were analyzed with thioflavin S staining, immunohistochemistry, immunoblotting, and MeCP2 chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq). The cognitive function of APP/PS1 mice was assessed via three behavioral tests: 3-chamber test (3CT), Y-maze test (YMT), and passive avoidance test (PA). A multi-electrode array (MEA) was performed to analyze the neuronal activity of the striatum in APP/PS1 mice.Results:Striatal MeCP2 expression was increased in the younger (6 months) and older (10 months) ages of APP/PS1 mice, and the genome-wide occupancy of MeCP2 in the younger APP/PS1 showed dysregulated binding patterns in the striatum. Additionally, we confirmed that APP/PS1 mice showed behavioral deficits in multiple cognitive behaviors. Notably, defective cognitive phenotypes and abnormal neuronal activity in old APP/PS1 mice were rescued through the knock-down of striatal MeCP2.Conclusion:We found that the MeCP2-mediated dysregulation of the epigenome in the striatum is linked to the defects in cognitive behavior and neuronal activity in the AD animal model, and that this alteration is initiated even in the very early stages of AD pathogenesis. Together, our data indicates that MeCP2 may be a potential target for the diagnosis and treatment of AD at asymptomatic and symptomatic stages.© The author(s)."

However, the underlying molecular mechanism is unclear. The current study investigated retinal protein changes of form-deprived myopic (FDM) guinea pigs in response to topical administration of 1% atropine gel (10 g/L).Methods:At the first stage, the differentially expressed proteins were screened using fractionated isobaric tags for a relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) approach, coupled with nano-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (nano-LC-MS/MS) (n= 24, 48 eyes) using a sample pooling technique. At the second stage, retinal tissues from another cohort with the same treatment (n= 12, 24 eyes) with significant ocular changes were subjected to label-free sequential window acquisition of all theoretical mass spectra (SWATH-MS) proteomics for orthogonal protein target confirmation. The localization of Alpha-synuclein was verified using immunohistochemistry and confocal imaging.Results:A total of 1,695 proteins (8,875 peptides) were identified with 479 regulated proteins (FC ≥ 1.5 or ≤0.67) found from FDM eyes and atropine-treated eyes receiving 4-weeks drug treatment using iTRAQ-MS proteomics. Combining the iTRAQ-MS and SWATH-MS datasets, a total of 29 confident proteins at 1% FDR were consistently quantified and matched, comprising 12 up-regulated and 17 down-regulated proteins which differed between FDM eyes and atropine treated eyes (iTRAQ: FC ≥ 1.5 or ≤0.67, SWATH: FC ≥ 1.4 or ≤0.71,p-value of ≤0.05). Bioinformatics analysis using IPA and STRING databases of these commonly regulated proteins revealed the involvement of the three commonly significant pathways: EIF2 signaling; glycolysis; and dopamine secretion. Additionally, the most significantly regulated proteins were closely connected to Alpha-synuclein (SNCA). Using immunostaining (n= 3), SNCA was further confirmed in the inner margin of the inner nuclear layer (INL) and spread throughout the inner plexiform layer (IPL) of the retina of guinea pigs.Conclusion:The molecular evidence using next-generation proteomics (NGP) revealed that retinal EIF2 signaling, glycolysis, and dopamine secretion through SNCA are implicated in atropine treatment of myopia in the FDM-induced guinea pig model.Copyright © 2022 Zhu, Bian, Lu, To, Lam, Li, Yu, Gong, Wang, Ji, Zhang, Nian, Lam and Wei."

The miRNA miR-486-5p has been shown to be downregulated in osteosarcoma and in cancer in general.To investigate if the mir-486 locus is epigenetically regulated, we integrated DNA methylation and miR-486-5p expression data using cohorts of osteosarcoma cell lines and patient samples. A CpG island in the promoter of the ANK1 host gene of mir-486 was shown to be highly methylated in osteosarcoma cell lines as determined by methylation-specific PCR and direct bisulfite sequencing. High methylation levels were seen for osteosarcoma patient samples, xenografts and cell lines based on quantitative methylation-specific PCR. 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine treatment of osteosarcoma cell lines caused induction of miR-486-5p and ANK1, indicating common epigenetic regulation in osteosarcoma cell lines. When overexpressed, miR-486-5p affected cell morphology.miR-486-5p represents a highly cancer relevant, epigenetically regulated miRNA in osteosarcoma, and this knowledge contributes to the understanding of osteosarcoma biology.© 2022.

Maternal smoking tends to reduce her BMI and the association of smoking with child overweight may be confounded by or interacting with maternal genetic predisposition to adiposity. In the Danish National Birth Cohort, we investigated whether smoking during pregnancy is associated with child BMI/overweight independent of pre-pregnancy BMI and maternal genetic predisposition to adiposity estimated as total, transmitted and non-transmitted genetic risk scores (GRSs) based on 941 common genetic variants associated with BMI. Smoking during pregnancy was associated with higher child BMI and higher odds of child overweight in a dose-response relationship. The odds ratio (95% CI) for smoking 11 + cigarettes in third trimester versus no smoking was 2.42 (1.30; 4.50), irrespective of maternal BMI and maternal GRSs (total, transmitted or non-transmitted). There were no statistically significant interactions between maternal GRSs and smoking (all p-values for interactions > 0.05). In conclusion, in this study, smoking during pregnancy exhibits a dose-response association with increased child BMI/overweight, independent of maternal pre-pregnancy BMI, maternal transmitted, and non-transmitted genetic predisposition to adiposity. Avoidance of smoking during pregnancy may help prevent childhood obesity irrespective of the mother-child genetic predisposition.© 2022. The Author(s)."

"35197931","Animal Foetal Models of Obesity and Diabetes - From Laboratory to Clinical Settings.","Front Endocrinol (Lausanne)","The prenatal period, during which a fully formed newborn capable of surviving outside its mother's body is built from a single cell, is critical for human development. It is also the time when the foetus is particularly vulnerable to environmental factors, which may modulate the course of its development. Both epidemiological and animal studies have shown that foetal programming of physiological systems may alter the growth and function of organs and lead to pathology in adulthood. Nutrition is a particularly important environmental factor for the pregnant mother as it affects the condition of offspring. Numerous studies have shown that an unbalanced maternal metabolic status (under- or overnutrition) may cause long-lasting physiological and behavioural alterations, resulting in metabolic disorders, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Various diets are used in laboratory settings in order to induce maternal obesity and metabolic disorders, and to alter the offspring development. The most popular models are: high-fat, high-sugar, high-fat-high-sugar, and cafeteria diets. Maternal undernutrition models are also used, which results in metabolic problems in offspring. Similarly to animal data, human studies have shown the influence of mothers' diets on the development of children. There is a strong link between the maternal diet and the birth weight, metabolic state, changes in the cardiovascular and central nervous system of the offspring. The mechanisms linking impaired foetal development and adult diseases remain under discussion. Epigenetic mechanisms are believed to play a major role in prenatal programming. Additionally, sexually dimorphic effects on offspring are observed. Therefore, further research on both sexes is necessary.Copyright © 2022 Grzęda, Matuszewska, Ziarniak, Gertig-Kolasa, Krzyśko- Pieczka, Skowrońska and Sliwowska."

It is also a major contributor to somatic complaints, worsening of chronic medical conditions, poor quality of life, and suicide. Current pharmacologic and psychotherapeutic approaches avert less than half of depression's cumulative burden on society. However, there is a growing body of research describing both how maladaptive lifestyle choices contribute to the development and worsening of depression and how lifestyle-oriented medical interventions can reduce the incidence and severity of depression. This research, largely derived from an emerging field called epigenetics, elucidates the interactions between our lifestyle choices and those epigenetic factors which mediate our tendencies toward either health, or the onset, if not worsening of disease. The present review highlights how lifestyle choices involving diet, physical activity, sleep, social relationships, and stress influence epigenetic processes positively or negatively, and thereby play a significant role in determining whether one does or does not suffer from depression. The authors propose that medical training programs consider and adopt lifestyle medicine oriented instructional initiatives that will enable tomorrow's primary care providers to more effectively identify and therapeutically intervene in the maladaptive choices contributing to their patients' depression.© 2020 The Author(s)."

The great variability among the techniques and the heterogeneous methodologies used to produce this data have placed meta-analysis methods as one of the approaches of choice to correlate the resultant large-scale datasets from different research groups. Through multi-study meta-analyses, it is possible to generate results with greater statistical power compared to individual analyses. Gene signatures, biomarkers and pathways that provide new insights of a phenotype of interest have been identified by the analysis of large-scale datasets in several fields of science. However, despite all the efforts, a standardized regulation to report large-scale data and to identify the molecular targets and signaling networks is still lacking. Integrative analyses have also been introduced as complementation and augmentation for meta-analysis methodologies to generate novel hypotheses. Currently, there is no universal method established and the different methods available follow different purposes. Herein we describe a new unifying, scalable and straightforward methodology to meta-analyze different omics outputs, but also to integrate the significant outcomes into novel pathways describing biological processes of interest. The significance of using proper molecular identifiers is highlighted as well as the potential to further correlate molecules from different regulatory levels.

Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) induce epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT) of renal tubular epithelial cells (HK-2), resulting in renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis. However, the underlying epigenetic mechanisms remain to be further investigated. In this work, we investigated the functional role of JMJD1A involved in DKD progression. The molecular mechanism study was performed in AGEs-induced HK-2 cells by gene expression analysis, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and JMJD1A lentiviral knockdown and overexpression particle transfection. The results showed that AGEs could upregulate JMJD1A, and the expressions of related fibrotic factor were also increased. At the same time, in the DKD animal model induced by unilateral nephrectomy plus streptozotocin (STZ), IHC immunohistochemical staining showed that compared with the control group, the expressions of JMJD1A, FN, and COL1 in the model group were all increased, masson staining results also show that the model group has typical fibrotic changes. This is consistent with the results of ourin vitroexperiments. In order to determine the downstream pathway, we screened out JMJD1A downstream transcription factors by RNA-seq. Further analysis showed that JMJD1A overexpression could accelerate the progression of AGEs-induced renal fibrosis by reducing the expression of NR4A1 in HK-2 cells. Meanwhile, NR4A1 inhibitor can promote the expression of fibrosis-related factors such as VIM, a-SMA in HK-2 cells, and aggravate the process of fibrosis. Taken together, JMJD1A/NR4A1 signaling can regulate the procession of renal tubular epithelial interstitial fibrosis induced by AGEs in HK-2.Copyright © 2022 Wang, Zuo, Jiang, Xie, Lin, Sun, Zhao, Xia, Shao, Zhao, Liang, Yang, Sun and Wang."
"35143520","Short communication: TNF-α and IGF-1 regulates epigenetic mechanisms of HDAC2 and HDAC10.","PLoS One","Vascular restenosis often presents as a consequence of injury to the vessel wall, resulting from stenting and other interventional procedures. Such injury to the arteries induces proliferation of Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells (VSMCs), resulting in cellular hyperplasia and restenosis. We and others have previously reported de-novo production of different cytokines and growth factors such as Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha (TNF-α) and Insulin like Growth Factor 1 (IGF-1), after vascular injury. As complex as it is, the profuse proliferation of VSMCs appears to be occurring due to several induced factors which initiate molecular mechanisms and exacerbate disease conditions. In many pathological events, the deleterious effects of TNF-α and IGF-1 in initiating disease mechanisms was reported. In the present work, we explored whether TNF-α and IGF-1 can regulate epigenetic mechanisms that promote proliferation of VSMCs. We investigated the mechanistic roles of proteins which can structurally interact with DNMT1 and initiate cellular pathways that promote proliferation of VSMCs. Our findings here, identify a novel molecular mechanism that is initiated by TNF-α and IGF-1. It was previously reported that DNMT1 expression is directly induced by TNF-α and IGF-1 treatment and increased/induced expression of DNMT1 causes silencing of genes that are essential to maintaining cellular homeostasis such as the tumor suppressor genes. We have earlier reported that TNF-α and IGF-1 treatment elevates DNMT1 expression in VSMCs and causes increased VSMC proliferation. However, the molecular mechanisms involved were not fully deciphered. Interestingly, in the present study we found that TNF-α and IGF-1 treatment failed to elevate DNMT1 expression levels in absence of HDAC2 and HDAC10. Also, while HDAC2 expression was not affected by HDAC10 knockdown, HDAC2 is essentially required for HDAC10 expression. Further, in TNF-α and IGF-1 induced epigenetic signaling mechanism, the expression of two important proteins EZH2 and PCNA seem to be regulated in an HDAC2-HDAC10 dependent manner. Our results show an inter-dependence of epigenetic mediators in inducing proliferation in VSMCs. To our knowledge, this is the first report that shows HDAC2 dependent expression of HDAC10, and suggests a novel mechanistic link between DNMT1, HDAC10 and HDAC2 that regulates EZH2 and PCNA to enhance cell proliferation of VSMCs which is the underlying cause for neointimal hyperplasia and restenosis."

Deep space exploration had been increasing in frequency, but heart function was susceptible to conspicuous damage and cardiac mass declined in weightlessness. Understanding of the etiology of cardiac atrophy exposed to microgravity currently remains limited. The 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of casein kinase-2 interacting protein-1 (Ckip-1) was a pivotal mediator in pressure overload-induced cardiac remodeling. However, the role ofCkip-13'-UTR in the heart during microgravity was unknown. We analyzedCkip-1mRNA 3'-UTR and coding sequence (CDS) expression levels in ground-based analogs such as mice hindlimb unloading (HU) and rhesus monkey head-down bed rest model.Ckip-13'-UTR had transcribed levels in the opposite change trend with cognate CDS expression in the hearts. We then subjected wild-type (WT) mice and cardiac-specificCkip-13'-UTR-overexpressing mice to hindlimb unloading for 28 days. Our results uncovered thatCkip-13'-UTR remarkably attenuated cardiac dysfunction and mass loss in simulated microgravity environments. Mechanistically,Ckip-13'-UTR inhibited lipid accumulation and elevated fatty acid oxidation-related gene expression in the hearts through targeting calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase 2 (CaMKK2) and activation of the AMPK-PPARα-CPT1b signaling pathway.

"35181672","Mechanical regulation of bone remodeling.","Bone Res","Bone remodeling is a lifelong process that gives rise to a mature, dynamic bone structure via a balance between bone formation by osteoblasts and resorption by osteoclasts. These opposite processes allow the accommodation of bones to dynamic mechanical forces, altering bone mass in response to changing conditions. Mechanical forces are indispensable for bone homeostasis; skeletal formation, resorption, and adaptation are dependent on mechanical signals, and loss of mechanical stimulation can therefore significantly weaken the bone structure, causing disuse osteoporosis and increasing the risk of fracture. The exact mechanisms by which the body senses and transduces mechanical forces to regulate bone remodeling have long been an active area of study among researchers and clinicians. Such research will lead to a deeper understanding of bone disorders and identify new strategies for skeletal rejuvenation.

Among them, the genes related to diagnosis were screened out based on differential gene expression in extracellular vesicles (EVs) by the ""limma"" package and histology by immunohistochemistry. Then, a risk signature was constructed by fitting the generalized linear model and validated by the receiver operating characteristic curve.Results:MYC targets pathway and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase-AKT-mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathway were identified as the hallmark-related pathways associated with 5mC regulators. Also, the P53 pathway was subject to the influence of regulators' expression. A five methylation-driven gene signature (FIRRE, MYBL2, TGFBI, AXIN2, and SLC35D3) was developed as the biomarker for CC diagnosis. Meanwhile, those genes positively related to 5mC regulators and interacted with their relevant or transcription factors.Conclusion:In general, 5mC regulators are positively related to each other and DNA methylation-driven genes, with the relationship of multiple active and inhibitory pathways related to cancer. Meanwhile, the signature (FIRRE, MYBL2, TGFBI, AXIN2, and SLC35D3) can prefigure prospective diagnosis in CC.Copyright © 2022 Du, Liu, Li, Zhao, Li, Wen, Liu, Yang, Fu and Wei."
"35194081","Functional buffering via cell-specific gene expression promotes tissue homeostasis and cancer robustness.","Sci Rep","Functional buffering that ensures biological robustness is critical for maintaining tissue homeostasis, organismal survival, and evolution of novelty. However, the mechanism underlying functional buffering, particularly in multicellular organisms, remains largely elusive. Here, we proposed that functional buffering can be mediated via expression of buffering genes in specific cells and tissues, by which we named Cell-specific Expression-BUffering (CEBU). We developed an inference index (C-score) for CEBU by computing C-scores across 684 human cell lines using genome-wide CRISPR screens and transcriptomic RNA-seq. We report that C-score-identified putative buffering gene pairs are enriched for members of the same duplicated gene family, pathway, and protein complex. Furthermore, CEBU is especially prevalent in tissues of low regenerative capacity (e.g., bone and neuronal tissues) and is weakest in highly regenerative blood cells, linking functional buffering to tissue regeneration. Clinically, the buffering capacity enabled by CEBU can help predict patient survival for multiple cancers. Our results suggest CEBU as a potential buffering mechanism contributing to tissue homeostasis and cancer robustness in humans.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35190728","A framework for fibrolamellar carcinoma research and clinical trials.","Nat Rev Gastroenterol Hepatol","Fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC), a rare, lethal hepatic cancer, occurs primarily in adolescents and young adults. Unlike hepatocellular carcinoma, FLC has no known association with viral, metabolic or chemical agents that cause cirrhosis. Currently, surgical resection is the only treatment demonstrated to achieve cure, and no standard of care exists for systemic therapy. Progress in FLC research illuminates a transition from an obscure cancer to one for which an interactive community seems poised to uncover fundamental mechanisms and initiate translation towards novel therapies. In this Roadmap, we review advances since the seminal discovery in 2014 that nearly all FLC tumours express a signature oncogene (DNAJB1-PRKACA) encoding a fusion protein (DNAJ-PKAc) in which the J-domain of a heat shock protein 40 (HSP40) co-chaperone replaces an amino-terminal segment of the catalytic subunit of the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). Important gains include increased understanding of oncogenic pathways driven by DNAJ-PKAc; identification of potential therapeutic targets; development of research models; elucidation of immune mechanisms with potential for the development of immunotherapies; and completion of the first multicentre clinical trials of targeted therapy for FLC. In each of these key areas we propose a Roadmap for future progress.© 2022. Springer Nature Limited."

In this study, PAFAH1B3 was elevated in human pan-cancer, and this correlated with greater pathology and poor prognosis, in particular for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC). In addition, PAFAH1B3 expression was positively associated with tumor mutational burden (TMB), microsatellite instability (MSI), immune cell infiltration, immune-modulatory related gene expression, and diverse cancer drug sensitivity in human cancer. Increased PAFAH1B3 expression correlated with poor overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), and progression-free interval (PFI) of NSCLC and LIHC, and has potential as an independent risk factor for overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), and progression-free interval (PFI) during LIHC. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis confirmed that PAFAH1B3 is primarily involved in immune regulation. More importantly, results demonstrated that PAFAH1B3 was upregulated in liver cancer cells lines and that knockdown of this gene significantly inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC). In summary, this study elucidates the clinical significance and biological function of PAFAH1B3 during liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) and may serve as a potential biomarker for the diagnosis and prognosis of various cancer types.Copyright © 2022 Yuan, Jiang, Tang, Wang and Duan."

Immunohistochemical examination of 679 patients illustrates that NNMT protein is predominantly expressed in the cancer stroma at varying levels, and about 20% of cancer tissues overexpress NNMT when compared to levels observed in normal colorectal mucosa. Clinical correlation analyses of 572 patients with early-stage cancers reveal that NNMT protein overexpression is significantly associated with shorter overall and disease-free survival, but no such correlation is found in late-stage colorectal cancer. Analyses of TCGA and CPTAC colorectal cancer cohorts show that NNMT mRNA expression is positively correlated with protein levels, is significantly higher in CIMP-high or MSI subtypes than in CIMP-low or MSS subtypes, and is positively correlated with its paralog INMT but not with its interaction partners such as PNMT, ADK, APP, ATF6, BMF, BRD4, CDC37, or CRYZ. In early-stage cancers, NNMT expression is higher in BRAF-mutated than in BRAF wild type tumors but is not affected by KRAS or PIK3CA mutation status. As a cancer stromal protein with important roles in metabolism and cancer epigenetics, NNMT is emerging as a promising biomarker for risk stratification of early-stage cancers.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35177083","Competition between type I activin and BMP receptors for binding to ACVR2A regulates signaling to distinct Smad pathways.","BMC Biol","Activins and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) play critical, sometimes opposing roles, in multiple physiological and pathological processes and diseases. They signal to distinct Smad branches; activins signal mainly to Smad2/3, while BMPs activate mainly Smad1/5/8. This gives rise to the possibility that competition between the different type I receptors through which activin and BMP signal for common type II receptors can provide a mechanism for fine-tuning the cellular response to activin/BMP stimuli. Among the transforming growth factor-β superfamily type II receptors, ACVR2A/B are highly promiscuous, due to their ability to interact with different type I receptors (e.g., ALK4 vs. ALK2/3/6) and with their respective ligands [activin A (ActA) vs. BMP9/2]. However, studies on complex formation between these full-length receptors situated at the plasma membrane, and especially on the potential competition between the different activin and BMP type I receptors for a common activin type II receptor, were lacking.We employed a combination of IgG-mediated patching-immobilization of several type I receptors in the absence or presence of ligands with fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) measurements on the lateral diffusion of an activin type II receptor, ACVR2A, to demonstrate the principle of competition between type I receptors for ACVR2. Our results show that ACVR2A can form stable heteromeric complexes with ALK4 (an activin type I receptor), as well as with several BMP type I receptors (ALK2/3/6). Of note, ALK4 and the BMP type I receptors competed for binding ACVR2A. To assess the implications of this competition for signaling output, we first validated that in our cell model system (U2OS cells), ACVR2/ALK4 transduce ActA signaling to Smad2/3, while BMP9 signaling to Smad1/5/8 employ ACVR2/ALK2 or ACVR2/ALK3. By combining ligand stimulation with overexpression of a competing type I receptor, we showed that differential complex formation of distinct type I receptors with a common type II receptor balances the signaling to the two Smad branches.Different type I receptors that signal to distinct Smad pathways (Smad2/3 vs. Smad1/5/8) compete for binding to common activin type II receptors. This provides a novel mechanism to balance signaling between Smad2/3 and Smad1/5/8.© 2022. The Author(s)."

"35164688","Genion, an accurate tool to detect gene fusion from long transcriptomics reads.","BMC Genomics","The advent of next-generation sequencing technologies empowered a wide variety of transcriptomics studies. A widely studied topic is gene fusion which is observed in many cancer types and suspected of having oncogenic properties. Gene fusions are the result of structural genomic events that bring two genes closely located and result in a fused transcript. This is different from fusion transcripts created during or after the transcription process. These chimeric transcripts are also known as read-through and trans-splicing transcripts. Gene fusion discovery with short reads is a well-studied problem, and many methods have been developed. But the sensitivity of these methods is limited by the technology, especially the short read length. Advances in long-read sequencing technologies allow the generation of long transcriptomics reads at a low cost. Transcriptomic long-read sequencing presents unique opportunities to overcome the shortcomings of short-read technologies for gene fusion detection while introducing new challenges.We present Genion, a sensitive and fast gene fusion detection method that can also detect read-through events. We compare Genion against a recently introduced long-read gene fusion discovery method, LongGF, both on simulated and real datasets. On simulated data, Genion accurately identifies the gene fusions and its clustering accuracy for detecting fusion reads is better than LongGF. Furthermore, our results on the breast cancer cell line MCF-7 show that Genion correctly identifies all the experimentally validated gene fusions.Genion is an accurate gene fusion caller.

"35163037","Sesquiterpene Lactones Potentiate Olaparib-Induced DNA Damage in p53 Wildtype Cancer Cells.","Int J Mol Sci","Despite notable advances in utilising PARP inhibitor monotherapy, many cancers are not PARP inhibitor-sensitive or develop treatment resistance. In this work, we show that the two structurally-related sesquiterpene lactones, a 2-bromobenzyloxy derivative of dehydrosantonin (BdS) and alantolactone (ATL) sensitise p53 wildtype, homologous recombination-proficient cancer cells to low-dose treatment with the PARP inhibitor, olaparib. Exposure to combination treatments of olaparib with BdS or ATL induces cell-cycle changes, chromosomal instability, as well as considerable increases in nuclear area. Mechanistically, we uncover that mitotic errors likely depend on oxidative stress elicited by the electrophilic lactone warheads and olaparib-mediated PARP-trapping, culminating in replication stress. Combination treatments exhibit moderately synergistic effects on cell survival, probably attenuated by a p53-mediated, protective cell-cycle arrest in the G2 cell-cycle phase. Indeed, using a WEE1 inhibitor, AZD1775, to inhibit the G2/M cell-cycle checkpoint further decreased cell survival. Around half of all cancers diagnosed retain p53 functionality, and this proportion could be expected to increase with improved diagnostic approaches in the clinic. Utilising sublethal oxidative stress to sensitise p53 wildtype, homologous recombination-proficient cancer cells to low-dose PARP-trapping could therefore serve as the basis for future research into the treatment of cancers currently refractory to PARP inhibition."

Reverse transcription quantitative PCR analysis evaluated selenoprotein mRNA expression in TNBC versus non-TNBC and normal breast cells, and in TNBC tissues versus normal counterparts. Immunohistochemistry was employed to study selenoproteins in TNBC tissues. STRING and Cytoscape tools were used for functional and network analysis.GPX1, GPX4, SELENOS, TXNRD1 and TXNRD3 were specifically overexpressed in TNBC cells, tissues and CCLE/LINCS datasets. Network analysis demonstrated that SELENOS-binding valosin-containing protein (VCP/p97) played a critical hub role in the TNBCselenoproteins sub-network, being directly associated with SELENOS expression.

Several quantitative measures to assess the interplay between EMT and cancer progression are available, based on large scale genome and transcriptome data. However, these large scale multi-omics studies have repeatedly illustrated a lack of correlation in mRNA and protein abundances that may be influenced by diverse post-translational regulation. Hence, it is imperative to understand how changes in the EMT proteome are associated with the process of oncogenic transformation. To this effect, we developed a parallel reaction monitoring-based targeted proteomics method for quantifying abundances of EMT-associated proteins across cancer cell lines. Our study revealed that quantitative measurement of EMT proteome which enabled a more accurate assessment than transcriptomics data and revealed specific discrepancies against a backdrop of generally strong concordance between proteomic and transcriptomic data. We further demonstrated that changes in our EMT proteome panel might play a role in tumor transformation across cancer types.

Here we show that epitope predictions can be further improved by considering abundance levels of peptides' source proteins. We utilized biophysical principles and existing MHC binding prediction tools in concert with abundance estimates of source proteins to derive a function that estimates the likelihood of a peptide to be an MHC class I ligand. We found that this combination improved predictions for both naturally eluted ligands and cancer neoantigen epitopes. We compared the use of different measures of antigen abundance, including mRNA expression by RNA-Seq, gene translation by Ribo-Seq, and protein abundance by proteomics on a dataset of SARS-CoV-2 epitopes. Epitope predictions were improved above binding predictions alone in all cases and gave the highest performance when using proteomic data.

Here, we investigated inflammatory signaling pathways in neuroblastoma, a classically ""cold"" pediatric cancer. By testing the functional response of a panel of 20 diverse neuroblastoma cell lines to three different inflammatory stimuli, we found that all cell lines have intact interferon signaling, and all but one lack functional cytosolic DNA sensing via cGAS-STING. However, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) sensing via Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) was heterogeneous, as was signaling through other dsRNA sensors and TLRs more broadly. Seven cell lines showed robust response to dsRNA, six of which are in the mesenchymal epigenetic state, while all unresponsive cell lines are in the adrenergic state. Genetically switching adrenergic cell lines toward the mesenchymal state fully restored responsiveness. In responsive cells, dsRNA sensing results in the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, enrichment of inflammatory transcriptomic signatures, and increased tumor killing by T cells in vitro. Using single-cell RNA sequencing data, we show that human neuroblastoma cells with stronger mesenchymal signatures have a higher basal inflammatory state, demonstrating intratumoral heterogeneity in inflammatory signaling that has significant implications for immunotherapeutic strategies in this aggressive childhood cancer.Copyright © 2022 the Author(s).

"35135348","Wild epigenetics: insights from epigenetic studies on natural populations.","Proc Biol Sci","Epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation, histone modifications and non-coding RNAs are increasingly targeted in studies of natural populations. Here, I review some of the insights gained from this research, examine some of the methods currently in use and discuss some of the challenges that researchers working on natural populations are likely to face when probing epigenetic mechanisms. While studies supporting the involvement of epigenetic mechanisms in generating phenotypic variation in natural populations are amassing, many of these studies are currently correlative in nature. Thus, while empirical data point to widespread contributions of epigenetic mechanisms in generating phenotypic variation, there are still concerns as to whether epigenetic variation is instead ultimately controlled by genetic variation. Disentangling these two sources of variation will be a key to resolving the debate about the importance of epigenetic mechanisms, and studies on natural populations that partition the relative contribution of genetic and epigenetic factors to phenotypic variation can play an important role in this debate."

Fatty acid transporter 5(FATP5), a member of FATPs family, participates in fatty acid transport and lipid metabolism and is related to tumor development, whose mechanism in colorectal cancer (CRC) remains unclear.Methods:In this study, we comprehensively utilized a range of relevant bioinformatic tools along with multiple databases to analyze the expression of FATPs family and investigate the biological function and prognostic value of FATP5 in CRC. Besides, cell proliferation and cell cycle distribution analysis, western blotting and immunohistochemistry (IHC) further validated the conclusion of bioinformatics analysis.Results:FATP5 is the only member of FATPs family which was overexpressed in CRC. In the survival analysis based on the GSE39582 databases, the low expression of FATP5 predicts poor prognosis in CRC. Similar results were also observed in GSE17536, GSE28814 and TCGA colon cohorts. The potential function of DNA methylation regulated the abnormal expression of FATP5 in CRC. In addition, enrichment analysis indicated that FATP5 also participates in the regulation of cell cycle. Furthermore, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) showed a strong negative correlation between FATP5 and cell growth, implying that it may participate in regulating cancer cell proliferation by the regulation of cell cycle G2/M transition. At last, we identified that FATP5 was overexpressed in colorectal carcinoma tissues through immunohistochemistry staining, and played an important role in cell cycle by cell proliferation and cell cycle distribution analysis.Conclusion:This study suggested that FATP5 was overexpression in colorectal carcinoma and predicted favorable prognosis, indicating it as a novel appealing prognostic marker for CRC.Copyright © 2022 Geng, Yang, Li, Shen, Wang, Zheng, Xue and Zhao."

There is growing evidence that competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) regulatory networks play an important role in various human tumors. However, the complexity and behavioral characteristics of the ceRNA network in STAD are still unclear. In this study, we constructed a ceRNA regulatory network to identify the potential prognostic biomarkers associated with STAD. The expression profile of lncRNA, miRNA, and mRNA was downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). After performing bioinformatics analysis, the CCDC144NL-AS1/hsa-miR-145-5p/SERPINE1 ceRNA network associated to STAD prognosis of STAD was obtained. The CCDC144NL-AS1/SERPINE1 axis in the ceRNA network was identified by correlation analysis and considered as a clinical prognosis model by Cox regression analysis. In addition, methylation analysis indicated that the abnormal upregulation of CCDC144NL-AS1/SERPINE1 axis might be related to the aberrant methylation of some sites, and immune infiltration analysis suggested that CCDC144NL-AS1/SERPINE1 axis probably influences the alteration of tumor immune microenvironment and the occurrence and development of STAD.

We have studied these trade-offs using the results of a large number of independent software benchmarks, and evaluated whether external factors, including speed, author reputation, journal impact, recency and developer efforts, are indicative of accurate software.We find that software speed, author reputation, journal impact, number of citations and age are unreliable predictors of software accuracy. This is unfortunate because these are frequently cited reasons for selecting software tools. However, GitHub-derived statistics and high version numbers show that accurate bioinformatic software tools are generally the product of many improvements over time. We also find an excess of slow and inaccurate bioinformatic software tools, and this is consistent across many sub-disciplines. There are few tools that are middle-of-road in terms of accuracy and speed trade-offs.Our findings indicate that accurate bioinformatic software is primarily the product of long-term commitments to software development. In addition, we hypothesise that bioinformatics software suffers from publication bias. Software that is intermediate in terms of both speed and accuracy may be difficult to publish-possibly due to author, editor and reviewer practises.

We compared the tools Cell Ranger version 6, STARsolo, Kallisto, Alevin, and Alevin-fry on 3 published datasets for human and mouse, sequenced with different versions of the 10X sequencing protocol.Striking differences were observed in the overall runtime of the mappers. Besides that, Kallisto and Alevin showed variances in the number of valid cells and detected genes per cell. Kallisto reported the highest number of cells; however, we observed an overrepresentation of cells with low gene content and unknown cell type. Conversely, Alevin rarely reported such low-content cells. Further variations were detected in the set of expressed genes. While STARsolo, Cell Ranger 6, Alevin-fry, and Alevin produced similar gene sets, Kallisto detected additional genes from the Vmn and Olfr gene family, which are likely mapping artefacts. We also observed differences in the mitochondrial content of the resulting cells when comparing a prefiltered annotation set to the full annotation set that includes pseudogenes and other biotypes.Overall, this study provides a detailed comparison of common single-cell RNA sequencing mappers and shows their specific properties on 10X Genomics data.© The Author(s) 2022.

Data were simulated to provide randomly generated models with no individual main effects at different heritabilities (pure epistasis) as well as models based on penetrance tables with some main effects (impure epistasis). Detection of both two and three locus interactions were assessed across a total of 1,560 simulated datasets.

"35155440","Interpreting Functional Impact of Genetic Variations by Network QTL for Genotype-Phenotype Association Study.","Front Cell Dev Biol","An enormous challenge in the post-genome era is to annotate and resolve the consequences of genetic variation on diverse phenotypes. The genome-wide association study (GWAS) is a well-known method to identify potential genetic loci for complex traits from huge genetic variations, following which it is crucial to identify expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL). However, the conventional eQTL methods usually disregard the systematical role of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or genes, thereby overlooking many network-associated phenotypic determinates. Such a problem motivates us to recognize the network-based quantitative trait loci (QTL), i.e., network QTL (nQTL), which is to detect the cascade association as genotype → network → phenotype rather than conventional genotype → expression → phenotype in eQTL. Specifically, we develop the nQTL framework on the theory and approach of single-sample networks, which can identify not only network traits (e.g., the gene subnetwork associated with genotype) for analyzing complex biological processes but also network signatures (e.g., the interactive gene biomarker candidates screened from network traits) for characterizing targeted phenotype and corresponding subtypes. Our results show that the nQTL framework can efficiently capture associations between SNPs and network traits (i.e., edge traits) in various simulated data scenarios, compared with traditional eQTL methods. Furthermore, we have carried out nQTL analysis on diverse biological and biomedical datasets. Our analysis is effective in detecting network traits for various biological problems and can discover many network signatures for discriminating phenotypes, which can help interpret the influence of nQTL on disease subtyping, disease prognosis, drug response, and pathogen factor association. Particularly, in contrast to the conventional approaches, the nQTL framework could also identify many network traits from human bulk expression data, validated by matched single-cell RNA-seq data in an independent or unsupervised manner. All these results strongly support that nQTL and its detection framework can simultaneously explore the global genotype-network-phenotype associations and the underlying network traits or network signatures with functional impact and importance.Copyright © 2022 Yuan, Zeng and Chen."
"35142607","Human embryoid bodies as a novel system for genomic studies of functionally diverse cell types.","Elife","Practically all studies of gene expression in humans to date have been performed in a relatively small number of adult tissues. Gene regulation is highly dynamic and context-dependent. In order to better understand the connection between gene regulation and complex phenotypes, including disease, we need to be able to study gene expression in more cell types, tissues, and states that are relevant to human phenotypes. In particular, we need to characterize gene expression in early development cell types, as mutations that affect developmental processes may be of particular relevance to complex traits. To address this challenge, we propose to use embryoid bodies (EBs), which are organoids that contain a multitude of cell types in dynamic states. EBs provide a system in which one can study dynamic regulatory processes at an unprecedentedly high resolution. To explore the utility of EBs, we systematically explored cellular and gene expression heterogeneity in EBs from multiple individuals. We characterized the various cell types that arise from EBs, the extent to which they recapitulate gene expression in vivo, and the relative contribution of technical and biological factors to variability in gene expression, cell composition, and differentiation efficiency. Our results highlight the utility of EBs as a new model system for mapping dynamic inter-individual regulatory differences in a large variety of cell types.© 2022, Rhodes et al."

Genetic correlation of GAD and PTSD between MHQ responders and non-responders ranged from 0.636 to 1.08; both were predicted by polygenic scores generated from independent cohorts. In meta-analyses of GAD (N = 489,579) and PTSD (N = 497,803), we discovered many novel genomic risk loci (13 for GAD and 40 for PTSD). Transcriptomic analyses converged on altered regulation of prenatal dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in these disorders. Our results provide one roadmap by which sample size and statistical power may be improved for gene discovery of incompletely ascertained traits in the UKB and other biobanks with limited mental health assessment.© 2022.

"35186825","Unraveling the Genetics of Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia: An Ongoing Challenge.","Front Pediatr","Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a congenital structural anomaly in which the diaphragm has not developed properly. It may occur either as an isolated anomaly or with additional anomalies. It is thought to be a multifactorial disease in which genetic factors could either substantially contribute to or directly result in the developmental defect. Patients with aneuploidies, pathogenic variants orde novoCopy Number Variations (CNVs) impacting specific genes and loci develop CDH typically in the form of a monogenetic syndrome. These patients often have other associated anatomical malformations. In patients without a known monogenetic syndrome, an increased genetic burden ofde novocoding variants contributes to disease development. In early years, genetic evaluation was based on karyotyping and SNP-array. Today, genomes are commonly analyzed with next generation sequencing (NGS) based approaches. While more potential pathogenic variants are being detected, analysis of the data presents a bottleneck-largely due to the lack of full appreciation of the functional consequence and/or relevance of the detected variant. The exact heritability of CDH is still unknown. Damagingde novoalterations are associated with the more severe and complex phenotypes and worse clinical outcome. Phenotypic, genetic-and likely mechanistic-variability hampersindividualpatient diagnosis, short and long-term morbidity prediction and subsequent care strategies. Detailed phenotyping, clinical follow-up at regular intervals and detailed registries are needed to find associations between long-term morbidity, genetic alterations, and clinical parameters. Since CDH is a relatively rare disorder with only a few recurrent changes large cohorts of patients are needed to identify genetic associations. Retrospective whole genome sequencing of historical patient cohorts using will yield valuable data from which today's patients and parents will profit Trio whole genome sequencing has an excellent potential for future re-analysis and data-sharing increasing the chance to provide a genetic diagnosis and predict clinical prognosis. In this review, we explore the pitfalls and challenges in the analysis and interpretation of genetic information, present what is currently known and what still needs further study, and propose strategies to reap the benefits of genetic screening.Copyright © 2022 Brosens, Peters, van Weelden, Bendixen, Brouwer, Sleutels, Bruggenwirth, van Ijcken, Veenma, Otter, Wijnen, Eggink, van Dooren, Reutter, Rottier, Schnater, Tibboel and de Klein."
"35176995","Exploring the effects of genetic variation on gene regulation in cancer in the context of 3D genome structure.","BMC Genom Data","Numerous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) conducted to date revealed genetic variants associated with various diseases, including breast and prostate cancers. Despite the availability of these large-scale data, relatively few variants have been functionally characterized, mainly because the majority of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) map to the non-coding regions of the human genome. The functional characterization of these non-coding variants and the identification of their target genes remain challenging.In this communication, we explore the potential functional mechanisms of non-coding SNPs by integrating GWAS with the high-resolution chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) data for breast and prostate cancers. We show that more genetic variants map to regulatory elements through the 3D genome structure than the 1D linear genome lacking physical chromatin interactions. Importantly, the association of enhancers, transcription factors, and their target genes with breast and prostate cancers tends to be higher when these regulatory elements are mapped to high-risk SNPs through spatial interactions compared to simply using a linear proximity. Finally, we demonstrate that topologically associating domains (TADs) carrying high-risk SNPs also contain gene regulatory elements whose association with cancer is generally higher than those belonging to control TADs containing no high-risk variants.Our results suggest that many SNPs may contribute to the cancer development by affecting the expression of certain tumor-related genes through long-range chromatin interactions with gene regulatory elements. Integrating large-scale genetic datasets with the 3D genome structure offers an attractive and unique approach to systematically investigate the functional mechanisms of genetic variants in disease risk and progression.© 2022.

This study reports the crosstalk between autophagy and ferroptosis at the molecular level in SCCs, and their roles on the immunological tumor microenvironment (TME) of SCCs.In this study, the connections between autophagy and ferroptosis were characterized in SCCs by analyzing the associations between autophagy- and ferroptosis-related genes in mRNA expression and prognosis, protein-protein interactions and shared signaling pathways. Autophagy potential index (API) and ferroptosis potential index (FPI) of each tumor were quantified for reflecting autophagy and ferroptosis levelsviaprincipal-component analysis algorithm. Their synergistical roles on TME, immunity, drug resistance and survival were systematically analyzed in SCCs.There were close connections between autophagy and ferroptosis at the mRNA and protein levels and prognosis. Both shared cancer-related pathways. The API and FPI were separately developed based on prognostic autophagy- and ferroptosis-related genes. A high correlation between API and FPI was found in SCCs. Their interplay was distinctly associated with favorable prognosis, enhanced sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs (Sunitinib, Gefitinib, Vinblastine and Vorinostat), an inflamed TME and higher likelihood of response to immunotherapy in SCCs.This study is the first to ﻿provide a comprehensive analysis of the interplay between autophagy and ferroptosis and their synergistical roles on manipulating the immunological TME in SCCs. These findings indicated that the induction of autophagy and ferroptosis combined with immunotherapy might produce synergistically enhanced anti-SCCs activity.Copyright © 2022 Chen, Niu, Qiao, Liu, Ma, Shi, He and Zhong."
"35194749","The Changing Climate and Pregnancy Health.","Curr Environ Health Rep","Climate change is the biggest public health threat of the twenty-first century but its impact on the perinatal period has only recently received attention. This review summarizes recent literature regarding the impacts of climate change and related environmental disasters on pregnancy health and provides recommendations to inform future adaptation and mitigation efforts.Accumulating evidence suggests that the changing climate affects pregnancy health directly via discrete environmental disasters (i.e., wildfire, extreme heat, hurricane, flood, and drought), and indirectly through changes in the natural and social environment. Although studies vary greatly in design, analytic methods, and assessment strategies, they generally converge to suggest that climate-related disasters are associated with increased risk of gestational complication, pregnancy loss, restricted fetal growth, low birthweight, preterm birth, and selected delivery/newborn complications. Window(s) of exposure with the highest sensitivity are not clear, but both acute and chronic exposures appear important. Furthermore, socioeconomically disadvantaged populations may be more vulnerable. Policy, clinical, and research strategies for adaptation and mitigation should be continued, strengthened, and expanded with cross-disciplinary efforts. Top priorities should include (a) reinforcing and expanding policies to further reduce emission, (b) increasing awareness and education resources for healthcare providers and the public, (c) facilitating access to quality population-based data in low-resource areas, and (d) research efforts to better understand mechanisms of effects, identify susceptible populations and windows of exposure, explore interactive impacts of multiple exposures, and develop novel methods to better quantify pregnancy health impacts.© 2022.

"35198004","Comparison of Capture Hi-C Analytical Pipelines.","Front Genet","It is now evident that DNA forms an organized nuclear architecture, which is essential to maintain the structural and functional integrity of the genome. Chromatin organization can be systematically studied due to the recent boom in chromosome conformation capture technologies (e.g., 3C and its successors 4C, 5C and Hi-C), which is accompanied by the development of computational pipelines to identify biologically meaningful chromatin contacts in such data. However, not all tools are applicable to all experimental designs and all structural features. Capture Hi-C (CHi-C) is a method that uses an intermediate hybridization step to target and select predefined regions of interest in a Hi-C library, thereby increasing effective sequencing depth for those regions. It allows researchers to investigate fine chromatin structures at high resolution, for instance promoter-enhancer loops, but it introduces additional biases with the capture step, and therefore requires specialized pipelines. Here, we compare multiple analytical pipelines for CHi-C data analysis. We consider the effect of retaining multi-mapping reads and compare the efficiency of different statistical approaches in both identifying reproducible interactions and determining biologically significant interactions. At restriction fragment level resolution, the number of multi-mapping reads that could be rescued was negligible. The number of identified interactions varied widely, depending on the analytical method, indicating large differences in type I and type II error rates. The optimal pipeline depends on the project-specific tolerance level of false positive and false negative chromatin contacts.Copyright © 2022 Aljogol, Thompson, Osborne and Mifsud."

Although often perceived as a medical complication of pregnancy, GDM is actually a chronic cardiometabolic disorder that identifies women who have an elevated lifetime risk of ultimately developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. In identifying high-risk women early in the natural history of these conditions, the diagnosis of GDM raises the tantalizing possibility of early intervention and risk modification. However, before such promise can be realized in practice, a series of clinical challenges/obstacles (reviewed herein) must be overcome. Ultimately, the coupling of this life course perspective of GDM with concerted efforts to overcome these challenges may enable fulfilment of this unique opportunity for the primary prevention of diabetes and heart disease in women.© 2022 The Author(s)."

Specifically, the microbiome genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 18,473 individuals from the MiBioGen study was used as exposure sample, and the GWAS for 15 psychiatric diseases was used as outcome samples.

"35163221","Mitochondrial Processing Peptidases-Structure, Function and the Role in Human Diseases.","Int J Mol Sci","Mitochondrial proteins are encoded by both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA. While some of the essential subunits of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes responsible for cellular ATP production are synthesized directly in the mitochondria, most mitochondrial proteins are first translated in the cytosol and then imported into the organelle using a sophisticated transport system. These proteins are directed mainly by targeting presequences at their N-termini. These presequences need to be cleaved to allow the proper folding and assembly of the pre-proteins into functional protein complexes. In the mitochondria, the presequences are removed by several processing peptidases, including the mitochondrial processing peptidase (MPP), the inner membrane processing peptidase (IMP), the inter-membrane processing peptidase (MIP), and the mitochondrial rhomboid protease (Pcp1/PARL). Their proper functioning is essential for mitochondrial homeostasis as the disruption of any of them is lethal in yeast and severely impacts the lifespan and survival in humans. In this review, we focus on characterizing the structure, function, and substrate specificities of mitochondrial processing peptidases, as well as the connection of their malfunctions to severe human diseases."

"35132955","Mosaic loss of chromosome Y promotes leukemogenesis and clonal hematopoiesis.","JCI Insight","Mosaic loss of chromosome Y (mLOY) in blood cells is one of the most frequent chromosome alterations in adult males. It is strongly associated with clonal hematopoiesis, hematopoietic malignancies, and other hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic diseases. However, whether there is a causal relationship between mLOY and human diseases is unknown. Here, we generated mLOY in murine hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) with CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing. We found that mLOY led to dramatically increased DNA damage in HSPCs. Interestingly, HSPCs with mLOY displayed significantly enhanced reconstitution capacity and gave rise to clonal hematopoiesis in vivo. mLOY, which is associated with AML1-ETO translocation and p53 defects in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), promoted AML in mice. Mechanistically, loss of KDM5D, a chromosome Y-specific histone 3 lysine 4 demethylase in both humans and mice, partially recapitulated mLOY in DNA damage and leukemogenesis. Thus, our study validates mLOY as a functional driver for clonal hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis."

We use CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing and drug screening to characterize drug-gene interactions withARID1AandBRCA2. We find that missense- but not frameshift mutations in the PDAC driver geneARID1Aare associated with increased sensitivity to the kinase inhibitors dasatinib (p < 0.0001) and VE-821 (p < 0.0001). We conduct an automated drug-repurposing screen with 1,172 FDA-approved compounds, identifying 26 compounds that effectively kill PDAC organoids, including 19 chemotherapy drugs currently approved for other cancer types. We validate the activity of these compoundsin vitroandin vivo. Thein vivovalidated hits include emetine and ouabain, compounds which are approved for non-cancer indications and which perturb the ability of PDAC organoids to respond to hypoxia.

However, it is also dishearteningly resistant to nearly all forms of treatment. New therapies are urgently needed, and with the advent of organoid culture for pancreatic cancer, an increasing number of innovative approaches are being tested. Organoids can be derived within a short enough time window to allow testing of several anticancer agents, which opens up the possibility for functional precision medicine for pancreatic cancer. At the same time, organoid model systems are being refined to better mimic the cancer, for example, by incorporation of components of the tumor microenvironment. We review some of the latest developments in pancreatic cancer organoid research and in novel treatment design. We also summarize our own current experiences with pancreatic cancer organoid drug sensitivity and resistance testing (DSRT) in 14 organoids from 11 PDAC patients. Our data show that it may be necessary to include a cell death read-out in ex vivo DSRT assays, as metabolic viability quantitation does not capture actual organoid killing. We also successfully adapted the organoid platform for drug combination synergy discovery. Lastly, live organoid culture 3D confocal microscopy can help identify individual surviving tumor cells escaping cell death even during harsh combination treatments. Taken together, the organoid technology allows the development of novel precision medicine approaches for PDAC, which paves the way for clinical trials and much needed new treatment options for pancreatic cancer patients."

The mortality rate from lung cancer has been estimated to be 18.4%. Until now, conventional treatments have not yielded optimal results, thus necessitating an investigation into the use of traditional herbal plants as potential candidates for its treatment. This study aimed to determine the inhibitory and apoptotic activity of the ethanolic extract fromOcimum sanctumLinn. (EEOS) byin silicomolecular docking and throughin vitrostudies using NSCLC cells (A549 cell line).Dried simplicia ofOcimum sanctumwas converted into EEOS using the maceration method. Spectrophotometry was then employed to analyze the EEOS compound. The known main active compounds were further analyzed for inhibitory and apoptotic effects on gene signaling usingin silicomolecular docking involving the downloading of active compounds from PubChem and target proteins from the Protein Data Bank; the active compounds and proteins were then prepared using the Discovery Studio software v. 19.0.0 and the PyRX 0.8 program, interacted with the HEX 8.0.0 program, and visualized with the Discovery Studio Visualizer v. 19.0. Finally, anin vitroanalysis was performed using an antiproliferative-cytotoxic test (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay in the NSCLC A549 cell line).The analysis revealed that the active compounds in the ethanolic extract were dominated by quercetin (flavonoids) (47.23% b/b) and eugenol (phenolic) (12.14% b/b). These active compounds interacted with the active sites (residual amino acids) of the αvβ3 integrin, a5b1 integrin, caspase-3, caspase-9, and vascular endothelial growth factor. Hydrogen bonds and Pi-cation and Pi-alkyl interactions were involved in the relationships between the active compounds and the active sites and thus may reveal an antioxidant property of the extract. Furthermore,in vitroanalysis showed the inhibitory and antiproliferative effects of the EEOS against non-small cell cancer (A549).Taken together, our data showed the ability of EEOS as an inhibitor and apoptotic agent for lung cancer; however, further research is needed to determine the exact mechanism of EEOS as an herbal medication.Copyright: © Kustiati, et al."

However, these epigenetic markers have not been thoroughly validated and therefore are still not considered in clinical practice. Hence, we aimed to independently verify results of selected studies describing the relationship between DNA methylation of specific genes and their prognostic potential in predicting overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS).Fourteen studies (published 2011-2019) comprising of 27 genes were subjected to validation by a custom NGS-based sequencing panel in 178 newly diagnosed non-M3 AML patients treated by 3 + 7 induction regimen. The results were considered as successfully validated, if both the log-rank test and multivariate Cox regression analysis had a p-value ≤ 0.05. The predictive role of DNA methylation was confirmed for three studies comprising of four genes: CEBPA (OS: p = 0.02; EFS: p = 0.03), PBX3 (EFS: p = 0.01), LZTS2 (OS: p = 0.05; EFS: p = 0.0003), and NR6A1 (OS: p = 0.004; EFS: p = 0.0003). For all of these genes, higher methylation was an indicator of longer survival. Concurrent higher methylation of both LZTS2 and NR6A1 was highly significant for survival in cytogenetically normal (CN) AML group (OS: p < 0.0001; EFS: p < 0.0001) as well as for the whole AML cohort (OS: p = 0.01; EFS < 0.0001). In contrast, for two studies reporting the poor prognostic effect of higher GPX3 and DLX4 methylation, we found the exact opposite, again linking higher GPX3 (OS: p = 0.006; EFS: p < 0.0001) and DLX4 (OS: p = 0.03; EFS = 0.03) methylation to a favorable treatment outcome. Individual gene significance levels refer to the outcomes of multivariate Cox regression analysis.Out of twenty-seven genes subjected to DNA methylation validation, a prognostic role was observed for six genes. Therefore, independent validation studies are necessary to reveal truly prognostic DNA methylation changes and to enable the introduction of these promising epigenetic markers into clinical practice.© 2022.

Neuroinflammation is central to all forms of MS. The current effective therapies for relapsing-remitting MS target the peripheral immune system; these treatments, however, have repeatedly failed in progressive MS. Greater understanding of inflammation driven by CNS-resident cells - including astrocytes and microglia - is, therefore, required to identify novel potential therapeutic opportunities. Advances in imaging, biomarker analysis and genomics suggest that microglia and astrocytes have central roles in the progressive disease process. In this Review, we provide an overview of the involvement of astrocytes and microglia at major sites of pathology in progressive MS. We discuss current and future therapeutic approaches to directly target glial cells, either to inhibit pathogenic functions or to restore homeostatic functions lost during the course of the disease. We also discuss how bidirectional communication between astrocytes and microglia needs to be considered, as therapeutic targeting of one is likely to alter the functions of the other.© 2022.

"35101972","ASK1 signaling regulates phase-specific glial interactions during neuroinflammation.","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","Neuroinflammation is well known to be associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) is a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase that has been implicated in neuroinflammation, but its precise cellular and molecular mechanisms remain unknown. In this study, we generated conditional knockout (CKO) mice that lack ASK1 in T cells, dendritic cells, microglia/macrophages, microglia, or astrocytes, to assess the roles of ASK1 during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). We found that neuroinflammation was reduced in both the early and later stages of EAE in microglia/macrophage-specific ASK1 knockout mice, whereas only the later-stage neuroinflammation was ameliorated in astrocyte-specific ASK1 knockout mice. ASK1 deficiency in T cells and dendritic cells had no significant effects on EAE severity. Further, we found that ASK1 in microglia/macrophages induces a proinflammatory environment, which subsequently activates astrocytes to exacerbate neuroinflammation. Microglia-specific ASK1 deletion was achieved using aCX3CR1CreERsystem, and we found that ASK1 signaling in microglia played a major role in generating and maintaining disease. Activated astrocytes produce key inflammatory mediators, including CCL2, that further activated and recruited microglia/macrophages, in an astrocytic ASK1-dependent manner. Astrocyte-specific analysis revealed CCL2 expression was higher in the later stage compared with the early stage, suggesting a greater proinflammatory role of astrocytes in the later stage. Our findings demonstrate cell-type-specific roles of ASK1 and suggest phase-specific ASK1-dependent glial cell interactions in EAE pathophysiology. We propose glial ASK1 as a promising therapeutic target for reducing neuroinflammation.Copyright © 2022 the Author(s). Published by PNAS."

This adversity can exacerbate existing morbidities, trigger new ones, and increase the risk of mortality-features that are also characteristic of advanced age-inviting the hypothesis that extreme weather events may accelerate aging. To test this idea, we examined the impact of Hurricane Maria and its aftermath on immune cell gene expression in large, age-matched, cross-sectional samples from free-ranging rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) living on an isolated island. A cross section of macaques was sampled 1 to 4 y before (n= 435) and 1 y after (n= 108) the hurricane. Hurricane Maria was significantly associated with differential expression of 4% of immune-cell-expressed genes, and these effects were correlated with age-associated alterations in gene expression. We further found that individuals exposed to the hurricane had a gene expression profile that was, on average, 1.96 y older than individuals that were not-roughly equivalent to an increase in 7 to 8 y of a human life. Living through an intense hurricane and its aftermath was associated with expression of key immune genes, dysregulated proteostasis networks, and greater expression of inflammatory immune cell-specific marker genes. Together, our findings illuminate potential mechanisms through which the adversity unleashed by extreme weather and potentially other natural disasters might become biologically embedded, accelerate age-related molecular immune phenotypes, and ultimately contribute to earlier onset of disease and death.Copyright © 2022 the Author(s).

Both the large amount of zero counts in experimental data and the lack of a consensus preprocessing pipeline for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data make it hard to infer networks. Imputation can be applied in order to enhance gene-gene correlations and facilitate downstream analysis. However, it is unclear what consequences imputation methods have on the reconstruction of gene regulatory networks. To study this, we evaluate the differences on the performance and structure of reconstructed networks before and after imputation in single-cell data. We observe an inflation of gene-gene correlations that affects the predicted network structures and may decrease the performance of network reconstruction in general. However, within the modest limits of achievable results, we also make a recommendation as to an advisable combination of algorithms while warning against the indiscriminate use of imputation before network reconstruction in general.© 2021 The Author(s)."
"35186713","Single-Cell Technologies to Decipher the Immune Microenvironment in Myeloid Neoplasms: Perspectives and Opportunities.","Front Oncol","Myeloid neoplasms (MN) are heterogeneous clonal disorders arising from the expansion of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. In parallel with genetic and epigenetic dynamics, the immune system plays a critical role in modulating tumorigenesis, evolution and therapeutic resistance at the various stages of disease progression. Single-cell technologies represent powerful tools to assess the cellular composition of the complex tumor ecosystem and its immune environment, to dissect interactions between neoplastic and non-neoplastic components, and to decipher their functional heterogeneity and plasticity. In addition, recent progress in multi-omics approaches provide an unprecedented opportunity to study multiple molecular layers (DNA, RNA, proteins) at the level of single-cell or single cellular clones during disease evolution or in response to therapy. Applying single-cell technologies to MN holds the promise to uncover novel cell subsets or phenotypic states and highlight the connections between clonal evolution and immune escape, which is crucial to fully understand disease progression and therapeutic resistance. This review provides a perspective on the various opportunities and challenges in the field, focusing on key questions in MN research and discussing their translational value, particularly for the development of more efficient immunotherapies.Copyright © 2022 Caprioli, Nazari, Milovanovic and Pelicci."

Each of these levels can be split into additional techniques that enable specific and optimized sequencing for a specialized purpose. At the transcriptomic level, single-cell sequencing has been used to understand immune-malignant cell networks, as well as differences between primary versus metastatic tumors. At the genomic and epigenomic levels, single-cell sequencing technology has been used to study genetic mutations involved in tumor evolution or the reprogramming of regulatory elements present in metastasized disease, respectively. Lastly, at the proteomic level, single-cell sequencing has been used to identify biomarkers important for predicting patient prognosis, as well as biomarkers essential for evaluating optimal treatment strategies. Integrated databases and atlases, as a result of large sequencing experiments, provide a vast array of information that can be applied to various studies and accessed by researchers to further answer scientific questions. This review summarizes recent, high-impact literature covering these aspects, as well as single-cell sequencing in the translational setting. Specifically, we review the potential that single-cell sequencing has in the clinic and its implementation in current clinical studies."

A comprehensive understanding of tumor microenvironment (TME) of reRCC may aid in designing effective anticancer therapies, including immunotherapies. Single-cell transcriptomics holds great promise for investigating the TME, however, this technique has not been used in reRCC. Here, we aimed to explore the difference in the TME and gene expression pattern between primary RCC (pRCC) and reRCC at single-cell level.We performed single-cell RNA sequencing analyses of 32,073 cells from 2 pRCC, 2 reRCC, and 3 adjacent normal kidney samples. 41 pairs of pRCC and reRCC samples were collected as a validation cohort to assess differences observed in single-cell sequencing. The prognostic significance of related cells and markers were studied in 47 RCC patients underwent immunotherapy. The function of related cells and markers were validated via in vitro and in vivo experiments.reRCC had reduced CD8+T cells but increased cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) infiltration compared with pRCC. Reduced CD8+T cells and increased CAFs infiltration were significantly associated with a worse response from immunotherapy. Remarkably, CAFs showed substantial expression of LGALS1 (Gal1). In vitro, CAFs could induce CD8+T cells apoptosis via Gal1. In vivo, knockdown of Gal1 in CAFs suppressed tumor growth, increased CD8+T cells infiltration, reduced the proportion of apoptotic CD8+T cells and enhanced the efficacy of immunotherapy.We delineated the heterogeneity of reRCC and highlighted an innovative mechanism that CAFs acted as a suppressor of CD8+T cells via Gal1. Targeting Gal1 combined with anti-PD1 showed promising efficacy in treating RCC.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022. Re-use permitted under CC BY. Published by BMJ."
"35173561","Helicid Improves Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Apoptosis of C6 Cells by Regulating SH2D5 DNA Methylation via the CytC/Caspase9/Caspase3 Signaling Pathway.","Contrast Media Mol Imaging","DNA methylation is reportedly associated with stress responses and depression. Treatment with antidepressants can regulate DNA methylation and, subsequently, gene expression in the hippocampus. Hence, DNA methylation is a potential target for treatment of depression. Screening of high-throughput data of a rat model of chronic unpredictable mild stress revealed relatively low expression of SH2 domain-containing 5 (SH2D5). SH2D5 can be overexpressed by treatment with helicid. Therefore, in order to further explore the role of SH2D5 in depression and whether helicid mediates the DNA methylation of SH2D5 as a potential antidepressant role, SH2D5 was overexpressed in C6 cells as a lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced model of depression. The expression levels of Bax, Bcl-2, Bad, and Daxx, and changes to the CytC/caspase9/caspase3 signal pathway were detected by qRT-PCR and Western blot analyses. After treatment with helicid or silencing of SH2D5, the above indices were detected. The results showed that helicid regulated the CytC/caspase9/caspase3 signaling pathway and improved the apoptosis indices of C6 cells through the overexpression of SH2D5. Interestingly, silencing of SH2D5 reversed the effects of helicid on the above indices. Then, in order to study the underlying mechanism, the cells were administered to helicid or 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-AzaD) and expression of SH2D5 was detected by qRT-PCR and Western blot analyses, while to assess the DNA methylation level of SH2D5 using bisulfite sequencing/PCR. The results showed that SH2D5 was hypermethylated with low expression in LPS-induced C6 cells, which was reversed by helicid and 5-AzaD. These results suggest that helicid may affect the CytC/caspase9/caspase3 apoptosis signaling pathway and improve the apoptosis indices by mediating DNA methylation of SH2D5.Copyright © 2022 Yuan Zhang et al."
"35174364","Intersecting single-cell transcriptomics and genome-wide association studies identifies crucial cell populations and candidate genes for atherosclerosis.","Eur Heart J Open","Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have discovered hundreds of common genetic variants for atherosclerotic disease and cardiovascular risk factors. The translation of susceptibility loci into biological mechanisms and targets for drug discovery remains challenging. Intersecting genetic and gene expression data has led to the identification of candidate genes. However, previously studied tissues are often non-diseased and heterogeneous in cell composition, hindering accurate candidate prioritization. Therefore, we analysed single-cell transcriptomics from atherosclerotic plaques for cell-type-specific expression to identify atherosclerosis-associated candidate gene-cell pairs.We applied gene-based analyses using GWAS summary statistics from 46 atherosclerotic and cardiovascular disease, risk factors, and other traits. We then intersected these candidates with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data to identify genes specific for individual cell (sub)populations in atherosclerotic plaques. The coronary artery disease (CAD) loci demonstrated a prominent signal in plaque smooth muscle cells (SMCs) (SKI,KANK2, andSORT1)P-adj. = 0.0012, and endothelial cells (ECs) (SLC44A1,ATP2B1)P-adj. = 0.0011. Finally, we used liver-derived scRNA-seq data and showed hepatocyte-specific enrichment of genes involved in serum lipid levels.We discovered novel and known gene-cell pairs pointing to new biological mechanisms of atherosclerotic disease. We highlight that loci associated with CAD reveal prominent association levels in mainly plaque SMC and EC populations. We present an intuitive single-cell transcriptomics-driven workflow rooted in human large-scale genetic studies to identify putative candidate genes and affected cells associated with cardiovascular traits. Collectively, our workflow allows for the identification of cell-specific targets relevant for atherosclerosis and can be universally applied to other complex genetic diseases and traits.© The Author(s) 2021.

"35159097","Dissecting <i>TET2</i> Regulatory Networks in Blood Differentiation and Cancer.","Cancers (Basel)","Cytosine methylation (5mC) of CpG is the major epigenetic modification of mammalian DNA, playing essential roles during development and cancer. Although DNA methylation is generally associated with transcriptional repression, its role in gene regulation during cell fate decisions remains poorly understood. DNA demethylation can be either passive or active when initiated by TET dioxygenases. During active demethylation, transcription factors (TFs) recruit TET enzymes (TET1, 2, and 3) to specific gene regulatory regions to first catalyze the oxidation of 5mC to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) and subsequently to higher oxidized cytosine derivatives. OnlyTET2is frequently mutated in the hematopoietic system from the three TET family members. These mutations initially lead to the hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) compartment expansion, eventually evolving to give rise to a wide range of blood malignancies. This review focuses on recent advances in characterizing the mainTET2-mediated molecular mechanisms that activate aberrant transcriptional programs in blood cancer onset and development. In addition, we discuss some of the key outstanding questions in the field."
"35190695","Future perspectives of uveal melanoma blood based biomarkers.","Br J Cancer","Uveal melanoma (UM) is the most common primary intraocular malignancy affecting adults. Despite successful local treatment of the primary tumour, metastatic disease develops in up to 50% of patients. Metastatic UM carries a particularly poor prognosis, with no effective therapeutic option available to date. Genetic studies of UM have demonstrated that cytogenetic features, including gene expression, somatic copy number alterations and specific gene mutations can allow more accurate assessment of metastatic risk. Pre-emptive therapies to avert metastasis are being tested in clinical trials in patients with high-risk UM. However, current prognostic methods require an intraocular tumour biopsy, which is a highly invasive procedure carrying a risk of vision-threatening complications and is limited by sampling variability. Recently, a new diagnostic concept known as ""liquid biopsy"" has emerged, heralding a substantial potential for minimally invasive genetic characterisation of tumours. Here, we examine the current evidence supporting the potential of blood circulating tumour cells (CTCs), circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA), microRNA (miRNA) and exosomes as biomarkers for UM. In particular, we discuss the potential of these biomarkers to aid clinical decision making throughout the management of UM patients.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35158795","Rlip Depletion Alters Oncogene Transcription at Multiple Distinct Regulatory Levels.","Cancers (Basel)","Rlip76 (Rlip) is a multifunctional membrane protein that facilitates the high metabolic rates of cancer cells through the efflux of toxic metabolites and other functions. Rlip inhibition or depletion results in broad-spectrum anti-cancer effects in vitro and in vivo. Rlip depletion effectively suppresses malignancy and causes global reversion of characteristic CpG island methylomic and transcriptomic aberrations in the p53-null mouse model of spontaneous carcinogenesis through incompletely defined signaling and transcriptomic mechanisms. The methylome and transcriptome are normally regulated by the concerted actions of several mechanisms that include chromatin remodeling, promoter methylation, transcription factor interactions, and miRNAs. The present studies investigated the interaction of Rlip depletion or inhibition with the promoter methylation and transcription of selected cancer-related genes identified as being affected by Rlip depletion in our previous studies. We constructed novel promoter CpG island/luciferase reporter plasmids that respond only to CpG methylation and transcription factors. We found that Rlip depletion regulated expression by a transcription factor-based mechanism that functioned independently of promoter CpG methylation, lipid peroxidation, and p53 status."

Different assessment methods for sleep exist, however, many studies only use one measure of sleep or focus on one specific mental health problem. In this population-based study, we assessed different aspects of sleep and mother-reported mental health to provide a broad overview of the associations between reported and actigraphic sleep characteristics and mental health.This cross-sectional study included 788 children 10-11-year-old children (52.5% girls) and 344 13-14-year-old children (55.2% girls). Mothers and children reported on the sleep of the child and wrist actigraphy was used to assess the child's sleep patterns and 24 h activity rhythm. Mental health was assessed via mother-report and covered internalizing, externalizing and a combined phenotype of internalizing and externalizing symptoms, the dysregulation profile.Higher reported sleep problems were related to more symptoms of mental health problems in 10-11- and 13-14-year-old adolescents, with standardized ß-estimates ranging between 0.11 and 0.35. There was no association between actigraphy-estimated sleep and most mental health problems, but earlier sleep onset was associated with more internalizing problems (ß = - 0.09, SE = 0.03, p-value = 0.002), and higher intra-daily variability of the 24 h activity rhythm was associated with more dysregulation profile symptoms at age 10-11 (ß = 0.11, SE = 0.04, p-value = 0.002).Reported sleep problems across informants were related to all domains of mental health problems, providing evidence that sleep can be an important topic to discuss for clinicians seeing children with mental health problems. Actigraphy-estimated sleep characteristics were not associated with most mental health problems. The discrepancy between reported and actigraphic sleep measures strengthens the idea that these two measures tap into distinct constructs of sleep.© 2022. The Author(s)."

Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are a rare subset of tumor cells found in the blood of cancer patients. CTCs has the potential utility for screening, early and definitive diagnosis, prognostic and predictive assessment, and offers the potential for personalized management. However, a gold-standard CTC detection and enrichment method remains elusive, hindering comprehensive comparisons between studies. In this review, we summarize data regarding the utility of CTCs at different stages of PDAC from early to metastatic disease and discuss the molecular profiling and culture of CTCs. The characterization of CTCs brings us closer to defining the specific CTC subpopulation responsible for metastasis with the potential to uncover new therapies and more effective management options for PDAC."
"35154283","Machine Learning: A New Prospect in Multi-Omics Data Analysis of Cancer.","Front Genet","Cancer is defined as a large group of diseases that is associated with abnormal cell growth, uncontrollable cell division, and may tend to impinge on other tissues of the body by different mechanisms through metastasis. What makes cancer so important is that the cancer incidence rate is growing worldwide which can have major health, economic, and even social impacts on both patients and the governments. Thereby, the early cancer prognosis, diagnosis, and treatment can play a crucial role at the front line of combating cancer. The onset and progression of cancer can occur under the influence of complicated mechanisms and some alterations in the level of genome, proteome, transcriptome, metabolome etc. Consequently, the advent of omics science and its broad research branches (such as genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, and so forth) as revolutionary biological approaches have opened new doors to the comprehensive perception of the cancer landscape. Due to the complexities of the formation and development of cancer, the study of mechanisms underlying cancer has gone beyond just one field of the omics arena. Therefore, making a connection between the resultant data from different branches of omics science and examining them in a multi-omics field can pave the way for facilitating the discovery of novel prognostic, diagnostic, and therapeutic approaches. As the volume and complexity of data from the omics studies in cancer are increasing dramatically, the use of leading-edge technologies such as machine learning can have a promising role in the assessments of cancer research resultant data. Machine learning is categorized as a subset of artificial intelligence which aims to data parsing, classification, and data pattern identification by applying statistical methods and algorithms. This acquired knowledge subsequently allows computers to learn and improve accurate predictions through experiences from data processing. In this context, the application of machine learning, as a novel computational technology offers new opportunities for achieving in-depth knowledge of cancer by analysis of resultant data from multi-omics studies. Therefore, it can be concluded that the use of artificial intelligence technologies such as machine learning can have revolutionary roles in the fight against cancer.Copyright © 2022 Arjmand, Hamidpour, Tayanloo-Beik, Goodarzi, Aghayan, Adibi and Larijani."

This study aimed to construct ferroptosis-related gene score (FRGscore) for predicting recurrence, explore immune-molecular characteristics, and determine the benefit of immunotherapy in distinct ferroptosis-based patterns and FRGscore-defined subgroups.A total of 1,085 early-stage LUAD patients from four independent cohorts were included. Consensus clustering analysis was performed using 217 co-expressed FRGs to explore different ferroptosis-mediated patterns. An FRG scoring system was established to predict relapse, quantify ferroptosis-mediated patterns, and evaluate the response to immunotherapy in individual patients based on Lasso-penalized and stepwise Cox regression analyses. Immune landscape involving multiple parameters was further evaluated, stratified by cluster subtypes and FRGscore subgroups.Two ferroptosis-mediated patterns were identified and verified, which were characterized by significantly distinct prognosis and immune profiles. Analyses of immune characteristics showed that identified ferroptosis patterns were characterized as immune-inflamed phenotype and immune-exhausted phenotype. The FRG scoring model based on 11 FRG-derived signatures panel classified patients into the FRGscore-high and FRGscore-low subgroups. Significantly longer recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) were observed in the FRGscore-low subgroup. FRGscore-low patients were characterized by higher tumor mutational burden (TMB), immunoscore, immunophenoscore, and PD-L1 expression level and were associated with lower Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE) score, whereas the opposite was observed in FRGscore-high patients. Immune-active pathways were remarkably enriched in the FRGscore-low subgroup. This scoring model remained highly predictive of prognosis across different clinical, molecular, and immune subgroups. Further analysis indicated that FRGscore-low patients exhibited higher response to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy and better clinical benefits based on two independent immunotherapy cohorts.The proposed FRGscore could highly distinguish the recurrence patterns and molecular and immune characteristics and could predict immunotherapy prognosis, potentially representing a powerful prognostic tool for further optimization of individuated treatment and management strategies in early-stage LUAD.Copyright © 2022 Yi, Huang, Gu, Wu, Zou, Guo, Wen, Zhu and Zhao."

The accumulated alterations of DNAs would change the manifestation of proteins. Therefore, as is the case in cancer liquid biopsies, deep proteome profiling will likely provide invaluable and clinically relevant information in real-time throughout all stages of cancer progression. However, due to the great complexity of proteomes in liquid biopsy samples and the limitations of proteomic technologies compared to high-plex sequencing technologies, proteomic discoveries have yet lagged behind their counterpart, genomic technologies. Therefore, novel protein technologies are in urgent demand to fulfill the goals set out for biomarker discovery in cancer liquid biopsies.Notably, conventional and innovative technologies are being rapidly developed for proteomic analysis in cancer liquid biopsies. These advances have greatly facilitated early detection, diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring of cancer evolution, adapted or adopted in response to therapeutic interventions. In this paper, we review the high-plex proteomics technologies that are capable of measuring at least hundreds of proteins simultaneously from liquid biopsy samples, ranging from traditional technologies based on mass spectrometry (MS) and antibody/antigen arrays to innovative technologies based on aptamer, proximity extension assay (PEA), and reverse phase protein arrays (RPPA).© 2022.

However, distinct mechanisms between acute and subacute stages have not been systemically revealed. The present study aimed to identify differentially expressed proteins in severe TBI from the acute to subacute phase.Sixty Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into sham surgery and model groups. The severe TBI models were induced by the controlled cortical impact (CCI) method. We evaluated the neurological deficits through the modified neurological severity score (NSS). Meanwhile, H&E staining and immunofluorescence were performed to assess the injured brain tissues. The protein expressions of the hippocampus on the wounded side of CCI groups and the same side of Sham groups were analyzed by the tandem mass tag-based (TMT) quantitative proteomics on the third and fourteenth days. Then, using the gene ontology (GO), Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG), and protein-protein interaction (PPI), the shared and stage-specific differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were screened, analyzed, and visualized. Eventually, target proteins were further verified by Western blotting (WB).In the severe TBI, the neurological deficits always exist from the acute stage to the subacute stage, and brain parenchyma was dramatically impaired in either period. Of the significant DEPs identified, 312 were unique to the acute phase, 76 were specific to the subacute phase, and 63 were shared in both. Of the 375 DEPs between Sham-a and CCI-a, 240 and 135 proteins were up-regulated and down-regulated, respectively. Of 139 DEPs, 84 proteins were upregulated, and 55 were downregulated in the Sham-s and CCI-s. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that the differential pathophysiology across both stages. One of the most critical shared pathways is the complement and coagulation cascades. Notably, three pathways associated with gastric acid secretion, insulin secretion, and thyroid hormone synthesis were only enriched in the acute phase. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) was significantly enriched in the subacute stage. WB experiments confirmed the reliability of the TMT quantitative proteomics results.Our findings highlight the same and different pathological processes in the acute and subacute phases of severe TBI at the proteomic level.

Researchers currently tend to combine this genomic information from these multiple studies in the form of a meta-analysis. As the number of genes involved is very large, the classical meta-analysis approaches need to be updated to acknowledge this large-scale aspect of the data.In this article, we discuss how application of standard theoretical null distributional assumptions of the classical meta-analysis methods, such as Fisher's p-value combination and Stouffer's Z, can lead to incorrect significant testing results, and we propose a robust meta-analysis method that empirically modifies the individual test statistics and p-values before combining them.Our proposed meta-analysis method performs best in significance testing among several meta-analysis approaches, especially in presence of hidden confounders, as shown through a wide variety of simulation studies and real genomic data analysis.The proposed meta-analysis method produces superior meta-analysis results compared to the standard p-value combination approaches for large-scale simultaneous testing in genomic experiments. This is particularly useful in studies with large number of genes where the standard meta-analysis approaches can result in gross false discoveries due to the presence of unobserved confounding variables.© 2022.

Studies exploring the underlying neurobiological mechanism of drug memory formation will likely contribute to the development of treatments for drug addiction and the prevention of relapse. In our study, we applied a cocaine-conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm and a self-administration paradigm (two drug-associated memory formation model) to confirm the hypothesis that the Src kinase Fyn critically regulates cocaine-associated memory formation in the hippocampus. For this experiment, we administered the Src kinase inhibitor PP2 into the bilateral hippocampus before cocaine-CPP and self-administration training, and the results showed that pharmacological manipulation of the Src kinase Fyn activity significantly attenuated the response to cocaine-paired cues in the cocaine-CPP and self-administration paradigms, indicating that hippocampal Fyn activity contributes to cocaine-associated memory formation. In addition, the regulation of cocaine-associated memory formation by Fyn depends on Tau expression, as restoring Tau to normal levels disrupted cocaine memory formation. Together, these results indicate that hippocampal Fyn activity plays a key role in the formation of cocaine-associated memory, which underlies cocaine-associated contextual stimulus-mediated regulation of cocaine-seeking behaviour, suggesting that Fyn represents a promising therapeutic target for weakening cocaine-related memory and treating cocaine addiction.Copyright © 2022 Li, Zhou, Chen, Xiao and Zhou."

Key neuropeptide-related proteins and potential target proteins of GAS5 were extracted, and protein interaction networks were mapped. AlphaFold 2 was used to predict the structure of the target protein. The ClusPro tool was used to predict protein-protein interactions. ZDOCK was used to further confirm the protein-nucleic acid docking.The lncRNA GAS5 was downregulated in the peripheral blood of pregnant women with GDM compared with normal pregnant women. The subcellular localization sites of GAS5 were the nucleus, cytoplasm, and ribosome; in addition, GAS5 was present in exosomes. Intercellular interactions, including neuropeptide receptors, were increased in the amniotic fluid cells of patients with GDM. Venn diagram analysis yielded seven neuropeptide-related proteins and three GAS5 target proteins. Among them, HERC5/TAC1 interacted and GAS5 docked well with HERC5.The lncRNA GAS5 in the peripheral blood exosomes in patients with GDM may be a new target for the detection of GDM, and the interaction between GAS5 and HERC5/TAC1 may be involved in the pathogenesis of GDM.Copyright © 2022 Gui-Yan Tang et al."

This novel, state-of-the-art platform fundamentally advances the utility of RM to study protective and pathogenic T cell responses.Copyright © 2022 Gerdemann, Fleming, Kaminski, McGuckin, Rui, Lane, Keskula, Cagnin, Shalek, Tkachev and Kean."
"35163527","Alzheimer's Disease-Associated SNP rs708727 in <i>SLC41A1</i> May Increase Risk for Parkinson's Disease: Report from Enlarged Slovak Study.","Int J Mol Sci","SLC41A1(A1) SNPs rs11240569 and rs823156 are associated with altered risk for Parkinson's disease (PD), predominantly in Asian populations, and rs708727 has been linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, we have examined a potential association of the three aforementioned SNPs and of rs9438393, rs56152218, and rs61822602 (all three lying in theA1promoter region) with PD in the Slovak population. Out of the six tested SNPs, we have identified only rs708727 as being associated with an increased risk for PD onset in Slovaks. The minor allele (A) in rs708727 is associated with PD in dominant and completely over-dominant genetic models (ORD= 1.36 (1.05-1.77),p= 0.02, and ORCOD= 1.34 (1.04-1.72),p= 0.02). Furthermore, the genotypic triplet GG(rs708727)+ AG(rs823156)+ CC(rs61822602)might be clinically relevant despite showing a medium (h≥ 0.5) size difference (h= 0.522) between the PD and the control populations. RandomForest modeling has identified the power of the tested SNPs for discriminating between PD-patients and the controls to be essentially zero. The identified association of rs708727 with PD in the Slovak population leads us to hypothesize that thisA1polymorphism, which is involved in the epigenetic regulation of the expression of the AD-linked genePM20D1, is also involved in the pathoetiology of PD (or universally in neurodegeneration) through the same or similar mechanism as in AD."

This study aimed to investigate the 5-hmC expression in PT-DLBCL and evaluate its prognostic value.Methods:A total of 34 patients with PT-DLBCL treated in the Department of Hematology from August 2000 to August 2020 were included in this study. The expression of 5-hmC in PT-DLBCL tissues and normal testicular tissues were assessed by immunohistochemistry. 5-hmC staining is estimated as a percentage under every nuclear staining intensity score (0-3), 0 or 1 of which were regarded as 5-hmC reduction. The quantification of 5-hmC reduction is defined as the percentage of cells with 5-hmC staining scores of 0 and 1. According 5-hmC reduction of 80%, a 5-hmC reduction of <80% is regarded as ""5-hmC high-level group"", and a 5-hmC reduction of ≥80% is regarded as ""5-hmC low-level group"". Furthermore, Cox regression model was used to evaluate the prognostic value of all covariates.Results:The median percentage of 5-hmC reduction in the PT-DLBCL group was 77.50% (60%-90%), the median 5-hmC reduction in the normal testicular tissues was 30% (20%-50%). Compared with normal testicular tissue, 5-hmC levels in PT-DLBCL tissue were significantly decreased (p<0.05). Of the 34 PT-DLBCL patients, 17 had tumors with relatively low 5-hmC expression (5-hmC reduction of ≥80%) and 17 had tumors with relatively high 5-hmC expression (5-hmC reduction of < 80%). 5-hmC expression was negatively correlated with international prognostic index (p = 0.037), while there was no significant difference in 5-hmC decrease among different groups of age at diagnosis, lactate dehydrogenase, testicular lymphoma involvement (unilateral or bilateral), Ki-67 and tumor diameter. Relatively low 5-hmC expression indicated shorter overall survival (OS) (5-year OS 50.2% vs 81.3%, p=0.022) and progression-free survival (PFS) (5-year PFS 38.5% vs 70.7%, p=0.001). Cox multivariate analysis of IPI (2-3 vs. 0-1), intrathecal prophylaxis (No vs. Yes), and 5-hmC reduction (≥80% vs. <80%) showed that 5-hmC reduction ≥80% (hazard ratio: 7.252, p = 0.005) and not receiving intrathecal prophylaxis (hazard ratio: 7.207, p =0.001) are independent risk factors for poor prognosis of PT-DLBCL.Conclusion:Our results suggested that 5-hmC decline can be identified as a poor prognostic predictor for PT-DLBCL. It is necessary to further explore the underlying mechanism of this epigenetic marker to identify methods to re-establish 5-hmC levels and provide new targets for cancer therapy.© The author(s)."
"35163133","The Epigenetic Role of Vitamin C in Neurodevelopment.","Int J Mol Sci","The maternal diet during pregnancy is a key determinant of offspring health. Early studies have linked poor maternal nutrition during gestation with a propensity for the development of chronic conditions in offspring. These conditions include cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and even compromised mental health. While multiple factors may contribute to these outcomes, disturbed epigenetic programming during early development is one potential biological mechanism. The epigenome is programmed primarily in utero, and during this time, the developing fetus is highly susceptible to environmental factors such as nutritional insults. During neurodevelopment, epigenetic programming coordinates the formation of primitive central nervous system structures, neurogenesis, and neuroplasticity. Dysregulated epigenetic programming has been implicated in the aetiology of several neurodevelopmental disorders such as Tatton-Brown-Rahman syndrome. Accordingly, there is great interest in determining how maternal nutrient availability in pregnancy might affect the epigenetic status of offspring, and how such influences may present phenotypically. In recent years, a number of epigenetic enzymes that are active during embryonic development have been found to require vitamin C as a cofactor. These enzymes include the ten-eleven translocation methylcytosine dioxygenases (TETs) and the Jumonji C domain-containing histone lysine demethylases that catalyse the oxidative removal of methyl groups on cytosines and histone lysine residues, respectively. These enzymes are integral to epigenetic regulation and have fundamental roles in cellular differentiation, the maintenance of pluripotency and development. The dependence of these enzymes on vitamin C for optimal catalytic activity illustrates a potentially critical contribution of the nutrient during mammalian development. These insights also highlight a potential risk associated with vitamin C insufficiency during pregnancy. The link between vitamin C insufficiency and development is particularly apparent in the context of neurodevelopment and high vitamin C concentrations in the brain are indicative of important functional requirements in this organ. Accordingly, this review considers the evidence for the potential impact of maternal vitamin C status on neurodevelopmental epigenetics."
"35163059","Retinal Plasticity.","Int J Mol Sci","Brain plasticity is a well-established concept designating the ability of central nervous system (CNS) neurons to rearrange as a result of learning, when adapting to changeable environmental conditions or else while reacting to injurious factors. As a part of the CNS, the retina has been repeatedly probed for its possible ability to respond plastically to a variably altered environment or to pathological insults. However, numerous studies support the conclusion that the retina, outside the developmental stage, is endowed with only limited plasticity, exhibiting, instead, a remarkable ability to maintain a stable architectural and functional organization. Reviewed here are representative examples of hippocampal and cortical paradigms of plasticity and of retinal structural rearrangements found in organization and circuitry following altered developmental conditions or occurrence of genetic diseases leading to neuronal degeneration. The variable rate of plastic changes found in mammalian retinal neurons in different circumstances is discussed, focusing on structural plasticity. The likely adaptive value of maintaining a low level of plasticity in an organ subserving a sensory modality that is dominant for the human species and that requires elevated fidelity is discussed."

Poor neurodevelopmental outcomes have been reported in children with congenital heart diseases (CHD). Intuitively, abnormal cardiac function or surgical intervention may stunt the developing brain, leading to neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD). However, recent work has uncovered several genetic variants within genes associated with the development of both the heart and brain that could also explain this co-occurrence. Given the scalability of hPSCs, straightforward genetic modification, and established differentiation strategies, it is now possible to investigate both CHD and NDD as independent events. We will first overview the potential for shared genetics in both heart and brain development. We will then summarize methods to differentiate both cardiac & neural cells and organoids from hPSCs that represent the developmental process of the heart and forebrain. Finally, we will highlight strategies to rapidly screen several genetic variants together to uncover potential phenotypes and how therapeutic advances could be achieved by hPSC-based models."

"35184750","Systematic comparison of published host gene expression signatures for bacterial/viral discrimination.","Genome Med","Measuring host gene expression is a promising diagnostic strategy to discriminate bacterial and viral infections. Multiple signatures of varying size, complexity, and target populations have been described. However, there is little information to indicate how the performance of various published signatures compare to one another.This systematic comparison of host gene expression signatures evaluated the performance of 28 signatures, validating them in 4589 subjects from 51 publicly available datasets. Thirteen COVID-specific datasets with 1416 subjects were included in a separate analysis. Individual signature performance was evaluated using the area under the receiving operating characteristic curve (AUC) value. Overall signature performance was evaluated using median AUCs and accuracies.Signature performance varied widely, with median AUCs ranging from 0.55 to 0.96 for bacterial classification and 0.69-0.97 for viral classification. Signature size varied (1-398 genes), with smaller signatures generally performing more poorly (P < 0.04). Viral infection was easier to diagnose than bacterial infection (84% vs. 79% overall accuracy, respectively; P < .001). Host gene expression classifiers performed more poorly in some pediatric populations (3 months-1 year and 2-11 years) compared to the adult population for both bacterial infection (73% and 70% vs. 82%, respectively; P < .001) and viral infection (80% and 79% vs. 88%, respectively; P < .001). We did not observe classification differences based on illness severity as defined by ICU admission for bacterial or viral infections. The median AUC across all signatures for COVID-19 classification was 0.80 compared to 0.83 for viral classification in the same datasets.In this systematic comparison of 28 host gene expression signatures, we observed differences based on a signature's size and characteristics of the validation population, including age and infection type. However, populations used for signature discovery did not impact performance, underscoring the redundancy among many of these signatures. Furthermore, differential performance in specific populations may only be observable through this type of large-scale validation.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35143593","Enteric nervous system modulation of luminal pH modifies the microbial environment to promote intestinal health.","PLoS Pathog","The enteric nervous system (ENS) controls many aspects of intestinal homeostasis, including parameters that shape the habitat of microbial residents. Previously we showed that zebrafish lacking an ENS, due to deficiency of the sox10 gene, develop intestinal inflammation and bacterial dysbiosis, with an expansion of proinflammatory Vibrio strains. To understand the primary defects resulting in dysbiosis in sox10 mutants, we investigated how the ENS shapes the intestinal environment in the absence of microbiota and associated inflammatory responses. We found that intestinal transit, intestinal permeability, and luminal pH regulation are all aberrant in sox10 mutants, independent of microbially induced inflammation. Treatment with the proton pump inhibitor, omeprazole, corrected the more acidic luminal pH of sox10 mutants to wild type levels. Omeprazole treatment also prevented overabundance of Vibrio and ameliorated inflammation in sox10 mutant intestines. Treatment with the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, acetazolamide, caused wild type luminal pH to become more acidic, and increased both Vibrio abundance and intestinal inflammation. We conclude that a primary function of the ENS is to regulate luminal pH, which plays a critical role in shaping the resident microbial community and regulating intestinal inflammation."

However, during treatment and later in life they are frequently confronted with the severe negative side-effects of their life-saving treatment. The occurrence of numerous features of accelerated aging, seriously affecting quality of life, has now become one of the most pressing problems associated with (pediatric) cancer treatment. Chemotherapies frequently target and damage the DNA, causing mutations or genome instability, a major hallmark of both cancer and aging. However, there are numerous types of chemotherapeutic drugs that are genotoxic and interfere with DNA metabolism in different ways, each with their own biodistribution, kinetics, and biological fate. Depending on the type of DNA lesion produced (e.g., interference with DNA replication or RNA transcription), the organ or cell type inflicted (e.g., cell cycle or differentiation status, metabolic state, activity of clearance and detoxification mechanisms, the cellular condition or micro-environment), and the degree of exposure, outcomes of cancer treatment can largely differ. These considerations provide a conceptual framework in which different classes of chemotherapeutics contribute to the development of toxicities and accelerated aging of different organ systems. Here, we summarize frequently observed side-effects in (pediatric) ex-cancer patients and discuss which types of DNA damage might be responsible."

The disease symptoms and outcomes depend on the host immunity, in which the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules play a distinct role. The HLA alleles have an inter-population variability, and understanding their link to the COVID-19 in an ethnically distinct population may contribute to personalized medicine. The present study aimed at detecting associations between common HLA alleles and COVID-19 susceptibility and severity in Armenians. In 299 COVID-19 patients (75 asymptomatic, 102 mild/moderate, 122 severe), the association between disease severity and classic HLA-I and II loci was examined. We found that the advanced age, male sex of patients, and sex and age interaction significantly contributed to the severity of the disease. We observed that an age-dependent effect of HLA-B*51:01 carriage [odds ratio (OR)=0.48 (0.28-0.80), Pbonf<0.036] is protective against severe COVID-19. Contrary, the HLA-C*04:01 allele, in a dose-dependent manner, was associated with a significant increase in the disease severity [OR (95% CI) =1.73 (1.20-2.49), Pbonf<0.021] and an advancing age (P<0.013). The link between HLA-C*04:01 and age was secondary to a stronger association between HLA-C*04:01 and disease severity. However, HLA-C*04:01 exerted a sex-dependent differential distribution between clinical subgroups [females: P<0.0012; males: P=0.48]. The comparison of HLA-C*04:01 frequency between subgroups and 2,781 Armenian controls revealed a significant incidence of HLA-C*04:01 deficiency in asymptomatic COVID-19. HLA-C*04:01 homozygous genotype in patients blueprinted a decrease in heterozygosity of HLA-B and HLA class-I loci. In HLA-C*04:01 carriers, these changes translated to the SARS-CoV-2 peptide presentation predicted inefficacy by HLA-C and HLA class-I molecules, simultaneously enhancing the appropriate HLA-B potency. In patients with clinical manifestation, due to the high prevalence of HLA-C*04:01, these effects provided a decrease of the HLA class-I heterozygosity and an ability to recognize SARS-CoV-2 peptides. Based on our observations, we developed a prediction model involving demographic variables and HLA-C*04:01 allele for the identification of potential cases with the risk of hospitalization (the area under the curve (AUC) = 86.2%) or severe COVID-19 (AUC =71%).Copyright © 2022 Hovhannisyan, Madelian, Avagyan, Nazaretyan, Hyussyan, Sirunyan, Arakelyan, Manukyan, Yepiskoposyan, Mayilyan and Jordan."

Post-COVID-19 patients showed abnormal airway (but not plasma) proteomes, with an elevated concentration of proteins associated with apoptosis, tissue repair, and epithelial injury versus healthy individuals. Increased numbers of cytotoxic lymphocytes were observed in individuals with greater airway dysfunction, while increased B cell numbers and altered monocyte subsets were associated with more widespread lung abnormalities. A one-year follow-up of some post-COVID-19 patients indicated that these abnormalities resolved over time.

To identify the most robust protein markers of the disease and the underlying pathways that are relevant under all conditions, it is essential to identify proteins that replicate most widely. Here we combined the Olink proteomics profiles of two newly recruited COVID-19 studies (N=68 and N=98) with those of three previously published COVID-19 studies (N=383, N=83, N=57). For these studies, three Olink panels (Inflammation and Cardiovascular II & III) with 253 unique proteins were compared. Case/control analysis revealed thirteen proteins (CCL16, CCL7, CXCL10, CCL8, LGALS9, CXCL11, IL1RN, CCL2, CD274, IL6, IL18, MERTK, IFNγ, and IL18R1) that were differentially expressed in COVID-19 patients in all five studies. Except CCL16, which was higher in controls, all proteins were overexpressed in COVID-19 patients. Pathway analysis revealed concordant trends across all studies with pathways related to cytokine-cytokine interaction, IL18 signaling, fluid shear stress and rheumatoid arthritis.

Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), considered multifactorial disorders, have been associated with changes in the gut microbiome. NDDs display pathologies that alter brain functions with a tendency to worsen over time. NDDs are a worldwide health problem; in the US alone, 12 million Americans will suffer from NDDs by 2030. While etiology may vary, the gut microbiome serves as a key element underlying NDD development and prognosis. In particular, an inflammation-associated microbiome plagues NDDs. Conversely, sequestration of this inflammatory microbiome by a correction in the dysbiotic state of the gut may render therapeutic effects on NDDs. To this end, treatment with short-chain fatty acid-producing bacteria, the main metabolites responsible for maintaining gut homeostasis, ameliorates the inflammatory microbiome. This intimate pathological link between the gut and NDDs suggests that the gut-brain axis (GBA) acts as an underexplored area for developing therapies for NDDs. Traditionally, the classification of NDDs depends on their clinical presentation, mostly manifesting as extrapyramidal and pyramidal movement disorders, with neuropathological evaluation at autopsy as the gold standard for diagnosis. In this review, we highlight the evolving notion that GBA stands as an equally sensitive pathological marker of NDDs, particularly in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and chronic stroke. Additionally, GBA represents a potent therapeutic target for treating NDDs."

"35084499","The Role of DNA Methylation in Genome Defense in Cnidaria and Other Invertebrates.","Mol Biol Evol","Considerable attention has recently been focused on the potential involvement of DNA methylation in regulating gene expression in cnidarians. Much of this work has been centered on corals, in the context of changes in methylation perhaps facilitating adaptation to higher seawater temperatures and other stressful conditions. Although first proposed more than 30 years ago, the possibility that DNA methylation systems function in protecting animal genomes against the harmful effects of transposon activity has largely been ignored since that time. Here, we show that transposons are specifically targeted by the DNA methylation system in cnidarians, and that the youngest transposons (i.e., those most likely to be active) are most highly methylated. Transposons in longer and highly active genes were preferentially methylated and, as transposons aged, methylation levels declined, reducing the potentially harmful side effects of CpG methylation. In Cnidaria and a range of other invertebrates, correlation between the overall extent of methylation and transposon content was strongly supported. Present transposon burden is the dominant factor in determining overall level of genomic methylation in a range of animals that diverged in or before the early Cambrian, suggesting that genome defense represents the ancestral role of CpG methylation.© The Author(s) 2022.

However, what are the mRNA targets regulated by miRNAs and how miRNAs are transcriptionally regulated themselves remain for the most part unknown. We found that in primary human memory T helper lymphocytes, miR-150 was the most abundantly expressed miRNA, and its expression decreased drastically upon activation, suggesting regulatory roles. Constitutive MIR150 gene expression required the RFX family of transcription factors, and its activation-induced down-regulation was linked to their reduced expression. By performing miRNA pull-down and sequencing experiments, we identified PDGFA-associated protein 1 (PDAP1) as one main target of miR-150 in human T lymphocytes. PDAP1 acted as an RNA-binding protein (RBP), and its CRISPR/Cas-9-mediated deletion revealed that it prominently contributed to the regulation of T-cell proliferation. Overall, using an integrated approach involving quantitative analysis, unbiased genomics, and genome editing, we identified RFX factors, miR-150, and the PDAP1 RBP as the components of a regulatory axis that restrains proliferation of primary human T lymphocytes."

EGFR staining and its correlation with FAM83A expression were also assessed. Lentivirus-mediated manipulation of FAM83A expression in primary and hTERT-immortalized breast epithelial cells was employed. Biological and molecular alterations upon FAM83A overexpression/downregulation and FAM83A's interaction partners were investigated.TMA analysis revealed a 1.5-fold increase in FAM83A expression level in breast cancer cases as compared with normal breast tissues (p < 0.0001). FAM83A protein expression was directly correlated with EGFR level in both normal and breast cancer tissues. In in vitro assays, exogenous expression of FAM83A in either primary or immortalized breast epithelial cells promoted cell viability and proliferation. Additionally, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) revealed that FAM83A overexpression in primary cells affected the expression of genes involved in cellular morphology and metabolism. Mass spectrometry analysis identified DDX3X and LAMB3 as potential FAM83A interaction partners in primary cells, while we detected FAM83A interaction with cytoskeleton reorganization factors, including LIMA1, MYH10, PLEC, MYL6 in the immortalized cells.This study shows that FAM83A promotes metabolic activation in primary breast epithelial cells and cell proliferation in both primary and immortalized cells. These findings support its role in early breast oncogenesis.© 2022. The Author(s)."
