No,20220228,cell types,35142607,Human embryoid bodies as a novel system for genomic studies of functionally diverse cell types.,Elife,"Practically all studies of gene expression in humans to date have been performed in a relatively small number of adult tissues. Gene regulation is highly dynamic and context-dependent. In order to better understand the connection between gene regulation and complex phenotypes, including disease, we need to be able to study gene expression in more cell types, tissues, and states that are relevant to human phenotypes. In particular, we need to characterize gene expression in early development cell types, as mutations that affect developmental processes may be of particular relevance to complex traits. To address this challenge, we propose to use embryoid bodies (EBs), which are organoids that contain a multitude of cell types in dynamic states. EBs provide a system in which one can study dynamic regulatory processes at an unprecedentedly high resolution. To explore the utility of EBs, we systematically explored cellular and gene expression heterogeneity in EBs from multiple individuals. We characterized the various cell types that arise from EBs, the extent to which they recapitulate gene expression in vivo, and the relative contribution of technical and biological factors to variability in gene expression, cell composition, and differentiation efficiency. Our results highlight the utility of EBs as a new model system for mapping dynamic inter-individual regulatory differences in a large variety of cell types.© 2022, Rhodes et al."
No,20220228,dnam age,35189945,Susceptibility to hormone-mediated cancer is reflected by different tick rates of the epithelial and general epigenetic clock.,Genome Biol,"A variety of epigenetic clocks utilizing DNA methylation changes have been developed; these clocks are either tissue-independent or designed to predict chronological age based on blood or saliva samples. Whether discordant tick rates between tissue-specific and general epigenetic clocks play a role in health and disease has not yet been explored.Here we analyze 1941 cervical cytology samples, which contain a mixture of hormone-sensitive cervical epithelial cells and immune cells, and develop the WID general clock (Women's IDentification of risk), an epigenetic clock that is shared by epithelial and immune cells and optimized for cervical samples. We then develop the WID epithelial clock and WID immune clock, which define epithelial- and immune-specific clocks, respectively. We find that the WID-relative-epithelial-age (WID-REA), defined as the difference between the epithelial and general clocks, is significantly reduced in cervical samples from pre-menopausal women with breast cancer (OR 2.7, 95% CI 1.28-5.72). We find the same effect in normal breast tissue samples from pre-menopausal women at high risk of breast cancer and show that potential risk reducing anti-progesterone drugs can reverse this. In post-menopausal women, this directionality is reversed. Hormone replacement therapy consistently leads to a significantly lower WID-REA in cancer-free women, but not in post-menopausal women with breast or ovarian cancer.Our findings imply that there are multiple epigenetic clocks, many of which are tissue-specific, and that the differential tick rate between these clocks may be an informative surrogate measure of disease risk.© 2022.

No,20220228,dnam age,35181865,Integrating DNA Methylation Measures of Biological Aging into Social Determinants of Health Research.,Curr Environ Health Rep,"Acceleration of biological processes of aging is hypothesized to drive excess morbidity and mortality in socially disadvantaged populations. DNA methylation measures of biological aging provide tools for testing this hypothesis.Next-generation DNA methylation measures of biological aging developed to predict mortality risk and physiological decline are more predictive of morbidity and mortality than the original epigenetic clocks developed to predict chronological age. These new measures show consistent evidence of more advanced and faster biological aging in people exposed to socioeconomic disadvantage and may be able to record the emergence of socially determined health inequalities as early as childhood. Next-generation DNA methylation measures of biological aging also indicate race/ethnic disparities in biological aging. More research is needed on these measures in samples of non-Western and non-White populations. New DNA methylation measures of biological aging open opportunities for refining inference about the causes of social disparities in health and devising policies to eliminate them. Further refining measures of biological aging by including more diversity in samples used for measurement development is a critical priority for the field.© 2022.

No,20220228,early detection,35164838,Novel epigenetic network biomarkers for early detection of esophageal cancer.,Clin Epigenetics,"Early detection of esophageal cancer is critical to improve survival. Whilst studies have identified biomarkers, their interpretation and validity is often confounded by cell-type heterogeneity.Here we applied systems-epigenomic and cell-type deconvolution algorithms to a discovery set encompassing RNA-Seq and DNA methylation data from esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) patients and matched normal-adjacent tissue, in order to identify robust biomarkers, free from the confounding effect posed by cell-type heterogeneity. We identify 12 gene-modules that are epigenetically deregulated in EAC, and are able to validate all 12 modules in 4 independent EAC cohorts. We demonstrate that the epigenetic deregulation is present in the epithelial compartment of EAC-tissue. Using single-cell RNA-Seq data we show that one of these modules, a proto-cadherin module centered around CTNND2, is inactivated in Barrett's Esophagus, a precursor lesion to EAC. By measuring DNA methylation in saliva from EAC cases and controls, we identify a chemokine module centered around CCL20, whose methylation patterns in saliva correlate with EAC status.Given our observations that a CCL20 chemokine network is overactivated in EAC tissue and saliva from EAC patients, and that in independent studies CCL20 has been found to be overactivated in EAC tissue infected with the bacterium F. nucleatum, a bacterium that normally inhabits the oral cavity, our results highlight the possibility of using DNAm measurements in saliva as a proxy for changes occurring in the esophageal epithelium. Both the CTNND2/CCL20 modules represent novel promising network biomarkers for EAC that merit further investigation.© 2022. The Author(s)."
No,20220228,epigenetics,35143483,Slow nucleosome dynamics set the transcriptional speed limit and induce RNA polymerase II traffic jams and bursts.,PLoS Comput Biol,"Nucleosomes are recognized as key regulators of transcription. However, the relationship between slow nucleosome unwrapping dynamics and bulk transcriptional properties has not been thoroughly explored. Here, an agent-based model that we call the dynamic defect Totally Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process (ddTASEP) was constructed to investigate the effects of nucleosome-induced pausing on transcriptional dynamics. Pausing due to slow nucleosome dynamics induced RNAPII convoy formation, which would cooperatively prevent nucleosome rebinding leading to bursts of transcription. The mean first passage time (MFPT) and the variance of first passage time (VFPT) were analytically expressed in terms of the nucleosome rate constants, allowing for the direct quantification of the effects of nucleosome-induced pausing on pioneering polymerase dynamics. The mean first passage elongation rate γ(hc, ho) is inversely proportional to the MFPT and can be considered to be a new axis of the ddTASEP phase diagram, orthogonal to the classical αβ-plane (where α and β are the initiation and termination rates). Subsequently, we showed that, for β = 1, there is a novel jamming transition in the αγ-plane that separates the ddTASEP dynamics into initiation-limited and nucleosome pausing-limited regions. We propose analytical estimates for the RNAPII density ρ, average elongation rate v, and transcription flux J and verified them numerically. We demonstrate that the intra-burst RNAPII waiting times tin follow the time-headway distribution of a max flux TASEP and that the average inter-burst interval [Formula: see text] correlates with the index of dispersion De. In the limit γ→0, the average burst size reaches a maximum set by the closing rate hc. When α≪1, the burst sizes are geometrically distributed, allowing large bursts even while the average burst size [Formula: see text] is small. Last, preliminary results on the relative effects of static and dynamic defects are presented to show that dynamic defects can induce equal or greater pausing than static bottle necks."

We investigated whether DNA methylation is associated with antihypertensive responses to a diuretic, a beta-blocker, a calcium channel blocker or an angiotensin receptor antagonist. In addition, since we previously showed an SNP at the transcription start site (TSS) of the catecholamine biosynthesis-relatedACY3gene to associate with blood pressure (BP) response to beta-blockers, we specifically analysed the association of methylation sites close to theACY3TSS with BP responses to beta-blockers. We conducted an epigenome-wide association study between leukocyte DNA methylation and BP responses to antihypertensive monotherapies in two hypertensive Finnish cohorts: the GENRES (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03276598; amlodipine 5 mg, bisoprolol 5 mg, hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg, or losartan 50 mg daily) and the LIFE-Fin studies (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00338260; atenolol 50 mg or losartan 50 mg daily). The monotherapy groups consisted of approximately 200 individuals each. We identified 64 methylation sites to suggestively associate (P < 1E-5) with either systolic or diastolic BP responses to a particular study drug in GENRES. These associations did not replicate in LIFE-Fin . Three methylation sites close to theACY3TSS were associated with systolic BP responses to bisoprolol in GENRES but not genome-wide significantly (P < 0.05). No robust associations between DNA methylation and BP responses to four different antihypertensive drugs were identified. However, the findings on the methylation sites close to theACY3TSS may support the role ofACY3genetic and epigenetic variation in BP response to bisoprolol."

We carried out a longitudinal epigenome-wide association study, using data from the Isle of Wight Birth Cohort (IOWBC). To improve statistical power, we first screened CpGs based on associations of DNA methylation (DNAm) at an age of 10 years (pre-adolescence) with asthma acquisition at 10-18 years (during adolescence). A logistic regression with repeated measures was applied to CpGs that passed screening to examine the associations of pre-adolescence DNAm with asthma acquisition from 10-18 years and 18-26 years, with an interaction term to evaluate transition period specificity. Findings were further tested in an independent birth cohort, ALSPAC. In total, 205 CpGs (with 150 being females) showed associations with asthma acquisition (main or interaction effects) at FDR = 0.05 in IOWBC, of which 112 (90 being females) showed consistent associations in the ALSPAC. Genes that the identified CpGs were mapped to, e.g.,AKAP1andENO1, have been shown to be associated with the risk of asthma. Our findings indicated that DNAm at specific CpGs was associated with asthma acquisition. CpGs showing such associations were likely to be different between males and females and, at certain CpGs, were unique to a specific transition period."
Yes,20220228,ewas,35205218,Variation in Genotype and DNA Methylation Patterns Based on Alcohol Use and CVD in the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study (KoGES).,Genes (Basel),"Alcohol consumption can increase the risk of chronic diseases, such as myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension. We aimed to assess the association between genotype, DNA methylation patterns, alcohol consumption, and chronic diseases in Korean population. We analyzed 8840 subjects for genotypes and 446 for DNA methylation among the 9351 subjects from the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study (KoGES). We further divided both groups into two sub-groups according to the presence/absence of chronic diseases. We selected genes whose methylation varied significantly with alcohol consumption, and visualized genotype and DNA methylation patterns specific to each group. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) revealed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)rs2074356andrs11066280in HECT domain E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 4 (HECTD4) to be significantly associated with alcohol consumption in both the presence. Thers12229654genotype also displayed significantly different patterns with alcohol consumption. Furthermore, we retrieved differentially methylated regions (DMRs) from four groups based on sex and chronic diseases and compared them by drinking status. In genotype analysis, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) showed a higher proportion in drinker than in non-drinker, but not in DMR analysis. Additionally, we analyzed the enriched Gene Ontology terms and Kyoto Gene and Genome Encyclopedia (KEGG) pathways and visualized the network, heatmap, and upset plot. We show that the pattern of DNA methylation associated with CVD is strongly influenced by alcoholism. Overall, this study identified genetic and epigenetic variants influenced by alcohol consumption and chronic diseases."
Yes,20220228,ewas,35196023,"Genome-wide study of DNA methylation shows alterations in metabolic, inflammatory, and cholesterol pathways in ALS.",Sci Transl Med,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease with an estimated heritability between 40 and 50%. DNA methylation patterns can serve as proxies of (past) exposures and disease progression, as well as providing a potential mechanism that mediates genetic or environmental risk. Here, we present a blood-based epigenome-wide association study meta-analysis in 9706 samples passing stringent quality control (6763 patients, 2943 controls). We identified a total of 45 differentially methylated positions (DMPs) annotated to 42 genes, which are enriched for pathways and traits related to metabolism, cholesterol biosynthesis, and immunity. We then tested 39 DNA methylation-based proxies of putative ALS risk factors and found that high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, body mass index, white blood cell proportions, and alcohol intake were independently associated with ALS. Integration of these results with our latest genome-wide association study showed that cholesterol biosynthesis was potentially causally related to ALS. Last, DNA methylation at several DMPs and blood cell proportion estimates derived from DNA methylation data were associated with survival rate in patients, suggesting that they might represent indicators of underlying disease processes potentially amenable to therapeutic interventions."

Epigenetic mechanisms have been implicated in the etiology of PTSD, with DNA methylation being the most studied to identify novel molecular biomarkers associated with this disorder. We performed one of the largest single-sample epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) of PTSD to date. Our sample included 1135 male European-American U.S. veterans who participated in the National Health and Resilience in Veterans Study (NHRVS). DNA was collected from saliva samples and the Illumina HumanMethylation EPIC BeadChip was used for the methylation analysis. PTSD was assessed using the PTSD Checklist. An EWAS was conducted using linear regression adjusted for age, cell-type proportions, first 10 principal components, and smoking status. After Bonferroni correction, we identified six genome-wide significant (GWS) CpG sites associated with past-month PTSD and three CpGs with lifetime PTSD (prange = 10-10-10-8). These CpG sites map to genes involved in immune function, transcription regulation, axonal guidance, cell signaling, and protein binding. Among these, SENP7, which is involved in transcription regulation and has been linked to risk-taking behavior and alcohol consumption in genome-wide association studies, replicated in an independent veteran cohort and was downregulated in medial orbitofrontal cortex of PTSD postmortem brain tissue. These findings suggest potential epigenetic biomarkers of PTSD that may help inform the pathophysiology of this disorder in veterans and other trauma-affected populations.© 2022.

Yes,20220228,ewas,35169870,Epigenome-wide association study of incident type 2 diabetes: a meta-analysis of five prospective European cohorts.,Diabetologia,"Type 2 diabetes is a complex metabolic disease with increasing prevalence worldwide. Improving the prediction of incident type 2 diabetes using epigenetic markers could help tailor prevention efforts to those at the highest risk. The aim of this study was to identify predictive methylation markers for incident type 2 diabetes by combining epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) results from five prospective European cohorts.We conducted a meta-analysis of EWASs in blood collected 7-10 years prior to type 2 diabetes diagnosis. DNA methylation was measured with Illumina Infinium Methylation arrays. A total of 1250 cases and 1950 controls from five longitudinal cohorts were included: Doetinchem, ESTHER, KORA1, KORA2 and EPIC-Norfolk. Associations between DNA methylation and incident type 2 diabetes were examined using robust linear regression with adjustment for potential confounders. Inverse-variance fixed-effects meta-analysis of cohort-level individual CpG EWAS estimates was performed using METAL. The methylGSA R package was used for gene set enrichment analysis. Confirmation of genome-wide significant CpG sites was performed in a cohort of Indian Asians (LOLIPOP, UK).The meta-analysis identified 76 CpG sites that were differentially methylated in individuals with incident type 2 diabetes compared with control individuals (p values <1.1 × 10-7). Sixty-four out of 76 (84.2%) CpG sites were confirmed by directionally consistent effects and p values <0.05 in an independent cohort of Indian Asians. However, on adjustment for baseline BMI only four CpG sites remained genome-wide significant, and addition of the 76 CpG methylation risk score to a prediction model including established predictors of type 2 diabetes (age, sex, BMI and HbA1c) showed no improvement (AUC 0.757 vs 0.753). Gene set enrichment analysis of the full epigenome-wide results clearly showed enrichment of processes linked to insulin signalling, lipid homeostasis and inflammation.By combining results from five European cohorts, and thus significantly increasing study sample size, we identified 76 CpG sites associated with incident type 2 diabetes. Replication of 64 CpGs in an independent cohort of Indian Asians suggests that the association between DNA methylation levels and incident type 2 diabetes is robust and independent of ethnicity. Our data also indicate that BMI partly explains the association between DNA methylation and incident type 2 diabetes. Further studies are required to elucidate the underlying biological mechanisms and to determine potential causal roles of the differentially methylated CpG sites in type 2 diabetes development.© 2022.

Yes,20220228,ewas,35163587,Genome-Wide DNA Methylation in Policemen Working in Cities Differing by Major Sources of Air Pollution.,Int J Mol Sci,"DNA methylation is the most studied epigenetic mechanism that regulates gene expression, and it can serve as a useful biomarker of prior environmental exposure and future health outcomes. This study focused on DNA methylation profiles in a human cohort, comprising 125 nonsmoking city policemen (sampled twice), living and working in three localities (Prague, Ostrava and Ceske Budejovice) of the Czech Republic, who spent the majority of their working time outdoors. The main characterization of the localities, differing by major sources of air pollution, was defined by the stationary air pollution monitoring of PM2.5, B[a]P and NO2. DNA methylation was analyzed by a genome-wide microarray method. No season-specific DNA methylation pattern was discovered; however, we identified 13,643 differentially methylated CpG loci (DML) for a comparison between the Prague and Ostrava groups. The most significant DML was cg10123377 (log2FC = -1.92,p= 8.30 × 10-4) and loci annotated toRPTOR(total 20 CpG loci). We also found two hypomethylated loci annotated to the DNA repair geneXRCC5.Groups of DML annotated to the same gene were linked to diabetes mellitus (KCNQ1), respiratory diseases (PTPRN2), the dopaminergic system of the brain and neurodegenerative diseases (NR4A2). The most significant possibly affected pathway was Axon guidance, with 86 potentially deregulated genes near DML. The cluster of gene sets that could be affected by DNA methylation in the Ostrava groups mainly includes the neuronal functions and biological processes of cell junctions and adhesion assembly. The study demonstrates that the differences in the type of air pollution between localities can affect a unique change in DNA methylation profiles across the human genome."
Yes,20220228,ewas,35169479,Immune cell type and DNA methylation vary with reproductive status in women: possible pathways for costs of reproduction.,Evol Med Public Health,"Consistent with evolutionarily theorized costs of reproduction (CoR), reproductive history in women is associated with life expectancy and susceptibility to certain cancers, autoimmune disorders and metabolic disease. Immunological changes originating during reproduction may help explain some of these relationships.To explore the potential role of the immune system in female CoR, we characterized leukocyte composition and regulatory processes using DNA methylation (DNAm) in a cross-sectional cohort of young (20-22 years old) women differing in reproductive status.Compared to nulliparity, pregnancy was characterized by differential methylation at 828 sites, 96% of which were hypomethylated and enriched for genes associated with T-cell activation, innate immunity, pre-eclampsia and neoplasia. Breastfeeding was associated with differential methylation at 1107 sites (71% hypermethylated), enriched for genes involved in metabolism, immune self-recognition and neurogenesis. There were no significant differences in DNAm between nulliparous and parous women. However, compared to nullipara, pregnant women had lower proportions of B, CD4T, CD8T and natural killer (NK) cells, and higher proportions of granulocytes and monocytes. Monocyte counts were lower and NK counts higher among breastfeeding women, and remained so among parous women.Our findings point to widespread differences in DNAm during pregnancy and lactation. These effects appear largely transient, but may accumulate with gravidity become detectable as women age. Nulliparous and parous women differed in leukocyte composition, consistent with more persistent effects of reproduction on cell type. These findings support transient (leukocyte DNAm) and persistent (cell composition) changes associated with reproduction in women, illuminating potential pathways contributing to CoR.Lay Summary:Evolutionary theory and epidemiology support costs of reproduction (CoR) to women's health that may involve changes in immune function. We report differences in immune cell composition and gene regulation during pregnancy and breastfeeding. While many of these differences appear transient, immune cell composition may remain, suggesting mechanisms for female CoR.© The Author(s) 2022.

No,20220228,methods,35156895,Updates to data versions and analytic methods influence the reproducibility of results from epigenome-wide association studies.,Epigenetics,"Biomedical research has grown increasingly cooperative through the sharing of consortia-level epigenetic data. Since consortia preprocess data prior to distribution, new processing pipelines can lead to different versions of the same dataset. Similarly, analytic frameworks evolve to incorporate cutting-edge methods and best practices. However, it remains unknown how different data and analytic versions alter the results of epigenome-wide analyses, which could influence the replicability of epigenetic associations. Thus, we assessed the impact of these changes using data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) cohort. We analysed DNA methylation from two data versions, processed using separate preprocessing and analytic pipelines, examining associations between seven childhood adversities or prenatal smoking exposure and DNA methylation at age 7. We performed two sets of analyses: (1) epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS); (2) Structured Life Course Modelling Approach (SLCMA), a two-stage method that models time-dependent effects. SLCMA results were also compared across two analytic versions. Data version changes impacted both EWAS and SLCMA analyses, yielding different associations at conventional p-value thresholds. However, the magnitude and direction of associations was generally consistent between data versions, regardless of p-values. Differences were especially apparent in analyses of childhood adversity, while smoking associations were more consistent using significance thresholds. SLCMA analytic versions similarly altered top associations, but time-dependent effects remained concordant. Alterations to data and analytic versions influenced the results of epigenome-wide analyses. Our findings highlight that magnitude and direction are better measures for replication and stability than p-value thresholds."
No,20220228,methods,35172880,"Sustained software development, not number of citations or journal choice, is indicative of accurate bioinformatic software.",Genome Biol,"Computational biology provides software tools for testing and making inferences about biological data. In the face of increasing volumes of data, heuristic methods that trade software speed for accuracy may be employed. We have studied these trade-offs using the results of a large number of independent software benchmarks, and evaluated whether external factors, including speed, author reputation, journal impact, recency and developer efforts, are indicative of accurate software.We find that software speed, author reputation, journal impact, number of citations and age are unreliable predictors of software accuracy. This is unfortunate because these are frequently cited reasons for selecting software tools. However, GitHub-derived statistics and high version numbers show that accurate bioinformatic software tools are generally the product of many improvements over time. We also find an excess of slow and inaccurate bioinformatic software tools, and this is consistent across many sub-disciplines. There are few tools that are middle-of-road in terms of accuracy and speed trade-offs.Our findings indicate that accurate bioinformatic software is primarily the product of long-term commitments to software development. In addition, we hypothesise that bioinformatics software suffers from publication bias. Software that is intermediate in terms of both speed and accuracy may be difficult to publish-possibly due to author, editor and reviewer practises. This leaves an unfortunate hole in the literature, as ideal tools may fall into this gap. High accuracy tools are not always useful if they are slow, while high speed is not useful if the results are also inaccurate.© 2022. The Author(s)."

Here, we investigated whether single-cell ATAC-seq would provide further resolution of transcriptomic patterns that align with patient outcomes.We performed scATAC-seq on peripheral blood mononuclear cells from four trauma patients at <4 h, 24 h, 72 h post-injury and four matched healthy controls, and extracted the features associated with the global epigenetic alterations. Three large-scale bulk transcriptomic datasets from trauma, burn and sepsis patients were used to validate the scATAC-seq derived signature, explore patient epigenetic heterogeneity (Epigenetic Groups: EG_hi vs. EG_lo), and associate patterns with clinical outcomes in critical illness.Patient subsets with gene expression patterns in blood leukocytes representative of a high global epigenetic signature (EG_hi) had worse outcomes across three etiologies of critical illness. EG_hi designation contributed independent of the known immune leukocyte transcriptomic responses to patient prognosis (Trauma: HR=0.62 [95% CI: 0.43-0.89, event set as recovery], p=0.01, n=167; Burns: HR=4.35 [95% CI: 0.816-23.2, event set as death], p=0.085, n=121; Sepsis: HR=1.60 [95% CI: 1.10-2.33, event set as death], p=0.013, n=479; Cox proportional hazards regression).The inclusion of gene expression patterns that associate with global epigenetic changes in circulating leukocytes improves the resolution of transcriptome-based patient classification in acute critical illnesses. Early detection of both the global epigenetic signature and the known immune transcriptomic patterns associates with the worse prognosis in trauma, burns and sepsis.Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

Many efforts have been made to develop machine learning methods that automatically integrate omics data. Here, we review machine learning tools categorized as either general-purpose or task-specific, covering both supervised and unsupervised learning for integrative analysis of multi-omics data. We benchmark the performance of five machine learning approaches using data from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia, reporting accuracy on cancer type classification and mean absolute error on drug response prediction, and evaluating runtime efficiency. This review provides recommendations to researchers regarding suitable machine learning method selection for their specific applications.

No,20220228,review,35170363,Evaluating the challenges and reproducibility of studies investigating DNA methylation signatures of psychological stress.,Epigenomics,"Psychological stress can increase the risk of a wide range of negative health outcomes. Studies have been completed to determine if DNA methylation changes occur in the human brain because of stress and are associated with long-term effects and disease, but results have been inconsistent. Human candidate gene studies (150) and epigenome-wide association studies (68) were systematically evaluated to assess how DNA methylation is impacted by stress during the prenatal period, early childhood and adulthood. The association between DNA methylation ofNR3C1exon 1F and child maltreatment and early life adversity was well demonstrated, but other genes did not exhibit a clear association. The reproducibility of individual CpG sites in epigenome-wide association studies was also poor. However, biological pathways, including stress response, brain development and immunity, have been consistently identified across different stressors throughout the life span. Future studies would benefit from the increased sample size, longitudinal design, standardized methodology, optimal quality control, and improved statistical procedures."
No,20220228,sex differences,35177097,Gender-affirming hormone therapy induces specific DNA methylation changes in blood.,Clin Epigenetics,"DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark that is influenced by underlying genetic profile, environment, and ageing. In addition to X-linked DNA methylation, sex-specific methylation patterns are widespread across autosomal chromosomes and can be present from birth or arise over time. In individuals where gender identity and sex assigned at birth are markedly incongruent, as in the case of transgender people, feminization or masculinization may be sought through gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT). GAHT is a cornerstone of transgender care, yet no studies to date have investigated its effect on genome-wide methylation. We profiled genome-wide DNA methylation in blood of transgender women (n = 13) and transgender men (n = 13) before and during GAHT (6 months and 12 months into feminizing or masculinizing hormone therapy).We identified several thousand differentially methylated CpG sites (DMPs) (Δβ ≥ 0.02, unadjusted p value < 0.05) and several differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in both people undergoing feminizing and masculinizing GAHT, the vast majority of which were progressive changes over time. X chromosome and sex-specific autosomal DNA methylation patterns established in early development are largely refractory to change in association with GAHT, with only 3% affected (Δβ ≥ 0.02, unadjusted p value < 0.05). The small number of sex-specific DMPs that were affected by GAHT were those that become sex-specific during the lifetime, known as sex-and-age DMPs, including DMRs in PRR4 and VMP1 genes. The GAHT-induced changes at these sex-associated probes consistently demonstrated a shift towards the methylation signature of the GAHT-naïve opposite sex, and we observed enrichment of previously reported adolescence-associated methylation changes.We provide evidence for GAHT inducing a unique blood methylation signature in transgender people. This study advances our understanding of the complex interplay between sex hormones, sex chromosomes, and DNA methylation in the context of immunity. We highlight the need to broaden the field of 'sex-specific' immunity beyond cisgender males and cisgender females, as transgender people on GAHT exhibit a unique molecular profile.© 2022.
