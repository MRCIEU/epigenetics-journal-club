"34648488","The genomic ecosystem of transposable elements in maize.","PLoS Genet","Transposable elements (TEs) constitute the majority of flowering plant DNA, reflecting their tremendous success in subverting, avoiding, and surviving the defenses of their host genomes to ensure their selfish replication. More than 85% of the sequence of the maize genome can be ascribed to past transposition, providing a major contribution to the structure of the genome. Evidence from individual loci has informed our understanding of how transposition has shaped the genome, and a number of individual TE insertions have been causally linked to dramatic phenotypic changes. Genome-wide analyses in maize and other taxa have frequently represented TEs as a relatively homogeneous class of fragmentary relics of past transposition, obscuring their evolutionary history and interaction with their host genome. Using an updated annotation of structurally intact TEs in the maize reference genome, we investigate the family-level dynamics of TEs in maize. Integrating a variety of data, from descriptors of individual TEs like coding capacity, expression, and methylation, as well as similar features of the sequence they inserted into, we model the relationship between attributes of the genomic environment and the survival of TE copies and families. In contrast to the wholesale relegation of all TEs to a single category of junk DNA, these differences reveal a diversity of survival strategies of TE families. Together these generate a rich ecology of the genome, with each TE family representing the evolution of a distinct ecological niche. We conclude that while the impact of transposition is highly family- and context-dependent, a family-level understanding of the ecology of TEs in the genome can refine our ability to predict the role of TEs in generating genetic and phenotypic diversity."

Genes dysregulated in bothDnmt1tet/tetcells and schizophrenia patients were studied further.Results & conclusions:About 50% of dysregulated genes in patients also showed altered transcript levels inTet/Tetneurons in a DNA methylation-independent manner. These neurons unexpectedly showed genome-wide hypomethylation, increased transcript levels ofTet1andApobec1-3 genes and increased activity and copy number of LINE-1 elements. The observed similarities betweenTet/Tetneurons and schizophrenia brain samples reinforce DNMT1 overexpression as a risk factor."
"34646294","Genome-Wide DNA Methylation and Hydroxymethylation Changes Revealed Epigenetic Regulation of Neuromodulation and Myelination in Yak Hypothalamus.","Front Genet","Both 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) are important epigenetic modifications in neurodevelopment. However, there is little research examining the genome-wide patterns of 5mC and 5hmC in brain regions of animals under natural high-altitude conditions. We used oxidative reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (oxRRBS) to determine the 5mC and 5hmC sites in the brain, brainstem, cerebellum, and hypothalamus of yak and cattle. We reported the first map of genome-wide DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation in the brain, brainstem, cerebellum, and hypothalamus of yak (living at high altitudes) and cattle. Overall, we found striking differences in 5mC and 5hmC between the hypothalamus and other brain regions in both yak and cattle. Genome-wide profiling revealed that 5mC level decreased and 5hmC level increased in the hypothalamus than in other regions. Furthermore, we identified differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and differentially hydroxymethylated regions (DhMRs), most of which overlapped with each other. Interestingly, transcriptome results for these brain regions also showed distinctive gene levels in the hypothalamus. Finally, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) regulated by DMRs and DhMRs may play important roles in neuromodulation and myelination. Overall, our results suggested that mediation of 5mC and 5hmC on epigenetic regulation may broadly impact the development of hypothalamus and its biological functions.Copyright © 2021 Chai, Wu, Ji, Wang, Wang, Wang, Zhang, Zhong and Xin."
"34639069","Hyperglycemia Altered DNA Methylation Status and Impaired Pancreatic Differentiation from Embryonic Stem Cells.","Int J Mol Sci","The prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) is rapidly increasing across the globe. Fetal exposure to maternal diabetes was correlated with higher prevalence of impaired glucose tolerance and T2D later in life. Previous studies showed aberrant DNA methylation patterns in pancreas of T2D patients. However, the underlying mechanisms remained largely unknown. We utilized human embryonic stem cells (hESC) as the in vitro model for studying the effects of hyperglycemia on DNA methylome and early pancreatic differentiation. Culture in hyperglycemic conditions disturbed the pancreatic lineage potential of hESC, leading to the downregulation of expression of pancreatic markersPDX1,NKX6-1andNKX6-2after in vitro differentiation. Genome-wide DNA methylome profiling revealed over 2000 differentially methylated CpG sites in hESC cultured in hyperglycemic condition when compared with those in control glucose condition. Gene ontology analysis also revealed that the hypermethylated genes were enriched in cell fate commitment. Among them,NKX6-2was validated and its hypermethylation status was maintained upon differentiation into pancreatic progenitor cells. We also established mouse ESC lines at both physiological glucose level (PG-mESC) and conventional hyperglycemia glucose level (HG-mESC). Concordantly, DNA methylome analysis revealed the enrichment of hypermethylated genes related to cell differentiation in HG-mESC, includingNkx6-1. Our results suggested that hyperglycemia dysregulated the epigenome at early fetal development, possibly leading to impaired pancreatic development."

FunctionalMUC1variants are associated with multiple metabolic and biochemical traits. This study investigated the association of functionalMUC1variants withMUC1DNA methylation and various metabolic, biochemical, and hematological parameters. In total, 80,728 participants from the Taiwan Biobank were enrolled for association analysis using functionalMUC1variants and a nearby gene regional plot association study. A subgroup of 1686 participants was recruited forMUC1DNA methylation analysis. After Bonferroni correction, we found that twoMUC1variants, rs4072037 and rs12411216, were significantly associated with waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, hemoglobin A1C, renal functional parameters (blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine levels, and estimated glomerular filtration rate), albuminuria, hematocrit, hemoglobin, red blood cell count, serum uric acid level, and gout risk, with both favorable and unfavorable effects. Causal inference analysis revealed that the association between the variants and gout was partially dependent on the serum uric acid level. Both gene variants showed genome-wide significant associations withMUC1gene-body methylation. Regional plot association analysis further revealed lead single-nucleotide polymorphisms situated at the nearbyTRIM46-MUC1-THBS3-MTX1gene region for the studied phenotypes. In conclusion, our data demonstrated the pleiotropic effects ofMUC1variants with novel associations for gout, red blood cell parameters, andMUC1DNA methylation. These results provide further evidence in understanding the critical role ofTRIM46-MUC1-THBS3-MTX1gene region variants in the pathogenesis of cardiometabolic, renal, and hematological disorders."
"34638727","Genome Maintenance Mechanisms at the Chromatin Level.","Int J Mol Sci","Genome integrity is constantly threatened by internal and external stressors, in both animals and plants. As plants are sessile, a variety of environment stressors can damage their DNA. In the nucleus, DNA twines around histone proteins to form the higher-order structure ""chromatin"". Unraveling how chromatin transforms on sensing genotoxic stress is, thus, key to understanding plant strategies to cope with fluctuating environments. In recent years, accumulating evidence in plant research has suggested that chromatin plays a crucial role in protecting DNA from genotoxic stress in three ways: (1) changes in chromatin modifications around damaged sites enhance DNA repair by providing a scaffold and/or easy access to DNA repair machinery; (2) DNA damage triggers genome-wide alterations in chromatin modifications, globally modulating gene expression required for DNA damage response, such as stem cell death, cell-cycle arrest, and an early onset of endoreplication; and (3) condensed chromatin functions as a physical barrier against genotoxic stressors to protect DNA. In this review, we highlight the chromatin-level control of genome stability and compare the regulatory systems in plants and animals to find out unique mechanisms maintaining genome integrity under genotoxic stress."
"34638440","Interaction between Microsatellite Instability (MSI) and Tumor DNA Methylation in the Pathogenesis of Colorectal Carcinoma.","Cancers (Basel)","In colorectal cancer (CRC), the role of microsatellite instability (MSI) is well known. In a genome-wide scale, for the first time, we explored whether differential methylation is associated with MSI. We analyzed 250 paired samples from 125 CRC patients (m = 72, f = 53) at different stages. Of them, 101 had left-sided CRC, 30 had MSI, 34 had somatic mutation in KRAS proto-oncogene (KRAS), and 6 had B-Raf proto-oncogene (BRAF) exon 15p.V600E mutation. MSI was more frequent in right-sided tumors (54% vs. 17%,p= 0.003). Among the microsatellite stable (MSS) CRC, a paired comparison revealed 1641 differentially methylated loci (DML) covering 686 genes at FDR 0.001 with delta beta ≥ 20%. Similar analysis in MSI revealed 6209 DML covering 2316 genes. ANOVA model including interaction (Tumor*MSI) revealed 23,322 loci, where the delta beta was different among MSI and MSS patients. Our study shows an association between MSI and tumor DNA methylation in the pathogenesis of CRC. Given the interaction seen in this study, it may be worth considering the MSI status while looking for methylation markers in CRC. The study also indicates an opportunity for potential use of certain immune checkpoint inhibitors (CTLA4andHAVCR2inhibitors) in CRC with MSI."
"34637497","Healthy eating patterns and epigenetic measures of biological age.","Am J Clin Nutr","Healthy eating is associated with lower risks of disease and mortality, but the mechanisms underlying these associations are unclear. Age is strongly related to health outcomes, and biological age can be estimated using the blood methylome.To determine whether healthy eating patterns are associated with methylation-based measures of biological age.Among women in the Sister Study, we calculated scores on 4 recommendation-based healthy eating indexes [Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet, Healthy Eating Index-2015, Alternative Healthy Eating Index (aHEI-2010), and the Alternative Mediterranean diet] using a validated 110-item Block FFQ completed at enrollment. Genome-wide DNA methylation data were generated using the HumanMethylation450 BeadChip on whole blood samples collected at enrollment from a case-cohort sample of 2694 women and were used to calculate 4 measures of epigenetic age acceleration (Hannum AgeAccel, Horvath AgeAccel, PhenoAgeAccel, and GrimAgeAccel). Linear regression models, adjusted for covariates and cohort sampling weights, were used to examine cross-sectional associations between eating patterns and measures of biological age.All 4 healthy eating indexes had inverse associations with epigenetic age acceleration, most notably with PhenoAgeAccel and GrimAgeAccel. Of these, the strongest associations were for aHEI-2010 [per 1-SD increase in diet quality, PhenoAgeAccel β = -0.5 y (95% CI: -0.8 to -0.2 y) and GrimAgeAccel β = -0.4 y (95% CI: -0.6 to -0.3 y)]. Although effect modification was not observed for most lifestyle factors, in analyses stratified by physical activity, the benefits of a healthy diet on epigenetic age acceleration were more pronounced among women who did not meet physical activity guidelines (reporting <2.5 h/wk of exercise).Higher diet quality is inversely associated with methylation-based measures of biological age. Improving diet could have the most benefits in lowering biological age among women with lower levels of physical activity. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00047970.Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the American Society for Nutrition 2021."
"34635736","HPA axis dysregulation is associated with differential methylation of CpG-sites in related genes.","Sci Rep","DNA methylation shifts in Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis related genes is reported in psychiatric disorders including hypersexual disorder. This study, comprising 20 dexamethasone suppression test (DST) non-suppressors and 73 controls, examined the association between the HPA axis dysregulation, shifts in DNA methylation of HPA axis related genes and importantly, gene expression. Individuals with cortisol level ≥ 138 nmol/l, after the low dose (0.5 mg) dexamethasone suppression test (DST) were classified as non-suppressors. Genome-wide methylation pattern, measured in whole blood using the EPIC BeadChip, investigated CpG sites located within 2000 bp of the transcriptional start site of key HPA axis genes, i.e.: CRH, CRHBP, CRHR-1, CRHR-2, FKBP5 and NR3C1. Regression models including DNA methylation M-values and the binary outcome (DST non-suppression status) were performed. Gene transcripts with an abundance of differentially methylated CpG sites were identified with binomial tests. Pearson correlations and robust linear regressions were performed between CpG methylation and gene expression in two independent cohorts. Six of 76 CpG sites were significantly hypermethylated in DST non-suppressors (nominal P < 0.05), associated with genes CRH, CRHR1, CRHR2, FKBP5 and NR3C1. NR3C1 transcript AJ877169 showed statistically significant abundance of probes differentially methylated by DST non-suppression status and correlated with DST cortisol levels. Further, methylation levels of cg07733851 and cg27122725 were positively correlated with gene expression levels of the NR3C1 gene. Methylation levels of cg08636224 (FKBP5) correlated with baseline cortisol and gene expression. Our findings revealed that DNA methylation shifts are involved in the altered mechanism of the HPA axis suggesting that new epigenetic targets should be considered behind psychiatric disorders.© 2021.

We compared in an exploratory manner the blood DNA methylome of Japanese Americans (JPA) versus European Americans (EUA).Genome-wide buffy coat DNA methylation was profiled among healthy Multiethnic Cohort participant women who were Japanese (JPA; n = 30) or European (EUA; n = 28) Americans aged 60-65. Differentially methylated CpGs by race/ethnicity (DM-CpGs) were identified by linear regression (Bonferroni-corrected P < 0.1) and analyzed in relation to corresponding gene expression, a priori selected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and blood biomarkers of inflammation and metabolism using Pearson or Spearman correlations (FDR < 0.1).We identified 174 DM-CpGs with the majority of hypermethylated in JPA compared to EUA (n = 133), often in promoter regions (n = 48). Half (51%) of the genes corresponding to the DM-CpGs were involved in liver function and liver disease, and the methylation in nine genes was significantly correlated with gene expression for DM-CpGs. A total of 156 DM-CpGs were associated with rs7489665 (SH2B1). Methylation of DM-CpGs was correlated with blood levels of the cytokine MIP1B (n = 146). We confirmed some of the DM-CpGs in the TCGA adjacent non-tumor liver tissue of Asians versus EUA.We found a number of differentially methylated CpGs in blood DNA between JPA and EUA women with a potential link to liver disease, specific SNPs, and systemic inflammation. These findings may support further research on the role of DNA methylation in mediating some of the higher risk of liver disease among JPA.© 2021. The Author(s)."
"34633777","EHMT2 (G9a) activation in mantle cell lymphoma and its associated DNA methylation and gene expression.","Cancer Biol Med","The function of euchromatic histone-lysine N-methyltransferase 2 (EHMT2) has been studied in several cancers; however, little is known about its role in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). Thus, this study aimed to characterize the significance and function of EHMT2 in MCL.EHMT2 expression in MCL and reactive hyperplasia (RH) were investigated by immunohistochemistry. Genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation was performed on EHMT2 + MCL samples. The function of EHMT2 was determined by CCK8, flow cytometry, and western blot assays. Gene expression profile analysis was performed before and afterEHMT2knockdown to search for EHMT2-regulated genes. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) experiments were conducted to identify the proteins interacting with EHMT2.EHMT2 was expressed in 68.57% (24/35) of MCLs but not in any RHs. Genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation on EHMT2 + MCLs revealed that multiple members of theHOX,FOX,PAX,SOX, andCDXfamilies were hypermethylated or hypomethylated in EHMT2 + MCLs. BIX01294, a EHMT2 inhibitor, inhibited MCL cell growth and stalled cells in the G1 phase. Additionally, BIX01294 downregulated the expressions of cell cycle proteins, cyclin D1, CDK4, and P21, but upregulated the expressions of apoptosis-related proteins, Bax and caspase-3. Co-IP experiments revealed that EHMT2 interacted with UHRF1, HDAC1, and HDAC2 but not with HDCA3. AfterEHMT2knockdown, multiple genes were regulated, includingCD5andCCND1, mostly enriched in the Tec kinase signaling pathway. In addition, several genes (e.g.,MARCH1,CCDC50,HIP1, andWNT3) were aberrantly methylated in EHMT2 + MCLs.For the first time, we determined the significance of EHMT2 in MCL and identified potential EHMT2-regulated genes.Copyright © 2021 Cancer Biology & Medicine."
"34633450","Dichotomy in the Impact of Elevated Maternal Glucose Levels on Neonatal Epigenome.","J Clin Endocrinol Metab","Antenatal hyperglycemia is associated with increased risk of future adverse health outcomes in both mother and child. Variations in offspring's epigenome can reflect the impact and response to in utero glycemic exposure, and may have different consequences for the child.We examined possible differences in associations of basal glucose status and glucose handling during pregnancy with both clinical covariates and offspring cord tissue DNA methylation.This study included 830 mother-offspring dyads from the GUSTO cohort. The fetal epigenome of umbilical cord tissue was profiled using Illumina HumanMethylation450 arrays. Associations of maternal mid-pregnancy fasting (FPG) and 2h plasma glucose (2hPG) post-75g oral glucose challenge (OGTT) with both maternal clinical phenotypes and offspring epigenome at delivery were investigated separately.Maternal age, pre-pregnancy BMI and blood pressure measures were associated with both FPG and 2hPG; while Chinese ethnicity (p=1.9×10 -4), maternal height (p=1.1×10 -4), pregnancy weight gain (p=2.2×10 -3), pre-pregnancy alcohol consumption (p=4.6×10 -4), and tobacco exposure (p=1.9×10 -3) showed significantly opposite associations between the two glucose measures. Most importantly, we observed a dichotomy in the effects of these glycemic indices on the offspring epigenome. Offspring born to mothers with elevated 2hPG showed global hypomethylation. CpGs most associated with the two glucose measures also reflected differences in gene ontologies and had different associations with offspring birthweight.Our findings suggest that two traditionally used glycemic indices for diagnosing gestational diabetes may reflect distinctive pathophysiologies in pregnancy, and have differential impacts on the offspring's DNA methylome.© The Author(s) 2021.

"34631458","Genetics of adult attachment: An updated review of the literature.","World J Psychiatry","Attachment style, which has been theorized to be rooted in childhood bonding experiences, influences adult cognitive, emotional and interpersonal functioning. Despite its relationship with early experiences, research indicates that the continuity of attachment style across childhood and adulthood is only partial, being a malleable tendency that is shaped throughout development, with an increasing influence of genetics, as it occurs in other cognitive and behavioral phenotypes. Genetic research indicates that up to 45% of the variability in anxious and 39% in avoidant adult attachment style could be explained by genetic causes, but the precise mechanisms remain unclear. A narrative review is conducted analyzing the existing literature regarding the implication of candidate genes related to oxytocin, dopaminergic pathways, serotonergic pathways and brain-derived neurotrophic factor in adult attachment, with both vulnerability and differential susceptibility approaches, yielding mixed results. We highlight the lack of genome-wide studies and the scarcity of epigenetic investigation. Based on the existing data, we conclude that the genetics of adult attachment is an area that requires further research to clarify its etiological role and that it should be preferably approached as an interaction between nature and nurture.©The Author(s) 2021.

"34630483","Gene Body Methylation Confers Transcription Robustness in Mangroves During Long-Term Stress Adaptation.","Front Plant Sci","Whether induced epigenetic changes contribute to long-term adaptation remains controversial. Recent studies indicate that environmentally cued changes in gene body methylation (gbM) can facilitate acclimatization. However, such changes are often associated with genetic variation and their contribution to long-term stress adaptation remains unclear. Using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, we examined evolutionary gains and losses of gbM in mangroves that adapted to extreme intertidal environments. We treated mangrove seedlings with salt stress, and investigated expression changes in relation with stress-induced or evolutionarily-acquired gbM changes. Evolution and function of gbM was compared with that of genetic variation. Mangroves gained much more gbM than their terrestrial relatives, mainly through convergent evolution. Genes that convergently gained gbM during evolution are more likely to become methylated in response to salt stress in species where they are normally not marked. Stress-induced and evolutionarily convergent gains of gbM both correlate with reduction in expression variation, conferring genome-wide expression robustness under salt stress. Moreover, convergent gbM evolution is uncoupled with convergent sequence evolution. Our findings suggest that transgenerational inheritance of acquired gbM helps environmental canalization of gene expression, facilitating long-term stress adaptation of mangroves in the face of a severe reduction in genetic diversity.Copyright © 2021 Wang, Dai, Chen and Tang."
"34629427","Association between Posttraumatic Stress Disorder and Epigenetic Age Acceleration in a Sample of Twins.","Psychosom Med","Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been related to accelerated biological aging processes, but objective evidence for this association is limited. DNA methylation (DNAm) age acceleration is a novel measure of biological aging which may help clarify if PTSD is related to biological aging processes. We aim to examine whether PTSD is associated with biological aging using a comprehensive set of DNAm age acceleration markers, and to what extent the unshared environment contributes to the association.Using a cross-sectional co-twin control study design, we investigated the association of the clinical diagnosis and symptom severity of posttraumatic stress disorder with six measurements of DNAm age acceleration based on epigenome-wide data derived from peripheral blood lymphocytes of 296 male twins from the Vietnam Era Twin Registry.Twins with current PTSD had significantly advanced DNAm age acceleration compared with twins without PTSD for five out of six measures of DNAm age acceleration. Across almost all measures of DNAm age acceleration, twins with current PTSD were ""epigenetically older"" than their twin brothers without PTSD: estimated differences ranged between 1.6 (95% confidence interval 0.0 to 3.1) to 2.7 (95% confidence interval 0.5 to 4.8) biological age year-equivalents. A higher CAPS score was also associated with a higher within-pair DNAm age acceleration. Results remained consistent after adjustment for behavioral and cardiovascular risk factors.PTSD is associated with epigenetic age acceleration, primarily through unshared environmental mechanisms as opposed to genetic or familial factors. These results suggest that PTSD is related to systemic processes relevant to biological aging.Copyright © 2021 by American Psychosomatic Society."
"34629083","Multi-omics colocalization with genome-wide association studies reveals a context-specific genetic mechanism at a childhood onset asthma risk locus.","Genome Med","Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified thousands of variants associated with asthma and other complex diseases. However, the functional effects of most of these variants are unknown. Moreover, GWASs do not provide context-specific information on cell types or environmental factors that affect specific disease risks and outcomes. To address these limitations, we used an upper airway epithelial cell (AEC) culture model to assess transcriptional and epigenetic responses to rhinovirus (RV), an asthma-promoting pathogen, and provide context-specific functional annotations to variants discovered in GWASs of asthma.Genome-wide genetic, gene expression, and DNA methylation data in vehicle- and RV-treated upper AECs were collected from 104 individuals who had a diagnosis of airway disease (n=66) or were healthy participants (n=38). We mapped cis expression and methylation quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTLs and cis-meQTLs, respectively) in each treatment condition (RV and vehicle) in AECs from these individuals. A Bayesian test for colocalization between AEC molecular QTLs and adult onset asthma and childhood onset asthma GWAS SNPs, and a multi-ethnic GWAS of asthma, was used to assign the function to variants associated with asthma. We used Mendelian randomization to demonstrate DNA methylation effects on gene expression at asthma colocalized loci.Asthma and allergic disease-associated GWAS SNPs were specifically enriched among molecular QTLs in AECs, but not in GWASs from non-immune diseases, and in AEC eQTLs, but not among eQTLs from other tissues. Colocalization analyses of AEC QTLs with asthma GWAS variants revealed potential molecular mechanisms of asthma, including QTLs at the TSLP locus that were common to both the RV and vehicle treatments and to both childhood onset and adult onset asthma, as well as QTLs at the 17q12-21 asthma locus that were specific to RV exposure and childhood onset asthma, consistent with clinical and epidemiological studies of these loci.This study provides evidence of functional effects for asthma risk variants in AECs and insight into RV-mediated transcriptional and epigenetic response mechanisms that modulate genetic effects in the airway and risk for asthma.© 2021.

Genome-wide DNA methylations were quantified by Agilent 1 × 244 k Human Methylation Microarray.In this study, we proposed a loci inheritance frequency model that allows characterization of differential methylated regions as SCZ biomarkers. Based on this model, 112 hypermethylated and 125 hypomethylated regions were identified. Additionally, 121 hypermethylated and 139 hypomethylated genes were annotated. The results of functional enrichment analysis indicated that multiple differentially methylated genes (DMGs) involved in Notch/HH/Wnt signaling, MAPK signaling, GPCR signaling, immune response signaling. Notably, a number of hypomethylated genes were significantly enriched in cerebral cortex and functionally enriched in nervous system development.Our findings not only validated previously discovered risk genes of SCZ but also identified novel candidate DMGs in SCZ.

Cord blood LCn3PUFA concentrations were assessed by gas chromatography, and nail Hg and Se concentrations were measured using clippings collected within 6 months of birth by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Five aspects of infant neurodevelopment (communication, gross motor, fine motor, problem-solving, and personal-social skills) were assessed using the Age and Stage Questionnaire (ASQ) at ages 6 and 12 months. Multivariable-adjusted generalized estimating equations models were performed to examine the associations between cord blood LCn3PUFA concentrations and ASQ test scores, and these associations were stratified by nail Hg and Se levels. Epigenome-wide DNA methylation in cord blood was compared in a random subgroup consisting of 19 infants from the highest and 21 from the lowest decile of LCn3PUFA concentrations.LCn3PUFAs were not significantly associated with any ASQ test scores. However, in the subgroup with lower Hg (<median 0.13 ppm) and higher Se (≥median 0.87 ppm) levels, infants with higher LCn3PUFA concentrations had higher ASQ scores indicating better performance in gross motor skills [quartile 4 vs. 1: mean difference = 7.78; 95% confidence interval=(3.47, 12.09); Ptrend<0.01; Pinteraction = 0.03]. Additionally, two CpG sites at genes related to neurodevelopment/cognitive decline were differentially methylated when comparing high to low LCn3PUFA groups.The association of prenatal LCn3PUFA concentrations with infant neurodevelopment, particularly gross motor skills, may be observed among infants with high Se and low Hg levels.Copyright © 2021.

It is a major cause of mortality worldwide. Various prediction methods have been developed to assess the likelihood of developing CHD, including those based on clinical features and genetic variation. Recent epigenome-wide studies have identified DNA methylation signatures associated with the development of CHD, indicating that DNA methylation may play a role in predicting future CHD. This narrative review summarises recent findings from DNA methylation studies of incident CHD (iCHD) events from epigenome-wide association studies (EWASs). The results suggest that DNA methylation signatures may identify new mechanisms involved in CHD progression and could prove a useful adjunct for the prediction of future CHD.© 2021. The Author(s)."

DNA methyltransferase establishes and maintains a stable methylation state in genomic DNA. Efficient and specific DNA methyltransferase testing is essential for the early diagnosis and treatment of cancer. In this study, we designed an ultra-sensitive fluorescent biosensor, based on a 3D tetrahedral fluorescent scaffold assisted by symmetrical double-ring dumbbells, for the detection of DNA-[N 6-adenine]-methyltransferase (Dam MTase). Double-stranded DNA was methylated by Dam MTase and then digested by DpnI to form two identical dumbbell rings. The 3D tetrahedral fluorescent scaffold was synthesized from four oligonucleotide chains containing hairpins. When the sheared dumbbells reacted with the 3D tetrahedral fluorescent scaffold, the hairpins opened and a fluorescence signal could be detected. The strategy was successful over a wide detection range, from 0.002 to 100 U mL-1 Dam MTase, and the lowest detection limit was 0.00036 U mL-1. Control experiments with M.SssI methyltransferase and HpaII methylation restriction endonuclease confirmed the specificity of the method. Experiments with spiked human serum and the 5-fluorouracil inhibitor proved the suitability of the method for early cancer diagnosis.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Our data show that, (1) PSGs are enriched in plant hormone signal transduction pathway and the transcription factor family; (2) PSGs are significantly lower expressed than randomly selected non-PSGs; (3) PSGs with tissue specificity are significantly higher expressed in the callus and reproductive tissues (flower and silique) than in vegetable tissues (root, stem and leaf); (4) the proportion of PSGs is positively correlated with the number of retained triplication gene copies, but the expression level of PSGs decay with the increasing of triplication gene copies; (5) the CG and CHG methylation levels of PSGs are significantly higher in introns and UTRs than in the promoter and exon regions; (6) the percent of transposable element is in proportion to the methylation level, and DNA methylation (especially in the CG content) has the tendency to reduce the expression of PSGs. This study provides insights into the characteristics, evolution, function, expression and methylation of PSGs in B. rapa."
"34623402","SMILE: Mutual Information Learning for Integration of Single-cell Omics Data.","Bioinformatics","Deep learning approaches have empowered single-cell omics data analysis in many ways and generated new insights from complex cellular systems. As there is an increasing need for single cell omics data to be integrated across sources, types, and features of data, the challenges of integrating single-cell omics data are rising. Here, we present an unsupervised deep learning algorithm that learns discriminative representations for single-cell data via maximizing mutual information, SMILE (Single-cell Mutual Information Learning).Using a unique cell-pairing design, SMILE successfully integrates multi-source single-cell transcriptome data, removing batch effects and projecting similar cell types, even from different tissues, into the shared space. SMILE can also integrate data from two or more modalities, such as joint profiling technologies using single-cell ATAC-seq, RNA-seq, DNA methylation, Hi-C, and ChIP data. When paired cells are known, SMILE can integrate data with unmatched feature, such as genes for RNA-seq and genome wide peaks for ATAC-seq. Integrated representations learned from joint profiling technologies can then be used as a framework for comparing independent single source data.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.

However, there is no study to investigate the potential role and mechanisms of MTDH in ICB-treated cancers. Here, we systematically explored the cohorts from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and independent cancer cohorts. Elevated MTDH expression was founded to associate with a worse overall survival and poorer immune response in patients with cancer. Dysregulated tumor-infiltrating immune cells and inhibitory immune checkpoint expression were correlated with MTDH expression. Furthermore, the mutual interactions between epithelial-to-mesenchymal-transition, m6A-RNA-methylation, and MTDH may illustrate the potential mechanisms of MTDH resistant to ICB treatment. Although more designed experiments and trials are needed in the future, targeting MTDH may help to overcome immunotherapy resistance in a wide range of cancers.© 2021 The Author(s)."
"34621920","The pediatric buccal epigenetic clock identifies significant ageing acceleration in children with internalizing disorder and maltreatment exposure.","Neurobiol Stress","Studies reporting accelerated ageing in children with affective disorders or maltreatment exposure have relied on algorithms for estimating epigenetic age derived from adult samples. These algorithms have limited validity for epigenetic age estimation during early development. We here use a pediatric buccal epigenetic (PedBE) clock to predict DNA methylation-based ageing deviation in children with and without internalizing disorder and assess the moderating effect of maltreatment exposure. We further conduct a gene set enrichment analysis to assess the contribution of glucocorticoid signaling to PedBE clock-based results.DNA was isolated from saliva of 158 children [73 girls, 85 boys; mean age (SD) = 4.25 (0.8) years] including children with internalizing disorder and maltreatment exposure. Epigenetic age was estimated based on DNA methylation across 94 CpGs of the PedBE clock. Residuals of epigenetic age regressed against chronological age were contrasted between children with and without internalizing disorder. Maltreatment was coded in 3 severity levels and entered in a moderation model. Genome-wide dexamethasone-responsive CpGs were derived from an independent sample and enrichment of these CpGs within the PedBE clock was identified.Children with internalizing disorder exhibited significant acceleration of epigenetic ageing as compared to children without internalizing disorder (F1,147 = 6.67,p = .011). This association was significantly moderated by maltreatment severity (b = 0.49, 95% CI [0.073, 0.909], t = 2.322,p = .022). Children with internalizing disorder who had experienced maltreatment exhibited ageing acceleration relative to children with no internalizing disorder (1-2 categories: b = 0.50, 95% CI [0.170, 0.821], t = 3.008,p = .003; 3 or more categories: b = 0.99, 95% CI [0.380, 1.593], t = 3.215, p = .002). Children with internalizing disorder who were not exposed to maltreatment did not show epigenetic ageing acceleration. There was significant enrichment of dexamethasone-responsive CpGs within the PedBE clock (OR = 4.36,p = 1.65*10-6). Among the 94 CpGs of the PedBE clock, 18 (19%) were responsive to dexamethasone.Using the novel PedBE clock, we show that internalizing disorder is associated with accelerated epigenetic ageing in early childhood. This association is moderated by maltreatment severity and may, in part, be driven by glucocorticoids. Identifying developmental drivers of accelerated epigenetic ageing after maltreatment will be critical to devise early targeted interventions.© 2021 The Authors."
"34620872","Epigenetic modifications affect the rate of spontaneous mutations in a pathogenic fungus.","Nat Commun","Mutations are the source of genetic variation and the substrate for evolution. Genome-wide mutation rates appear to be affected by selection and are probably adaptive. Mutation rates are also known to vary along genomes, possibly in response to epigenetic modifications, but causality is only assumed. In this study we determine the direct impact of epigenetic modifications and temperature stress on mitotic mutation rates in a fungal pathogen using a mutation accumulation approach. Deletion mutants lacking epigenetic modifications confirm that histone mark H3K27me3 increases whereas H3K9me3 decreases the mutation rate. Furthermore, cytosine methylation in transposable elements (TE) increases the mutation rate 15-fold resulting in significantly less TE mobilization. Also accessory chromosomes have significantly higher mutation rates. Finally, we find that temperature stress substantially elevates the mutation rate. Taken together, we find that epigenetic modifications and environmental conditions modify the rate and the location of spontaneous mutations in the genome and alter its evolutionary trajectory.© 2021.

Epigenetic alterations are among the most widely studied mechanisms of As toxicity. To understand how As exposure alters gene expression through epigenetic modifications, a systematic genome-wide study was designed to address the impact of multiple important single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) related to As exposure on the methylome of drinking water As-exposed rural subjects from Pakistan. Urinary As levels were used to stratify subjects into low, medium and high exposure groups. Genome-wide DNA methylation was investigated using MeDIP in combination with NimbleGen 2.1 M Deluxe Promotor arrays. Transcriptome levels were measured using Agilent 8 × 60 K expression arrays. Genotyping of selected SNPs (As3MT, DNMT1a, ERCC2, EGFR and MTHFR) was measured and an integrated genetic risk factor for each respondent was calculated by assigning a specific value to the measured genotypes based on known risk allele numbers. To select a representative model related to As exposure we compared 9 linear mixed models comprising of model 1 (including the genetic risk factor), model 2 (without the genetic risk factor) and models with individual SNPs incorporated into the methylome data. Pathway analysis was performed using ConsensusPathDB. Model 1 comprising the integrated genetic risk factor disclosed biochemical pathways including muscle contraction, cardio-vascular diseases, ATR signaling, GPCR signaling, methionine metabolism and chromatin modification in association with hypo- and hyper-methylated gene targets. A unique pathway (direct P53 effector) was found associated with the individual DNMT1a polymorphism due to hyper-methylation of CSE1L and TRRAP. Most importantly, we provide here the first evidence of As-associated DNA methylation in relation with gene expression of ATR, ATF7IP, TPM3, UBE2J2. We report the first evidence that integrating SNPs data with methylome data generates a more representative epigenome profile and discloses a better insight in disease risks of As-exposed individuals.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

"34616320","Methylation Analysis in Monozygotic Twins With Treatment-Resistant Schizophrenia and Discordant Responses to Clozapine.","Front Psychiatry","Schizophrenia is a mental illness that involves both genetic and environmental factors. Clozapine, an atypical antipsychotic, is a well-established therapy for treatment-resistant schizophrenia. In this study, we focused on a set of monozygotic twins with treatment-resistant schizophrenia in which one twin effectively responded to clozapine treatment and the other did not. Our previous study generated neurons from induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells derived from these patients and compared the transcriptome profiles between mock- and clozapine-treated neurons. In this study, we performed genome-wide DNA methylation profiling to investigate the mechanisms underlying gene expression changes. First, we extracted the differentially methylated sites from each twin based on statistical analysis. Then, we combined the DNA methylation profiling with transcriptome profiling from our previous RNA-seq data. Among the genes with altered methylation and expression, we found the different proportions of the genes related to neuronal and synaptic functions between the clozapine responder and non-responder (35.7 and 6.7%, respectively). This trend was observed even when the basal differences between the responder and non-responder was excluded. These results suggest that effective clozapine action may correct the abnormalities of neuronal and synapse functions in schizophrenia via changes in methylation.Copyright © 2021 Kikuchi, Nakazawa, Kinoshita, Yamamori, Yasuda, Fujimoto, Hashimoto and Numata."

His phenotype was also reminiscent of genome-wide paternal uniparental isodisomy. We discuss the most likely origin of the UPDs; a maternal double monosomy 7 and 15 rescued by duplication of the paternal chromosomes after fertilization. So far, paternal UPD7 is not associated with an abnormal phenotype, while paternal UPD15 causes Angelman syndrome. Methylation analysis for other clinically relevant imprinting disorders, including BWSp, was normal. Therefore, we hypothesized that the double UPD affected other imprinted genes. To look for such effects, patient fibroblast RNA was isolated and analyzed for differential expression compared to six controls. We did not find apparent transcription differences in imprinted genes outside chromosomes 7 and 15 in patient fibroblast. PEG10 (7q21.3) was the only paternally imprinted gene on these chromosomes upregulated beyond double-dose expectation (6-fold). We speculate that a high PEG10 level could have a growth-promoting effect as his phenotype was not related to aberrations in BWS-locus on 11p15.5 after DNA, RNA, and methylation testing. However, many genes in gene sets associated with growth were upregulated. This case broadens the phenotypic spectrum of UPDs but did not show evidence of involvement of an imprinted gene network.Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press."

Critical gaps in basic knowledge need to be addressed to devise an exclusive biomarker and candidate when targeting the AXL/GAS6 axis.To clarify the effects of the AXL/GAS6 axis on RCC, we herein performed a large-scale immunogenomic analysis and single-cell counts including various metastatic organs and histological subtypes of RCC. We further applied genome-wide mutation analyses and methylation arrays.Varying patterns of AXL and GAS6 expression were observed throughout primary RCC tumours and metastases. Scoring individual AXL/GAS6 levels in the tumour centre and invasive margin, namely, the AXL/GAS6 score, showed a good ability to predict the prognosis of clear cell RCC. Metastasis- and histological subtype-specific differences in the AXL/GAS6 score existed since lung metastasis and the papillary subtype were weakly related to the AXL/GAS6 axis. Cell-by-cell immunohistological assessments clarified an immunosuppressive environment in tumours with high AXL/GAS6 scores. Genomic alterations in the PI3K-mTOR pathway and DNA methylation profiling revealed distinct differences with the AXL/GAS6 score in ccRCC.The AXL/GAS6 scoring system could predict the outcome of prognosis and work as a robust biomarker for the immunogenomic state in RCC.© 2021.

BDE-209 has been listed as persistent organic pollutants (POPs), which was considered to be reproductive toxin in the environment. But it still remains unclear about the effects of BDE-209 on DNA methylation and the induced-male reproductive toxicity. Due to the extensive epigenetic regulation in germ line development, we hypothesize that BDE-209 exposure impacts the statue of DNA methylation in spermatocytes in vitro. Therefore, the mouse GC-2spd (GC-2) cells were used for the genome wide DNA methylation analysis after treated with 32 μg/mL BDE-209 for 24 hr. The results showed that BDE-209 caused genomic methylation changes with 32,083 differentially methylated CpGs in GC-2 cells, including 16,164 (50.38%) hypermethylated and 15,919 (49.62%) hypomethylated sites. With integrated analysis of DNA methylation data and functional enrichment, we found that BDE-209 might affect the functional transcription in cell growth and sperm development by differential gene methylation. qRT-PCR validation demonstrated the involvement of p53-dependent DNA damage response in the GC-2 cells after BDE-209 exposure. In general, our findings indicated that BDE-209-induced genome wide methylation changes could be interrelated with reproductive dysfunction.

We investigated changes in the methylome in isolated circulating CD4+ T-cells in non-pregnant and pregnant women, during the 1st and 2nd trimester, using the Illumina Infinium Human Methylation 450K array, and explored how these changes were related to autoimmune diseases that are known to be affected during pregnancy. Pregnancy was associated with several hundreds of methylation differences, particularly during the 2nd trimester. A network-based modular approach identified several genes, e.g., CD28, FYN, VAV1 and pathways related to T-cell signalling and activation, highlighting T-cell regulation as a central component of the observed methylation alterations. The identified pregnancy module was significantly enriched for disease-associated methylation changes related to multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. A negative correlation between pregnancy-associated methylation changes and disease-associated changes was found for multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis, diseases that are known to improve during pregnancy whereas a positive correlation was found for systemic lupus erythematosus, a disease that instead worsens during pregnancy. Thus, the directionality of the observed changes is in line with the previously observed effect of pregnancy on disease activity. Our systems medicine approach supports the importance of the methylome in immune regulation of T-cells during pregnancy. Our findings highlight the relevance of using pregnancy as a model for understanding and identifying disease-related mechanisms involved in the modulation of autoimmune diseases.Abbreviations: BMIQ: beta-mixture quantile dilation; DMGs: differentially methylated genes; DMPs: differentially methylated probes; FE: fold enrichment; FDR: false discovery rate; GO: gene ontology; GWAS: genome-wide association studies; MDS: multidimensional scaling; MS: multiple sclerosis; PBMC: peripheral blood mononuclear cells; PBS: phosphate buffered saline; PPI; protein-protein interaction; RA: rheumatoid arthritis; SD: standard deviation; SLE: systemic lupus erythematosus; SNP: single nucleotide polymorphism; TH: CD4+T helper cell; VIStA: diVIsive Shuffling Approach."

Epigenetic regulation is considered as a key mediator for this phenomenon but analysis on humans is sparse. The Great Chinese Famine lasting from 1958 to 1961 is a natural string of disasters offering a precious opportunity for elucidating the underlying epigenetic mechanism of the long-term effect of early adversity.Using a high-throughput array platform for DNA methylome profiling, we conducted a case-control epigenome-wide association study on early-life exposure to Chinese famine in 79 adults born during 1959-1961 and compared to 105 unexposed subjects born 1963-1964.The single CpG site analysis of whole epigenome revealed a predominant pattern of decreased DNA methylation levels associated with fetal exposure to famine. Four CpG sites were detected with p < 1e-06 (linked to EHMT1, CNR1, UBXN7 and ESM1 genes), 16 CpGs detected with 1e-06 < p < 1e-05 and 157 CpGs with 1e-05 < p < 1e-04, with a predominant pattern of hypomethylation. Functional annotation to genes and their enriched biological pathways mainly involved neurodevelopment, neuropsychological disorders and metabolism. Multiple sites analysis detected two top-rank differentially methylated regions harboring RNF39 on chromosome 6 and PTPRN2 on chromosome 7, both showing epigenetic association with stress-related conditions.Early-life exposure to famine could mediate DNA methylation regulations that persist into adulthood with broad impacts in the activities of genes and biological pathways.

Previous studies showed that conversion of primed human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) into naive pluripotency is accompanied by genome-wide loss of methylation that includes imprinted loci. However, the extent of aberrant biallelic expression of imprinted genes is still unknown. Here, we analyze loss of imprinting (LOI) in a large cohort of both bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing samples of naive and primed hPSCs. We show that naive hPSCs exhibit high levels of non-random LOI, with bias toward paternally methylated imprinting control regions. Importantly, we show that different protocols used for the primed to naive conversion led to different extents of LOI, tightly correlated to FGF signaling. This analysis sheds light on the process of LOI occurring during the conversion to naive pluripotency and highlights the importance of these events when modeling disease and development or when utilizing the cells for therapy.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

To investigate the causality and direction of these associations, we performed bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses using data of the most recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) for AN and both a GWAS and an exome-wide-association-study (EWAS) for leptin levels. Most MR methods with genetic instruments from GWAS showed a causal effect of lower leptin levels on higher risk of AN (e.g. IVW b = -0.923,p= 1.5 × 10-4). Because most patients with AN are female, we additionally performed analyses using leptin GWAS data of females only. Again, there was a significant effect of leptin levels on the risk of AN (e.g. IVW b = -0.826,p= 1.1 × 10-04). MR with genetic instruments from EWAS showed no overall effect of leptin levels on the risk for AN. For the opposite direction, MR revealed no causal effect of AN on leptin levels.

Comprehensive integrated analysis was performed using bioinformatics analysis and the validated experiments including Sanger sequencing, methylation-specific PCR, qPCR and ROC analysis. Furthermore, the function of novel genes in ligamentum flavum cells (LFCs) was detected to explore the molecular mechanism in HLF through knock down experiment, overexpression experiment, CCK8 assay, apoptosis assay, and so on.We identified 69 SNP genes and 735 661 differentially methylated sites that were enriched in extracellular matrix, inflammatory, and cell proliferation. A comprehensive analysis demonstrated key genes in regulating the development of HLF including ACSM5. Furthermore, the hypermethylation of ACSM5 that was mediated by DNMT1 led to downregulation of ACSM5 expression, promoted the proliferation and fibrosis, and inhibited the apoptosis of LFCs.This study revealed that DNMT1/ACSM5 signaling could enhance HLF properties in vitro as a potential therapeutic strategy for HLF.© 2021.

However, there is limited consensus about which CpG islands (CGIs) define a CIMP, particularly in microsatellite stable (MSS) carcinomas. To study this phenotype in a systematic manner, we analyzed genome-wide CGI DNA methylation profiles of 19 MSS CRC using methyl-CpG immunoprecipitation (MCIp) and hybridization on 244K CGI oligonucleotide microarrays, determined KRAS and BRAF mutation status and compared disease-related DNA methylation changes to chromosomal instability as detected by microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization. Results were validated using mass spectrometry analysis of bisulfite-converted DNA at a subset of 76 individual CGIs in 120 CRC and 43 matched normal tissue samples. Both genome-wide profiling and CpG methylation fine mapping segregated a group of CRC showing pronounced and frequent de novo DNA methylation of a distinct group of CGIs that only partially overlapped with previously established classifiers. The CIMP group defined in our study revealed significant association with colon localization, either KRAS or BRAF mutation, and mostly minor chromosomal losses but no association with known histopathological features.

Biomarkers of dystonia are notoriously lacking. Here, a biomarker is reported for histone lysine methyltransferase (KMT2B)-deficient dystonia, a leading subtype among the individually rare monogenic dystonias. It was derived by applying a support vector machine to an episignature of 113 DNA CpG sites which, in blood cells, showed significant epigenome-wide association with KMT2B deficiency and at least 1x log-fold change of methylation. This classifier was accurate both when tested on the general population and on samples with various other deficiencies of the epigenetic machinery, thus allowing for definitive evaluation of variants of uncertain significance and identifying patients who may profit from deep brain stimulation, a highly successful treatment in KMT2B-deficient dystonia. Methylation was increased in KMT2B deficiency at all 113 CpG sites. The coefficients of variation of the normalized methylation levels at these sites also perfectly classified the samples with KMT2B-deficient dystonia. Moreover, the mean of the normalized methylation levels correlated well with the age at onset of dystonia (p = 0.003) - being lower in samples with late or incomplete penetrance-thus serving as a predictor of disease onset and severity. Similarly, it may also function in monitoring the recently envisioned treatment of KMT2B deficiency by inhibition of DNA methylation.© The Author(s) (2021).

We analyzed newborns' heel blood from six families to identify the DMRs between ART and natural pregnancy newborns, and the genetic model of methylation was explored, meanwhile we analyzed 32 samples of umbilical cord blood of infants born with ART and those of normal pregnancy to confirm which differences are consistent with cord blood data. The DNA methylation level was lower in ART-assisted offspring at the whole genome-wide level. Differentially methylated sites, DMRs, and cord blood differentially expressed genes were enriched in the important pathways of the immune system and nervous system, the genetic patterns of DNA methylation could be changed in the ART group. A total of three imprinted genes and 28 housekeeping genes which were involved in the nervous and immune systems were significant different between the two groups, six of them were detected both in heel blood and cord blood.

Under investigation here is whether epigenetic modulations, similar to those that occur in terrestrial stress responses, have a functional role in spaceflight physiological adaptation. The Advanced Plant Experiment-04 - Epigenetic Expression experiment examined the role of cytosine methylation in spaceflight adaptation. The experiment was conducted onboard the International Space Station, and evaluated the spaceflight-altered, genome-wide methylation profiles of two methylation-regulating gene mutants [methyltransferase 1 (met1-7)and elongator complex subunit 2 (elp2-5)] along with a wild-type Col-0 control.Results:Theelp2-5plants suffered in their physiological adaptation to spaceflight in that their roots failed to extend away from the seed and the overall development of the plants was greatly impaired in space. Themet1-7plants suffered less, with their morphology affected by spaceflight in a manner similar to that of the Col-0 controls. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in spaceflight were dramatically different in theelp2-5andmet1-7plants compared to Col-0, indicating that the disruptions in these mutants resulted in a reprogramming of their spaceflight responses, especially inelp2-5. Many of the genes comprising the spaceflight transcriptome of each genotype were differentially methylated in spaceflight. In Col-0 the majority of the DEGs were representative of the now familiar spaceflight response, which includes genes associated with cell wall remodeling, pathogen responses and ROS signaling. However, the spaceflight transcriptomes ofmet1-7andelp2-5each presented patterns of DEGs that are almost completely different than Col-0, and to each other. Further, the DEGs of the mutant genotypes suggest a more severe spaceflight stress response in the mutants, particularly inelp2-5.Conclusion:Arabidopsis physiological adaptation to spaceflight results in differential DNA methylation in an organ-specific manner.

"34588622","Subtypes of schizophrenia identified by multi-omic measures associated with dysregulated immune function.","Mol Psychiatry","Epigenetic modifications are plausible molecular sources of phenotypic heterogeneity across schizophrenia patients. The current study investigated biological heterogeneity in schizophrenia using peripheral epigenetic profiles to delineate illness subtypes independent of their phenomenological manifestations. We applied epigenome-wide profiling with a DNA methylation array from blood samples of 63 schizophrenia patients and 59 healthy controls. Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) and k-means clustering were performed to identify DNA methylation-related patient subtypes. The validity of the partition was tested by assessing the profile of the T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires. The uniqueness of the identified subtypes in relation to brain structural and clinical measures were evaluated. Two distinct patterns of DNA methylation profiles were identified in patients. One subtype (60.3% of patients) showed relatively limited changes in methylation levels and cell composition compared to controls, while a second subtype (39.7% of patients) exhibited widespread methylation level alterations among genes enriched in immune cell activity, as well as a higher proportion of neutrophils and lower proportion of lymphocytes. Differentiation of the two patient subtypes was validated by TCR repertoires, which paralleled the partition based on DNA methylation profiles. The subtype with widespread methylation modifications had higher symptom severity, performed worse on cognitive measures, and displayed greater reductions in fractional anisotropy of white matter tracts and evidence of gray matter thickening compared to the other subtype. Identification of a distinct subtype of schizophrenia with unique molecular, cerebral, and clinical features provide a novel parcellation of the schizophrenia syndrome with potential to guide development of individualized therapeutics.© 2021.

"34588438","SPOP mutation induces DNA methylation via stabilizing GLP/G9a.","Nat Commun","Mutations in SPOP E3 ligase gene are reportedly associated with genome-wide DNA hypermethylation in prostate cancer (PCa) although the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate that SPOP binds and promotes polyubiquitination and degradation of histone methyltransferase and DNMT interactor GLP. SPOP mutation induces stabilization of GLP and its partner protein G9a and aberrant upregulation of global DNA hypermethylation in cultured PCa cells and primary PCa specimens. Genome-wide DNA methylome analysis shows that a subset of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) including FOXO3, GATA5, and NDRG1, are hypermethylated and downregulated in SPOP-mutated PCa cells. DNA methylation inhibitor 5-azacytidine effectively reverses expression of the TSGs examined, inhibits SPOP-mutated PCa cell growth in vitro and in mice, and enhances docetaxel anti-cancer efficacy. Our findings reveal the GLP/G9a-DNMT module as a mediator of DNA hypermethylation in SPOP-mutated PCa. They suggest that SPOP mutation could be a biomarker for effective treatment of PCa with DNA methylation inhibitor alone or in combination with taxane chemotherapeutics.© 2021. The Author(s)."
"34588385","Analysis of genome-wide DNA methylation patterns in obesity.","Endocr J","Obesity is a chronic and complex psychosomatic disease that is becoming increasingly prevalent worldwide. This study aimed to analyze whole methylation profiles to uncover the epigenetic mechanisms associated with obesity. DNA methylation profiles in blood samples from patients with obesity and normal controls were studied using the Illumina 850 K methylation microarray. The diagnostic value of the differentially methylated genes was determined using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. The expression of selected candidate genes was verified using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and pyrosequencing. A total of 9,371 significantly differentially methylated sites (7,974 hypermethylated sites and 1,397 hypomethylated sites) were identified in 4,571 genes. A difference in the distribution of differentially methylated sites (hypermethylated and hypomethylated) in both gene structures and CpG islands was observed. A total of 114 key differentially methylated sites were identified in the CpG islands. ROC results indicated that Inhibin Subunit Beta B (INHBB), Homeobox A9 (HOXA9), Troponin T3 (TNNT3), Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-responsive element binding protein (CREB)-regulated transcription coactivator 1 (CRTC1) and Zinc finger and BTB domain-containing 7 B (ZBTB7B) could discriminate patients with obesity from normal controls. RT-qPCR results of CRTC1 and ZBTB7B were consistent with our methylation profile results. The pyrosequencing results showed that the methylation levels of CRTC1 CpG sites (CpG1 and CpG2-cg11660071) and INHBB CpG sites (CpG2) were significantly changed in patients with obesity compared with normal controls, which was consistent with our DNA methylation profile results. Our study provides new insights into the pathological mechanism of obesity."

However, clinical data show that these patients have worse outcome compared to patients with hormone receptor expression above 10%. We performed DNA methylation profiling on 23 LowHR breast cancer specimens, including 13 samples with HER2 amplification and compared our results with a reference breast cancer cohort from The Cancer Genome Atlas to clarify the status for this infrequent but important patient subgroup.In unsupervised clustering and dimensionality reduction, breast cancers with low hormone receptor expression that lacked HER2 amplification usually clustered with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) reference samples (8/10; ""LowHR TNBC-like""). In contrast, most specimens with low hormone receptor expression and HER2 amplification grouped with hormone receptor positive cancers (11/13; ""LowHR HRpos-like""). We observed highly similar DNA methylation patterns of LowHR TNBC-like samples and true TNBCs. Furthermore, the Ki67 proliferation index of LowHR TNBC-like samples and clinical outcome parameters were more similar to TNBCs and differed from LowHR HRpos-like cases.We here demonstrate that LowHR breast cancer comprises two epigenetically distinct groups. Our data strongly suggest that LowHR TNBC-like samples are molecularly, histologically and clinically closely related to TNBC, while LowHR HRpos-like specimens are closely related to hormone receptor positive tumors.© 2021.

DNA methylation (DNAm) presents a mechanism to investigate inflammation, aging, and hematopoiesis in PD, using epigenetic mitotic aging and aging clocks. Here, we aimed to define the influence of blood cell lineage on epigenetic mitotic age and then investigate mitotic age acceleration with PD, while considering epigenetic age acceleration biomarkers.We estimated epigenetic mitotic age using the ""epiTOC"" epigenetic mitotic clock in 10 different blood cell populations and in a population-based study of PD with whole-blood. Within subject analysis of the flow-sorted purified blood cell types DNAm showed a clear separation of epigenetic mitotic age by cell lineage, with the mitotic age significantly lower in myeloid versus lymphoid cells (p = 2.1e-11). PD status was strongly associated with accelerated epigenetic mitotic aging (AccelEpiTOC) after controlling for cell composition (OR = 2.11, 95 % CI = 1.56, 2.86, p = 1.6e-6). AccelEpiTOC was also positively correlated with extrinsic epigenetic age acceleration, a DNAm aging biomarker related to immune system aging (with cell composition adjustment: R = 0.27, p = 6.5e-14), and both were independently associated with PD. Among PD patients, AccelEpiTOC measured at baseline was also associated with longitudinal motor and cognitive symptom decline.The current study presents a first look at epigenetic mitotic aging in PD and our findings suggest accelerated hematopoietic cell mitosis, possibly reflecting immune pathway imbalances, in early PD that may also be related to motor and cognitive progression.© 2021.

"34576113","How Are Epigenetic Modifications Related to Cardiovascular Disease in Older Adults?","Int J Mol Sci","The rate of aging has increased globally during recent decades and has led to a rising burden of age-related diseases such as cardiovascular disease (CVD). At the molecular level, epigenetic modifications have been shown recently to alter gene expression during the life course and impair cellular function. In this regard, several CVD risk factors, such as lifestyle and environmental factors, have emerged as key factors in epigenetic modifications within the cardiovascular system. In this study, we attempted to summarized recent evidence related to epigenetic modification, inflammation response, and CVD in older adults as well as the effect of lifestyle modification as a preventive strategy in this age group. Recent evidence showed that lifestyle and environmental factors may affect epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation, histone acetylation, and miRNA expression. Several substances or nutrients such as selenium, magnesium, curcumin, and caffeine (present in coffee and some teas) could regulate epigenetics. Similarly, physical inactivity, alcohol consumption, air pollutants, psychological stress, and shift working are well-known modifiers of epigenetic patterns. Understanding the exact ways that lifestyle and environmental factors could affect the expression of genes could help to influence the time of incidence and severity of aging-associated diseases. This review highlighted that a healthy lifestyle throughout the life course, such as a healthy diet rich in fibers, vitamins, and essential elements, and specific fatty acids, adequate physical activity and sleep, smoking cessation, and stress control, could be useful tools in preventing epigenetic changes that lead to impaired cardiovascular function."

Cas9-based enrichment combined with nanopore sequencing is an important technique for targeting repetitive sequences. Cpf1 has low molecular weight, low off-target efficiency, and the same editing efficiency as Cas9. There are numerous studies on enrichment sequencing using Cas9 combined with nanopore, while there are only a few studies on the enrichment sequencing of long and highly repetitive genes using Cpf1. We developed Cpf1-based enrichment combined with ONT sequencing (CEO) to characterize theB. mori FibHgene, which is composed of many repeat units with a long and GC-rich sequence up to 17 kb and is not easily amplified by means of a polymerase chain reaction (PCR). CEO has four steps: the dephosphorylation of genomic DNA, the Cpf1 targeted cleavage ofFibH, adapter ligation, and ONT sequencing. Using CEO, we determined the fine structure ofB. moriFibH, which is 16,845 bp long and includes 12 repetitive domains separated by amorphous regions. Except for the difference of three bases in the intron from the reference gene, the other sequences are identical. Surprisingly, many methylated CG sites were found and distributed unevenly on theFibHrepeat unit. The CEO we established is an available means to depict highly repetitive genes, but also a supplement to the enrichment method based on Cas9."

Particular situations increase susceptibility to infection in neonates. The enhanced susceptibility to certain infections increases the risk of developing particular diseases that can progress to become morbidly severe. For example, during the current pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, epidemiological studies have established that pregnant women with COVID-19 disease are more likely to be hospitalized. However, the risk for intensive care unit admission and mechanical ventilation is not increased compared with nonpregnant women. Although much remains unknown with this particular infection, the elevated risk of progression during pregnancy towards more severe manifestations of COVID-19 disease is not associated with an increased risk of death. In addition, the epidemiological data available in neonates suggest that their risk of acquiring COVID-19 is low compared with infants (<12 months of age). However, they might be at higher risk for progression to severe COVID-19 disease compared with older children. The data on clinical presentation and disease severity among neonates are limited and based on case reports and small case series. It is well documented the importance of the Zika virus infection as the main cause of several congenital anomalies and birth defects such as microcephaly, and also adverse pregnancy outcomes. Mycoplasma infections also increase adverse pregnancy outcomes. This review will focus on the molecular, pathophysiological and biophysical characteristics of the mother/placental-fetal/neonatal interactions and the possible mechanisms of these pathogens (SARS-CoV-2, ZIKV, and Mycoplasmas) for promoting disease at this level.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

"34589758","DNA methylation and exposure to violence among African American young adult males.","Brain Behav Immun Health","Exposure to violence (ETV) has been linked to epigenomics mechanisms such as DNA methylation (DNAm). We used epigenetic profiling of blood collected from 32 African American young adult males who lived in Washington DC to determine if changes in DNAm at CpG sites affiliated with nervous and immune system were associated with exposure to violence. Pathway analysis of differentially methylated regions comparing high and low ETV groups revealed an enrichment of gene sets annotated to nervous system and immune ontologies. Many of these genes are known to interact with each other which suggests DNAm alters gene function in the nervous and immune system in response to ETV. Using data from a unique age group, young African American adult males, we provide evidence that lifetime ETV could impact DNA methylation in genes impacted at Central Nervous System and Immune Function sites.Methylation analysis was performed on DNA collected from the blood of participants classified with either high or low lifetime ETV. Illumina®MethylationEPIC Beadchips (~850k CpG sites) were processed on the iScan System to examine whole-genome methylation differences. Differentially methylated CpG-sites between high (n ​= ​19) and low (n ​= ​13) groups were identified using linear regression with violence and substance abuse as model covariates. Gene ontology analysis was used to identify enrichment categories from probes annotated to the nearest gene.A total of 595 probes (279 hypermethylated; 316 hypomethylated) annotated to 383 genes were considered differentially methylated in association with ETV. Males with high ETV showed elevated methylation in several signaling pathways but were most impacted at Central Nervous System and Immune Function affiliated sites. Eight candidate genes were identified that play important biological roles in stress response to violence with HDAC4 (10%), NR4A3 (11%), NR4A2 (12%), DSCAML1(12%), and ELAVL3 (13%) exhibiting higher levels in the low ETV group and DLGAP1 (10%), SHANK2 (10%), and NRG1(11%) having increased methylation in the high ETV group. These findings suggest that individuals subjected to high ETV may be at risk for poor health outcomes that have not been reported previously.© 2021 The Authors."

Dietary assessment has focused on selected nutrients. However, this approach does not consider the complex interactions between foods and nutrients. To provide a more comprehensive approach to public health, dietary indices have been developed to assess dietary quality, dietary inflammation and risk factors for non-communicable diseases. Thus far, their use in the context of placental development is limited and associations with offspring outcomes have been inconsistent. Although epidemiological studies have focused on the role of maternal diet on foetal programming, the underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood. Some evidence suggests these associations may be driven by placental and epigenetic changes. In this narrative review, we examine the current literature regarding relationships between key validated diet quality scores (Dietary Inflammatory Index [DII], Mediterranean diet [MD], Healthy Eating Index [HEI], Alternative Healthy Eating Index [AHEI], Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension [DASH], Glycaemic Index [GI] and Glycaemic Load [GL]) in pregnancy and birth and long-term offspring outcomes. We summarise findings, discuss potential underlying placental and epigenetic mechanisms, in particular DNA methylation, and highlight the need for further research and public health strategies that incorporate diet quality and epigenetics."

We generated novel DNA methylation data from vervet cerebral cortex, blood, and liver using highly conserved mammalian CpGs represented on a custom array (HorvathMammalMethylChip40). We present six DNA methylation-based estimators of age: vervet multi-tissue epigenetic clock and tissue-specific clocks for brain cortex, blood, and liver. In addition, we developed two dual species clocks (human-vervet clocks) for measuring chronological age and relative age, respectively. Relative age was defined as ratio of chronological age to maximum lifespan to address the species differences in maximum lifespan. The high accuracy of the human-vervet clocks demonstrates that epigenetic aging processes are evolutionary conserved in primates. When applying these vervet clocks to tissue samples from another primate species, rhesus macaque, we observed high age correlations but strong offsets. We characterized CpGs that correlate significantly with age in the vervet. CpG probes that gain methylation with age across tissues were located near the targets of Polycomb proteins SUZ12 and EED and genes possessing the trimethylated H3K27 mark in their promoters. The epigenetic clocks are expected to be useful for anti-aging studies in vervets.© 2021. The Author(s)."
"34534207","Hierarchy and control of ageing-related methylation networks.","PLoS Comput Biol","DNA methylation provides one of the most widely studied biomarkers of ageing. Since the methylation of CpG dinucleotides function as switches in cellular mechanisms, it is plausible to assume that by proper adjustment of these switches age may be tuned. Though, adjusting hundreds of CpG methylation levels coherently may never be feasible and changing just a few positions may lead to biologically unstable state. A prominent example of methylation-based age estimators is provided by Horvath's clock, based on 353 CpG dinucleotides, showing a high correlation (not necessarily causation) with chronological age across multiple tissue types. On this small subset of CpG dinucleotides we demonstrate how the adjustment of one methylation level leads to a cascade of changes at other sites. Among the studied subset, we locate the most important CpGs (and related genes) that may have a large influence on the rest of the sub-system. According to our analysis, the structure of this network is way more hierarchical compared to what one would expect based on ensembles of uncorrelated connections. Therefore, only a handful of CpGs is enough to modify the system towards a desired state. When propagation of the change over the network is taken into account, the resulting modification in the predicted age can be significantly larger compared to the effect of isolated CpG perturbations. By adjusting the most influential single CpG site and following the propagation of methylation level changes we can reach up to 5.74 years in virtual age reduction, significantly larger than without taking into account of the network control. Extending our approach to the whole methylation network may identify key nodes that have controller role in the ageing process."

However, expression profiles of genes involved in DNA methylation and demethylation during plant development and their responses to phytohormone treatments remain largely unknown. We characterized the spatiotemporal expression patterns of genes involved in de novo methylation, methyl maintenance, and active demethylation in roots, shoots, and reproductive organs using β-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter lines. Promoters of DNA demethylases were generally more highly active at the mature root tissues, whereas the promoters of genes involved in DNA methylation were more highly active at fast-growing root tissues. The promoter activity also implies that methylation status in shoot apex, leaf primordia, floral organs, and developing embryos is under tight equilibrium through the activity of genes involved in DNA methylation and demethylation. The promoter activity of DNA methylation and demethylation-related genes in response to various phytohormone treatments revealed that phytohormones can alter DNA methylation status in specific and redundant ways. Overall, our results illustrate that DNA methylation and demethylation pathways act synergistically and antagonistically in various tissues and in response to phytohormone treatments and point to the existence of hormone-linked methylome regulation mechanisms that may contribute to tissue differentiation and development."
"34602872","A Discovery that Reframes the Whole of Global Healthcare in the 21st Century: The Importance of the Imprintome.","Integr Med (Encinitas)","Within the genome exists a specific subset of genes whose expression is controlled by epigenetic marks. These tags can be modified by lifestyle factors including diet, behavior, environment and social interactions. Differences in genetic expression, despite identical genes, is explained in part through metastable epialleles-alleles that, while genetically indistinguishable, are variably expressed as a function of epigenetic modification. As a group, these metastable epialleles have been given a unique descriptive name: the imprintome. This breakthrough in understanding genetic expression has led to a wider recognition that our genes are fundamentally controlled at two levels. One is the hardware of the genetic code, which is modified slowly by natural selection through mutational changes in the genome over centuries of time. The other is the software that controls the expression of our genetic code, converting nucleotide sequences into phenotype in response to the imprinting of our epigenome. Acting as a rapid translator for real time changes, the imprintome responds to environmental and lifestyle inputs by genomic methylation and histone modifications that affect promoter accessibility and transcription factor activity. In application, this understanding of the plasticity of the imprintome necessitates a rethinking of both health and disease states. It's a concept that cuts across all forms of healthcare: physical, metabolic, and cognitive-behavioral interventions. But at the same time, it is an aggregating concept-one that brings disciplines together to collaborate on the personalization of health and the delivery of truly individualized care.

"34571798","MIDESP: Mutual Information-Based Detection of Epistatic SNP Pairs for Qualitative and Quantitative Phenotypes.","Biology (Basel)","The interactions between SNPs result in a complex interplay with the phenotype, known as epistasis. The knowledge of epistasis is a crucial part of understanding genetic causes of complex traits. However, due to the enormous number of SNP pairs and their complex relationship to the phenotype, identification still remains a challenging problem. Many approaches for the detection of epistasis have been developed using mutual information (MI) as an association measure. However, these methods have mainly been restricted to case-control phenotypes and are therefore of limited applicability for quantitative traits. To overcome this limitation of MI-based methods, here, we present an MI-based novel algorithm, MIDESP, to detect epistasis between SNPs for qualitative as well as quantitative phenotypes. Moreover, by incorporating a dataset-dependent correction technique, we deal with the effect of background associations in a genotypic dataset to separate correct epistatic interaction signals from those of false positive interactions resulting from the effect of single SNP×phenotype associations. To demonstrate the effectiveness of MIDESP, we apply it on two real datasets with qualitative and quantitative phenotypes, respectively. Our results suggest that by eliminating the background associations, MIDESP can identify important genes, which play essential roles for bovine tuberculosis or the egg weight of chickens."

Expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) studies have been performed in several different model species, yet most of these linkage studies have been based on the genetic segregation of two parental alleles. Recently, we developed a multiparental segregating population of 200 recombinant inbred lines (mpRILs) derived from four wild isolates (JU1511, JU1926, JU1931, and JU1941) in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We used RNA-seq to investigate how multiple alleles affect gene expression in these mpRILs. We found 1789 genes differentially expressed between the parental lines. Transgression, expression beyond any of the parental lines in the mpRILs, was found for 7896 genes. For expression QTL mapping almost 9000 SNPs were available. By combining these SNPs and the RNA-seq profiles of the mpRILs, we detected almost 6800 eQTLs. Most trans-eQTLs (63%) co-locate in six newly identified trans-bands. The trans-eQTLs found in previous two-parental allele eQTL experiments and this study showed some overlap (17.5-46.8%), highlighting on the one hand that a large group of genes is affected by polymorphic regulators across populations and conditions, on the other hand, it shows that the mpRIL population allows identification of novel gene expression regulatory loci. Taken together, the analysis of our mpRIL population provides a more refined insight into C. elegans complex trait genetics and eQTLs in general, as well as a starting point to further test and develop advanced statistical models for detection of multiallelic eQTLs and systems genetics studying the genotype-phenotype relationship.© The Author(s) 2021.

Using this method, we probe a small number of inducible promoters and find the effect of DNA demethylation to be small, while demethylation of CpG-rich FMR1 produces larger changes in gene expression.

To this end, we adopted repeated batch bioreactor cultivations ofY. lipolyticasubjected to thermal stress in specific time intervals. To analyze the variation in DNA methylation between stressed and control cultures, we (a) quantified the global DNA methylation status using an immuno-assay, and (b) studied DNA methylation patterns through whole-genome sequencing. Primarily, we demonstrated that 5 mC modification can be detected using a commercial immuno-assay, and that the modifications are present inY. lipolytica's genome at ~0.5% 5 mC frequency.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to search the vulnerability components from 67 mothers of autistic children. We found that PC1 had a higher correlation with psychosocial stress (maternal stress, maternal education, and social class), and PC2 had a higher correlation with biological factors (psychiatric family history and gestational complications). Comparing the methylome between above and below PC1 average subgroups we found 11,879 statistically significant differentially methylated probes (DMPs,p< 0.05). DMPs CpG sites were enriched in variably methylated regions (VMRs), most showing environmental and genetic influences. Hypermethylated probes presented higher rates in different regulatory regions associated with functional SNPs, indicating that the subgroups may have different affected regulatory regions and their liability to disease explained by common variations.

Here, we investigated the impact of maternal HFD on abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) development. Female wild-type mice were fed an HFD or normal diet (ND). AAA was induced in eight-week-old pups using calcium chloride. Male offspring of HFD-fed dams (O-HFD) showed a significant enlargement in AAA compared with the offspring of ND-fed dams (O-ND). Positive-staining cells for tartrate-resistant acid phosphate (TRAP) and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity were significantly increased in O-HFD. The pharmacological inhibition of osteoclastogenesis abolished the exaggerated AAA development in O-HFD. The in vitro tumor necrosis factor-α-induced osteoclast-like differentiation of bone marrow-derived macrophages showed a higher number of TRAP-positive cells and osteoclast-specific gene expressions in O-HFD. Consistent with an increased expression of nuclear factor of activated T cells 1 (NFATc1) in O-HFD, the nuclear protein expression of interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8), a transcriptional repressor, were much lower, with significantly increased H3K27me3 marks at the promoter region.

"34576335","Novel Insights into Epigenetic Regulation of IL6 Pathway: In Silico Perspective on Inflammation and Cancer Relationship.","Int J Mol Sci","IL-6 pathway is abnormally hyperactivated in several cancers triggering tumor cell growth and immune system inhibition. Along with genomic mutation, the IL6 pathway gene expression can be affected by DNA methylation, microRNAs, and post-translational modifications. Computational analysis was performed on the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets to explore the role of IL6, IL6R, IL6ST, and IL6R transmembrane isoform expression and their epigenetic regulation in different cancer types. IL6 was significantly modulated in 70% of tumor types, revealing either up- or down-regulation in an approximately equal number of tumors. Furthermore, IL6R and IL6ST were downregulated in more than 10 tumors. Interestingly, the correlation analysis demonstrated that only the IL6R expression was negatively affected by the DNA methylation within the promoter region in most tumors. Meanwhile, only the IL6ST expression was extensively modulated by miRNAs including miR-182-5p, which also directly targeted all three genes. In addition, IL6 upregulated miR-181a-3p, mirR-214-3p, miR-18a-5p, and miR-938, which in turn inhibited the expression of IL6 receptors. Finally, the patients' survival rate was significantly affected by analyzed targets in some tumors. Our results suggest the relevance of epigenetic regulation of IL6 signaling and pave the way for further studies to validate these findings and to assess the prognostic and therapeutic predictive value of these epigenetic markers on the clinical outcome and survival of cancer patients."

Emerging evidence indicates the adaptive advantage of microRNAs residing within introns is attributed to their complex co-regulation with transcription and alternative splicing of their host genes. Intronic microRNAs are often co-expressed with their host genes, thereby providing functional synergism or antagonism that is exploited or decoupled in cancer. Additionally, intronic microRNA biogenesis and the alternative splicing of host transcript are co-regulated and intertwined. The importance of intronic microRNAs is under-recognized in relation to the pathogenesis of cancer."
"34615881","Improved detection of tumor suppressor events in single-cell RNA-Seq data.","NPJ Genom Med","Tissue-specific transcription factors are frequently inactivated in cancer. To fully dissect the heterogeneity of such tumor suppressor events requires single-cell resolution, yet this is challenging because of the high dropout rate. Here we propose a simple yet effective computational strategy called SCIRA to infer regulatory activity of tissue-specific transcription factors at single-cell resolution and use this tool to identify tumor suppressor events in single-cell RNA-Seq cancer studies. We demonstrate that tissue-specific transcription factors are preferentially inactivated in the corresponding cancer cells, suggesting that these are driver events. For many known or suspected tumor suppressors, SCIRA predicts inactivation in single cancer cells where differential expression does not, indicating that SCIRA improves the sensitivity to detect changes in regulatory activity. We identify NKX2-1 and TBX4 inactivation as early tumor suppressor events in normal non-ciliated lung epithelial cells from smokers. In summary, SCIRA can help chart the heterogeneity of tumor suppressor events at single-cell resolution.© 2020. The Author(s)."
"34616060","Single-cell epigenomics reveals mechanisms of human cortical development.","Nature","During mammalian development, differences in chromatin state coincide with cellular differentiation and reflect changes in the gene regulatory landscape1. In the developing brain, cell fate specification and topographic identity are important for defining cell identity2and confer selective vulnerabilities to neurodevelopmental disorders3. Here, to identify cell-type-specific chromatin accessibility patterns in the developing human brain, we used a single-cell assay for transposase accessibility by sequencing (scATAC-seq) in primary tissue samples from the human forebrain. We applied unbiased analyses to identify genomic loci that undergo extensive cell-type- and brain-region-specific changes in accessibility during neurogenesis, and an integrative analysis to predict cell-type-specific candidate regulatory elements. We found that cerebral organoids recapitulate most putative cell-type-specific enhancer accessibility patterns but lack many cell-type-specific open chromatin regions that are found in vivo. Systematic comparison of chromatin accessibility across brain regions revealed unexpected diversity among neural progenitor cells in the cerebral cortex and implicated retinoic acid signalling in the specification of neuronal lineage identity in the prefrontal cortex. Together, our results reveal the important contribution of chromatin state to the emerging patterns of cell type diversity and cell fate specification and provide a blueprint for evaluating the fidelity and robustness of cerebral organoids as a model for cortical development.© 2021.

Here, we provide the most comprehensive catalogue to date of regulatory elements in the pig (Sus scrofa) by integrating 223 epigenomic and transcriptomic data sets, representing 14 biologically important tissues. We systematically describe the dynamic epigenetic landscape across tissues by functionally annotating 15 different chromatin states and defining their tissue-specific regulatory activities. We demonstrate that genomic variants associated with complex traits and adaptive evolution in pig are significantly enriched in active promoters and enhancers. Furthermore, we reveal distinct tissue-specific regulatory selection between Asian and European pig domestication processes. Compared with human and mouse epigenomes, we show that porcine regulatory elements are more conserved in DNA sequence, under both rapid and slow evolution, than those under neutral evolution across pig, mouse, and human. Finally, we provide biological insights on tissue-specific regulatory conservation, and by integrating 47 human genome-wide association studies, we demonstrate that, depending on the traits, mouse or pig might be more appropriate biomedical models for different complex traits and diseases.© 2021.

"34605948","Beyond GWAS: from simple associations to functional insights.","Semin Immunopathol","Each human, when born, has slightly different DNA sequences, which make each of us unique. The variations in DNA sequences are called genetic variants. The primary aim of genome-wide association study (GWAS) is to detect associations between genetic variants and human phenotypes. Since GWAS focuses on germ-line variants, there is no reverse causation. Therefore, GWAS is one of the few tools that can assess the causality of human diseases. In the past 10 years, many large-scale GWAS have been conducted. Although the primary outputs of GWAS are just a series of statistics, its downstream analyses provided many insights beyond simple associations: the causal mechanisms for autoimmune diseases and shared etiology between diseases. Moreover, GWAS downstream analyses generated scores potentially helpful in predicting clinical outcomes of each patient. This review focuses on GWAS for autoimmune diseases and introduces significant achievements of its downstream analyses. We also provide future directions that potentially overcome current limitations. We restrict our discussion to common autoimmune diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis) since rare Mendelian diseases possess distinct genetic etiologies and are not tested by GWAS.© 2021.

Here, we propose GenNet, a novel open-source deep learning framework for predicting phenotypes from genetic variants. In this framework, interpretable and memory-efficient neural network architectures are constructed by embedding biologically knowledge from public databases, resulting in neural networks that contain only biologically plausible connections. We applied the framework to seventeen phenotypes and found well-replicated genes such as HERC2 and OCA2 for hair and eye color, and novel genes such as ZNF773 and PCNT for schizophrenia. Additionally, the framework identified ubiquitin mediated proteolysis, endocrine system and viral infectious diseases as most predictive biological pathways for schizophrenia.

"34586374","The Genetic Architecture of Depression in Individuals of East Asian Ancestry: A Genome-Wide Association Study.","JAMA Psychiatry","Most previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of depression have used data from individuals of European descent. This limits the understanding of the underlying biology of depression and raises questions about the transferability of findings between populations.To investigate the genetics of depression among individuals of East Asian and European descent living in different geographic locations, and with different outcome definitions for depression.Genome-wide association analyses followed by meta-analysis, which included data from 9 cohort and case-control data sets comprising individuals with depression and control individuals of East Asian descent. This study was conducted between January 2019 and May 2021.Associations of genetic variants with depression risk were assessed using generalized linear mixed models and logistic regression. The results were combined across studies using fixed-effects meta-analyses. These were subsequently also meta-analyzed with the largest published GWAS for depression among individuals of European descent. Additional meta-analyses were carried out separately by outcome definition (clinical depression vs symptom-based depression) and region (East Asian countries vs Western countries) for East Asian ancestry cohorts.Depression status was defined based on health records and self-report questionnaires.There were a total of 194 548 study participants (approximate mean age, 51.3 years; 62.8% women). Participants included 15 771 individuals with depression and 178 777 control individuals of East Asian descent. Five novel associations were identified, including 1 in the meta-analysis for broad depression among those of East Asian descent: rs4656484 (β = -0.018, SE = 0.003, P = 4.43x10-8) at 1q24.1. Another locus at 7p21.2 was associated in a meta-analysis restricted to geographically East Asian studies (β = 0.028, SE = 0.005, P = 6.48x10-9 for rs10240457). The lead variants of these 2 novel loci were not associated with depression risk in European ancestry cohorts (β = -0.003, SE = 0.005, P = .53 for rs4656484 and β = -0.005, SE = 0.004, P = .28 for rs10240457). Only 11% of depression loci previously identified in individuals of European descent reached nominal significance levels in the individuals of East Asian descent. The transancestry genetic correlation between cohorts of East Asian and European descent for clinical depression was r = 0.413 (SE = 0.159). Clinical depression risk was negatively genetically correlated with body mass index in individuals of East Asian descent (r = -0.212, SE = 0.084), contrary to findings for individuals of European descent.These results support caution against generalizing findings about depression risk factors across populations and highlight the need to increase the ancestral and geographic diversity of samples with consistent phenotyping."

Stress, including social isolation, during this time has profound effects on behaviors associated with reward and other neuropsychiatric disorders. Because the Nucleus Accumbens (NAc), is crucial to the integration of rewarding stimuli, the NAc is especially sensitive to disruptions by adolescent social isolation stress. This review highlights the long-term behavioral consequences of adolescent social isolation rearing on the NAc. It will discuss the cellular and molecular changes within the NAc that might underlie the long-term effects on behavior. When available sex-specific effects are discussed. Finally by mining publicly available data we identify, for the first time, key transcriptional profiles induced by adolescence social isolation in genes associated with dopamine receptor 1 and 2 medium spiny neurons and genes associated with cocaine self-administration.

Accumulating evidence highlights the potential antidepressant-like effects of inosine on adult MDD, and gut microbiomes are significantly associated with MDDviathe microbiota-gut-brain axis. However, few studies have investigated possible associations between inosine and gut microbiota in adolescents with MDD. The current study investigated the potential antidepressant effects of inosine in adolescent male C57BL/6 mice. After 4 weeks of chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) stimulation, the mice were assessed by body weight, the sucrose preference test (SPT), open field test, and the elevated plus maze (EPM). The microbiota compositions of feces were determined by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Inosine significantly improved CUMS-induced depressive and anxiety-like behaviors in adolescent mice including SPT and EPM results. Fecal microbial composition differed in the CON+saline, CUMS+saline, and CUMS+inosine groups, which were characterized by 126 discriminative amplicon sequence variants belonging toBacteroidetesandFirmicuteat the phylum level andMuribaculaceaeandLachnospiraceaeat the family level.Muribaculaceaewas positively associated with depressive and anxiety-like behaviors. KEGG functional analysis suggested that inosine might affect gut microbiota through carbohydrate metabolism and lipid metabolism pathways.

"34589809","Uncovering microglial pathways driving sex-specific neurobiological effects in stress and depression.","Brain Behav Immun Health","Women suffer from major depressive disorder (MDD) more often than men and report greater MDD symptom severity. Mounting evidence suggests that sex differences in MDD may be driven, in part, by sex-specific neurobiological mechanisms. Chronic stress is a significant risk factor in MDD, and preclinical rodent models show differential patterns of stress-induced neural remodeling and cognitive-behavioral dysfunction in males and females. For instance, chronic stress leads to synapse loss in the medial prefrontal cortex in male rodents yet has either no effect on- or increases-synapse number in females. Recent reports have implicated microglia, the immune cells of the brain, in MDD, and findings demonstrate sex-specific microglial signatures in both preclinical stress models and MDD patients. Given that microglia can remodel neural architecture, modulate synaptic transmission, and affect subsequent changes in behavior, it is plausible that microglial pathways contribute to differential stress effects on neuroplasticity and function in males and females. As such, this review examines the evidence for sex-specific microglia-neuron interactions in preclinical stress models and in patients with MDD. Discoveries highlighted herein demonstrate divergent microglial contributions in males and females and suggest that future studies investigating stress-linked disorders should be guided by sex-dependent neurobiological and behavioral findings. Examining these pathways represents a clear avenue toward both a richer understanding of brain, behavior, and immunity, and innovative psychoneuroimmunology-based applications in personalized medicine.© 2021 The Author."
"34581271","Individual history of winning and hierarchy landscape influence stress susceptibility in mice.","Elife","Social hierarchy formation is strongly evolutionarily conserved. Across species, rank within social hierarchy has large effects on health and behavior. To investigate the relationship between social rank and stress susceptibility, we exposed ranked male and female mice to social and non-social stressors and manipulated social hierarchy position. We found that rank predicts same sex social stress outcomes: dominance in males and females confers resilience while subordination confers susceptibility. Pre-existing rank does not predict non-social stress outcomes in females and weakly does so in males, but rank emerging under stress conditions reveals social interaction deficits in male and female subordinates. Both history of winning and rank of cage mates affect stress susceptibility in males: rising to the top rank through high mobility confers resilience and mice that lose dominance lose stress resilience, although gaining dominance over a subordinate animal does not confer resilience. Overall, we have demonstrated a relationship between social status and stress susceptibility, particularly when taking into account individual history of winning and the overall hierarchy landscape in male and female mice.© 2021, LeClair et al."

In this research, we focused on identifying genomic regions affected by different selection pressures, mainly highlighting the recent positive selection, as well as understanding the candidate genes and functional pathways associated with the signatures of selection in the Mangalarga Marchador genome. Besides, we seek to direct the discussion about genes and traits of importance in this breed, especially traits related to the type and quality of gait, temperament, conformation, and locomotor system.Three different methods were used to search for signals of selection: Tajima's D (TD), the integrated haplotype score (iHS), and runs of homozygosity (ROH). The samples were composed of males (n = 62) and females (n = 130) that were initially chosen considering well-defined phenotypes for gait: picada (n = 86) and batida (n = 106). All horses were genotyped using a 670 k Axiom® Equine Genotyping Array​ (Axiom MNEC670). In total, 27, 104 (chosen), and 38 candidate genes were observed within the signatures of selection identified in TD, iHS, and ROH analyses, respectively. The genes are acting in essential biological processes. The enrichment analysis highlighted the following functions: anterior/posterior pattern for the set of genes (GLI3, HOXC9, HOXC6, HOXC5, HOXC4, HOXC13, HOXC11, and HOXC10); limb morphogenesis, skeletal system, proximal/distal pattern formation, JUN kinase activity (CCL19 and MAP3K6); and muscle stretch response (MAPK14). Other candidate genes were associated with energy metabolism, bronchodilator response, NADH regeneration, reproduction, keratinization, and the immunological system.Our findings revealed evidence of signatures of selection in the MM breed that encompass genes acting on athletic performance, limb development, and energy to muscle activity, with the particular involvement of the HOX family genes. The genome of MM is marked by recent positive selection. However, Tajima's D and iHS results point also to the presence of balancing selection in specific regions of the genome.© 2021.

"34622151","Wisdom of the crowds: A suggested polygenic plan for small-RNA-mediated regulation in bacteria.","iScience","The omnigenic/polygenic theory, which states that complex traits are not shaped by single/few genes, but by situation-specific large networks, offers an explanation for a major enigma in microbiology: deletion of specific small RNAs (sRNAs) playing key roles in various aspects of bacterial physiology, including virulence and antibiotic resistance, results in surprisingly subtle phenotypes. A recent study uncovered polar accumulation of most sRNAs upon osmotic stress, the majority not known to be involved in the applied stress. Here we show that cells deleted for a handful of pole-enriched sRNAs exhibit fitness defect in several stress conditions, as opposed to single, double, or triple sRNA-knockouts, implying that regulation by sRNA relies on sets of genes. Moreover, analysis of RNA-seq data ofEscherichia coliandSalmonella typhimuriumexposed to antibiotics and/or infection-relevant conditions reveals the involvement of multiple sRNAs in all cases, in line with the existence of a polygenic plan for sRNA-mediated regulation.© 2021 The Authors."
"34620077","Wavelet Screening: a novel approach to analyzing GWAS data.","BMC Bioinformatics","Traditional methods for single-variant genome-wide association study (GWAS) incur a substantial multiple-testing burden because of the need to test for associations with a vast number of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) simultaneously. Further, by ignoring more complex joint effects of nearby SNPs within a given region, these methods fail to consider the genomic context of an association with the outcome.To address these shortcomings, we present a more powerful method for GWAS, coined 'Wavelet Screening' (WS), that greatly reduces the number of tests to be performed. This is achieved through the use of a sliding-window approach based on wavelets to sequentially screen the entire genome for associations. Wavelets are oscillatory functions that are useful for analyzing the local frequency and time behavior of signals. The signals can then be divided into different scale components and analyzed separately. In the current setting, we consider a sequence of SNPs as a genetic signal, and for each screened region, we transform the genetic signal into the wavelet space. The null and alternative hypotheses are modeled using the posterior distribution of the wavelet coefficients. WS is enhanced by using additional information from the regression coefficients and by taking advantage of the pyramidal structure of wavelets. When faced with more complex genetic signals than single-SNP associations, we show via simulations that WS provides a substantial gain in power compared to both the traditional GWAS modeling and another popular regional association test called SNP-set (Sequence) Kernel Association Test (SKAT). To demonstrate feasibility, we applied WS to a large Norwegian cohort (N=8006) with genotypes and information available on gestational duration.WS is a powerful and versatile approach to analyzing whole-genome data and lends itself easily to investigating various omics data types. Given its broader focus on the genomic context of an association, WS may provide additional insight into trait etiology by revealing genes and loci that might have been missed by previous efforts.© 2021.

"34617196","Using phenotypic plasticity to understand the structure and evolution of the genotype-phenotype map.","Genetica","Deciphering the genotype-phenotype map necessitates relating variation at the genetic level to variation at the phenotypic level. This endeavour is inherently limited by the availability of standing genetic variation, the rate of spontaneous mutation to novo genetic variants, and possible biases associated with induced mutagenesis. An interesting alternative is to instead rely on the environment as a source of variation. Many phenotypic traits change plastically in response to the environment, and these changes are generally underlain by changes in gene expression. Relating gene expression plasticity to the phenotypic plasticity of more integrated organismal traits thus provides useful information about which genes influence the development and expression of which traits, even in the absence of genetic variation. We here appraise the prospects and limits of such an environment-for-gene substitution for investigating the genotype-phenotype map. We review models of gene regulatory networks, and discuss the different ways in which they can incorporate the environment to mechanistically model phenotypic plasticity and its evolution. We suggest that substantial progress can be made in deciphering this genotype-environment-phenotype map, by connecting theory on gene regulatory network to empirical patterns of gene co-expression, and by more explicitly relating gene expression to the expression and development of phenotypes, both theoretically and empirically.© 2021.

"34599243","Crossing design shapes patterns of genetic variation in synthetic recombinant populations of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.","Sci Rep","""Synthetic recombinant"" populations have emerged as a useful tool for dissecting the genetics of complex traits. They can be used to derive inbred lines for fine QTL mapping, or the populations themselves can be sampled for experimental evolution. In the latter application, investigators generally value maximizing genetic variation in constructed populations. This is because in evolution experiments initiated from such populations, adaptation is primarily fueled by standing genetic variation. Despite this reality, little has been done to systematically evaluate how different methods of constructing synthetic populations shape initial patterns of variation. Here we seek to address this issue by comparing outcomes in synthetic recombinant Saccharomyces cerevisiae populations created using one of two strategies: pairwise crossing of isogenic strains or simple mixing of strains in equal proportion. We also explore the impact of the varying the number of parental strains. We find that more genetic variation is initially present and maintained when population construction includes a round of pairwise crossing. As perhaps expected, we also observe that increasing the number of parental strains typically increases genetic diversity. In summary, we suggest that when constructing populations for use in evolution experiments, simply mixing founder strains in equal proportion may limit the adaptive potential.© 2021. The Author(s)."
"34599163","Complex small-world regulatory networks emerge from the 3D organisation of the human genome.","Nat Commun","The discovery that overexpressing one or a few critical transcription factors can switch cell state suggests that gene regulatory networks are relatively simple. In contrast, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) point to complex phenotypes being determined by hundreds of loci that rarely encode transcription factors and which individually have small effects. Here, we use computer simulations and a simple fitting-free polymer model of chromosomes to show that spatial correlations arising from 3D genome organisation naturally lead to stochastic and bursty transcription as well as complex small-world regulatory networks (where the transcriptional activity of each genomic region subtly affects almost all others). These effects require factors to be present at sub-saturating levels; increasing levels dramatically simplifies networks as more transcription units are pressed into use. Consequently, results from GWAS can be reconciled with those involving overexpression. We apply this pan-genomic model to predict patterns of transcriptional activity in whole human chromosomes, and, as an example, the effects of the deletion causing the diGeorge syndrome.© 2021.

Previous genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have neither explained the large proportion of genetic heritability nor provided comprehensive understanding of the underlying regulatory mechanisms. We adopted an integrative genomic network approach by incorporating our previous GWAS data for CRP and IL6 with multi-omics datasets, such as whole-blood expression quantitative loci, molecular biologic pathways, and gene regulatory networks to capture the full range of genetic functionalities associated with CRP/IL6 and tissue-specific key drivers (KDs) in gene subnetworks. We applied another systematic genomics approach for BC development to detect shared gene sets in enriched subnetworks across BC and CRP/IL6. We detected the topmost significant common pathways across CRP/IL6 (e.g., immune regulatory; chemokines and their receptors; interferon γ, JAK-STAT, and ERBB4 signaling), several of which overlapped with BC pathways. Further, in gene-gene interaction networks enriched by those topmost pathways, we identified KDs-both well-established (e.g., JAK1/2/3, STAT3) and novel (e.g., CXCR3, CD3D, CD3G, STAT6)-in a tissue-specific manner, for mechanisms shared in regulating CRP/IL6 and BC risk. Our study may provide robust, comprehensive insights into the mechanisms of CRP/IL6 regulation and highlight potential novel genetic targets as preventive and therapeutic strategies for associated disorders, such as BC."

Deleterious alleles like hemoglobin S are well-known to confer strong resistance to malaria, but the effects of common RBC variation are largely undetermined. Here, we collected fresh blood samples from 121 healthy donors, most with African ancestry, and performed exome sequencing, detailed RBC phenotyping, and parasite fitness assays. Over one-third of healthy donors unknowingly carried alleles for G6PD deficiency or hemoglobinopathies, which were associated with characteristic RBC phenotypes. Among non-carriers alone, variation in RBC hydration, membrane deformability, and volume was strongly associated withP. falciparumgrowth rate. Common genetic variants inPIEZO1,SPTA1/SPTB, and severalP. falciparuminvasion receptors were also associated with parasite growth rate. Interestingly, we observed little or negative evidence for divergent selection on non-pathogenic RBC variation between Africans and Europeans. These findings suggest a model in which globally widespread variation in a moderate number of genes and phenotypes modulatesP. falciparumfitness in RBCs.© 2021, Ebel et al."

The poor understanding of the cellular heterogeneity within the IVD makes it difficult to develop regenerative IVD therapies. To address this gap, we developed an atlas of bovine (Bos taurus) caudal IVDs using single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq). Unsupervised clustering resolved 15 unique clusters, which we grouped into the following annotated partitions: nucleus pulposus (NP), outer annulus fibrosus (oAF), inner AF (iAF), notochord, muscle, endothelial, and immune cells. Analyzing the pooled gene expression profiles of the NP, oAF, and iAF partitions allowed us to identify novel markers for NP (CP, S100B, H2AC18, SNORC, CRELD2, PDIA4, DNAJC3, CHCHD7, and RCN2), oAF (IGFBP6, CTSK, LGALS1, and CCN3), and iAF (MGP, COMP, SPP1, GSN, SOD2, DCN, FN1, TIMP3, WDR73, and GAL) cells. Network analysis on subpopulations of NP and oAF cells determined that clusters NP1, NP2, NP4, and oAF1 displayed gene expression profiles consistent with cell survival, suggesting these clusters may uniquely support viability under the physiological stresses of the IVD. Clusters NP3, NP5, oAF2, and oAF3 expressed various extracellular matrix (ECM)-associated genes, suggesting their role in maintaining IVD structure. Lastly, transcriptional entropy and pseudotime analyses found that clusters NP3 and NP1 had the most stem-like gene expression signatures of the NP partition, implying these clusters may contain IVD progenitor cells. Overall, results highlight cell type diversity within the IVD, and these novel cell phenotypes may enhance our understanding of IVD development, homeostasis, degeneration, and regeneration.© 2021 Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology."
"34572930","The Multifaceted Role of Aldehyde Dehydrogenases in Prostate Cancer Stem Cells.","Cancers (Basel)","Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are the only tumor cells possessing self-renewal and differentiation properties, making them an engine of tumor progression and a source of tumor regrowth after treatment. Conventional therapies eliminate most non-CSCs, while CSCs often remain radiation and drug resistant, leading to tumor relapse and metastases. Thus, targeting CSCs might be a powerful tool to overcome tumor resistance and increase the efficiency of current cancer treatment strategies. The identification and isolation of the CSC population based on its high aldehyde dehydrogenase activity (ALDH) is widely accepted for prostate cancer (PCa) and many other solid tumors. In PCa, several ALDH genes contribute to the ALDH activity, which can be measured in the enzymatic assay by converting 4, 4-difluoro-4-bora-3a, 4a-diaza-s-indacene (BODIPY) aminoacetaldehyde (BAAA) into the fluorescent product BODIPY-aminoacetate (BAA). Although each ALDH isoform plays an individual role in PCa biology, their mutual functional interplay also contributes to PCa progression. Thus, ALDH proteins are markers and functional regulators of CSC properties, representing an attractive target for cancer treatment. In this review, we discuss the current state of research regarding the role of individual ALDH isoforms in PCa development and progression, their possible therapeutic targeting, and provide an outlook for the future advances in this field."
"34620871","Mapping epigenetic divergence in the massive radiation of Lake Malawi cichlid fishes.","Nat Commun","Epigenetic variation modulates gene expression and can be heritable. However, knowledge of the contribution of epigenetic divergence to adaptive diversification in nature remains limited. The massive evolutionary radiation of Lake Malawi cichlid fishes displaying extensive phenotypic diversity despite extremely low sequence divergence is an excellent system to study the epigenomic contribution to adaptation. Here, we present a comparative genome-wide methylome and transcriptome study, focussing on liver and muscle tissues in phenotypically divergent cichlid species. In both tissues we find substantial methylome divergence among species. Differentially methylated regions (DMR), enriched in evolutionary young transposons, are associated with transcription changes of ecologically-relevant genes related to energy expenditure and lipid metabolism, pointing to a link between dietary ecology and methylome divergence. Unexpectedly, half of all species-specific DMRs are shared across tissues and are enriched in developmental genes, likely reflecting distinct epigenetic developmental programmes. Our study reveals substantial methylome divergence in closely-related cichlid fishes and represents a resource to study the role of epigenetics in species diversification.© 2021. Crown."
"34616061","DNA methylation atlas of the mouse brain at single-cell resolution.","Nature","Mammalian brain cells show remarkable diversity in gene expression, anatomy and function, yet the regulatory DNA landscape underlying this extensive heterogeneity is poorly understood. Here we carry out a comprehensive assessment of the epigenomes of mouse brain cell types by applying single-nucleus DNA methylation sequencing1,2to profile 103,982 nuclei (including 95,815 neurons and 8,167 non-neuronal cells) from 45 regions of the mouse cortex, hippocampus, striatum, pallidum and olfactory areas. We identified 161 cell clusters with distinct spatial locations and projection targets. We constructed taxonomies of these epigenetic types, annotated with signature genes, regulatory elements and transcription factors. These features indicate the potential regulatory landscape supporting the assignment of putative cell types and reveal repetitive usage of regulators in excitatory and inhibitory cells for determining subtypes. The DNA methylation landscape of excitatory neurons in the cortex and hippocampus varied continuously along spatial gradients. Using this deep dataset, we constructed an artificial neural network model that precisely predicts single neuron cell-type identity and brain area spatial location. Integration of high-resolution DNA methylomes with single-nucleus chromatin accessibility data3enabled prediction of high-confidence enhancer-gene interactions for all identified cell types, which were subsequently validated by cell-type-specific chromatin conformation capture experiments4. By combining multi-omic datasets (DNA methylation, chromatin contacts, and open chromatin) from single nuclei and annotating the regulatory genome of hundreds of cell types in the mouse brain, our DNA methylation atlas establishes the epigenetic basis for neuronal diversity and spatial organization throughout the mouse cerebrum.© 2021.

"34606615","SBSA: an online service for somatic binding sequence annotation.","Nucleic Acids Res","Efficient annotation of alterations in binding sequences of molecular regulators can help identify novel candidates for mechanisms study and offer original therapeutic hypotheses. In this work, we developed Somatic Binding Sequence Annotator (SBSA) as a full-capacity online tool to annotate altered binding motifs/sequences, addressing diverse types of genomic variants and molecular regulators. The genomic variants can be somatic mutation, single nucleotide polymorphism, RNA editing, etc. The binding motifs/sequences involve transcription factors (TFs), RNA-binding proteins, miRNA seeds, miRNA-mRNA 3'-UTR binding target, or can be any custom motifs/sequences. Compared to similar tools, SBSA is the first to support miRNA seeds and miRNA-mRNA 3'-UTR binding target, and it unprecedentedly implements a personalized genome approach that accommodates joint adjacent variants. SBSA is empowered to support an indefinite species, including preloaded reference genomes for SARS-Cov-2 and 25 other common organisms. We demonstrated SBSA by annotating multi-omics data from over 30,890 human subjects. Of the millions of somatic binding sequences identified, many are with known severe biological repercussions, such as the somatic mutation in TERT promoter region which causes a gained binding sequence for E26 transformation-specific factor (ETS1). We further validated the function of this TERT mutation using experimental data in cancer cells. Availability:http://innovebioinfo.com/Annotation/SBSA/SBSA.php.© The Author(s) 2021.

"34595226","Transcriptome Analysis Revealed Potential Mechanisms of Resistance to <i>Trichomoniasis gallinae</i> Infection in Pigeon (<i>Columba livia</i>).","Front Vet Sci","Trichomoniasis gallinae(T. gallinae) is one of the most pathogenic parasites in pigeon, particularly in squabs. Oral cavity is the main site for the host-parasite interaction. Herein, we used RNA-sequencing technology to characterize lncRNA and mRNA profiles and compared transcriptomic dynamics of squabs, including four susceptible birds (S) from infected group, four tolerant birds (T) without parasites afterT. gallinaeinfection, and three birds from uninfected group (N), to understand molecular mechanisms underlying host resistance to this parasite. We identified 29,809 putative lncRNAs and characterized their genomic features subsequently. Differentially expressed (DE) genes, DE-lncRNAs and cis/trans target genes of DE-lncRNAs were further compared among the three groups. The KEGG analysis indicated that specific intergroup DEGs were involved in carbon metabolism (S vs. T), metabolic pathways (N vs. T) and focal adhesion pathway (N vs. S), respectively. Whereas, the cis/trans genes of DE-lncRNAs were enriched in cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, toll-like receptor signaling pathway, p53 signaling pathway and insulin signaling pathway, which play crucial roles in immune system of the host animal. This suggestsT. gallinaeinvasion in pigeon mouth may modulate lncRNAs expression and their target genes. Moreover, co-expression analysis identified crucial lncRNA-mRNA interaction networks. Several DE-lncRNAs including MSTRG.82272.3, MSTRG.114849.42, MSTRG.39405.36, MSTRG.3338.5, and MSTRG.105872.2 targeted methylation and immune-related genes, such as JCHAIN, IL18BP, ANGPT1, TMRT10C, SAMD9L, and SOCS3. This implied that DE-lncRNAs exert critical influence onT. gallinaeinfections. The quantitative exploration of host transcriptome changes induced byT. gallinaeinfection broaden both transcriptomic and epigenetic insights intoT. gallinaeresistance and its pathological mechanism.Copyright © 2021 Yuan, Ni, Li, Bian, Liu, Wang, Shi, Isa, Ge, Sun, Ma and Chen."
"34594038","Single-cell multimodal glioma analyses identify epigenetic regulators of cellular plasticity and environmental stress response.","Nat Genet","Glioma intratumoral heterogeneity enables adaptation to challenging microenvironments and contributes to therapeutic resistance. We integrated 914 single-cell DNA methylomes, 55,284 single-cell transcriptomes and bulk multi-omic profiles across 11 adult IDH mutant or IDH wild-type gliomas to delineate sources of intratumoral heterogeneity. We showed that local DNA methylation disorder is associated with cell-cell DNA methylation differences, is elevated in more aggressive tumors, links with transcriptional disruption and is altered during the environmental stress response. Glioma cells under in vitro hypoxic and irradiation stress increased local DNA methylation disorder and shifted cell states. We identified a positive association between genetic and epigenetic instability that was supported in bulk longitudinally collected DNA methylation data. Increased DNA methylation disorder associated with accelerated disease progression and recurrently selected DNA methylation changes were enriched for environmental stress response pathways. Our work identified an epigenetically facilitated adaptive stress response process and highlights the importance of epigenetic heterogeneity in shaping therapeutic outcomes.© 2021.

It has been proposed that transcription factors could bind specifically to methylated promoters and trigger transcription. We looked at this rather comprehensively for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and studied some cases in more detail. Some 2% of regulated genes in PDAC exhibited higher transcription coupled to promoter hypermethylation in comparison to healthy tissue. Screening 661 transcription factors, several were found to bind specifically to methylated promoters, in particular molecules of the NFAT family. One of them-NFATc1-was substantially more strongly expressed in PDAC than control tissue and exhibited a strong oncogenic role. Functional studies combined with computational analyses allowed determining affected genes. A prominent one was geneALDH1A3, which accelerates PDAC metastasis and correlates with a bad prognosis. Further studies confirmed the direct up-regulation ofALDH1A3transcription by NFATc1 promoter binding in a methylation-dependent process, providing insights into the oncogenic role of transcription activation in PDAC that is promoted by DNA methylation."
"34565361","Transcriptional alterations of protein coding and noncoding RNAs in triple negative breast cancer in response to DNA methyltransferases inhibition.","Cancer Cell Int","DNA methylation plays a crucial role in multiple cellular processes such as gene regulation, chromatin stability, and genetic imprinting. In mammals, DNA methylation is achieved by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs). A number of studies have associated alterations in DNMT activity to tumorigenesis; however, the exact role of DNMTs in shaping the genome in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is still being unraveled.In the current study, we employed two DNMT inhibitors (Decitabine and 5-Azacytidine), two TNBC models (MDA-MB-231 and BT-549) and whole transcriptome RNA-Seq and characterized the transcriptional alterations associated with DNMT inhibition. Colony forming unit (CFU), flow cytometry, and fluorescent microscopy were used to assess cell proliferation, cell cycle distribution, and cell death, respectively. Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) was used for network and pathway analyses.Remarkably, DNMT inhibition induced the expression of genes involved in endoplasmic reticulum response to stress, response to unfolder protein, as well as cobalamin metabolic processes. In contrast, suppression of cellular processes related to cell cycle and mitosis were hallmarks of DNMT inhibition. Concordantly, DNMT inhibition led to significant inhibition of TNBC cell proliferation, G2-M cell cycle arrest and induction of cell death. Mechanistically, DNMT inhibition activated TP53, NUPR1, and NFkB (complex) networks, while RARA, RABL6, ESR1, FOXM1, and ERBB2 networks were suppressed. Our data also identified the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) transcriptional portrait associated with DNMT inhibition and identified 25 commonly upregulated and 60 commonly downregulated lncRNAs in response to Decitabine and 5-Azacytidinec treatment in both TNBC models. TPT1-AS1 was the most highly induced (6.3 FC), while MALAT1 was the most highly suppressed (- 7.0 FC) lncRNA in response to DNMT inhibition.Taken together, our data provides a comprehensive view of transcriptome alterations in the coding and noncoding transcriptome in TNBC in response to DNMT inhibition.© 2021.

The enrolled patients was divided into high or low NLR group with the cutoff value determined by the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve. Different vascular anastomoses were selected according to the Chaoyang classification of PDAC. Survival rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier and evaluated with the log-rank test. Cox risk regression model was used to analyze the independent risk factors for prognostic survival. The optimal cut-off value of NRL was correlated with the differentiation, tumor size, TNM stage and distant metastasis of advanced PDAC. A curative resection with vascular reconstructive of advanced PDAC according to Chaoyang classification can obviously improve the survival benefits. Cox proportional hazards demonstrated higher evaluated NLR, incisal margin R1 and lymphatic metastasis were the independent risk predictor for prognosis with the HR > 2, meanwhile, age beyond 55, TNM stage of III-IV or Tumor size > 4cm were also the obvious independent risk predictor for prognosis with the HR ≤ 2. The advanced PADC patients marked of RS group (3 < RS ≤ 6) showed no more than 24 months of survival time according to RS model based on the six independent risk predictors. Vascular reconstruction in radical resection of advanced PDAC improved survival, higher elevated NLR (>2.90) was a negative predictor of DFS and OS in those patients accompanying portal system invasion.Copyright © 2021 Zhou, Wang, Zhang, Lyu, Pan, Du, Lang and He."

Currently, there is a limited understanding of the magnitude, determinants and clinical significance of these muscle abnormalities in the lung cancer CRT/RT population. The primary objective of this study is to identify the predictors of muscle abnormalities (low muscle mass and muscle attenuation) and their depletion over time in people with lung cancer receiving CRT/RT. Secondary objectives are to assess the magnitude of change in these parameters and their association with health-related quality of life, treatment completion, toxicities and survival.Patients diagnosed with lung cancer and planned for treatment with CRT/RT are invited to participate in this prospective observational study, with a target of 120 participants. The impact and predictors of muscle abnormalities (assessed via CT at the third lumbar vertebra) prior to and 2 months post CRT/RT on the severity of treatment toxicities, treatment completion and survival will be assessed by examining the following variables: demographic and clinical factors, weight loss, malnutrition, muscle strength, physical performance, energy and protein intake, physical activity and sedentary time, risk of sarcopenia (Strength, Assistance in walking, Rise from a chair, Climb stairs, Falls history (SARC-F) score alone and with calf-circumference) and systemic inflammation. A sample of purposively selected participants with muscle abnormalities will be invited to take part in semistructured interviews to understand their ability to cope with treatment and explore preference for treatment strategies focused on nutrition and exercise.The PREDICT study received ethics approval from the Human Research Ethics Committee at Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre (HREC/53147/PMCC-2019) and Deakin University (2019-320).

PubMed, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, Cochrane Specialized Register, DOAJ, PDQT, Biosis Citation Index, Scopus, and Web of Science were systematically searched. A total of 2621 citations yielding 62 primary studies were synthesized under four categories: distinguishing patients with IBD from controls, disease activity differentiation, clinical outcome prediction, and association of NLR with other IBD biomarkers. Thirty-eight studies employed receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis to generate optimal NLR cutpoints for applications including disease activity differentiation and prediction of response to treatment. Among the most promising findings, NLR may have utility for clinical and endoscopic disease activity differentiation and prediction of loss of response to infliximab (IFX). Overall findings suggest NLR may be a promising IBD biomarker. Assessment of NLR is non-invasive, low cost, and widely accessible given NLR is easily calculated from blood count data routinely and serially monitored in patients with IBD. Further research is justified to elucidate how evaluation of NLR in research and clinical practice would directly impact the quality and cost of care for patients living with IBD."

"34631709","Transcriptomics and Other Omics Approaches to Investigate Effects of Xenobiotics on the Placenta.","Front Cell Dev Biol","The conceptus is most vulnerable to developmental perturbation during its early stages when the events that create functional organ systems are being launched. As the placenta is in direct contact with maternal tissues, it readily encounters any xenobiotics in her bloodstream. Besides serving as a conduit for solutes and waste, the placenta possesses a tightly regulated endocrine system that is, of itself, vulnerable to pharmaceutical agents, endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), and other environmental toxicants. To determine whether extrinsic factors affect placental function, transcriptomics and other omics approaches have become more widely used. In casting a wide net with such approaches, they have provided mechanistic insights into placental physiological and pathological responses and how placental responses may impact the fetus, especially the developing brain through the placenta-brain axis. This review will discuss how such omics technologies have been utilized to understand effects of EDCs, including the widely prevalent plasticizers bisphenol A (BPA), bisphenol S (BPS), and phthalates, other environmental toxicants, pharmaceutical agents, maternal smoking, and air pollution on placental gene expression, DNA methylation, and metabolomic profiles. It is also increasingly becoming clear that miRNA (miR) are important epigenetic regulators of placental function. Thus, the evidence to date that xenobiotics affect placental miR expression patterns will also be explored. Such omics approaches with mouse and human placenta will assuredly provide key biomarkers that may be used as barometers of exposure and can be targeted by early mitigation approaches to prevent later diseases, in particular neurobehavioral disorders, originating due to placental dysfunction.Copyright © 2021 Rosenfeld."

We developed computational and statistical methods to integrate multimodal data and quantitatively validate cell-type reproducibility. The resulting reference atlas-containing over 56 neuronal cell types that are highly replicable across analysis methods, sequencing technologies and modalities-is a comprehensive molecular and genomic account of the diverse neuronal and non-neuronal cell types in the mouse primary motor cortex. The atlas includes a population of excitatory neurons that resemble pyramidal cells in layer 4 in other cortical regions4. We further discovered thousands of concordant marker genes and gene regulatory elements for these cell types.

Treatment is limited to symptom management, a disease-modifying therapy is not available. To advance search of therapy approaches, there is a continued need to identify targets for disease intervention both by confirming existing hypotheses and generating new hypotheses.We conducted a mRNA-seq study to identify genes associated with AD in post-mortem brain samples from the superior temporal gyrus (STG, n ​= ​76), and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG, n ​= ​65) brain regions. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified correcting for gender and surrogate variables to capture hidden variation not accounted for by pre-planned covariates. The results from this study were compared with the transcriptome studies from the Accelerated Medicine Partnership - Alzheimer's Disease (AMP-AD) initiative. Over-representation and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used to identify disease-associated pathways. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) analyses were carried out and co-expressed gene modules and their hub genes were identified and associated with additional phenotypic traits of interest.Several hundred mRNAs were differentially expressed between AD cases and cognitively normal controls in the STG, while no and few transcripts met the same criteria (adjusted p less than 0.05 and fold change greater than 1.2) in the IFG. The findings were consistent at the gene set level with two out of three cohorts from AMP-AD. PPI analysis suggested that the DEGs were enriched in protein-protein interactions than expected by random chance. Over-representation and GSEA analysis suggested genes playing roles in neuroinflammation, amyloid-β, autophagy and trafficking being important for the AD disease process. At the gene level, 10 genes from the STG that were consistently differentially expressed in this study and in the MSBB study (one of the three cohorts within the AMP-AD initiative) were enriched in microglial genes (TREM2, C3AR1, ITGAX, OLR1, CD74, and HLA-DRA), but also included genes with a broader cell type expression pattern such as CDK2AP1. Among the DEGs with supporting evidence from an independent study, CDK2AP1 (most abundantly expressed in astrocyte) was the transcript with strongest association with antemortem cognitive measure (last Mini-Mental State Examination score) and neurofibril tangle burden but also associated with amyloid plaque burden, while OLR1 was the transcript with strongest association with amyloid plaque burden. GSEA and over-representation analyses revealed gene sets related to immune processes including neutrophil degranulation, interleukin 10 signaling, and interferon gamma signaling, complement and coagulation cascades, phosphatidylinositol signaling system, phagosome and neurotransmitter receptors and postsynaptic signal transmission were enriched from this study and replicated in an independent study.This study identified differential gene sets, common with two out of three AMP-AD cohorts (ROSMAP and MSBB) and highlights microglia and astrocyte as the key cell-types with DGEs associated with AD clinical diagnosis, and/or antemortem cognitive measure as well as neuropathological indices. Future meta-analysis and causal inferential analysis will be helpful in pinpointing the most relevant pathways and genes to intervene.© 2021 The Author(s)."

Four HLA types were associated with PD after correction for multiple comparisons, HLA-DQA1*03:01, HLA-DQB1*03:02, HLA-DRB1*04:01, and HLA-DRB1*04:04. Haplotype analyses followed by amino acid analysis and conditional analyses suggested that the association is protective and primarily driven by three specific amino acid polymorphisms present in most HLA-DRB1*04 subtypes-11V, 13H, and 33H (OR = 0.87, 95% CI: 0.83-0.90, p < 8.23 × 10-9for all three variants). No other effects were present after adjustment for these amino acids. Our results suggest that specific HLA-DRB1 variants are associated with reduced risk of PD, providing additional evidence for the role of the immune system in PD. Although effect size is small and has no diagnostic significance, understanding the mechanism underlying this association may lead to the identification of new targets for therapeutics development.© 2021.

The aim of this study is to assess the effect of exposure to prenatal or postnatal traffic-related air pollution combining concomitant noise pollution on ASD-related epigenetic and behavioral alternations on offspring.A 2 × 2 factorial analysis experiment was designed. Wistar rats were exposed at different sites (L group: green space; H group: crossroads) and timings (E group: full gestation; P group: 21 days after birth) at the same time, and air pollutants of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and fine particles (PM2.5) were meanwhile sampled. On postnatal day 25, brains from offspring of each group were extracted to determine the levels of DNA methylation in Shank3 (three parts: Shank3_01, Shank3_02, Shank3_03) and MeCP2 (two parts: MeCP2_01, MeCP2_02) promoter regions, H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 after three-chamber social test. Meanwhile, the Shank3 and MeCP2 levels were quantified.The concentrations of PM2.5(L: 58.33 µg/m3; H: 88.33 µg/m3, P < 0.05) and NO2(L: 52.76 µg/m3; H: 146.03 µg/m3, P < 0.01) as well as the intensity of noise pollution (L: 44.4 dB (A); H: 70.1 dB (A), P < 0.001) differed significantly from 18:00 to 19:00 between experimental sites. Traffic pollution exposure (P = 0.006) and neonatal exposure (P = 0.001) led to lower weight of male pups on PND25. Male rats under early-life exposure had increased levels of Shank3 (Shank3_02: timing P < 0.001; site P < 0.05, Shank3_03: timing P < 0.001) and MeCP2 (MeCP2_01: timing P < 0.001, MeCP2_02: timing P < 0.001) methylation and H3K4me3 (EL: 11.94 µg/mg; EH: 11.98; PL: 17.14; PH: 14.78, timing P < 0.05), and reduced levels of H3K27me3 (EL: 71.07 µg/mg; EH: 44.76; PL: 29.15; PH: 28.67, timing P < 0.001; site P < 0.05) in brain compared to those under prenatal exposure. There was, for female pups, a same pattern of Shank3 (Shank3_02: timing P < 0.001; site P < 0.05, Shank3_03: timing P < 0.001) and MeCP2 (MeCP2_01: timing P < 0.05, MeCP2_02: timing P < 0.001) methylation and H3K4me3 (EL: 11.27 µg/mg; EH: 11.55; PL: 16.11; PH: 15.44, timing P < 0.001), but the levels of H3K27me3 exhibited an inverse trend concerning exposure timing. Hypermethylation at the MeCP2 and Shank3 promoter was correlated with the less content of MeCP2 (female: EL: 32.23 ng/mg; EH: 29.58; PL: 25.01; PH: 23.03, timing P < 0.001; site P < 0.05; male: EL: 31.05 ng/mg; EH: 32.75; PL: 23.40; PH: 25.91, timing P < 0.001) and Shank3 (female: EL: 5.10 ng/mg; EH: 5.31; PL: 4.63; PH: 4.82, timing P < 0.001; male: EL: 5.40 ng/mg; EH: 5.48; PL: 4.82; PH: 4.87, timing P < 0.001).

"34631566","Targeted Next-Generation Sequencing of Cancer-Related Genes in a Norwegian Patient Cohort With Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma Reveals Novel Actionable Mutations and Correlations With Pathological Parameters.","Front Oncol","Targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) is increasingly applied in clinical oncology to advance personalized treatment. Despite success in many other tumour types, use of targeted NGS panels for assisting diagnosis and treatment of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) is still limited.The focus of this study was to establish a robust NGS panel targeting most frequent cancer mutations in long-term preserved formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples of HNSCC from routine diagnostics.Tumour DNA obtained from archival FFPE tissue blocks of HNSCC patients treated at Haukeland University Hospital between 2003-2016 (n=111) was subjected to mutational analysis using a custom made AmpliSeq Library PLUS panel targeting 31 genes (Illumina). Associations between mutational burden and clinical and pathological parameters were investigated. Mutation and corresponding clinicopathological data from HNSCC were extracted for selected genes from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and used for Chi-square and Kaplan-Meier analysis.The threshold for sufficient number of reads was attained in 104 (93.7%) cases. Although the specific number of PCR amplified reads detected decreased, the number of NGS-annotated mutations did not significantly change with increased tissue preservation time. In HPV-negative carcinomas, mutations were detected mainly inTP53(73.3%),FAT1(26.7%) andFLG(16.7%) whereas in HPV-positive, the common mutations were inFLG (24.3%) FAT1(17%) andFGFR3(14.6%) genes. Other less common pathogenic mutations, including well reported SNPs were reproducibly identified. Presence of at least one cancer-specific mutations was found to be positively associated with an extensive desmoplastic stroma (p=0.019), and an aggressive type of invasive front (p=0.035), and negatively associated with the degree of differentiation (p=0.041). Analysis of TCGA data corroborated the association between cancer-specific mutations and tumour differentiation and survival analysis showed that tumours with at least one mutation had shorter disease-free and overall survival (p=0.005).A custom made targeted NGS panel could reliably detect several specific mutations in archival samples of HNSCCs preserved up to 17 years. Using this method novel associations between mutational burden and clinical and pathological parameters were detected and actionable mutations in HPV-positive HNSCC were discovered.Copyright © 2021 Dongre, Haave, Fromreide, Erland, Moe, Dhayalan, Riis, Sapkota, Costea, Aarstad and Vintermyr."

The mortality, premature mortality, cause-eliminated life expectancy, potential years of life lost (PYLL), average potential years of life lost (APYLL), annual change percentage (APC), and other indicators of cancer were calculated. The age-standardized rates were calculated using the sixth national census (2010).From 2013 to 2018, the mortality rate of cancer in Feicheng City was 221.55/100,000, and the standardized mortality rate was 166.37/100,000. The standardized mortality rate increased from 2013 to 2014 and then decreased annually. The premature mortality of cancer was 8.98% and showed a downward trend (APC = -2.47%, t = -3.10, P = .04). From 2013 to 2018, the average life expectancy of residents in Feicheng City was 78.63 years. Eliminating the impact of cancer, life expectancy could increase by 3.72 years. The rate of life loss caused by cancer in men was higher than that in women. The total life loss caused by cancer deaths was 126,870.50 person-years, the potential life loss rate was 22.51‰, and the average potential life loss was 13.30 years. The standardized potential years of life lost rate showed a downward trend (APC = -2.96%, t = -3.72, P = .02), and APYLL decreased by 1.98% annually (t = -5.44, P = .01). The top 5 malignant tumors in APYLL were leukemia, breast cancer, brain tumor, liver cancer, and ovarian cancer.Lung cancer, esophageal cancer, female breast cancer, and childhood leukemia have a great impact on the life expectancy of residents in Feicheng City.

Males are two times more likely to develop kidney cancer than females and have a higher death rate. These differences can be explained by looking at genetics and genomics, as well as other risk factors such as hypertension and obesity, lifestyle, and female sex hormones. Examination of the hormonal signaling pathways bring further insights into sex-related differences. Sex and gender-based disparities can be observed at the diagnostic, histological and treatment levels, leading to significant outcome difference. This review summarizes the current knowledge about sex and gender-related differences in the clinical presentation of patients with kidney cancer and the possible biological mechanisms that could explain these observations. Underlying sex-based differences may contribute to the development of sex-specific prognostic and diagnostic tools and the improvement of personalized therapies."
"34594041","Increased somatic mutation burdens in normal human cells due to defective DNA polymerases.","Nat Genet","Mutation accumulation in somatic cells contributes to cancer development and is proposed as a cause of aging. DNA polymerases Pol ε and Pol δ replicate DNA during cell division. However, in some cancers, defective proofreading due to acquired POLE/POLD1 exonuclease domain mutations causes markedly elevated somatic mutation burdens with distinctive mutational signatures. Germline POLE/POLD1 mutations cause familial cancer predisposition. Here, we sequenced normal tissue and tumor DNA from individuals with germline POLE/POLD1 mutations. Increased mutation burdens with characteristic mutational signatures were found in normal adult somatic cell types, during early embryogenesis and in sperm. Thus human physiology can tolerate ubiquitously elevated mutation burdens. Except for increased cancer risk, individuals with germline POLE/POLD1 mutations do not exhibit overt features of premature aging. These results do not support a model in which all features of aging are attributable to widespread cell malfunction directly resulting from somatic mutation burdens accrued during life.© 2021.

However, the biology underlying these associations is unclear. To understand the genetic underpinnings of this complex relationship, we investigated genome-wide datasets informative of African and European ancestries from the Psychiatric Genomic Consortium, the UK Biobank, the GIANT Consortium, and the Million Veteran Program. We used genome-wide association statistics to estimate sex-specific genetic correlations (rg) of traumatic experiences, social support, and PTSD with multiple anthropometric traits. After multiple testing corrections (false discovery rate, FDR q < 0.05), we observed 58 significantrgrelationships in females (e.g., childhood physical abuse and body mass index, BMIrg = 0.245, p = 3.88 × 10-10) and 21 significantrgrelationships in males (e.g., been involved in combat or exposed to warzone and leg fat percentage;rg = 0.405, p = 4.42 × 10-10). We performed causal inference analyses of these genetic overlaps using Mendelian randomization and latent causal variable approaches. Multiple female-specific putative causal relationships were observed linking body composition/size with PTSD (e.g., leg fat percentage→PTSD; beta = 0.319, p = 3.13 × 10-9), traumatic experiences (e.g., childhood physical abuse→waist circumference; beta = 0.055, p = 5.07 × 10-4), and childhood neglect (e.g., ""someone to take you to doctor when needed as a child""→BMI; beta = -0.594, p = 1.09 × 10-5). In males, we observed putative causal effects linking anthropometric-trait genetic liabilities to traumatic experiences (e.g., BMI→childhood physical abuse; beta = 0.028, p = 8.19 × 10-3). Some of these findings were replicated in individuals of African descent although the limited sample size available did not permit us to conduct a sex-stratified analysis in this ancestry group. In conclusion, our findings provide insights regarding sex-specific causal networks linking anthropometric traits to PTSD, traumatic experiences, and social support.© 2021 The Authors."
"34594037","Epigenetic encoding, heritability and plasticity of glioma transcriptional cell states.","Nat Genet","Single-cell RNA sequencing has revealed extensive transcriptional cell state diversity in cancer, often observed independently of genetic heterogeneity, raising the central question of how malignant cell states are encoded epigenetically. To address this, here we performed multiomics single-cell profiling-integrating DNA methylation, transcriptome and genotype within the same cells-of diffuse gliomas, tumors characterized by defined transcriptional cell state diversity. Direct comparison of the epigenetic profiles of distinct cell states revealed key switches for state transitions recapitulating neurodevelopmental trajectories and highlighted dysregulated epigenetic mechanisms underlying gliomagenesis. We further developed a quantitative framework to directly measure cell state heritability and transition dynamics based on high-resolution lineage trees in human samples. We demonstrated heritability of malignant cell states, with key differences in hierarchal and plastic cell state architectures in IDH-mutant glioma versus IDH-wild-type glioblastoma, respectively. This work provides a framework anchoring transcriptional cancer cell states in their epigenetic encoding, inheritance and transition dynamics.© 2021.

"34628600","Joint-Tissue Integrative Analysis Identified Hundreds of Schizophrenia Risk Genes.","Mol Neurobiol","Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified a large number of schizophrenia risk variants, and most of them are mapped to noncoding regions. By leveraging multiple joint-tissue gene expression data and GWAS data, we herein performed a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) and Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis and identified 144 genes whose mRNA levels were related to genetic risk of schizophrenia. Most of these genes exhibited diametrically opposite trends of expression in prenatal and postnatal brain tissues, despite that their expression levels in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) tissues did not significantly differ between schizophrenics and healthy controls. We then found significant enrichment of these genes in dopamine-related pathways that were repeatedly implicated in schizophrenia pathogenesis and in the action of antipsychotic drugs. Gene expression analysis using single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data of mid-gestation fetal brains further revealed enrichment of these genes in glutamatergic excitatory neurons and cycling progenitors. These lines of evidence, in consistency with previous findings, confirmed the polygenic nature of schizophrenia and highlighted involvement of early neurodevelopment aberrations in this disorder. Further investigations using advanced algorithms in both bulk brain tissues and in single cells and at different developmental stages are necessary to characterize transcriptomic features of schizophrenia pathogenesis along brain development.© 2021.

Statistical methods for such integration have been developed for continuous and binary phenotypes; however, the SNP-set integrative approaches for time-to-event or survival outcomes are lacking.We here propose IEHC, an integrative eQTL (expression quantitative trait loci) hierarchical Cox regression, for SNP-set based survival association analysis by modeling effect sizes of genetic variants as a function of eQTL via a hierarchical manner. Three p-values combination tests are developed to examine the joint effects of eQTL and genetic variants after a novel decorrelated modification of statistics for the two components. An omnibus test (IEHC-ACAT) is further adapted to aggregate the strengths of all available tests.Simulations demonstrated that the IEHC joint tests were more powerful if both eQTL and genetic variants contributed to association signal, while IEHC-ACAT was robust and often outperformed other approaches across various simulation scenarios. When applying IEHC to ten TCGA cancers by incorporating eQTL from relevant tissues of GTEx, we revealed that substantial correlations existed between the two types of effect sizes of genetic variants from TCGA and GTEx, and identified 21 (9 unique) cancer-associated genes which would otherwise be missed by approaches not incorporating eQTL.IEHC represents a flexible, robust, and powerful approach to integrate functional omics information to enhance the power of identifying association signals for the survival risk of complex human cancers.© 2021.

However, it is challenging to identify the mechanisms that connect the genetic variants with complex traits as the majority of GWAS associations are in non-coding regions. Methods that integrate genomic and transcriptomic data allow us to investigate how genetic variants may affect a trait through their effect on gene expression. These include CoMM and CoMM-S2, likelihood-ratio-based methods that integrate GWAS and eQTL studies to assess expression-trait association. However, their reliance on individual-level eQTL data render them inapplicable when only summary-level eQTL results, such as those from large-scale eQTL analyses, are available.Result:We develop an efficient probabilistic model, CoMM-S4, to explore the expression-trait association using summary-level eQTL and GWAS datasets. Compared with CoMM-S2, which uses individual-level eQTL data, CoMM-S4requires only summary-level eQTL data. To test expression-trait association, an efficient variational Bayesian EM algorithm and a likelihood ratio test were constructed. We applied CoMM-S4to both simulated and real data. The simulation results demonstrate that CoMM-S4can perform as well as CoMM-S2and S-PrediXcan, and analyses using GWAS summary statistics from Biobank Japan and eQTL summary statistics from eQTLGen and GTEx suggest novel susceptibility loci for cardiovascular diseases and osteoporosis.Availability and implementation:The developed R package is available at https://github.com/gordonliu810822/CoMM.Copyright © 2021 Yang, Yeung and Liu."

A total of 3198 unrelated Russian subjects including 1572 T2D patients and 1626 healthy subjects were enrolled. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of theGSSandGGT7genes were genotyped using the MassArray-4 system. We found that theGSSandGGT7gene polymorphisms alone and in combinations are associated with T2D risk regardless of sex, age, and body mass index, as well as correlated with plasma glutathione, hydrogen peroxide, and fasting blood glucose levels. Polymorphisms ofGSS(rs13041792) andGGT7(rs6119534 and rs11546155) genes were associated with the tissue-specific expression of genes involved in unfolded protein response and the regulation of proteostasis. Transcriptome-wide association analysis has shown that the pancreatic expression of some of these genes such asEDEM2,MYH7B,MAP1LC3A, andCPNE1is linked to the genetic risk of T2D. A comprehensive analysis of the data allowed proposing a new hypothesis for the etiology of type 2 diabetes that endogenous glutathione deficiency might be a key condition responsible for the impaired folding of proinsulin which triggered an unfolded protein response, ultimately leading to beta-cell apoptosis and disease development."

Given the importance of the microbiota-gut-brain axis, we investigated the differences in gut microbiota between representative cases of these two diseases and sought to develop a microbiome-based approach for their differential diagnosis.Methods:We enrolled 23 patients with MDD, 21 with GAD, and 10 healthy subjects (healthy crowd, HC) in the present study. We used 16S rRNA gene-sequencing analysis to determine the microbial compositions of the gut microbiome based on Illumina Miseq and according to the standard protocol.Results:GAD showed a significant difference in microbiota richness and diversity as compared with HC. Additionally, Otu24167, Otu19140, and Otu19751 were significantly decreased in MDD relative to HC, and Otu2581 and Otu10585 were significantly increased in GAD relative to MDD. At the genus level, the abundances ofSutterellaandFusicatenibacterwere significantly lower in MDD relative to HC, and the abundances ofFusicatenibacterandChristensenellaceae_R7_group were significantly lower in GAD than in HC. The abundance ofSutterellawas significantly higher whereas that ofFaecalibacteriumwas significantly lower in GAD relative to MDD. Moreover, we observed thatChristensenellaceae_R7_group negatively correlated with the factor score (Limited to Hopelessness) and total score of HAMD-24 (p< 0.05), whereasFusicatenibacternegatively correlated with FT4 (p< 0.05). Furthermore, the GAD group showed significant differences at the genus level forFaecalibacterium, which negatively correlated with PTC (p< 0.05).Conclusions:This study elucidated a unique gut-microbiome signature associated with MDD and GAD that could facilitate differential diagnosis and targeted therapy.Copyright © 2021 Dong, Shen, Hao, Li, Li, Xu, Yin and Kuang."

Insulin deficiency in our body is the main cause of diabetes. Insulin is one of the most well studied proteins, yet the genesis of its discovery was not getting much attention so far. Nevertheless, the history of the discovery of insulin is an exemplary of solving observational and scientific riddles, drudgery, patience and even professional turmoil. It is an inspiration for all medical personnel and scientists who are practising in the field of molecular medicine. Additionally, the genetic and epigenetic regulation of different types of diabetes needs to be addressed because of the widespread nature of the disease. Diabetes not only involves genetic predisposition but environmental factors, lifestyle etc. can be the major contributor for its inception. Nonetheless, viral infections at an early age are also found to trigger the onset of type I diabetes. In this review article, the history of the discovery of insulin is detailed along with the justification for the genetic and epigenetic regulatory mechanisms of diabetes and explained how viral infections can also trigger the onset of diabetes.© Archana Sharma Foundation of Calcutta 2021."

We applied MPRAu to six human cell lines, focusing on genetic variants associated with genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and human evolutionary adaptation. MPRAu expands our understanding of 3'UTR function, suggesting that simple sequences predominately explain 3'UTR regulatory activity. We adapt MPRAu to uncover diverse molecular mechanisms at base pair resolution, including an adenylate-uridylate (AU)-rich element of LEPR linked to potential metabolic evolutionary adaptations in East Asians. We nominate hundreds of 3'UTR causal variants with genetically fine-mapped phenotype associations. Using endogenous allelic replacements, we characterize one variant that disrupts a miRNA site regulating the viral defense gene TRIM14 and one that alters PILRB abundance, nominating a causal variant underlying transcriptional changes in age-related macular degeneration.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

"34630878","Hepatocellular carcinoma in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: A growing challenge.","World J Hepatol","Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of liver disease worldwide, and its prevalence increases continuously. As it predisposes to hepatocellular carcinoma both in the presence and in the absence of cirrhosis, it is not surprising that the incidence of NAFLD-related hepatocellular carcinoma would also rise. Some of the mechanisms involved in hepatocarcinogenesis are particular to individuals with fatty liver, and they help explain why liver cancer develops even in patients without cirrhosis. Genetic and immune-mediated mechanisms seem to play an important role in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma in this population. Currently, it is consensual that patients with NAFLD-related cirrhosis should be surveilled with ultrasonography every 6 mo (with or without alpha-fetoprotein), but it is known that they are less likely to follow this recommendation than individuals with other kinds of liver disease. Moreover, the performance of the methods of surveillance are lower in NAFLD than they are in other liver diseases. Furthermore, it is not clear which subgroups of patients without cirrhosis should undergo surveillance. Understanding the mechanisms of hepatocarcinogenesis in NAFLD could hopefully lead to the identification of biomarkers to be used in the surveillance for liver cancer in these individuals. By improving surveillance, tumors could be detected in earlier stages, amenable to curative treatments.©The Author(s) 2021. Published by Baishideng Publishing Group Inc. All rights reserved."

Much important biochemistry derives from electrophilic enzyme cofactors, transient intermediates, and labile regulatory modifications, but ABPP probes for such species are underdeveloped. Here, we describe a versatile class of probes for this less charted hemisphere of the proteome. The use of an electron-rich hydrazine as the common chemical modifier enables covalent targeting of multiple, pharmacologically important classes of enzymes bearing diverse organic and inorganic cofactors. Probe attachment occurs by both polar and radicaloid mechanisms, can be blocked by molecules that occupy the active sites, and depends on the proper poise of the active site for turnover. These traits will enable the probes to be used to identify specific inhibitors of individual members of these multiple enzyme classes, making them uniquely versatile among known ABPP probes.© 2021 The Authors.

The sample consisted of 743 Polish children aged between 6 and 17 years. We analyzed a unique set of genes and polymorphisms selected for ADHD and/or obesity based on gene prioritization tools. Polymorphisms in theKCNIP1, SLC1A3, MTHFR, ADRA2A, andSLC6A2genes proved to be associated with the risk of ADHD in the studied population. TheCOMTgene polymorphism was one that specifically increased the risk of EBW in the ADHD group. Using the whole-exome sequencing technique, we have shown that the ADHD group contains rare and protein-truncating variants in theFBXL17, DBH, MTHFR, PCDH7, RSPH3, SPTBN1, andTNRC6Cgenes. In turn, variants in theADRA2A, DYNC1H1, MAP1A, SEMA6D, andZNF536genes were specific for ADHD with EBW. In this way, we confirmed, at the molecular level, the existence of genes specifically predisposing to EBW in ADHD patients, which are associated with the biological pathways involved in the regulation of the reward system, intestinal microbiome, and muscle metabolism."
"34534210","Genetic dissection of complex traits using hierarchical biological knowledge.","PLoS Comput Biol","Despite the growing constellation of genetic loci linked to common traits, these loci have yet to account for most heritable variation, and most act through poorly understood mechanisms. Recent machine learning (ML) systems have used hierarchical biological knowledge to associate genetic mutations with phenotypic outcomes, yielding substantial predictive power and mechanistic insight. Here, we use an ontology-guided ML system to map single nucleotide variants (SNVs) focusing on 6 classic phenotypic traits in natural yeast populations. The 29 identified loci are largely novel and account for ~17% of the phenotypic variance, versus <3% for standard genetic analysis. Representative results show that sensitivity to hydroxyurea is linked to SNVs in two alternative purine biosynthesis pathways, and that sensitivity to copper arises through failure to detoxify reactive oxygen species in fatty acid metabolism.

In a genome-wide association study of vertigo (Ncases = 48,072, Ncontrols = 894,541), we uncovered an association with six common sequence variants in individuals of European ancestry, including missense variants in ZNF91, OTOG, OTOGL, and TECTA, and a cis-eQTL for ARMC9. The association of variants in ZNF91, OTOGL, and OTOP1 was driven by an association with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. Using previous reports of sequence variants associating with age-related hearing impairment and motion sickness, we found eight additional variants that associate with vertigo. Although disorders of the auditory and the vestibular system may co-occur, none of the six genome-wide significant vertigo variants were associated with hearing loss and only one was associated with age-related hearing impairment. Our results uncovered sequence variants associating with vertigo in a genome-wide association study and implicated genes with known roles in inner ear development, maintenance, and disease.© 2021.

Recent surveys of mouse and human brains with single-cell transcriptomics2-6and high-throughput imaging technologies7,8have uncovered hundreds of neural cell types distributed in different brain regions, but the transcriptional regulatory programs that are responsible for the unique identity and function of each cell type remain unknown. Here we probe the accessible chromatin in more than 800,000 individual nuclei from 45 regions that span the adult mouse isocortex, olfactory bulb, hippocampus and cerebral nuclei, and use the resulting data to map the state of 491,818 candidate cis-regulatory DNA elements in 160 distinct cell types. We find high specificity of spatial distribution for not only excitatory neurons, but also most classes of inhibitory neurons and a subset of glial cell types. We characterize the gene regulatory sequences associated with the regional specificity within these cell types. We further link a considerable fraction of the cis-regulatory elements to putative target genes expressed in diverse cerebral cell types and predict transcriptional regulators that are involved in a broad spectrum of molecular and cellular pathways in different neuronal and glial cell populations. Our results provide a foundation for comprehensive analysis of gene regulatory programs of the mammalian brain and assist in the interpretation of noncoding risk variants associated with various neurological diseases and traits in humans.© 2021.

"34603368","Cross-Disorder Genomics Data Analysis Elucidates a Shared Genetic Basis Between Major Depression and Osteoarthritis Pain.","Front Genet","Osteoarthritis (OA) and major depression (MD) are two debilitating disorders that frequently co-occur and affect millions of the elderly each year. Despite the greater symptom severity, poorer clinical outcomes, and increased mortality of the comorbid conditions, we have a limited understanding of their etiologic relationships. In this study, we conducted the first cross-disorder investigations of OA and MD, using genome-wide association data representing over 247K cases and 475K controls. Along with significant positive genome-wide genetic correlations (rg= 0.299 ± 0.026,p= 9.10 × 10-31), Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis identified a bidirectional causal effect between OA and MD (βOA→MD= 0.09, SE = 0.02,z-scorep-value < 1.02 × 10-5; βMD→OA= 0.19, SE = 0.026,p< 2.67 × 10-13), indicating genetic variants affecting OA risk are, in part, shared with those influencing MD risk. Cross-disorder meta-analysis of OA and MD identified 56 genomic risk loci (Pmeta≤ 5 × 10-8), which show heightened expression of the associated genes in the brain and pituitary. Gene-set enrichment analysis highlighted ""mechanosensory behavior"" genes (GO:0007638;Pgene_set= 2.45 × 10-8) as potential biological mechanisms that simultaneously increase susceptibility to these mental and physical health conditions. Taken together, these findings show that OA and MD share common genetic risk mechanisms, one of which centers on the neural response to the sensation of mechanical stimulus. Further investigation is warranted to elaborate the etiologic mechanisms of the pleiotropic risk genes, as well as to develop early intervention and integrative clinical care of these serious conditions that disproportionally affect the aging population.Copyright © 2021 Barowsky, Jung, Nesbit, Silberstein, Fava, Loggia, Smoller and Lee."

To identify novel genetic loci associated with resistant hypertension in the Japanese population, we conducted a genome-wide association study with 2705 resistant hypertension cases and 21,296 mild hypertension controls, all from BioBank Japan. We identified one novel susceptibility candidate locus, rs1442386 on chromosome 18p11.3 (DLGAP1), achieving genome-wide significance (odds ratio (95% CI) = 0.85 (0.81-0.90), P = 3.75 × 10-8) and 18 loci showing suggestive association, including rs62525059 of 8q24.3 (CYP11B2) and rs3774427 of 3p21.1 (CACNA1D). We further detected biological processes associated with resistant hypertension, including chemical synaptic transmission, regulation of transmembrane transport, neuron development and neurological system processes, highlighting the importance of the nervous system.

"34593973","Prenatal inflammation exposure-programmed hypertension exhibits multi-generational inheritance via disrupting DNA methylome.","Acta Pharmacol Sin","The multi-generation heredity trait of hypertension in human has been reported, but the molecular mechanisms underlying multi-generational inheritance of hypertension remain obscure. Recent evidence shows that prenatal inflammatory exposure (PIE) results in increased incidence of cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension. In this study we investigated whether and how PIE contributed to multi-generational inheritance of hypertension in rats. PIE was induced in pregnant rats by intraperitoneal injection of LPS or Poly (I:C) either once on gestational day 10.5 (transient stimulation, T) or three times on gestational day 8.5, 10.5, and 12.5 (persistent stimulation, P). Male offspring was chosen to study the paternal inheritance. We showed that PIE, irrespectively induced by LPS or Poly (I:C) stimulation during pregnancy, resulted in multi-generational inheritance of significantly increased blood pressure in rat descendants, and that prenatal LPS exposure led to vascular remodeling and vasoconstrictor dysfunction in both thoracic aorta and superior mesenteric artery of adult F2 offspring. Furthermore, we revealed that PIE resulted in global alteration of DNA methylome in thoracic aorta of F2 offspring. Specifically, PIE led to the DNA hypomethylation of G beta gamma (Gβγ) signaling genes in both the F1 sperm and the F2 thoracic aorta, and activation of PI3K/Akt signaling was implicated in the pathologic changes and dysregulated vascular tone of aortic tissue in F2 LPS-P offspring. Our data demonstrate that PIE reprogrammed DNA methylome of cells from the germline/mature gametes contributes to the development of hypertension in F2 PIE offspring. This study broadens the current knowledge regarding the multi-generation effect of the cumulative early life environmental factors on the development of hypertension.© 2021.

However, to date, most genetic studies of type 2 diabetes and related glycaemic traits have been performed in individuals of European ancestry. The same is true for most other complex diseases, largely due to use of 'convenience samples'. Rapid genotyping of large population cohorts and case-control studies from existing collections was performed when the genome-wide association study (GWAS) 'revolution' began, back in 2005. Although global representation has increased in the intervening 15 years, further expansion and inclusion of diverse populations in genetic and genomic studies is still needed. In this review, I discuss the progress made in incorporating multi-ancestry participants in genetic analyses of type 2 diabetes and related glycaemic traits, and associated opportunities and challenges.

"34631717","X-Chromosome Inactivation and Autosomal Random Monoallelic Expression as ""Faux Amis"".","Front Cell Dev Biol","X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) and random monoallelic expression of autosomal genes (RMAE) are two paradigms of gene expression regulation where, at the single cell level, genes can be expressed from either the maternal or paternal alleles. X-chromosome inactivation takes place in female marsupial and placental mammals, while RMAE has been described in mammals and also other species. Although the outcome of both processes results in random monoallelic expression and mosaicism at the cellular level, there are many important differences. We provide here a brief sketch of the history behind the discovery of XCI and RMAE. Moreover, we review some of the distinctive features of these two phenomena, with respect to when in development they are established, their roles in dosage compensation and cellular phenotypic diversity, and the molecular mechanisms underlying their initiation and stability.Copyright © 2021 Barreto, Kubasova, Alves-Pereira and Gendrel."

Furthermore, we demonstrate direct induction of germline stem cells (iGSCs) differentiated into functional oocytes by transduction ofH19,Stella, andZfp57and inactivation ofPlzfin SSCs after screening with ovarian organoids. We uncovered extensive chromatin reorganization during SSC conversion into iGSCs, which was highly similar to female germline stem cells. We observed that although topologically associating domains were stable during SSC conversion, chromatin interactions changed in a striking manner, altering 35% of inactive and active chromosomal compartments throughout the genome.We demonstrate successful offspring production of ovarian organoids derived from SSCs by defined factors with chromatin reorganization.

Here we suggest a third route-disruption of the germline epigenome induced by exogenous toxicants during a parent's gamete development. Similar to cases of germline mutation, these molecular perturbations may produce dysregulated transcription of brain-related genes during fetal and early development, resulting in abnormal neurobehavioral phenotypes in offspring. Many types of exposures may have these impacts, and here we discuss examples of anesthetic gases, tobacco components, synthetic steroids, and valproic acid. Alterations in parental germline could help explain some unsolved phenomena of autism, including increased prevalence, missing heritability, skewed sex ratio, and heterogeneity of neurobiology and behavior.© 2021.

However, current in vitro models to generate human primordial germ cell-like cells (hPGCLCs) have revealed high variability regarding differentiation efficiency depending on the hPSC lines used. Here, we investigated whether differences in X chromosome inactivation (XCI) in female hPSCs could contribute to the variability of hPGCLC differentiation efficiency during embryoid body (EB) formation. For this, we first characterized the XCI state in different hPSC lines by investigating the expression ofXISTand H3K27me3, followed by differentiation and quantification of hPGCLCs. We observed that the XCI state did not influence the efficiency to differentiate to hPGCLCs; rather, hPSCs derived from cells isolated from urine showed an increased trend towards hPGCLCs differentiation compared to skin-derived hPSCs. In addition, we also characterized the XCI state in the generated hPGCLCs. Interestingly, we observed that independent of the XCI state of the hPSCs used, both hPGCLCs and soma cells in the EBs acquiredXISTexpression, indicative of an inactive X chromosome. In fact, culture conditions for EB formation seemed to promoteXISTexpression. Together, our results contribute to understanding how epigenetic properties of hPSCs influence differentiation and to optimize differentiation methods to obtain higher numbers of hPGCLCs, the first step to achieve human in vitro gametogenesis."

The oxytocin pathway has been implicated in the onset of maternal behaviors. Epigenetic modification of the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) through DNA methylation has been associated with the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric disorders. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of prenatal DEHP exposure on oxytocin-regulated maternal behaviors and to examine the protective effect of exercise. Pregnant rats (F0) were fed with vehicle or DEHP during gestation and the offspring females (F1) were assessed for their maternal behaviors by pup retrieval test at postpartum. The results showed that reduced pup retrieval activities without significant alteration of stress responses were observed in the prenatally DEHP-exposed females. Prenatal DEHP exposure decreased the expressions of oxytocin,OxtrmRNA, and oxytocin receptor, and increasedOxtrmethylation in the hypothalamus of postpartum female rats. There were no significant effects of exercise on behavioral, biochemical, and epigenetic measurements. These results suggest that prenatal DEHP exposure has a long-term adverse effect on maternal behaviors;Oxtrhyper-methylation may be a potential epigenetic mechanism for this alteration, which cannot be prevented by physical exercise during childhood."

The molecular mechanisms underlying MG are not fully understood. We analyzed the gene expression profile (GSE85452) and methylation profile (GSE85647) of MG samples from the GEO database to identify aberrantly methylated-differentially expressed genes. By integrating the datasets, we identified 143 hypermethylation-low expression genes and 91 hypomethylation-high expression genes. Then we constructed PPI network and ceRNA networks by these genes. Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and Abelson tyrosine-protein kinase (ABL)1 were critical genes in both PPI networks and ceRNA networks. And potential MG associated lncRNAs were selected by comprehensive analysis of the critical genes and ceRNA networks. In the hypermethylation-low expression genes associated ceRNA network, sirtuin (SIRT)1 was the most important gene and the lncRNA HLA complex (HC) P5 had the highest connection degree. Meanwhile, PTEN was the most important gene and the lncRNA LINC00173 had the highest connection degree in the hypomethylation-high expression genes associated ceRNA network. LINC00173 was validated to be upregulated in MG patients by qRT-PCR (P= 0.005), which indicated LINC00173 might be a potential biomarker for MG.

"34620190","Global properties of regulatory sequences are predicted by transcription factor recognition mechanisms.","Genome Biol","Mammalian genomes contain millions of putative regulatory sequences, which are delineated by binding of multiple transcription factors. The degree to which spacing and orientation constraints among transcription factor binding sites contribute to the recognition and identity of regulatory sequence is an unresolved but important question that impacts our understanding of genome function and evolution. Global mechanisms that underlie phenomena including the size of regulatory sequences, their uniqueness, and their evolutionary turnover remain poorly described.Here, we ask whether models incorporating different degrees of spacing and orientation constraints among transcription factor binding sites are broadly consistent with several global properties of regulatory sequence. These properties include length, sequence diversity, turnover rate, and dominance of specific TFs in regulatory site identity and cell type specification. Models with and without spacing and orientation constraints are generally consistent with all observed properties of regulatory sequence, and with regulatory sequences being fundamentally small (~ 1 nucleosome). Uniqueness of regulatory regions and their rapid evolutionary turnover are expected under all models examined. An intriguing issue we identify is that the complexity of eukaryotic regulatory sites must scale with the number of active transcription factors, in order to accomplish observed specificity.Models of transcription factor binding with or without spacing and orientation constraints predict that regulatory sequences should be fundamentally short, unique, and turn over rapidly. We posit that the existence of master regulators may be, in part, a consequence of evolutionary pressure to limit the complexity and increase evolvability of regulatory sites.© 2021. The Author(s)."

However, how the epigenetic landscape contributes to pigment cell differentiation, especially in the context of iridophore cell fate, is poorly understood.We chart the global changes in the epigenetic landscape, including DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility, during neural crest differentiation into melanophores and iridophores to identify epigenetic determinants shaping cell type-specific gene expression. Motif enrichment in the epigenetically dynamic regions reveals putative transcription factors that might be responsible for driving pigment cell identity. Through this effort, in the relatively uncharacterized iridophores, we validate alx4a as a necessary and sufficient transcription factor for iridophore differentiation and present evidence on alx4a's potential regulatory role in guanine synthesis pathway.Pigment cell fate is marked by substantial DNA demethylation events coupled with dynamic chromatin accessibility to potentiate gene regulation through cis-regulatory control.

Recent work using single-cell transcriptomics has led to the identification of distinct cancer cell states across a range of cancer types, but their functional relevance and the advantage that they provide to the tumor as a system remain elusive. We present here a definition of cancer cell states in terms of coherently and differentially expressed gene modules and review the origins, dynamics, and impact of states on the tumor system as a whole. The spectrum of cell states taken on by a malignant population may depend on cellular lineage, epigenetic history, genetic mutations, or environmental cues, which has implications for the relative stability or plasticity of individual states. Finally, evidence has emerged that malignant cells in different states may cooperate or compete within a tumor niche, thereby providing an evolutionary advantage to the tumor through increased immune evasion, drug resistance, or invasiveness. Uncovering the mechanisms that govern the origin and dynamics of cancer cell states in tumorigenesis may shed light on how heterogeneity contributes to tumor fitness and highlight vulnerabilities that can be exploited for therapy.© 2021 Barkley et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press."

Here, we used a graph-based method to genotype long-read-discovered SVs in short-read data from diverse human genomes. We then applied an admixture-aware method to identify 220 SVs exhibiting extreme patterns of frequency differentiation - a signature of local adaptation. The top two variants traced to the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus, tagging a haplotype that swept to near fixation in certain southeast Asian populations, but is rare in other global populations. Further investigation revealed evidence that the haplotype traces to gene flow from Neanderthals, corroborating the role of immune-related genes as prominent targets of adaptive introgression.

A total of 55 young women (≤ 37 years) with at least two IVF cycles with ≤ 5 harvested oocytes despite sufficient stimulation with follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) were included in the early ovarian aging group. As controls, 52 young women (≤ 37 years) with normal ovarian function, defined by at least eight harvested oocytes, were included. Relative telomere length (rTL) and epigenetic age acceleration (AgeAccel) were measured in white blood cells as markers of premenopausal accelerated biological aging.rTL was comparable with a mean of 0.46 (± SD 0.12) in the early ovarian aging group and 0.47 (0.14) in the normal ovarian aging group. The AgeAccel of the early ovarian aging group was, insignificantly, 0.5 years older, but this difference disappeared when adjusting for chronological age. Sub-analysis using Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) as selection criterion for the two groups did not change the results.We did not find any indications of accelerated aging in whole blood from young women with idiopathic early ovarian aging.

New and reliable biomarkers are in urgent need for ccRCC diagnosis and prognosis. The CENP family is overexpressed in many types of cancers, but its functions in ccRCC have not been fully clarified. In this paper, we found that several CENP family members were highly expressed in ccRCC tissues. Also, CENPA expression level was related to clinicopathological grade and prognosis by weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). CENPA served as a representative CENP family member as a ccRCC biomarker. Further in vitro experiments verified that overexpression of CENPA promoted ccRCC proliferation and metastasis by accelerating the cell cycle and activating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. The elevated β-catenin led by CENPA overexpression translocated to nucleus for downstream effect. Functional recovery experiment confirmed that Wnt/β-catenin pathway was essential for ccRCC progression and metastasis.

"34630127","Epigenetic Alterations in Podocytes in Diabetic Nephropathy.","Front Pharmacol","Recently, epigenetic alterations have been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of diabetes and its complications. Kidney podocytes, which are glomerular epithelial cells, are important cells that form a slit membrane-a barrier for proteinuria. Podocytes are terminally differentiated cells without cell division or replenishment abilities. Therefore, podocyte damage is suggested to be one of the key factors determining renal prognosis. Recent studies, including ours, suggest that epigenetic changes in podocytes are associated with chronic kidney disease, including diabetic nephropathy. Furthermore, the association between DNA damage repair and epigenetic changes in diabetic podocytes has been demonstrated. Detection of podocyte DNA damage and epigenetic changes using human samples, such as kidney biopsy and urine-derived cells, may be a promising strategy for estimating kidney damage and renal prognoses in patients with diabetes. Targeting epigenetic podocyte changes and associated DNA damage may become a novel therapeutic strategy for preventing progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and provide a possible prognostic marker in diabetic nephropathy. This review summarizes recent advances regarding epigenetic changes, especially DNA methylation, in podocytes in diabetic nephropathy and addresses detection of these alterations in human samples. Additionally, we focused on DNA damage, which is increased under high-glucose conditions and associated with the generation of epigenetic changes in podocytes. Furthermore, epigenetic memory in diabetes is discussed. Understanding the role of epigenetic changes in podocytes in diabetic nephropathy may be of great importance considering the increasing diabetic nephropathy patient population in an aging society.Copyright © 2021 Sugita, Hayashi, Hishikawa and Itoh."

However, it is difficult to estimate in most animals, including felines-most of whom are endangered. Here, we developed the first DNA methylation-based age-estimation technique-as an alternative to current age-estimation methods-for two feline species that share a relatively long genetic distance with each other: domestic cat (Felis catus; 79 blood samples) and an endangered Panthera, the snow leopard (Panthera uncia; 11 blood samples). We measured the methylation rates of two gene regions using methylation-sensitive high-resolution melting (MS-HRM). Domestic cat age was estimated with a mean absolute deviation (MAD) of 3.83 years. Health conditions influenced accuracy of the model. Specifically, the models built on cats with chronic kidney disease (CKD) had lower accuracy than those built on healthy cats. The snow leopard-specific model (i.e. the model that resets the model settings for snow leopards) had a better accuracy (MAD = 2.10 years) than that obtained on using the domestic cat model directly. This implies that our markers could be utilised across species, although changing the model settings when targeting different species could lead to better estimation accuracy.

Extracellular deposition of amyloid plaques (Aβ) and intracellular deposition of neurofibrillary tangles in neurons are the major pathogenicities of AD. However, drugs targeting these therapeutic targets are not effective. Therefore, novel targets for the treatment of AD urgently need to be identified. Expression of the mesoderm-specific transcript (Mest) is regulated by genomic imprinting, where only the paternal allele is active for transcription. We identified hypermethylation on the Mest promoter, which led to a reduction in Mest mRNA levels and activation of Wnt signaling in brain tissues of AD patients. Mest knockout (KO) using the CRIPSR/Cas9 system in mouse embryonic stem cells and P19 embryonic carcinoma cells leads to neuronal differentiation arrest. Depletion of Mest in primary hippocampal neurons via lentivirus expressing shMest or inducible KO system causes neurodegeneration. Notably, depletion of Mest in primary cortical neurons of rats leads to tau phosphorylation at the S199 and T231 sites. Overall, our data suggest that hypermethylation of the Mest promoter may cause or facilitate the progression of AD.© 2021. The Author(s)."

This aggregate formation may be triggered by an increase in the TDP-43 level with aging. However, the amount of TDP-43 is autoregulated by alternative splicing of the TARDBP 3'UTR, and how this autoregulation is affected by aging remains to be elucidated. We found that DNA demethylation in the autoregulatory region in the TARDBP 3'UTR reduced alternative splicing and increased TARDBP mRNA expression. Furthermore, in the human motor cortex, we found that this region was demethylated with aging, resulting in increased expression of TARDBP mRNA. The acceleration of DNA demethylation in the motor cortex was associated with the age of ALS onset. In summary, the dysregulation of TDP-43 autoregulation by age-related DNA demethylation in the motor cortex may explain the contribution of aging and motor system selectivity in ALS.© 2021.

Gene ontology analysis was performed for 3 groups of genes (females, males, and duplicates) using the PANTHER database. The DAVID platform was used to perform KEGG metabolic pathway analysis.The studies revealed unique for males and females changes in methylation of CpG sites, associated with certain metabolic processes. It was demonstrated that most of the CpG sites, for which methylation changes with age were revealed in both sexes, are associated with the genes responsible for the development and functioning of the nervous system. In males, unique age-related methylation changes affect CpG sites associated with changes in the immune system and lipid metabolism. In females, most CpGs are associated with changes involved in transcription and translation processes. Analysis of biological functions by KEGG revealed that a unique process associated with age-related changes in methylation of the glutamatergic system is typical for males.

Like other autoimmune disorders, a strong interferon (IFN) signature is present among subsets of pSS patients, suggesting the involvement of innate immunity in pSS pathogenesis.NCR3/NKp30 is a natural killer (NK) cell-specific activating receptor regulating the cross talk between NK and dendritic cells including type II IFN secretion upon NK-cell activation. A genetic association between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in theNCR3/NKp30 promoter gene and a higher susceptibility for pSS has been previously described, with pSS patients most frequently carrying the major allele variant associated with a higher NKp30 transcript and IFN-γ release as a consequence of the receptor engagement. In the present study, we combined RNA-sequencing and histology from pSS salivary gland biopsies to better characterize NKp30 (NCR3) and its ligand B7/H6 (NCR3LG1) in pSS salivary gland tissues. Levels ofNCR3/NKp30 were significantly increased both in salivary glands and in circulating NK cells of pSS patients compared with sicca controls, especially in salivary glands with organized ectopic lymphoid structures. In line with this observation, a strong correlation betweenNCR3/NKp30 levels and salivary gland infiltrating immune cells (CD3, CD20) was found. Furthermore,NCR3/NKp30 levels also correlated with higher IFN-γ, Perforin, and Granzyme-B expression in pSS SGs with organized ectopic lymphoid structures, suggesting an activation state of NK cells infiltrating SG tissue. Of note, NKp30+ NK cells accumulated at the border of the inflammatoryfoci, while the NKp30 ligand, B7/H6, is shown to be expressed mainly by ductal epithelial cells in pSS salivary glands. Finally, immunomodulatory treatment, such as the B-cell depleting agent rituximab, known to reduce the infiltration of immune cells in pSS SGs, prevented the upregulation ofNCR3/NKp30 within the glands.Copyright © 2021 Pontarini, Sciacca, Grigoriadou, Rivellese, Lucchesi, Fossati-Jimack, Coleby, Chowdhury, Calcaterra, Tappuni, Lewis, Fabris, Quartuccio, Bella, Bowman, Pitzalis, Mavilio, De Vita and Bombardieri."
"34631153","DNA methylation changes induced by prenatal toxic metal exposure: An overview of epidemiological evidence.","Environ Epigenet","Accumulating evidence suggests that exposure to unfavorable conditions early in life can substantially contribute to the risk of chronic disorders later in life ('developmental programming' phenomenon). The mechanistic basis for this phenomenon remains poorly understood so far, although epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation, histone modifications and microRNA-mediated gene regulation apparently play a crucial role. The key role of epigenetic modifications triggered by unfavorable environmental cues during sensitive developmental periods in linking adverse early-life events to later-life health outcomes is evident from a large body of studies, including methylome-wide association studies and research of candidate genes. Toxic metals (TMs), such as heavy metals, including lead, chromium, cadmium, arsenic, mercury, etc., are among environmental contaminants currently most significantly impacting human health status. Since TMs can cross the placental barrier and accumulate in fetal tissues, exposure to high doses of these xenobiotics early in development is considered to be among important factors contributing to the developmental programming of adult-life diseases in modern societies. In this mini-review, we summarize epidemiological findings indicating that prenatal TM exposure can induce epigenetic dysregulation, thereby potentially affecting adult health outcomes.© The Author(s) 2021.

"34628465","Mechanisms of neuroplasticity linking early adversity to depression: developmental considerations.","Transl Psychiatry","Early exposure to psychosocial adversity is among the most potent predictors of depression. Because depression commonly emerges prior to adulthood, we must consider the fundamental principles of developmental neuroscience when examining how experiences of childhood adversity, including abuse and neglect, can lead to depression. Considering that both the environment and the brain are highly dynamic across the period spanning gestation through adolescence, the purpose of this review is to discuss and integrate stress-based models of depression that center developmental processes. We offer a general framework for understanding how psychosocial adversity in early life disrupts or calibrates the biobehavioral systems implicated in depression. Specifically, we propose that the sources and nature of the environmental input shaping the brain, and the mechanisms of neuroplasticity involved, change across development. We contend that the effects of adversity largely depend on the developmental stage of the organism. First, we summarize leading neurobiological models that focus on the effects of adversity on risk for mental disorders, including depression. In particular, we highlight models of allostatic load, acceleration maturation, dimensions of adversity, and sensitive or critical periods. Second, we expound on and review evidence for the formulation that distinct mechanisms of neuroplasticity are implicated depending on the timing of adverse experiences, and that inherent within certain windows of development are constraints on the sources and nature of these experiences. Finally, we consider other important facets of adverse experiences (e.g., environmental unpredictability, perceptions of one's experiences) before discussing promising research directions for the future of the field.© 2021.

"34616431","A Ferroptosis-Related Prognostic Signature Based on Antitumor Immunity and Tumor Protein p53 Mutation Exploration for Guiding Treatment in Patients With Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma.","Front Genet","Background:Due to the lack of accurate guidance of biomarkers, the treatment of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) has not been ideal. Ferroptosis plays an important role in tumor suppression and treatment of patients. However, tumor protein p53 (TP53) mutation may promote tumor progression through ferroptosis. Therefore, it is particularly important to mine prognostic-related differentially expressed ferroptosis-related genes (PR-DE-FRGs) in HNSCC to construct a prognostic model for accurately guiding clinical treatment.Methods:First, the HNSCC data obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) was used to identify PR-DE-FRGs for screening candidate genes to construct a prognostic model. We not only used a variety of methods to verify the accuracy of the model for predicting prognosis but also explored the role of ferroptosis in the development of HNSCC from the perspective of the immune microenvironment and mutation. Finally, we explored the correlation between the prognostic model and clinical treatment and drew a high-precision nomogram to predict the prognosis.Results:Seventeen of the 29 PR-DE-FRGs were selected to construct a prognostic model with good predictive performance. Patients in the low-risk group were found to have a greater number of CD8 + T cells, follicular helper T cells, regulatory T cells, mast cells, T-cell costimulations, and type II interferon responses. A higher tumor mutation burden (TMB) was observed in the low-risk group and was associated with a better prognosis. A higher risk score was found in the TP53 mutation group and was associated with a worse prognosis. The risk score is closely related to the expression of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs)-related genes such as PD-L1 and the IC50 of six chemotherapeutic drugs. The nomogram we constructed performs well in predicting prognosis.Conclusion:Ferroptosis may participate in the progression of HNSCC through the immune microenvironment and TP53 mutation. The model we built can be used as an effective predictor of immunotherapy and chemotherapy effects and prognosis of HNSCC patients.Copyright © 2021 Fan, Ou, Liu, Zhan, Zhu, Cheng, Li, Yin and Liao."

The multifactorial nature of PD poses a difficult obstacle for understanding the mechanisms involved in its onset and progression. Currently, diagnosis depends on the appearance of clinical signs, some of which are shared among various neurologic disorders, hindering early diagnosis. There are no effective tools to prevent PD onset, detect the disease in early stages or accurately report the risk of disease progression. Hence, there is an increasing demand for biomarkers that may identify disease onset and progression, as treatment-based medicine may not be the best approach for PD. Over the last few decades, the search for molecular markers to predict susceptibility, aid in accurate diagnosis and evaluate the progress of PD have intensified, but strategies aimed to improve individualized patient care have not yet been established.Genomic variation, regulation by epigenomic mechanisms, as well as the influence of the host gut microbiome seem to have a crucial role in the onset and progress of PD, thus are considered potential biomarkers. As such, the human nuclear and mitochondrial genome, epigenome, and the host gut microbiome might be the key elements to the rise of personalized medicine for PD patients."

Specific epigenetic signatures at all levels, including DNA methylation, chromatin accessibility, histone modification, and non-coding RNA, define β cell identity during embryonic development, postnatal maturation, and maintain β cell function at homeostatic states. During progression of T2DM, overnutrition, inflammation, and other types of stress collaboratively disrupt the homeostatic epigenetic signatures in β cells.

However, only a fraction of patients respond well to immunotherapy. Immuno-oncological studies have identified the type of tumors that are sensitive to immunotherapy, the so-called hot tumors, while unresponsive tumors, known as ""cold tumors,"" have the potential to turn into hot ones. Therefore, the mechanisms underlying cold tumor formation must be elucidated, and efforts should be made to turn cold tumors into hot tumors. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA modification affects the maturation and function of immune cells by controlling mRNA immunogenicity and innate immune components in the tumor microenvironment (TME), suggesting its predominant role in the development of tumors and its potential use as a target to improve cancer immunotherapy. In this review, we first describe the TME, cold and hot tumors, and m6A RNA modification. Then, we focus on the role of m6A RNA modification in cold tumor formation and regulation. Finally, we discuss the potential clinical implications and immunotherapeutic approaches of m6A RNA modification in cancer patients. In conclusion, m6A RNA modification is involved in cold tumor formation by regulating immunity, tumor-cell-intrinsic pathways, soluble inhibitory mediators in the TME, increasing metabolic competition, and affecting the tumor mutational burden. Furthermore, m6A RNA modification regulators may potentially be used as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for different types of cancer. In addition, targeting m6A RNA modification may sensitize cancers to immunotherapy, making it a promising immunotherapeutic approach for turning cold tumors into hot ones.Copyright © 2021 Zhan, Zhang, Zhu, Liu, Zhang, Wang, Fan, Sun, Wei and Cao."
"34603017","Small-Molecule Inhibitors Overcome Epigenetic Reprogramming for Cancer Therapy.","Front Pharmacol","Cancer treatment is a significant challenge for the global health system, although various pharmacological and therapeutic discoveries have been made. It has been widely established that cancer is associated with epigenetic modification, which is reversible and becomes an attractive target for drug development. Adding chemical groups to the DNA backbone and modifying histone proteins impart distinct characteristics on chromatin architecture. This process is mediated by various enzymes modifying chromatin structures to achieve the diversity of epigenetic space and the intricacy in gene expression files. After decades of effort, epigenetic modification has represented the hallmarks of different cancer types, and the enzymes involved in this process have provided novel targets for antitumor therapy development. Epigenetic drugs show significant effects on both preclinical and clinical studies in which the target development and research offer a promising direction for cancer therapy. Here, we summarize the different types of epigenetic enzymes which target corresponding protein domains, emphasize DNA methylation, histone modifications, and microRNA-mediated cooperation with epigenetic modification, and highlight recent achievements in developing targets for epigenetic inhibitor therapy.

Studies are showing that the effect of estrogen is important in the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into adipocytes, osteocytes, and chondrocytes. Activation of certain transcription factors and epigenetic modifications in related genes play an active role in the initiation and completion of adipogenic differentiation. Understanding the role of estrogen in diseases such as obesity, which increases with the onset of menopause, will pave the way for more effective use of estrogen as a therapeutic option. Demonstration of the differentiation tendencies of MSCs change in the presence/absence of estrogen, especially the evaluation of reversible epigenetic changes, will provide valuable information for clinical applications. In this study, the effect of estrogen on the expression of genes involved in adipogenic differentiation of MSCs and accompanying epigenetic modifications was investigated. Our results showed that estrogen affects the expression of adipogenesis-related transcription factors such as PPARy, C/EBPα and Adipsin. In addition, after estrogen treatment, increased accumulation of estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) and repressive epigenetic markers such as H3K27me2 and H3K27me3 were observed on the promoter of given transcription factors. By using co-immunoprecipitation experiments we were also able to show that ERα physically interacts with the zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) H3K27 methyltransferase in MSCs. We propose that the increase of H3K27me2 and H3K27me3 markers on adipogenic genes upon estrogen treatment may be mediated by the direct interaction of ERα and EZH2. Taken together, these findings suggest that estrogen has a role as an epigenetic switcher in the regulation of H3K27 methylation leading to suppression of adipogenic differentiation of MSC.© 2021 Bitirim et al."

Due to its proximity to the coronary arteries and myocardium, dysfunctional EAT may contribute to the development and progression of cardiovascular and metabolic-related adiposity-based chronic diseases. The aim of this work was to describe, by morphological techniques, the early origin of EAT.Methods:EAT adipogenesis was studied in 41 embryos from 32 gestational days (GD) to 8 gestational weeks (GW) and in 23 fetuses until full term (from 9 to 36 GW).Results:This process comprises five stages. Stage 1 appears as mesenchyme at 33-35 GD. Stage 2 is characterized by angiogenesis at 42-45 GD. Stage 3 covers up to 34 GW with the appearance of small fibers in the extracellular matrix. Stage 4 is visible around the coronary arteries, as multilocular adipocytes in primitive fat lobules, and Stage 5 is present with unilocular adipocytes in the definitive fat lobules. EAT precursor tissue appears as early as the end of the first gestational month in the atrioventricular grooves. Unilocular adipocytes appear at the eighth gestational month.Conclusions:Due to its early origin, plasticity and clinical implications, factors such as maternal health and nutrition might influence EAT early development in consequence."

However, the non-invasive biomarkers for GC detection remain to be identified.We used online databases (GEPIA, UALCAN, Kaplan-Meier plotter, TIMER, and MEXPRESS) to explore the association between H19 or metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1) expression in tissues and the occurrence, development, prognosis, the levels of immune cell infiltration, and methylation of GC; the correlation between mRNA expression and DNA methylation levels of genes were also examined. Methylation levels of H19 or MALAT1 in peripheral blood were compared between 150 GC patients and 100 healthy controls (HCs). Predictive nomograms were constructed among female and male groups for GC diagnosis. The calibration curves, Hosmer-Lemeshow test, and decision curve analysis were also used to examine the nomograms' predictive ability and clinical values.Using multiple online databases, we found that the mRNA expressions of H19 and MALAT1 in tissues were related to the occurrence of GC, and such expressions were associated with immune cell infiltration of GC and negatively correlated with DNA methylation levels of H19 and MALAT1. H19 gene, H19C island, and MALAT1B island, as well as 20 CpG sites were hypermethylated in peripheral blood of GC patients compared with HCs; similar results were also found in female and male groups (P< .05 for all). The combination of H19c3, H19c4, MALAT1b12, and age, as well as the combination of H19b7, H19c1, H19c5, and age in the nomograms could distinguish GC patients from HCs in the female group and male group, respectively.We found statistically significant hypermethylation of H19 and MALAT1 promoters in GC patients, and meaningful sensitivity and specificity of MALAT1 and H19 methylation in discriminating GC and HCs were observed in both female and male groups, which indicates that the peripheral blood-based DNA methylation of H19 and MALAT1 could act as potential non-invasive biomarkers for the diagnosis of GC."

The role of epigenetic regulations in the immune cells is emerging and we have previously shown that macrophages capacity to kill M. tuberculosis is reflected in the DNA methylome. The aim of this study was to investigate epigenetic modifications in alveolar macrophages and T cells in a cohort of medical students with an increased risk of TB exposure, longitudinally. DNA methylome analysis revealed that a unique DNA methylation profile was present in healthy subjects who later developed latent TB during the study. The profile was reflected in a different overall DNA methylation distribution as well as a distinct set of differentially methylated genes (DMGs). The DMGs were over-represented in pathways related to metabolic reprogramming of macrophages and T cell migration and IFN-γ production, pathways previously reported important in TB control. In conclusion, we identified a unique DNA methylation signature in individuals, with no peripheral immune response to M. tuberculosis antigen who later developed latent TB. Together the study suggests that the DNA methylation status of pulmonary immune cells can reveal who will develop latent TB infection.© 2021. The Author(s)."
"34635648","Homeostatic membrane tension constrains cancer cell dissemination by counteracting BAR protein assembly.","Nat Commun","Malignancy is associated with changes in cell mechanics that contribute to extensive cell deformation required for metastatic dissemination. We hypothesized that the cell-intrinsic physical factors that maintain epithelial cell mechanics could function as tumor suppressors. Here we show, using optical tweezers, genetic interference, mechanical perturbations, and in vivo studies, that epithelial cells maintain higher plasma membrane (PM) tension than their metastatic counterparts and that high PM tension potently inhibits cancer cell migration and invasion by counteracting membrane curvature sensing/generating BAR family proteins. This tensional homeostasis is achieved by membrane-to-cortex attachment (MCA) regulated by ERM proteins, whose disruption spontaneously transforms epithelial cells into a mesenchymal migratory phenotype powered by BAR proteins. Consistently, the forced expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-inducing transcription factors results in decreased PM tension. In metastatic cells, increasing PM tension by manipulating MCA is sufficient to suppress both mesenchymal and amoeboid 3D migration, tumor invasion, and metastasis by compromising membrane-mediated mechanosignaling by BAR proteins, thereby uncovering a previously undescribed mechanical tumor suppressor mechanism.© 2021.

Chromatin licensing and DNA replication factor 1 (CDT1) is an important regulator of DNA replication licensing, which is essential for initiation of DNA replication. CDT1 overexpression in several human cancers reportedly leads to abnormal cell replication, activates DNA damage checkpoints, and predisposes malignant transformation. However, the abnormal expression of CDT1 in HCC and its diagnostic and prognostic value remains to be elucidated.TCGA, ONCOMINE, UALCAN, HCCDB, HPA, Kaplan-Meier plotter, STRING, GEPIA, GeneMANIA, and TIMER were conducted for bioinformatics analysis. CDT1 protein expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in HCC tissues through a tissue microarray. qRT-PCR, western blot and a cohort of functional experiments were performed forin vitrovalidation.In this study, we discovered remarkably upregulated transcription of CDT1 in HCC samples relative to normal liver samples through bioinformatic analysis, which was further verified in clinical tissue microarray samples andin vitroexperiments. Moreover, the transcriptional level of CDT1 in HCC samples was positively associated with clinical parameters such as clinical tumor stage. Survival, logistic regression, and Cox regression analyses revealed the significant clinical prognostic value of CDT1 expression in HCC. The receiver operating characteristic curve and nomogram analysis results demonstrated the strong predictive ability of CDT1 in HCC. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes and gene set enrichment analyses indicated that CDT1 was mainly associated with the cell cycle, DNA repair, and DNA replication. We further demonstrated the significant correlation between CDT1 and minichromosome maintenance (MCM) family genes, revealing abnormal expression and prognostic significance of MCMs in HCC. Immune infiltration analysis indicated that CDT1 was significantly associated with immune cell subsets and affected the survival of HCC patients. Finally, knockdown of CDT1 decreased, whereas overexpression of CDT1 promoted the proliferation, migration, invasion of HCC cellsin vitro.Our study findings demonstrate the potential diagnostic and prognostic significance of CDT1 expression in HCC, and elucidate the potential molecular mechanism underlying its role in promoting the occurrence and development of liver cancer.

Nonetheless, DNA-based biomarkers for the immune-sensitive TME and the identification of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) responders are under-explored. This study aims to comprehensively landscape the homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) score, an emerging hallmark for tumor genome instability that triggers immune responsiveness across major cancer types, and to unveil their link to the TME and immunotherapeutic response. The HRD-associated genomic scars were characterized in 9088 tumor samples across 32 cancer types from TCGA. We evaluated the HRD score's performance in classifying ICI responders using an independent breast cancer cohort (GSE87049) and 11 in vivo murine mammary tumor models treated with anti-PD1/CTLA4 regimen (GSE124821). This study revealed a broad association between HRD-high genotype and neoantigenesis in the major cancer types including bladder cancer, breast cancer, head and neck squamous carcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma, ovarian cancer, and sarcoma. Tumors with high HRD score bears increased leukocyte infiltration and lymphocyte fraction and demonstrated immune-sensitive microenvironment. The tumor immune dysfunction and exclusion (TIDE) model further confirmed HRD score-high genotype as a potential predictor for ICI immunotherapy responders in breast cancer. In conclusion, tumors with high HRD score exhibit an immune-sensitive TME. The HRD-high genotype is a promising marker for identifying ICI therapy responders among breast cancer patients.© 2021.

"34621686","Constitutive TRIM22 Expression in the Respiratory Tract Confers a Pre-Existing Defence Against Influenza A Virus Infection.","Front Cell Infect Microbiol","The induction of antiviral effector proteins as part of a homeostatically controlled innate immune response to infection plays a critical role in limiting the propagation and transmission of respiratory pathogens. However, the prolonged induction of this immune response can lead to lung hyperinflammation, tissue damage, and respiratory failure. We hypothesized that tissues exposed to the constant threat of infection may constitutively express higher levels of antiviral effector proteins to reduce the need to activate potentially harmful innate immune defences. By analysing transcriptomic data derived from a range of human tissues, we identify lung tissue to express constitutively higher levels of antiviral effector genes relative to that of other mucosal and non-mucosal tissues. By using primary cell lines and the airways of rhesus macaques, we show the interferon-stimulated antiviral effector protein TRIM22 (TRIpartite Motif 22) to be constitutively expressed in the lung independently of viral infection or innate immune stimulation. These findings contrast with previous reports that have shown TRIM22 expression in laboratory-adapted cell lines to require interferon stimulation. We demonstrate that constitutive levels of TRIM22 are sufficient to inhibit the onset of human and avian influenza A virus (IAV) infection by restricting the onset of viral transcription independently of interferon-mediated innate immune defences. Thus, we identify TRIM22 to confer a pre-existing (intrinsic) intracellular defence against IAV infection in cells derived from the respiratory tract. Our data highlight the importance of tissue-specific and cell-type dependent patterns of pre-existing immune gene expression in the intracellular restriction of IAV from the outset of infection.Copyright © 2021 Charman, McFarlane, Wojtus, Sloan, Dewar, Leeming, Al-Saadi, Hunter, Carroll, Stewart, Digard, Hutchinson and Boutell."

"34608266","RNA binding protein RBMS3 is a common EMT effector that modulates triple-negative breast cancer progression via stabilizing PRRX1 mRNA.","Oncogene","The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been recognized as a driving force for tumor progression in breast cancer. Recently, our group identified the RNA Binding Motif Single Stranded Interacting Protein 3 (RBMS3) to be significantly associated with an EMT transcriptional program in breast cancer. Additional expression profiling demonstrated that RBMS3 was consistently upregulated by multiple EMT transcription factors and correlated with mesenchymal gene expression in breast cancer cell lines. Functionally, RBMS3 was sufficient to induce EMT in two immortalized mammary epithelial cell lines. In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) models, RBMS3 was necessary for maintaining the mesenchymal phenotype and invasion and migration in vitro. Loss of RBMS3 significantly impaired both tumor progression and spontaneous metastasis in vivo. Using a genome-wide approach to interrogate mRNA stability, we found that ectopic expression of RBMS3 upregulates many genes that are resistant to degradation following transcriptional blockade by actinomycin D (ACTD). Specifically, RBMS3 was shown to interact with the mRNA of EMT transcription factor PRRX1 and promote PRRX1 mRNA stability. PRRX1 is required for RBMS3-mediated EMT and is partially sufficient to rescue the effect of RBMS3 knockdown in TNBC cell lines. Together, this study identifies RBMS3 as a novel and common effector of EMT, which could be a promising therapeutic target for TNBC treatment.© 2021.

However, the intrinsic complexity and continuous growth of biomedical data makes it increasingly difficult to process, analyze, and share with the community in a FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable) manner. To overcome these issues, we created a cloud-based platform called ORCESTRA ( orcestra.ca ), which provides a flexible framework for the reproducible processing of multimodal biomedical data. It enables processing of clinical, genomic and perturbation profiles of cancer samples through automated processing pipelines that are user-customizable. ORCESTRA creates integrated and fully documented data objects with persistent identifiers (DOI) and manages multiple dataset versions, which can be shared for future studies.© 2021. The Author(s)."
"34604945","Atypical cyclin P regulates cancer cell stemness through activation of the WNT pathway.","Cell Oncol (Dordr)","Cancer stem cells represent a cancer cell subpopulation that has been found to be associated with metastasis and chemoresistance. Therefore, it is vital to identify mechanisms regulating cancer stemness. Previously, we have shown that the atypical cyclin P (CCNP), also known as CNTD2, is upregulated in lung and colorectal cancers and is associated with a worse clinical prognosis. Given that other cyclins have been implicated in pluripotency regulation, we hypothesized that CCNP may also play a role in cancer stemness.Cell line-derived spheroids, ex vivo intestinal organoid cultures and induced-pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) were used to investigate the role of CCNP in stemness. The effects of CCNP on cancer cell stemness and the expression of pluripotency markers and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters were evaluated using Western blotting and RT-qPCR assays. Cell viability was assessed using a MTT assay. The effects of CCNP on WNT targets were monitored by RNA-seq analysis. Data from publicly available web-based resources were also analyzed.We found that CCNP increases spheroid formation in breast, lung and colorectal cancers, and upregulates the expression of stemness (CD44, CD133) and pluripotency (SOX2, OCT4, NANOG) markers. In addition, we found that CCNP promotes resistance to anticancer drugs and induces the expression of multidrug resistance ABC transporters. Our RNA-seq data indicate that CCNP activates the WNT pathway, and that inhibition of this pathway abrogates the increase in spheroid formation promoted by CCNP. Finally, we found that CCNP knockout decreases OCT4 expression in iPSCs, further supporting the notion that CCNP is involved in stemness regulation.Our results reveal CCNP as a novel player in stemness and as a potential therapeutic target in cancer.© 2021.

Nevertheless, the possible role ofAGTRAPin hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unrecognized.The metabolic gene rapid visualizer, Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia, Human Protein Atlas, and Hepatocellular Carcinoma Database were used to analyze the expression ofAGTRAPin HCC tissues and normal liver tissues or adjacent tissues. Kaplan-Meier plotter and UALCAN analysis were used to assess the prognostic and diagnostic value ofAGTRAP.LinkedOmics and cBioPortal were used to explore the genes co-expressed withAGTRAPin HCC. To further understand the potential mechanism ofAGTRAPin HCC, Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment pathway analyses were performed usingRsoftware, the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was established using the STRING database, and the immune infiltration and T-cell exhaustion related toAGTRAPwere exploredviaTimer and GEPIA. In addition, immunohistochemistry was used to detect the expression of AGTRAP protein in HCC tissues and paired adjacent tissues from clinical specimens.This study found that the mRNA and protein levels of AGTRAP in HCC tissues were higher than those in normal liver tissues and adjacent tissues, and higher mRNA levels ofAGTRAPwere associated with higher histological grade and a poor overall survival in HCC patients. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) ofAGTRAPwas 0.856, suggesting that it could be a diagnostic marker for HCC. Moreover, the alteration rate ofAGTRAPin HCC was 8%, andAGTRAPwas involved in HCC probably through the NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways. Furthermore,AGTRAPwas positively correlated with the infiltration of CD8+T cells, CD4+T cells, B cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, and neutrophils, and the levels ofAGTRAPwere significantly correlated with T-cell exhaustion biomarkers. The immunohistochemistry results confirmed that the protein levels of AGTRAP were consistently higher in HCC tissues than in paired adjacent tissues.The clinical value ofAGTRAPand its correlation with immune infiltration in HCC was effectively identified in clinical data from multiple recognized databases. These findings indicate thatAGTRAPcould serve as a potential biomarker in the treatment of HCC, thereby informing its prognosis, diagnosis, and even immunotherapy.Copyright © 2021 Liu, Zhao, Li, Zhang, Gao, Peng, Du and Jiang."
"34589115","Identification of Prognostic Biomarker Candidates Associated With Melanoma Using High-Dimensional Genomic Data.","Front Genet","Survival of patients with metastatic melanoma varies widely. Melanoma is a highly proliferative, chemo-resistant disease. With the recent availability of immunotherapies such as checkpoint inhibitors, durable response rates have improved but are often still limited to 2-3 years. Response rates to treatment range from 30 to 45% with combination therapy however no improvement in overall survival is frequently observed. Of the available therapies, many have targeted the BRAFV600E mutation that results in abnormal MAPK pathway activation which is important for regulating cell proliferation. Immune checkpoint inhibitors such as anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 offer better success but response rates are still low. Identifying biomarkers to better target those who will respond and identify the right combination of treatment is the best approach. In this study, we utilize data from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE), including 62 samples, to examine features of gene expression (19K+) and copy number (20K+) in the melanoma cell lines. We perform a clustering analysis on the feature set to assess genetically similarity among the cell lines. We then discover which specific genes and combinations thereof maximize cluster density. We design a feature selection approach for high-dimensional datasets that integrates multiple disparate machine learning techniques into one cohesive pipeline. Our approach provides a small subset of genes that can accurately distinguish between the clusters of melanoma cell lines across multiple types of classifiers. In particular, we find only the 15 highest ranked genes among the original 19 K are necessary to achieve perfect or near-perfect test split classification performance. Of these 15 genes, some are known to be linked to melanoma or other cancer progressions, while others have not previously been linked to melanoma and are of interest for further examination.Copyright © 2021 Kutt, Burdorf, Bain, Cameron, Pearah, Subasi, Carroll, Moore and Subasi."

Large collections of expression signatures provide the basis for their application to data sets, but the applicability of each signature in a new experimental context must be reassessed. We apply a methodology that utilizes the previously developed concept of coherent expression of genes in signatures to identify translatable signatures before scoring their activity in single tumors. We present a web interface (www.rosettasx.com) that applies our methodology to expression data from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopaedia and The Cancer Genome Atlas. Configurable heat maps visualize per-cancer signature scores for 293 hand-curated literature-derived gene sets representing a wide range of cancer-relevant transcriptional modules and phenomena. The platform allows users to complement heatmaps of signature scores with molecular information on SNVs, CNVs, gene expression, gene dependency, and protein abundance or to analyze own signatures.

In addition, the role of ancestry is frequently discussed. In preclinical studies, high-throughput drug screens in cancer cell lines have empowered the identification of clinically relevant molecular biomarkers of drug sensitivity; however, the genetic ancestry from tissue donors has been largely neglected in this setting. In order to address this, here, we show that the inferred ancestry of cancer cell lines is conserved and may impact drug response in patients as a predictive covariate in high-throughput drug screens. We found that there are differential drug responses between European and East Asian ancestries, especially when treated with PI3K/mTOR inhibitors. Our finding emphasizes a new angle in precision medicine, as cancer intervention strategies should consider the germline landscape, thereby reducing the failure rate of clinical trials."
"34575074","Identification of Immune Function-Related Subtypes in Cutaneous Melanoma.","Life (Basel)","Tumour immunotherapy combined with molecular typing is a new therapy to help select patients. However, molecular typing algorithms related to tumour immune function have not been thoroughly explored. We herein proposed a single sample immune signature network (SING) method to identify new immune function-related subtypes of cutaneous melanoma of the skin. A sample-specific network and tumour microenvironment were constructed based on the immune annotation of cutaneous melanoma samples. Then, the differences and heterogeneity of immune function among different subtypes were analysed and verified. A total of 327 cases of cutaneous melanoma were divided into normal and immune classes; the immune class had more immune enrichment characteristics. After further subdividing the 327 cases into three immune-related subtypes, the degree of immune enrichment in the ""high immune subtype"" was greater than that in other subtypes. Similar results were validated in both tumour samples and cell lines. Sample-specific networks and the tumour microenvironment based on immune annotation contribute to the mining of cutaneous melanoma immune function-related subtypes. Mutations inB2MandPTENare considered potential therapeutic targets that can improve the immune response. Patients with a high immune subtype can generally obtain a better immune prognosis effect, and the prognosis may be improved when combined with TGF-β inhibitors."

Here, we review the current knowledge about the biochemistry, cellular function and role of NSD1 in human diseases. Several studies have shown that NSD1 controls gene expression by methylation of lysine 36 of histone 3 (H3K36me1/2) in a complex crosstalk with de novo DNA methylation. Inactivation in flies and mice revealed that NSD1 is essential for normal development and that it regulates multiple cell type-specific functions by interfering with transcriptional master regulators. In humans, putative loss of function NSD1 mutations characterize developmental syndromes, such as SOTOS, as well as cancer from different organs. In pediatric hematological malignancies, a recurrent chromosomal translocation forms a NUP98-NSD1 fusion with SET-dependent leukemogenic activity, which seems targetable by small molecule inhibitors. To treat or prevent diseases driven by aberrant NSD1 activity, future research will need to pinpoint the mechanistic correlation between the NSD1 gene dosage and/or mutational status with development, homeostasis, and malignant transformation."

MicroRNAs have emerged as promising predictive biomarkers to therapeutic treatments as their expression might characterize the tumor stage or grade. In EOC, miR-200c is considered a master regulator of oncogenes or tumor suppressors. To investigate novel miR-200c-3p target genes involved in EOC tumorigenesis, we evaluated the association between this miRNA and the mRNA expression of several potential target genes by RNA-seq data of both 46 EOC cell lines from Cancer Cell line Encyclopedia (CCLE) and 456 EOC patient bio-specimens from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Both analyses showed a significant anticorrelation between miR-200c-3p and the protein phosphatase 3 catalytic subunit γ of calcineurin (PPP3CC) levels involved in the apoptosis pathway. Quantitative mRNA expression analysis in patient biopsies confirmed the inverse correlation between miR-200c-3p and PPP3CC levels. In vitro regulation of PPP3CC expression through miR-200c-3p and RNA interference technology led to a concomitant modulation of BCL2- and p-AKT-related pathways, suggesting the tumor suppressive role of PPP3CC in EOC. Our results suggest that inhibition of high expression of miR-200c-3p in EOC might lead to overexpression of the tumor suppressor PPP3CC and subsequent induction of apoptosis in EOC patients."

Concomitant loss of these key subunits of SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes in both cancers is associated with chemotherapy resistance and poor prognosis. Here, we discover that SMARCA4/2 loss inhibits chemotherapy-induced apoptosis through disrupting intracellular organelle calcium ion (Ca2+) release in these cancers. By restricting chromatin accessibility to ITPR3, encoding Ca2+channel IP3R3, SMARCA4/2 deficiency causes reduced IP3R3 expression leading to impaired Ca2+transfer from the endoplasmic reticulum to mitochondria required for apoptosis induction. Reactivation of SMARCA2 by a histone deacetylase inhibitor rescues IP3R3 expression and enhances cisplatin response in SMARCA4/2-deficient cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. Our findings elucidate the contribution of SMARCA4/2 to Ca2+-dependent apoptosis induction, which may be exploited to enhance chemotherapy response in SMARCA4/2-deficient cancers.© 2021.

In cancer, enhancer variation has been proposed as a major cause of inter-patient heterogeneity-however, most predicted enhancer regions remain to be functionally tested.We analyzed 132 epigenomic histone modification profiles of 18 primary gastric cancer (GC) samples, 18 normal gastric tissues, and 28 GC cell lines using Nano-ChIP-seq technology. We applied Capture-based Self-Transcribing Active Regulatory Region sequencing (CapSTARR-seq) to assess functional enhancer activity. An Activity-by-contact (ABC) model was employed to explore the effects of histone acetylation and CapSTARR-seq levels on enhancer-promoter interactions.We report a comprehensive catalog of 75,730 recurrent predicted enhancers, the majority of which are GC-associated in vivo (> 50,000) and associated with lower somatic mutation rates inferred by whole-genome sequencing. Applying CapSTARR-seq to the enhancer catalog, we observed significant correlations between CapSTARR-seq functional activity and H3K27ac/H3K4me1 levels. Super-enhancer regions exhibited increased CapSTARR-seq signals compared to regular enhancers, even when decoupled from native chromatin contexture. We show that combining histone modification and CapSTARR-seq functional enhancer data improves the prediction of enhancer-promoter interactions and pinpointing of germline single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs), and trans-acting TFs involved in GC expression. We identified cancer-relevant genes (ING1, ARL4C) whose expression between patients is influenced by enhancer differences in genomic copy number and germline SNPs, and HNF4α as a master trans-acting factor associated with GC enhancer heterogeneity.Our results indicate that combining histone modification and functional assay data may provide a more accurate metric to assess enhancer activity than either platform individually, providing insights into the relative contribution of genetic (cis) and regulatory (trans) mechanisms to GC enhancer functional heterogeneity.© 2021.

In this study, we explored the potential role of RNA m6A modification in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease (AD).We investigated the m6A modification and the expression of m6A regulators in the brain tissues of AD patients and determined the impact and underlying mechanism of manipulated expression of m6A levels on AD-related deficits both in vitro and in vivo.We found decreased neuronal m6A levels along with significantly reduced expression of m6A methyltransferase like 3 (METTL3) in AD brains. Interestingly, reduced neuronal m6A modification in the hippocampus caused by METTL3 knockdown led to significant memory deficits, accompanied by extensive synaptic loss and neuronal death along with multiple AD-related cellular alterations including oxidative stress and aberrant cell cycle events in vivo. Inhibition of oxidative stress or cell cycle alleviated shMettl3-induced apoptotic activation and neuronal damage in primary neurons. Restored m6A modification by inhibiting its demethylation in vitro rescued abnormal cell cycle events, neuronal deficits and death induced by METTL3 knockdown. Soluble Aβ oligomers caused reduced METTL3 expression and METTL3 knockdown exacerbated while METTL3 overexpression rescued Aβ-induced synaptic PSD95 loss in vitro. Importantly, METTL3 overexpression rescued Aβ-induced synaptic damage and cognitive impairment in vivo.Collectively, these data suggested that METTL3 reduction-mediated m6A dysregulation likely contributes to neurodegeneration in AD which may be a therapeutic target for AD.© 2021.

The poor knowledge of population age structure in crustaceans therefore hampers accurate assessment of population dynamics and consequently sustainable fisheries management. Quantification of DNA methylation of the evolutionarily conserved ribosomal DNA (rDNA) may allow for age prediction across diverse species. However, the rDNA epigenetic clock remains to be tested in crustaceans, despite its potential to inform both ecological and evolutionary understanding, as well as conservation and management practices. Here, patterns of rDNA methylation with age were measured across 5154 bp of rDNA corresponding to 355 quality-filtered loci in the economically important European lobster (Homarus gammarus). Across 0- to 51-month-old lobsters (n = 155), there was a significant linear relationship between age and percentage rDNA methylation in claw tissue at 60% of quality-filtered loci (n = 214). An Elastic Net regression model using 46 loci allowed for the accurate and precise age estimation of individuals (R2 = 0.98; standard deviation = 1.6 months). Applying this ageing model to antennal DNA from wild lobsters of unknown age (n = 38) resulted in predicted ages that are concordant with estimates of minimum size at age in the wild (mean estimated age = 40.1 months; range 32.8-55.7 months). Overall, the rDNA epigenetic clock shows potential as a novel, nonlethal ageing technique for European lobsters. However, further validation is required across a wider range of known-age individuals and tissue types before the model can be used in fisheries management.© 2021 The Authors.

Accumulating evidence suggests that nutrition interacts with our genes and that there is a strong association between the quality of diet and mental health throughout life. Environmental influences such as maternal diet during pregnancy or offspring diet have been shown to cause epigenetic changes during critical periods of development, such as chemical modifications of DNA or histones by methylation for the regulation of gene expression. One-carbon metabolism, which consists of the folate and methionine cycles, is influenced by the diet and generates S-Adenosylmethinoine (SAM), the main methyl donor for methylation reactions such as DNA and histone methylation. This review provides current knowledge on how the levels of one-carbon metabolism associated micronutrients such as choline, betaine, folate, methionine and B vitamins that play a role in brain function can impact our well-being and mental health across the lifespan. Micronutrients that act as methyl donors for SAM formation could affect global or gene methylation, altering gene expression and phenotype. Strategies should then be adopted to better understand how these nutrients work and their impact at different stages of development to provide individualized dietary recommendations for better mental health outcomes."

In recent years, this has been centered in the single-cell space with a catalog of tagmentation-based assays that have been developed, covering a substantial swath of the regulatory landscape. To date, there have been a number of excellent reviews on single-cell technologies structured around the molecular properties that can be profiled.

"34579089","A Maternal High-Fat Diet during Early Development Provokes Molecular Changes Related to Autism Spectrum Disorder in the Rat Offspring Brain.","Nutrients","Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a disruptive neurodevelopmental disorder manifested by abnormal social interactions, communication, emotional circuits, and repetitive behaviors and is more often diagnosed in boys than in girls. It is postulated that ASD is caused by a complex interaction between genetic and environmental factors. Epigenetics provides a mechanistic link between exposure to an unbalanced maternal diet and persistent modifications in gene expression levels that can lead to phenotype changes in the offspring. To better understand the impact of the early development environment on the risk of ASD in offspring, we assessed the effect of maternal high-fat (HFD), high-carbohydrate, and mixed diets on molecular changes in adolescent and young adult offspring frontal cortex and hippocampus. Our results showed that maternal HFD significantly altered the expression of 48 ASD-related genes in the frontal cortex of male offspring. Moreover, exposure to maternal HFD led to sex- and age-dependent changes in the protein levels of ANKRD11, EIF4E, NF1, SETD1B, SHANK1 and TAOK2, as well as differences in DNA methylation levels in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of the offspring. Taken together, it was concluded that a maternal HFD during pregnancy and lactation periods can lead to abnormal brain development within the transcription and translation of ASD-related genes mainly in male offspring."
"34575826","Alteration of the Early Development Environment by Maternal Diet and the Occurrence of Autistic-like Phenotypes in Rat Offspring.","Int J Mol Sci","Epidemiological and preclinical studies suggest that maternal obesity increases the risk of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in offspring. Here, we assessed the effects of exposure to modified maternal diets limited to pregnancy and lactation on brain development and behavior in rat offspring of both sexes. Among the studied diets, a maternal high-fat diet (HFD) disturbed the expression of ASD-related genes (Cacna1d,Nlgn3, andShank1) and proteins (SHANK1 and TAOK2) in the prefrontal cortex of male offspring during adolescence. In addition, a maternal high-fat diet induced epigenetic changes by increasing cortical global DNA methylation and the expression of miR-423 and miR-494. As well as the molecular changes, behavioral studies have shown male-specific disturbances in social interaction and an increase in repetitive behavior during adolescence. Most of the observed changes disappeared in adulthood. In conclusion, we demonstrated the contribution of a maternal HFD to the predisposition to an ASD-like phenotype in male adolescent offspring, while a protective effect occurred in females."

Although higher age is a major risk factor for disease severity in COVID-19, several predisposing risk factors for mortality are related to low cardiorespiratory and metabolic fitness, including obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and hypertension. Reaching physical activity (PA) guideline goals contribute to protect against numerous immune and inflammatory disorders, in addition to multi-morbidities and mortality. Elevated levels of cardiorespiratory fitness, being non-obese, and regular PA improves immunological function, mitigating sustained low-grade systemic inflammation and age-related deterioration of the immune system, or immunosenescence. Regular PA and being non-obese also improve the antibody response to vaccination. In this review, we highlight potential physiological, cellular, and molecular mechanisms that are affected by regular PA, increase the host antiviral defense, and may determine the course and outcome of COVID-19. Not only are the immune system and regular PA in relation to COVID-19 discussed, but also the cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, and hormonal systems, as well as skeletal muscle, epigenetics, and mitochondrial function."

The DNA methyltransferase 3B (DNMT3B) enhances promoter activity and methylation of tumor suppressor genes. Tea polyphenols may inhibit DNMT activity. We designed a case-control study to evaluate the combined effects of smoking, green tea consumption, DNMT3B - 149 polymorphism, and DNA damage on lung cancer occurrence.Questionnaires were administered to obtain demographic characteristics, life styles, and family histories of lung cancer from 190 primary lung cancer cases and 380 healthy controls. Genotypes and cellular DNA damage were determined by polymerase chain reaction and comet assay, respectively.The mean DNA tail moment for lung cancer cases was significantly higher than that for healthy controls. Compared to nonsmokers carrying the DNMT3B - 149 CT genotype, smokers carrying the TT genotype had a greater lung cancer risk (odds ratio [OR]: 2.83, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.62-4.93). DNA damage levels were divided by the tertile of the healthy controls' values. Compared to nonsmokers with low DNA damage, smokers with moderate DNA damage (OR: 2.37, 95% CI: 1.54-3.63) and smokers with high DNA damage (OR: 3.97, 95% CI: 2.63-5.98) had elevated lung cancer risks. Interaction between smoking and DNA damage significantly affected lung cancer risk.Our study suggested that the DNMT3B - 149 TT genotype, which has higher promoter activity, can increase the lung cancer risk elicited by smoking, and DNA damage may further promote smoking related lung cancer development.© 2021.

Despite ongoing conservation efforts, genetic data on this species remains scarce. Complicating factors include limitations on sample collection and a lack of high-quality reference sequences. Here, we used nanopore adaptive sampling to resequence the L. rosalia mitogenome from feces, a sample which can be collected non-invasively.Adaptive sampling doubled the fraction of both host-derived and mitochondrial sequences compared to sequencing without enrichment. 258x coverage of the L. rosalia mitogenome was achieved in a single flow cell by targeting the unfinished genome of the distantly related emperor tamarin (Saguinus imperator) and the mitogenome of the closely related black lion tamarin (Leontopithecus chrysopygus). The L. rosalia mitogenome has a length of 16,597 bp, sharing 99.68% sequence identity with the L. chrysopygus mitogenome. A total of 38 SNPs between them were identified, with the majority being found in the non-coding D-loop region. DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation were directly detected using a neural network model applied to the raw signal from the MinION sequencer. In contrast to prior reports, DNA methylation was negligible in mitochondria in both CpG and non-CpG contexts. Surprisingly, a quarter of the 642 CpG sites exhibited DNA hydroxymethylation greater than 1% and 44 sites were above 5%, with concentration in the 3' side of several coding regions.Overall, we report a robust new mitogenome assembly for L. rosalia and direct detection of cytosine base modifications in all contexts.© 2021.

"34615865","Calibrated rare variant genetic risk scores for complex disease prediction using large exome sequence repositories.","Nat Commun","Rare variants are collectively numerous and may underlie a considerable proportion of complex disease risk. However, identifying genuine rare variant associations is challenging due to small effect sizes, presence of technical artefacts, and heterogeneity in population structure. We hypothesize that rare variant burden over a large number of genes can be combined into a predictive rare variant genetic risk score (RVGRS). We propose a method (RV-EXCALIBER) that leverages summary-level data from a large public exome sequencing database (gnomAD) as controls and robustly calibrates rare variant burden to account for the aforementioned biases. A calibrated RVGRS strongly associates with coronary artery disease (CAD) in European and South Asian populations by capturing the aggregate effect of rare variants through a polygenic model of inheritance. The RVGRS identifies 1.5% of the population with substantial risk of early CAD and confers risk even when adjusting for known Mendelian CAD genes, clinical risk factors, and a common variant genetic risk score.© 2021.

"34603492","Meta-analysis: Congruence of genomic and phenotypic differentiation across diverse natural study systems.","Evol Appl","Linking genotype to phenotype is a primary goal for understanding the genomic underpinnings of evolution. However, little work has explored whether patterns of linked genomic and phenotypic differentiation are congruent across natural study systems and traits. Here, we investigate such patterns with a meta-analysis of studies examining population-level differentiation at subsets of loci and traits putatively responding to divergent selection. We show that across the 31 studies (88 natural population-level comparisons) we examined, there was a moderate (R2 = 0.39) relationship between genomic differentiation (FST) and phenotypic differentiation (PST) for loci and traits putatively under selection. This quantitative relationship betweenPSTandFSTfor loci under selection in diverse taxa provides broad context and cross-system predictions for genomic and phenotypic adaptation by natural selection in natural populations. This context may eventually allow for more precise ideas of what constitutes ""strong"" differentiation, predictions about the effect size of loci, comparisons of taxa evolving in nonparallel ways, and more. On the other hand, links betweenPSTandFSTwithin studies were very weak, suggesting that much work remains in linking genomic differentiation to phenotypic differentiation atspecificphenotypes. We suggest that linking genotypes to specific phenotypes can be improved by correlating genomic and phenotypic differentiation across a spectrum of diverging populations within a taxon and including wide coverage of both genomes and phenomes.© 2021 The Authors.

"34589118","The Effect of Population Structure on Murine Genome-Wide Association Studies.","Front Genet","The ability to use genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for genetic discovery depends upon our ability to distinguish true causative from false positive association signals. Population structure (PS) has been shown to cause false positive signals in GWAS. PS correction is routinely used for analysis of human GWAS results, and it has been assumed that it also should be utilized for murine GWAS using inbred strains. Nevertheless, there are fundamental differences between murine and human GWAS, and the impact of PS on murine GWAS results has not been carefully investigated. To assess the impact of PS on murine GWAS, we examined 8223 datasets that characterized biomedical responses in panels of inbred mouse strains. Rather than treat PS as a confounding variable, we examined it as a response variable. Surprisingly, we found that PS had a minimal impact on datasets measuring responses in ≤20 strains; and had surprisingly little impact on most datasets characterizing 21 - 40 inbred strains. Moreover, we show that true positive association signals arising from haplotype blocks, SNPs or indels, which were experimentally demonstrated to be causative for trait differences, would be rejected if PS correction were applied to them. Our results indicate because of the special conditions created by GWAS (the use of inbred strains, small sample sizes) PS assessment results should be carefully evaluated in conjunction with other criteria, when murine GWAS results are evaluated.Copyright © 2021 Wang, Fang, Yoo, Bejerano and Peltz."
"34573345","Meta-Analysis of Brain Gene Expression Data from Mouse Model Studies of Maternal Immune Activation Using Poly(I:C).","Genes (Basel)","Maternal immune activation (MIA) is a known risk factor for schizophrenia (SCZ) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and is often modelled in animal studies in order to study the effect of prenatal infection on brain function including behaviour and gene expression. Although the effect of MIA on gene expression are highly heterogeneous, combining data from multiple gene expression studies in a robust method may shed light on the true underlying biological effects caused by MIA and this could inform studies of SCZ and ASD. This study combined four RNA-seq and microarray datasets in an overlap analysis and ranked meta-analysis in order to investigate genes, pathways and cell types dysregulated in the MIA mouse models. Genes linked to SCZ and ASD and crucial in neurodevelopmental processes including neural tube folding, regulation of cellular stress and neuronal/glial cell differentiation were among the most consistently dysregulated in these ranked analyses. Gene ontologies including K+ ion channel function, neuron and glial cell differentiation, synaptic structure, axonal outgrowth, cilia function and lipid metabolism were also strongly implicated. Single-cell analysis identified excitatory and inhibitory cell types in the cortex, hippocampus and striatum that may be affected by MIA and are also enriched for genes associated with SCZ, ASD and cognitive phenotypes. This points to the cellular location of molecular mechanisms that may be consistent between the MIA model and neurodevelopmental disease, improving our understanding of its utility to study prenatal infection as an environmental stressor."

DNA methylation (DNAm) is associated with asthma, rhinitis, and several viruses. We examined associations of asthma/rhinitis with DNAm at CpGs located on coronavirus related genes, and if these associations were sex-specific.In total, n = 242 subjects aged 26 years from the Isle of Wight Birth Cohort were included in the study. Linear regressions were used to examine sex specific and non-specific associations of DNAm at CpGs on coronavirus related genes with asthma/rhinitis status. Associations of DNAm with gene expression in blood were assessed for functional relevance of identified CpGs.Statistically significant interaction effects of asthma or rhinitis with sex were identified at 40 CpGs for asthma and 27 CpGs for rhinitis. At 21 CpGs, DNAm was associated with asthma, and at 45 CpGs with rhinitis, regardless of sex. Assessment of functional relevance of the identified CpGs indicated a potential of epigenetic regulatory functionality on gene activity at 14 CpGs for asthma and 17 CpGs for rhinitis, and of those 6 CpGs for asthma and 7 CpGs for rhinitis were likely to be sex-specific.Subjects with asthma/rhinitis may have altered susceptibility to COVID-19 due to changes in their DNAm associated with these conditions. Sex specificity on association of asthma/rhinitis with DNAm at certain CpGs, and on the association of DNAm at asthma/rhinitis-linked CpGs with gene expression have the potential to explain the reported sex-specificity in COVID-19 morbidity and mortality.© The Author(s) 2021."

Using a conditional knockout mouse model for uterineFoxa2, here we show that the lack of uterineFoxa2elicits a sexually-conflicting transcriptional response in the fetal brain relative to placenta. The ablation ofFoxa2in the uterus altered expression of genes related to growth, nutrient sensing, aging, longevity and angiogenesis among others. In the wildtype mice, these genes were expressed higher in the fetal brain and placenta of males compared to females. However, in mice lacking uterineFoxa2, the same genes showed the opposite pattern i.e., higher expression in the fetal brain and placenta of females compared to males. Based on the known marker genes of mice placenta and fetal brain cells, we further predicted that the genes exhibiting the sexually conflicting expression were associated with vascular endothelial cells. Overall, our study suggests that uterineFoxa2plays a role in the regulation of the brain-placental axis by influencing the fetoplacental vascular changes during pregnancy."
"34572090","Sexually Dimorphic Transcriptomic Changes of Developing Fetal Brain Reveal Signaling Pathways and Marker Genes of Brain Cells in Domestic Pigs.","Cells","In this study, transcriptomic changes of the developing brain of pig fetuses of both sexes were investigated on gestation days (GD) 45, 60 and 90. Pig fetal brain grows rapidly around GD60. Consequently, gene expression of the fetal brain was distinctly different on GD90 compared to that of GD45 and GD60. In addition, varying numbers of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in the male brain compared to the female brain during development. The sex of adjacent fetuses also influenced gene expression of the fetal brain. Extensive changes in gene expression at the exon-level were observed during brain development. Pathway enrichment analysis showed that the ionotropic glutamate receptor pathway andp53pathway were enriched in the female brain, whereas specific receptor-mediated signaling pathways were enriched in the male brain. Marker genes of neurons and astrocytes were significantly differentially expressed between male and female brains during development. Furthermore, comparative analysis of gene expression patterns between fetal brain and placenta suggested that genes related to ion transportation may play a key role in the regulation of the brain-placental axis in pig. Collectively, the study suggests potential application of pig models to better understand influence of fetal sex on brain development."

Therefore, it is of great necessity to appraise the safety of ART and investigate the long-term effect, including lipid metabolism, on ART-conceived offspring. Augmenting our ART rabbit model to investigate lipid metabolic outcomes in offspring longitudinally, we detected variations in hepatic DNA methylation ART offspring in the F3 generation for embryonic exposure (multiple ovulation, vitrification and embryo transfer). Through adult liver metabolomics and proteomics, we identified changes mainly related to lipid metabolism (e.g., polyunsaturated fatty acids, steroids, steroid hormone). We also found that DNA methylation analysis was linked to changes in lipid metabolism and apoptosis genes. Nevertheless, these differences did not apparently alter the general health status. Thus, our findings suggest that ART is likely to be a player in embryo epigenetic events related to hepatic homeostasis alteration in adulthood."
"34576022","Mechanisms of DNA Methylation in Virus-Host Interaction in Hepatitis B Infection: Pathogenesis and Oncogenetic Properties.","Int J Mol Sci","Hepatitis B virus (HBV), the well-studied oncovirus that contributes to the majority of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) worldwide, can cause a severe inflammatory microenvironment leading to genetic and epigenetic changes in hepatocyte clones. HBV replication contributes to the regulation of DNA methyltransferase gene expression, particularly by X protein (HBx), and subsequent methylation changes may lead to abnormal transcription activation of adjacent genes and genomic instability. Undoubtedly, the altered expression of these genes has been known to cause diverse aspects of infected hepatocytes, including apoptosis, proliferation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, and immune responses. Additionally, pollutant-induced DNA methylation changes and aberrant methylation of imprinted genes in hepatocytes also complicate the process of tumorigenesis. Meanwhile, hepatocytes also contribute to epigenetic modification of the viral genome to affect HBV replication or viral protein production. Meanwhile, methylation levels of HBV integrants and surrounding host regions also play crucial roles in their ability to produce viral proteins in affected hepatocytes. Both host and viral changes can provide novel insights into tumorigenesis, individualized responses to therapeutic intervention, disease progress, and early diagnosis. As such, DNA methylation-mediated epigenetic silencing of cancer-related genes and viral replication is a compelling therapeutic goal to reduce morbidity and mortality from liver cancer caused by chronic HBV infection. In this review, we summarize the most recent research on aberrant DNA methylation associated with HBV infection, which is involved in HCC development, and provide an outlook on the future direction of the research."

Herein, a prognostic TLR-based gene signature was conducted for HCC.Methods:HCC-specific TLRs were screened in the TCGA cohort. A LASSO model was constructed based on prognosis-related HCC-specific TLRs. The predictive efficacy, sensitivity, and independency of this signature was then evaluated and externally verified in the ICGC, GSE14520, and GSE76427 cohorts. The associations between this signature and tumor microenvironment (stromal/immune score, immune checkpoint expression, and immune cell infiltrations) and chemotherapy response were assessed in HCC specimens. The expression of TLRs in this signature was verified in HCC and normal liver tissues by Western blot. Following si-MAP2K2 transfection, colony formation and apoptosis of Huh7 and HepG2 cells were examined.Results:Herein, we identified 60 HCC-specific TLRs. A TLR-based gene signature (MAP2K2, IRAK1, RAC1, TRAF3, MAP3K7, and SPP1) was conducted for HCC prognosis. High-risk patients exhibited undesirable outcomes. ROC curves confirmed the well prediction performance of this signature. Multivariate Cox regression analysis demonstrated that the signature was an independent prognostic indicator. Also, high-risk HCC was characterized by an increased immune score, immune checkpoint expression, and immune cell infiltration. Meanwhile, high-risk patients displayed higher sensitivity to gemcitabine and cisplatin. The dysregulation of TLRs in the signature was confirmed in HCC. MAP2K2 knockdown weakened colony formation and elevated apoptosis of Huh7 and HepG2 cells.Conclusion:Collectively, this TLR-based gene signature might assist clinicians to select personalized therapy programs for HCC patients.Copyright © 2021 Liu, Liu, Yu, Zhang, Shi and Liang."

As a novel predictor for prognosis in a variety of cancers, immune-related long noncoding RNA pairs (IRlncRNAPs) have been reported to predict tumor prognosis. Herein, we integrated an IRlncRNAPs model to predict the clinical outcome, immune features, and chemotherapeutic efficacy of GC.Methods:Based on the GC data obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and the Immunology Database and Analysis Portal (ImmPort), differentially expressed immune-related long noncoding RNAs (DEIRlncRNAs) were identified. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression and Cox regression analysis were used to select the most appropriate overall survival (OS)-related IRlncRNAPs to develop a prognostic signature. The riskScore of each sample was calculated by comparing the long noncoding RNA expression level in each IRlncRNAP. Based on the riskScore for each patient, GC patients were divided into high- and low-risk groups. Then, the correlation of the signature and riskScore with OS, clinical features, immune cell infiltration, immune-related gene (IRG) expression and chemotherapeutic efficacy in GC was analyzed.Results:A total of 107 DEIRlncRNAs were identified which formed 4297 IRlncRNAPs. Fifteen OS-related IRlncRNAPs were selected to develop a prognostic model. GC patients could be accurately classified into high- and low-risk groups according to the riskScore of the prognostic model. The 1-, 2-, 3-, and 5-year receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for the riskScore were drawn and the area under the curve (AUC) values were found to be 0.788, 0.810, 0.825, and 0.868, respectively, demonstrating a high sensitivity and accuracy of this prognostic signature. Moreover, the immune-related riskScore was an independent risk factor. Patients showed a poorer outcome within the high-risk group. In addition, the riskScore was found to be significantly correlated with the clinical features, immune infiltration status, IRG expression, and chemotherapeutic efficacy in GC.Conclusion:The prognostic model of IRlncRNAPs offers great promise in predicting the prognosis, immune infiltration status, and chemotherapeutic efficacy in GC, which might be helpful for the selection of chemo- and immuno-therapy of GC.Copyright © 2021 Song, Liu, Wei, Jin, Mao, He, Li and Zhang."

One ArrayExpress dataset and eight Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets (GEO-meta dataset) as well as the Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium dataset were used as validation sets to confirm the findings regarding the immune profiles, mutational features, and survival outcomes of the three identified immune subtypes. Moreover, the development trajectory of ER+ BC patients from the single-cell resolution level was also explored.Results:Through comprehensive bioinformatics analysis, three immune subtypes of ER+ BC (C1, C2, and C3, designated the immune suppressive, activation, and neutral subtypes, respectively) were identified. C2 was associated with up-regulated immune cell signatures and immune checkpoint genes. Additionally, five tumor-related pathways (transforming growth factor, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, extracellular matrix, interferon-γ, and WNT signaling) tended to be more activated in C2 than in C1 and C3. Moreover, C2 was associated with a lower tumor mutation burden, a decreased neoantigen load, and fewer CNVs. Drug sensitivity analysis further showed that C2 may be more sensitive to immunosuppressive agents.Conclusion:C2 (the immune activation subtype) may be sensitive to immunotherapy, which provides new insights into effective treatment approaches for ER+ BC.Copyright © 2021 Ma, Chen, Yang, Ke, Wang, Huang and Li."

However, the prognosis of STAD remains poor, and the therapeutic effect of chemotherapy and immunotherapy varies from person to person. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play vital roles in tumor development and metastasis and can be used for cancer diagnosis and prognosis. In this study, hsa-miR-100-5p was identified as the only dysregulated miRNA in STAD samples through an analysis of three miRNA expression matrices. A weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was performed to select hsa-miR-100-5p-related genes. A least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression analysis was performed to establish a miR-100-5p-related prognostic signature. Kaplan-Meier analyses, nomograms, and univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to evaluate the prognostic signature, which was subsequently identified as an independent risk factor for STAD patients. We investigated the tumor immune environment between low- and high-risk groups and found that, among component types, M2 macrophages contributed the most to the difference between these groups. A drug sensitivity analysis suggested that patients with high-risk scores may be more sensitive to docetaxel and cisplatin chemotherapy and that patients in the low-risk group may be more likely to benefit from immunotherapy. Finally, external cohorts were evaluated to validate the robustness of the prognostic signature. In summary, this study may provide new ideas for developing more individualized therapeutic strategies for STAD patients.Copyright © 2021 Wang, Yang, Hu, Hu, Wang, Chen, Jiang and Cui."

Due to the lack of standardization and the variety of metabolomics assays, it is difficult to integrate datasets across studies or assays. To inform metabolomics platform selection, with a focus on posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), we review platform use and sample sizes in psychiatric metabolomics studies and then evaluate five prominent metabolomics platforms for coverage and performance, including intra-/inter-assay precision, accuracy, and linearity. We found performance was variable between metabolite classes, but comparable across targeted and untargeted approaches. Within all platforms, precision and accuracy were highly variable across classes, ranging from 0.9-63.2% (coefficient of variation) and 0.6-99.1% for accuracy to reference plasma. Several classes had high inter-assay variance, potentially impeding dissociation of a biological signal, including glycerophospholipids, organooxygen compounds, and fatty acids. Coverage was platform-specific and ranged from 16-70% of PTSD-associated metabolites. Non-overlapping coverage is challenging; however, benefits of applying multiple metabolomics technologies must be weighed against cost, biospecimen availability, platform-specific normative levels, and challenges in merging datasets. Our findings and open-access cross-platform dataset can inform platform selection and dataset integration based on platform-specific coverage breadth/overlap and metabolite-specific performance."
"34616062","Comparative cellular analysis of motor cortex in human, marmoset and mouse.","Nature","The primary motor cortex (M1) is essential for voluntary fine-motor control and is functionally conserved across mammals1. Here, using high-throughput transcriptomic and epigenomic profiling of more than 450,000 single nuclei in humans, marmoset monkeys and mice, we demonstrate a broadly conserved cellular makeup of this region, with similarities that mirror evolutionary distance and are consistent between the transcriptome and epigenome. The core conserved molecular identities of neuronal and non-neuronal cell types allow us to generate a cross-species consensus classification of cell types, and to infer conserved properties of cell types across species. Despite the overall conservation, however, many species-dependent specializations are apparent, including differences in cell-type proportions, gene expression, DNA methylation and chromatin state. Few cell-type marker genes are conserved across species, revealing a short list of candidate genes and regulatory mechanisms that are responsible for conserved features of homologous cell types, such as the GABAergic chandelier cells. This consensus transcriptomic classification allows us to use patch-seq (a combination of whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, RNA sequencing and morphological characterization) to identify corticospinal Betz cells from layer 5 in non-human primates and humans, and to characterize their highly specialized physiology and anatomy. These findings highlight the robust molecular underpinnings of cell-type diversity in M1 across mammals, and point to the genes and regulatory pathways responsible for the functional identity of cell types and their species-specific adaptations.© 2021.

As a key component of complex pathogenesis, ELS-mediated changes in brain metabolism associate with development of mitochondrial dysfunction, loss of appropriate mitochondria quality control and mitochondrial dynamics, deregulation of metabolic reprogramming. These mechanisms are particularly critical for maintaining the pool and development of brain cells within neurogenic and angiogenic niches. In this review, we focus on brain mitochondria and energy metabolism related to tightly coupled neurogenic and angiogenic events in healthy and ELS-affected brain, and new opportunities to develop efficient therapeutic strategies aimed to restore brain metabolism and reduce ELS-induced impairments of brain plasticity."
"34635837","Identification of tumor antigens with immunopeptidomics.","Nat Biotechnol","The identification of actionable tumor antigens is indispensable for the development of several cancer immunotherapies, including T cell receptor-transduced T cells and patient-specific mRNA or peptide vaccines. Most known tumor antigens have been identified through extensive molecular characterization and are considered canonical if they derive from protein-coding regions of the genome. By eluting human leukocyte antigen-bound peptides from tumors and subjecting these to mass spectrometry analysis, the peptides can be identified by matching the resulting spectra against reference databases. Recently, mass-spectrometry-based immunopeptidomics has enabled the discovery of noncanonical antigens-antigens derived from sequences outside protein-coding regions or generated by noncanonical antigen-processing mechanisms. Coupled with transcriptomics and ribosome profiling, this method enables the identification of thousands of noncanonical peptides, of which a substantial fraction may be detected exclusively in tumors. Spectral matching against the immense noncanonical reference may generate false positives. However, sensitive mass spectrometry, analytical validation and advanced bioinformatics solutions are expected to uncover the full landscape of presented antigens and clinically relevant targets.© 2021.

"34599748","Clinical epigenetics and restoring of metabolic health in severely obese patients undergoing batriatric and metabolic surgery.","Updates Surg","Epigenetic-sensitive mechanisms, mainly DNA methylation, mirror the relationship between environmental and genetic risk factors able to affect the sensitiveness to development of obesity and its comorbidities. Bariatric and metabolic surgery may reduce obesity-related cardiovascular risk through tissue-specific DNA methylation changes. Among the most robust results, differential promoter methylation of ACACA, CETP, CTGF, S100A8, and S100A9 genes correlated significantly with the levels of mRNA before and after gastric bypass surgery (RYGB) in obese women. Additionally, promoter hypermethylation of NFKB1 gene was significantly associated with reduced blood pressure in obese patients after RYGB suggesting useful non-invasive biomarkers. Of note, sperm-related DNA methylation signatures of genes regulating the central control of appetite, such as MC4R, BDNF, NPY, and CR1, and other genes including FTO, CHST8, and SH2B1 were different in obese patients as compared to non-obese subjects and patients who lost weight after RYGB surgery. Importantly, transgenerational studies provided relevant evidence of the potential effect of bariatric and metabolic surgery on DNA methylation. For example, peripheral blood biospecimens isolated from siblings born from obese mothers before bariatric surgery showed different methylation signatures in the insulin receptor and leptin signaling axis as compared to siblings born from post-obese mothers who underwent surgery. This evidence suggests that bariatric and metabolic surgery of mothers may affect the epigenetic profiles of the offspring with potential implication for primary prevention of severe obesity. We update on tissue-specific epigenetic signatures as potential mechanisms underlying the restoration of metabolic health after surgery suggesting useful predictive biomarkers.© 2021. The Author(s)."
"34565346","A targeted solution for estimating the cell-type composition of bulk samples.","BMC Bioinformatics","To avoid false-positive findings and detect cell-type specific associations in methylation and transcription investigations with bulk samples, it is critical to know the proportions of the major cell-types.We present a novel approach that allows for precise estimation of cell-type proportions using only a few highly informative methylation markers. The most reliable estimates were obtained with 17 amplicons (34 CpGs) using the MuSiC estimator, for which the average correlations between the estimated and the true cell-type proportions were 0.889. Furthermore, the estimates were not significantly different from the true values (P = 0.95) indicating that the estimator is unbiased and the standard deviation of the estimates further indicate high precision. Moreover, the overall variability of the estimates as measured by the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), which is a function of both bias and precision, was low (mean RMSE = 0.038). Taken together, these results indicate that the approach produced reliable estimates that are both unbiased and highly precise.This cost-effective approach for estimating cell-type proportions in bulk samples allows for enhanced targeted analysis, which in turn will minimize the risk of reporting false-positive findings and allowing for detection of cell-type specific associations. The approach is applicable across platforms and can be extended to assess cell-type proportions for various tissues.© 2021. The Author(s)."

It arises during the first 2 years of a child's life and is associated with developmental deficiencies and life-long health problems. Current interventions provide some benefit, but new approaches to prevention and treatment grounded in a molecular understanding of stunting are needed. Epigenetic analyses are critical as they can provide insight into how signals from a poor environment lead to changes in cell function.Here we profiled histone H3 acetylation on lysine 27 (H3K27ac) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 18-week-old (n = 14) and 1-year-old children (n = 22) living in an urban slum in Dhaka, Bangladesh. We show that 18-week-old children destined to become stunted have elevated levels of H3K27ac overall, functional analysis of which indicates activation of the immune system and stress response pathways as a primary response to a poor environment with high pathogen load. Conversely, overt stunting at 1-year-of age is associated with globally reduced H3K27ac that is indicative of metabolic rewiring and downregulation of the immune system and DNA repair pathways that are likely secondary responses to chronic exposure to a poor environment with limited nutrients. Among processes altered in 1-year-old children, we identified one-carbon metabolism, the significance of which is supported by integrative analysis with results from histone H3 trimethylation on lysine 4 (H3K4me3). Together, these results suggest altered one-carbon metabolism in this population of stunted children.The epigenomes of stunted children undergo two global changes in H3K27ac within their first year of life, which are associated with probable initial hyperactive immune responses followed by reduced metabolic capacity. Limitation of one-carbon metabolites may play a key role in the development of stunting. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01375647.

Appropriate methods for the diagnosis and treatment of PC have not been found at the genetic level, thus making epigenetics a promising research path in studies of PC. Histone methylation is one of the most complicated types of epigenetic modifications and has proved crucial in the development of PC. Histone methylation is a reversible process regulated by readers, writers, and erasers. Some writers and erasers can be recognized as potential biomarkers and candidate therapeutic targets in PC because of their unusual expression in PC cells compared with normal pancreatic cells. Based on the impact that writers have on the development of PC, some inhibitors of writers have been developed. However, few inhibitors of erasers have been developed and put to clinical use. Meanwhile, there is not enough research on the reader domains. Therefore, the study of erasers and readers is still a promising area. This review focuses on the regulatory mechanism of histone methylation, and the diagnosis and chemotherapy of PC based on it. The future of epigenetic modification in PC research is also discussed.©The Author(s) 2021. Published by Baishideng Publishing Group Inc. All rights reserved."

Several cells modulate the process of wound healing including macrophages, fibroblasts, and keratinocytes. Apart from these cells, platelet has been considered as a major cellular fragment to be involved in wound healing at several stages by secreting its granular contents including growth factors, thus resulting in coagulation, inflammation, and angiogenesis. A distant cell, which is gaining significant attention nowadays due to its resemblance with platelet in several aspects, is the neuron. Not only neurons but also glia cells are also confirmed to regulate wound healing at different stages in an orchestrated manner. Furthermore, these neurons and glia cells mediate wound healing inducing tissue repair and regeneration apart from hemostasis, angiogenesis, and inflammation by secreting various growth factors, coagulation molecules, immunomodulatory molecules as well as neurohormones, neuropeptides, and neurotrophins. Therefore, in wound healing platelets, neurons and glia cells not only contribute to tissue repair but are also responsible for establishing the wound microenvironment, thus affecting the proliferation of immune cells, fibroblast, and keratinocytes. Here in this review, we will enlighten the physiological roles of neurons and glia cells in coordination with platelets to understand various cellular and molecular mechanism in brain injury and associated neurocognitive impairments.© 2021.

The global COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically changed the face of social relationships and revealed elderly to be particularly vulnerable to the effects of social isolation. Social distancing may represent a double-edged sword for older adults, protecting them against COVID-19 infection while also sacrificing personal interaction and attention at a critical time. Here, we consider the moderating role of social relationships as a potential influence on stress resilience, allostatic load, and vulnerability to infection and adverse health outcomes in the elderly population. Understanding the mechanisms how social support enhances resilience to stress and promotes mental and physical health into old age will enable new preventive strategies. Targeted social interventions may provide effective relief from the impact of COVID-19-related isolation and loneliness. In this regard, a pandemic may also offer a window of opportunity for raising awareness and mobilizing resources for new strategies that help build resilience in our aging population and future generations.copyright: © 2021 Faraji et al."

Is There a Role for Stem Cell Transplantation?","Front Cell Dev Biol","The outcomes of Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) vary depending on the age, health status and sex of an individual, ranging from asymptomatic to lethal. From an immunologic viewpoint, the final severe lung damage observed in COVID-19 should be caused by cytokine storm, driven mainly by interleukin-6 and other pro-inflammatory cytokines. However, which immunopathogenic status precedes this ""cytokine storm"" and why the male older population is more severely affected, are currently unanswered questions. The aging of the immune system, i.e., immunosenescence, closely associated with a low-grade inflammatory status called ""inflammageing,"" should play a key role. The remodeling of both innate and adaptive immune response observed with aging can partly explain the age gradient in severity and mortality of COVID-19. This review discusses how aging impacts the immune response to the virus, focusing on possible strategies to rejuvenate the immune system with stem cell-based therapies. Indeed, due to immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties, multipotent mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a worth-considering option against COVID-19 adverse outcomes.Copyright © 2021 Ligotti, Pojero, Accardi, Aiello, Caruso, Duro and Candore."

Microvascular injury, endothelial dysfunction and thrombosis resulting from viral infection or indirectly related to the intense systemic inflammatory and immune responses are characteristic features of severe COVID-19. Pre-existing cardiovascular disease and viral load are linked to myocardial injury and worse outcomes. The vascular response to cytokine production and the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 receptor may lead to a significant reduction in cardiac contractility and subsequent myocardial dysfunction. In addition, a considerable proportion of patients who have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 do not fully recover and continue to experience a large number of symptoms and post-acute complications in the absence of a detectable viral infection. This conditions often referred to as ""post-acute COVID-19"" may have multiple causes. Viral reservoirs or lingering fragments of viral RNA or proteins contribute to the condition. Systemic inflammatory response to COVID-19 has the potential to increase myocardial fibrosis which in turn may impair cardiac remodelling. Here we summarize the current knowledge of cardiovascular injury and post-acute sequelae of COVID-19. As the pandemic continues and new variants emerge, we can advance our knowledge of the underlying mechanisms only by integrating our understanding of the pathophysiology with the corresponding clinical findings.

By performing fate mapping or single-cell transcriptomics studies, or a combination of both, the field has made key observations: SMCs populate atherosclerotic lesions by the selective expansion and investment of a limited number of medial SMCs, which undergo profound and diverse modifications of their original phenotype and function. Thus, if SMCs residing within atherosclerotic lesions and contributing to the disease are clones, they are not carbon copies and can play atheroprotective or atheropromoting roles, depending on the nature of their phenotypic transitions. Tremendous progress has been made in identifying the transcriptional mechanisms biasing SMC fate. In the present review, we have summarized the recent advances in characterizing SMC investment and phenotypic diversity and the molecular mechanisms controlling SMC fate in atherosclerotic lesions. We have also discussed some of the remaining questions associated with these breakthrough observations. These questions include the underlying mechanisms regulating the phenomenon of SMC oligoclonal expansion; whether single-cell transcriptomics is reliable and sufficient to ascertain SMC functions and contributions during atherosclerosis development and progression; and how SMC clonality and phenotypic plasticity affects translational research and the therapeutic approaches developed to prevent atherosclerosis complications. Finally, we have discussed the complementary approaches the field should lean toward by combining single-cell phenotypic categorization and functional studies to understand further the complex SMC behavior and contribution in atherosclerosis.© 2021 by the Society for Vascular Surgery.

Blood samples were collected from eleven enrolled patients, before, during and after anesthesia. PBMC were isolated and global DNA methylation levels as well as DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) and cytokine gene expression were assessed. DNA methylation levels significantly declined by 26%, reversing the direction after the end of surgery. Likewise, DNMT1a mRNA expression was significantly reduced at all time points, with lowest level of -68%. DNMT3a and DNMT3b decreased by 65 and 71%, respectively. Inflammatory cytokines IL6 and TNFα mRNA levels showed a trend for increased expression at early time-points to end with a significant decrease at 48 h after surgery. This exploratory study revealed for the first time intraoperative global DNA hypomethylation in patients undergoing major breast surgery under general anesthesia with fentanyl. The alterations of global DNA methylation here observed seem to be in agreement with DNMTs gene expression changes. Furthermore, based on perioperative variations of IL6 and TNFα gene expression, we hypothesize that DNA hypomethylation may occur as a response to surgical stress rather than to opiate exposure.Copyright © 2021 Caputi, Carboni, Rullo, Alessandrini, Balzani, Melotti, Romualdi, Candeletti and Fanelli."

NAFLD became the most common cause of chronic liver disease that is tightly associated with key aspects of metabolic disorders, including insulin resistance, obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. It is generally accepted that multiple mechanisms and pathways are involved in the pathogenesis of NAFLD. Heredity, sedentary lifestyle, westernized high sugar saturated fat diet, metabolic derangements, and gut microbiota, all may interact on a on genetically susceptible individual to cause the disease initiation and progression. While there is an unquestionable role for gene-diet interaction in the etiopathogenesis of NAFLD, it is increasingly apparent that epigenetic processes can orchestrate many aspects of this interaction and provide additional mechanistic insight. Exciting research demonstrated that epigenetic alterations in chromatin can influence gene expression chiefly at the transcriptional level in response to unbalanced diet, and therefore predispose an individual to NAFLD. Thus, further discoveries into molecular epigenetic mechanisms underlying the link between nutrition and aberrant hepatic gene expression can yield new insights into the pathogenesis of NAFLD, and allow innovative epigenetic-based strategies for its early prevention and targeted therapies. Herein, we outline the current knowledge of the interactive role of a high-fat high-calories diet and gene expression through DNA methylation and histone modifications on the pathogenesis of NAFLD.

"34618233","The relationship between transcription and eccentricity in human V1.","Brain Struct Funct","Gene expression gradients radiating from regions of primary sensory cortices have recently been described and are thought to underlie the large-scale organization of the human cerebral cortex. However, the role of transcription in the functional layout of a single region within the adult brain has yet to be clarified, likely owing to the difficulty of identifying a brain region anatomically consistent enough across individuals with dense enough tissue sampling. Overcoming these hurdles in human primary visual cortex (V1), we show a relationship between differential gene expression and the cortical layout of eccentricity in human V1. Interestingly, these genes are unique from those previously identified that contribute to the positioning of cortical areas in the visual processing hierarchy. Enrichment analyses show that a subset of the identified genes encode for structures related to inhibitory interneurons, ion channels, as well as cellular projections, and are expressed more in foveal compared to peripheral portions of human V1. These findings predict that tissue density should be higher in foveal compared to peripheral V1. Using a histological pipeline, we validate this prediction using Nissl-stained sections of postmortem occipital cortex. We discuss these findings relative to previous studies in non-human primates, as well as in the context of an organizational pattern in which the adult human brain employs transcription gradients at multiple spatial scales: across the cerebral cortex, across areas within processing hierarchies, and within single cortical areas.© 2021.

"34593797","Chromatin accessibility associates with protein-RNA correlation in human cancer.","Nat Commun","Although alterations in chromatin structure are known to exist in tumors, how these alterations relate to molecular phenotypes in cancer remains to be demonstrated. Multi-omics profiling of human tumors can provide insight into how alterations in chromatin structure are propagated through the pathway of gene expression to result in malignant protein expression. We applied multi-omics profiling of chromatin accessibility, RNA abundance, and protein abundance to 36 human thyroid cancer primary tumors, metastases, and patient-match normal tissue. Through quantification of chromatin accessibility associated with active transcription units and global protein expression, we identify a local chromatin structure that is highly correlated with coordinated RNA and protein expression. In particular, we identify enhancers located within gene-bodies as predictive of correlated RNA and protein expression, that is independent of overall transcriptional activity. To demonstrate the generalizability of these findings we also identify similar results in an independent cohort of human breast cancers. Taken together, these analyses suggest that local enhancers, rather than distal enhancers, are likely most predictive of cancer gene expression phenotypes. This allows for identification of potential targets for cancer therapeutic approaches and reinforces the utility of multi-omics profiling as a methodology to understand human disease.© 2021.

"34587152","Transcriptome analyses reveal tau isoform-driven changes in transposable element and gene expression.","PLoS One","Alternative splicing of the gene MAPT produces several isoforms of tau protein. Overexpression of these isoforms is characteristic of tauopathies, which are currently untreatable neurodegenerative diseases. Though non-canonical functions of tau have drawn interest, the role of tau isoforms in these diseases has not been fully examined and may reveal new details of tau-driven pathology. In particular, tau has been shown to promote activation of transposable elements-highly regulated nucleotide sequences that replicate throughout the genome and can promote immunologic responses and cellular stress. This study examined tau isoforms' roles in promoting cell damage and dysregulation of genes and transposable elements at a family-specific and locus-specific level. We performed immunofluorescence, Western blot and cytotoxicity assays, along with paired-end RNA sequencing on differentiated SH-SY5Y cells infected with lentiviral constructs of tau isoforms and treated with amyloid-beta oligomers. Our transcriptomic findings were validated using publicly available RNA-sequencing data from Alzheimer's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy and control human samples from the Accelerating Medicine's Partnership for AD (AMP-AD). Significance for biochemical assays was determined using Wilcoxon ranked-sum tests and false discovery rate. Transcriptome analysis was conducted through DESeq2 and the TEToolkit suite available from the Hammell lab at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. Our analyses show overexpression of different tau isoforms and their interactions with amyloid-beta in SH-SY5Y cells result in isoform-specific changes in the transcriptome, with locus-specific transposable element dysregulation patterns paralleling those seen in patients with Alzheimer's disease and progressive supranuclear palsy. Locus-level transposable element expression showed increased dysregulation of L1 and Alu sites, which have been shown to drive pathology in other neurological diseases. We also demonstrated differences in rates of cell death in SH-SY5Y cells depending on tau isoform overexpression. These results demonstrate the importance of examining tau isoforms' role in neurodegeneration and of further examining transposable element dysregulation in tauopathies and its role in activating the innate immune system."

Moreover, we highlight an emerging class of chimeric PF derived from translocation partners in human disease and PFs associated with rare tumors. In the age of site-directed genome editing and targeted protein degradation, increasing our understanding of PFs will provide access to next-generation therapy for human disease driven from altered transcriptional circuitry.© 2021 The Author(s)."
"34573112","Oxidative Stress and Beta Amyloid in Alzheimer's Disease. Which Comes First: The Chicken or the Egg?","Antioxidants (Basel)","The pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease involves β amyloid (Aβ) accumulation known to induce synaptic dysfunction and neurodegeneration. The brain's vulnerability to oxidative stress (OS) is considered a crucial detrimental factor in Alzheimer's disease. OS and Aβ are linked to each other because Aβ induces OS, and OS increases the Aβ deposition. Thus, the answer to the question ""which comes first: the chicken or the egg?"" remains extremely difficult. In any case, the evidence for the primary occurrence of oxidative stress in AD is attractive. Thus, evidence indicates that a long period of gradual oxidative damage accumulation precedes and results in the appearance of clinical and pathological AD symptoms, including Aβ deposition, neurofibrillary tangle formation, metabolic dysfunction, and cognitive decline. Moreover, oxidative stress plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of many risk factors for AD. Alzheimer's disease begins many years before its symptoms, and antioxidant treatment can be an important therapeutic target for attacking the disease."
"34615459","Impact of metabolic syndrome on the viability of human spermatozoa: a cross-sectional descriptive study in men from infertile couples.","Basic Clin Androl","A direct association between metabolic syndrome (MetS) and sperm production/function has been proposed. In this cross-sectional study, we aimed to determine the impact of MetS on sperm survival. Men from infertile couples treated at Hue University Hospital, Vietnam, were enrolled in this study, which spanned the October 2018 to October 2020 period. The general characteristics of the patients, including body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), the levels of different biochemicals, and semen parameters were determined, and sperm survival tests (SSTs) were performed. The modified National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III for the Asian population was used for MetS diagnosis.Men with an abnormal waist circumference (≥ 90 cm) showed a higher rate of abnormal SST results (30.1% vs. 16.7%, p = 0.012). The frequency of abnormal SST results in patients with MetS (72.3%) was significantly higher than that in individuals without MetS (53.4%) (p = 0.02). Furthermore, the percentage of abnormal SST results in patients with MetS and with BMI ≥ 23 was significantly higher than those in individuals without MetS (77.1% vs. 55.2%, p = 0.03). Weak negative correlations were also observed between the patients' age and the SST results.Sperm viability was lower in men with MetS. We also observed that age and BMI were independent factors associated with abnormal SST.© 2021. The Author(s)."

Previous studies focused on nasal cartilage as a possible source for autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) in cartilage defects in humans. ""HOX gene-negative"" nasal chondrocytes adapted articular HOX patterns after implantation into caprine joint defects and produced cartilage matrix proteins. We compared the HOX gene profile of equine chondrocytes of nasal septum, anterior and posterior fetlock to identify nasal cartilage as a potential source for ACI in horses. Cartilage was harvested from seven horses after death and derived chondrocytes were cultured in a monolayer to fourth subcultivation. HOX A3, D1, D8 and chondrocyte markers COL2 and SOX9 were analyzed with qPCR in chondrocytes of three different locations obtained during passage 0 and passage 2. HOX gene expression showed no significant differences between the locations but varied significantly between the horses. HOX genes and SOX9 remained stable during culturing. Cultured nasal chondrocytes may be a target for future research in cell-based regenerative therapies in equine osteoarthritis. The involvement of HOX genes in the high regenerative and adaptive potential of nasal chondrocytes observed in previous studies could not be confirmed."
"34584172","Natural selection at the RASGEF1C (GGC) repeat in human and divergent genotypes in late-onset neurocognitive disorder.","Sci Rep","Expression dysregulation of the neuron-specific gene, RASGEF1C (RasGEF Domain Family Member 1C), occurs in late-onset neurocognitive disorders (NCDs), such as Alzheimer's disease. This gene contains a (GGC)13, spanning its core promoter and 5' untranslated region (RASGEF1C-201 ENST00000361132.9). Here we sequenced the (GGC)-repeat in a sample of human subjects (N = 269), consisting of late-onset NCDs (N = 115) and controls (N = 154). We also studied the status of this STR across various primate and non-primate species based on Ensembl 103. The 6-repeat allele was the predominant allele in the controls (frequency = 0.85) and NCD patients (frequency = 0.78). The NCD genotype compartment consisted of an excess of genotypes that lacked the 6-repeat (divergent genotypes) (Mid-P exact = 0.004). A number of those genotypes were not detected in the control group (Mid-P exact = 0.007). The RASGEF1C (GGC)-repeat expanded beyond 2-repeats specifically in primates, and was at maximum length in human. We conclude that there is natural selection for the 6-repeat allele of the RASGEF1C (GGC)-repeat in human, and significant divergence from that allele in late-onset NCDs. STR alleles that are predominantly abundant and genotypes that deviate from those alleles are underappreciated features, which may have deep evolutionary and pathological consequences.© 2021.

"34608310","Joint single-cell measurements of nuclear proteins and RNA in vivo.","Nat Methods","Identifying gene-regulatory targets of nuclear proteins in tissues is a challenge. Here we describe intranuclear cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes (inCITE-seq), a scalable method that measures multiplexed intranuclear protein levels and the transcriptome in parallel across thousands of nuclei, enabling joint analysis of transcription factor (TF) levels and gene expression in vivo. We apply inCITE-seq to characterize cell state-related changes upon pharmacological induction of neuronal activity in the mouse brain. Modeling gene expression as a linear combination of quantitative protein levels revealed genome-wide associations of each TF and recovered known gene targets. TF-associated genes were coexpressed as distinct modules that each reflected positive or negative TF levels, showing that our approach can disentangle relative putative contributions of TFs to gene expression and add interpretability to inferred gene networks. inCITE-seq can illuminate how combinations of nuclear proteins shape gene expression in native tissue contexts, with direct applications to solid or frozen tissues and clinical specimens.© 2021.

"34594043","Differential abundance testing on single-cell data using k-nearest neighbor graphs.","Nat Biotechnol","Current computational workflows for comparative analyses of single-cell datasets typically use discrete clusters as input when testing for differential abundance among experimental conditions. However, clusters do not always provide the appropriate resolution and cannot capture continuous trajectories. Here we present Milo, a scalable statistical framework that performs differential abundance testing by assigning cells to partially overlapping neighborhoods on a k-nearest neighbor graph. Using simulations and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, we show that Milo can identify perturbations that are obscured by discretizing cells into clusters, that it maintains false discovery rate control across batch effects and that it outperforms alternative differential abundance testing strategies. Milo identifies the decline of a fate-biased epithelial precursor in the aging mouse thymus and identifies perturbations to multiple lineages in human cirrhotic liver. As Milo is based on a cell-cell similarity structure, it might also be applicable to single-cell data other than scRNA-seq.

"34575087","Astrocytes in Neurodegenerative Diseases: A Perspective from Tauopathy and α-Synucleinopathy.","Life (Basel)","Neurodegenerative diseases are aging-associated chronic pathological conditions affecting primarily neurons in humans. Inclusion bodies containing misfolded proteins have emerged as a common pathologic feature for these diseases. In many cases, misfolded proteins produced by a neuron can be transmitted to another neuron or a non-neuronal cell, leading to the propagation of disease-associated pathology. While undergoing intercellular transmission, misfolded proteins released from donor cells can often change the physiological state of recipient cells. Accumulating evidence suggests that astrocytes are highly sensitive to neuron-originated proteotoxic insults, which convert them into an active inflammatory state. Conversely, activated astrocytes can release a plethora of factors to impact neuronal functions. This review summarizes our current understanding of the complex molecular interplays between astrocyte and neuron, emphasizing on Tau and α-synuclein (α-syn), the disease-driving proteins for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, respectively."
"34647171","Neuroendocrine neoplasms of the pancreas: diagnosis and pitfalls.","Virchows Arch","Common to neuroendocrine neoplasms of the pancreas is their expression of synaptophysin, chromogranin A, and/or INSM1. They differ, however, in their histological differentiation and molecular profile. Three groups can be distinguished: well-differentiated neuroendocrine neoplasms (neuroendocrine tumors), poorly differentiated neuroendocrine neoplasms (neuroendocrine carcinomas), and mixed neuroendocrine-non-neuroendocrine neoplasms. However, the expression of synaptophysin and, to a lesser extent, also chromogranin A is not restricted to the neuroendocrine neoplasms, but may also be in a subset of non-neuroendocrine epithelial and non-epithelial neoplasms. This review provides the essential criteria for the diagnosis of pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms including diagnostic clues for the distinction of high-grade neuroendocrine tumors from neuroendocrine carcinomas and an algorithm avoiding diagnostic pitfalls in the delineation of non-neuroendocrine neoplasms with neuroendocrine features from pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms.© 2021.

"34603044","Therapeutic Drugs and Devices for Tackling Ocular Hypertension and Glaucoma, and Need for Neuroprotection and Cytoprotective Therapies.","Front Pharmacol","Damage to the optic nerve and the death of associated retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) by elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), also known as glaucoma, is responsible for visual impairment and blindness in millions of people worldwide. The ocular hypertension (OHT) and the deleterious mechanical forces it exerts at the back of the eye, at the level of the optic nerve head/optic disc and lamina cribosa, is the only modifiable risk factor associated with glaucoma that can be treated. The elevated IOP occurs due to the inability of accumulated aqueous humor (AQH) to egress from the anterior chamber of the eye due to occlusion of the major outflow pathway, the trabecular meshwork (TM) and Schlemm's canal (SC). Several different classes of pharmaceutical agents, surgical techniques and implantable devices have been developed to lower and control IOP. First-line drugs to promote AQH outflow via the uveoscleral outflow pathway include FP-receptor prostaglandin (PG) agonists (e.g., latanoprost, travoprost and tafluprost) and a novel non-PG EP2-receptor agonist (omidenepag isopropyl, Eybelis®). TM/SC outflow enhancing drugs are also effective ocular hypotensive agents (e.g., rho kinase inhibitors like ripasudil and netarsudil; and latanoprostene bunod, a conjugate of a nitric oxide donor and latanoprost). One of the most effective anterior chamber AQH microshunt devices is the Preserflo®microshunt which can lower IOP down to 10-13 mmHg. Other IOP-lowering drugs and devices on the horizon will be also discussed. Additionally, since elevated IOP is only one of many risk factors for development of glaucomatous optic neuropathy, a treatise of the role of inflammatory neurodegeneration of the optic nerve and retinal ganglion cells and appropriate neuroprotective strategies to mitigate this disease will also be reviewed and discussed.Copyright © 2021 Sharif."

Although, the survival rates vary widely depending on the type of the tumor, early diagnosis could generally benefit in better prognosis outcomes of the brain cancer patients. Conventionally, neuroimaging and biopsy are the most widely used approaches in diagnosis, subtyping, and prognosis monitoring of brain cancers, while emerging liquid biopsy assays using peripheral blood or cerebrospinal fluid have demonstrated many favorable characteristics in this task, especially due to their minimally invasive and easiness in sampling nature. Here, we review the recent studies in the liquid biopsy of brain cancers.

"34572541","Novel Approaches to an Integrated Route for Trisomy 21 Evaluation.","Biomolecules","Trisomy 21 (T21) is one of the most commonly occurring genetic disorders, caused by the partial or complete triplication of chromosome 21. Despite the significant progress in the diagnostic tools applied for prenatal screening, commonly used methods are still imprecise and involve invasive diagnostic procedures that are related to a maternal risk of miscarriage. In this case, novel prenatal biomarkers are still being evaluated using highly specialized techniques, which could increase the diagnostic usefulness of biochemical prenatal screening for T21. From the other hand, the T21's pathogenesis, caused by the improper division of genetic material, disrupting many metabolic pathways, could be further evaluated with the use of omics methods, which could result in bringing relevant insights for the evaluation of potential medical targets. Accordingly, a literature search was undertaken to collect novel information about prenatal screening for Down syndrome with the use of advanced technology, with a particular emphasis on the evaluation of novel screening biomarkers and the discovery of potential medical targets. These meta-analyses are focused on novel approaches designed with the use of omics techniques, representing the most rapidly developing and promising field in research today. Considering the limitations and progress of these methods, the use of omics techniques in evaluating T21 pathogenesis could bring beneficial results in prenatal screening, simultaneously uncovering novel potential medical targets."

Genomic surveillance must combine generation and sharing sequence data with appropriate bioinformatics monitoring and analysis methods. We applied molecular portrayal using self-organizing maps machine learning (SOM portrayal) to characterize the diversity of the virus genomes, their mutual relatedness and development since the beginning of the pandemic. The genetic landscape obtained visualizes the relevant mutations in a lineage-specific fashion and provides developmental paths in genetic state space from early lineages towards the variants of concern alpha, beta, gamma and delta. The different genes of the virus have specific footprints in the landscape reflecting their biological impact. SOM portrayal provides a novel option for 'bioinformatics surveillance' of the pandemic, with strong odds regarding visualization, intuitive perception and 'personalization' of the mutational patterns of the virus genomes."

The psychoneuroimmunology (PNI) field has made important contributions to the knowledge of the pathophysiology of poor perinatal mental health, but the PNI lens could be used more broadly to inform clinical practice. This review argues that PNI holds the key to several important aspects of variations in mental health for pregnant and postpartum women. This review describes existing knowledge from studies on immune activation in maternal depression during pregnancy and postpartum, and other important features such as stress reactivity, the microbiome, and its metabolites. The importance of objective measures for screening and prediction is discussed as well as the need for novel therapeutics to treat poor mental health in the perinatal period. The PNI framework could thus be further applied to inform research about the mechanisms of perinatal psychiatric morbidity, which could pave the way for future precision medicine for perinatal mental health issues.© 2021 The Author(s)."

With the advancing development of COVID-19 vaccines and their administration globally, it is expected that COVID-19 will converge in the future; however, the situation remains unpredictable because of a series of reports regarding SARS-CoV-2 variants. Currently, there are still few specific effective treatments for COVID-19, as many unanswered questions remain regarding the pathogenic mechanism of COVID-19. Continued elucidation of COVID-19 pathogenic mechanisms is a matter of global importance. In this regard, recent reports have suggested that epigenetics plays an important role; for instance, the expression of angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, an important factor in human infection with SARS-CoV-2, is epigenetically regulated; further, DNA methylation status is reported to be unique to patients with COVID-19. In this review, we focus on epigenetic mechanisms to provide a new molecular framework for elucidating the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans and of COVID-19, along with the possibility of new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies."
"34600479","DECONbench: a benchmarking platform dedicated to deconvolution methods for tumor heterogeneity quantification.","BMC Bioinformatics","Quantification of tumor heterogeneity is essential to better understand cancer progression and to adapt therapeutic treatments to patient specificities. Bioinformatic tools to assess the different cell populations from single-omic datasets as bulk transcriptome or methylome samples have been recently developed, including reference-based and reference-free methods. Improved methods using multi-omic datasets are yet to be developed in the future and the community would need systematic tools to perform a comparative evaluation of these algorithms on controlled data.We present DECONbench, a standardized unbiased benchmarking resource, applied to the evaluation of computational methods quantifying cell-type heterogeneity in cancer. DECONbench includes gold standard simulated benchmark datasets, consisting of transcriptome and methylome profiles mimicking pancreatic adenocarcinoma molecular heterogeneity, and a set of baseline deconvolution methods (reference-free algorithms inferring cell-type proportions). DECONbench performs a systematic performance evaluation of each new methodological contribution and provides the possibility to publicly share source code and scoring.DECONbench allows continuous submission of new methods in a user-friendly fashion, each novel contribution being automatically compared to the reference baseline methods, which enables crowdsourced benchmarking. DECONbench is designed to serve as a reference platform for the benchmarking of deconvolution methods in the evaluation of cancer heterogeneity. We believe it will contribute to leverage the benchmarking practices in the biomedical and life science communities. DECONbench is hosted on the open source Codalab competition platform.

"34595540","Genetic overlap between type 1 diabetes and other autoimmune diseases.","Semin Immunopathol","Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a chronic disease caused by the destruction of pancreatic β cells, which is driven by autoreactive T lymphocytes. It has been described that a high proportion of T1D patients develop other autoimmune diseases (AIDs), such as autoimmune thyroid disease, celiac disease, or vitiligo, which suggests the existence of common etiological factors among these disorders. In this regard, genetic studies have identified a high number of loci consistently associated with T1D that also represent established genetic risk factors for other AIDs. In addition, studies focused on identifying the shared genetic component in autoimmunity have described several common susceptibility loci with a potential role in T1D. Elucidation of this genetic overlap has been useful in identifying key molecular pathways with a pathogenic role in multiple disorders. In this review, we summarized recent advances in understanding the shared genetic component between T1D and other AIDs and discuss how the identification of common pathogenic mechanisms can help in the development of new therapeutic approaches as well as in improving the use of existing drugs.© 2021.
