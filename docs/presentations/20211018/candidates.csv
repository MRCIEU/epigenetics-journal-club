no,,EWAS,34635736,HPA axis dysregulation is associated with differential methylation of CpG-sites in related genes.,Sci Rep,"DNA methylation shifts in Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis related genes is reported in psychiatric disorders including hypersexual disorder. This study, comprising 20 dexamethasone suppression test (DST) non-suppressors and 73 controls, examined the association between the HPA axis dysregulation, shifts in DNA methylation of HPA axis related genes and importantly, gene expression. Individuals with cortisol level ≥ 138 nmol/l, after the low dose (0.5 mg) dexamethasone suppression test (DST) were classified as non-suppressors. Genome-wide methylation pattern, measured in whole blood using the EPIC BeadChip, investigated CpG sites located within 2000 bp of the transcriptional start site of key HPA axis genes, i.e.: CRH, CRHBP, CRHR-1, CRHR-2, FKBP5 and NR3C1. Regression models including DNA methylation M-values and the binary outcome (DST non-suppression status) were performed. Gene transcripts with an abundance of differentially methylated CpG sites were identified with binomial tests. Pearson correlations and robust linear regressions were performed between CpG methylation and gene expression in two independent cohorts. Six of 76 CpG sites were significantly hypermethylated in DST non-suppressors (nominal P < 0.05), associated with genes CRH, CRHR1, CRHR2, FKBP5 and NR3C1. NR3C1 transcript AJ877169 showed statistically significant abundance of probes differentially methylated by DST non-suppression status and correlated with DST cortisol levels. Further, methylation levels of cg07733851 and cg27122725 were positively correlated with gene expression levels of the NR3C1 gene. Methylation levels of cg08636224 (FKBP5) correlated with baseline cortisol and gene expression. Our findings revealed that DNA methylation shifts are involved in the altered mechanism of the HPA axis suggesting that new epigenetic targets should be considered behind psychiatric disorders.© 2021.

We compared in an exploratory manner the blood DNA methylome of Japanese Americans (JPA) versus European Americans (EUA).Genome-wide buffy coat DNA methylation was profiled among healthy Multiethnic Cohort participant women who were Japanese (JPA; n = 30) or European (EUA; n = 28) Americans aged 60-65. Differentially methylated CpGs by race/ethnicity (DM-CpGs) were identified by linear regression (Bonferroni-corrected P < 0.1) and analyzed in relation to corresponding gene expression, a priori selected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and blood biomarkers of inflammation and metabolism using Pearson or Spearman correlations (FDR < 0.1).We identified 174 DM-CpGs with the majority of hypermethylated in JPA compared to EUA (n = 133), often in promoter regions (n = 48). Half (51%) of the genes corresponding to the DM-CpGs were involved in liver function and liver disease, and the methylation in nine genes was significantly correlated with gene expression for DM-CpGs. A total of 156 DM-CpGs were associated with rs7489665 (SH2B1). Methylation of DM-CpGs was correlated with blood levels of the cytokine MIP1B (n = 146). We confirmed some of the DM-CpGs in the TCGA adjacent non-tumor liver tissue of Asians versus EUA.We found a number of differentially methylated CpGs in blood DNA between JPA and EUA women with a potential link to liver disease, specific SNPs, and systemic inflammation. These findings may support further research on the role of DNA methylation in mediating some of the higher risk of liver disease among JPA.© 2021. The Author(s)."
yes,,EWAS,34633450,Dichotomy in the Impact of Elevated Maternal Glucose Levels on Neonatal Epigenome.,J Clin Endocrinol Metab,"Antenatal hyperglycemia is associated with increased risk of future adverse health outcomes in both mother and child. Variations in offspring's epigenome can reflect the impact and response to in utero glycemic exposure, and may have different consequences for the child.We examined possible differences in associations of basal glucose status and glucose handling during pregnancy with both clinical covariates and offspring cord tissue DNA methylation.This study included 830 mother-offspring dyads from the GUSTO cohort. The fetal epigenome of umbilical cord tissue was profiled using Illumina HumanMethylation450 arrays. Associations of maternal mid-pregnancy fasting (FPG) and 2h plasma glucose (2hPG) post-75g oral glucose challenge (OGTT) with both maternal clinical phenotypes and offspring epigenome at delivery were investigated separately.Maternal age, pre-pregnancy BMI and blood pressure measures were associated with both FPG and 2hPG; while Chinese ethnicity (p=1.9×10 -4), maternal height (p=1.1×10 -4), pregnancy weight gain (p=2.2×10 -3), pre-pregnancy alcohol consumption (p=4.6×10 -4), and tobacco exposure (p=1.9×10 -3) showed significantly opposite associations between the two glucose measures. Most importantly, we observed a dichotomy in the effects of these glycemic indices on the offspring epigenome. Offspring born to mothers with elevated 2hPG showed global hypomethylation. CpGs most associated with the two glucose measures also reflected differences in gene ontologies and had different associations with offspring birthweight.Our findings suggest that two traditionally used glycemic indices for diagnosing gestational diabetes may reflect distinctive pathophysiologies in pregnancy, and have differential impacts on the offspring's DNA methylome.© The Author(s) 2021.

no,,EWAS,34628353,Genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation in 106 schizophrenia family trios in Han Chinese.,EBioMedicine,"Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a severe psychiatric disorder that affects approximately 0.75% of the global population. Both genetic and environmental factors contribute to development of SCZ. SCZ tends to run in family while both genetic and environmental factor contribute to its etiology. Much evidence suggested that alterations in DNA methylations occurred in SCZ patients.To investigate potential inheritable pattern of DNA methylation in SCZ family, we performed a genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation of peripheral blood samples from 106 Chinese SCZ family trios. Genome-wide DNA methylations were quantified by Agilent 1 × 244 k Human Methylation Microarray.In this study, we proposed a loci inheritance frequency model that allows characterization of differential methylated regions as SCZ biomarkers. Based on this model, 112 hypermethylated and 125 hypomethylated regions were identified. Additionally, 121 hypermethylated and 139 hypomethylated genes were annotated. The results of functional enrichment analysis indicated that multiple differentially methylated genes (DMGs) involved in Notch/HH/Wnt signaling, MAPK signaling, GPCR signaling, immune response signaling. Notably, a number of hypomethylated genes were significantly enriched in cerebral cortex and functionally enriched in nervous system development.Our findings not only validated previously discovered risk genes of SCZ but also identified novel candidate DMGs in SCZ. These results may further the understanding of altered DNA methylations in SCZ.Copyright © 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
yes,,EWAS,34600028,Differential regulation of the DNA methylome in adults born during the Great Chinese Famine in 1959-1961.,Genomics,"Extensive epidemiological studies have established the association between exposure to early-life adversity and health status and diseases in adults. Epigenetic regulation is considered as a key mediator for this phenomenon but analysis on humans is sparse. The Great Chinese Famine lasting from 1958 to 1961 is a natural string of disasters offering a precious opportunity for elucidating the underlying epigenetic mechanism of the long-term effect of early adversity.Using a high-throughput array platform for DNA methylome profiling, we conducted a case-control epigenome-wide association study on early-life exposure to Chinese famine in 79 adults born during 1959-1961 and compared to 105 unexposed subjects born 1963-1964.The single CpG site analysis of whole epigenome revealed a predominant pattern of decreased DNA methylation levels associated with fetal exposure to famine. Four CpG sites were detected with p < 1e-06 (linked to EHMT1, CNR1, UBXN7 and ESM1 genes), 16 CpGs detected with 1e-06 < p < 1e-05 and 157 CpGs with 1e-05 < p < 1e-04, with a predominant pattern of hypomethylation. Functional annotation to genes and their enriched biological pathways mainly involved neurodevelopment, neuropsychological disorders and metabolism. Multiple sites analysis detected two top-rank differentially methylated regions harboring RNF39 on chromosome 6 and PTPRN2 on chromosome 7, both showing epigenetic association with stress-related conditions.Early-life exposure to famine could mediate DNA methylation regulations that persist into adulthood with broad impacts in the activities of genes and biological pathways. Results from this study provide new clues to the epigenetic embedding of early-life adversity and its impacts on adult health.Copyright © 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

yes,,EWAS,34596421,Associations between an integrated component of maternal glycemic regulation in pregnancy and cord blood DNA methylation.,Epigenomics,"Background:Previous studies suggest that fetal programming to hyperglycemia in pregnancy is due to modulation of DNA methylation (DNAm), but they have been limited in their maternal glycemic characterization.Methods:In the Gen3G study, we used a principal component analysis to integrate multiple glucose and insulin values measured during the second trimester oral glucose tolerance test. We investigated associations between principal components and cord blood DNAm levels in an epigenome-wide analysis among 430 mother-child pairs.Results:The first principal component was robustly associated with lower DNAm at cg26974062 (TXNIP; p = 9.9 × 10-9) in cord blood.TXNIPis a well-known DNAm marker for type 2 diabetes in adults.Conclusion:We hypothesize that abnormal glucose metabolism in pregnancy may program dysregulation ofTXNIPacross the life course."
no,,prediction,34534207,Hierarchy and control of ageing-related methylation networks.,PLoS Comput Biol,"DNA methylation provides one of the most widely studied biomarkers of ageing. Since the methylation of CpG dinucleotides function as switches in cellular mechanisms, it is plausible to assume that by proper adjustment of these switches age may be tuned. Though, adjusting hundreds of CpG methylation levels coherently may never be feasible and changing just a few positions may lead to biologically unstable state. A prominent example of methylation-based age estimators is provided by Horvath's clock, based on 353 CpG dinucleotides, showing a high correlation (not necessarily causation) with chronological age across multiple tissue types. On this small subset of CpG dinucleotides we demonstrate how the adjustment of one methylation level leads to a cascade of changes at other sites. Among the studied subset, we locate the most important CpGs (and related genes) that may have a large influence on the rest of the sub-system. According to our analysis, the structure of this network is way more hierarchical compared to what one would expect based on ensembles of uncorrelated connections. Therefore, only a handful of CpGs is enough to modify the system towards a desired state. When propagation of the change over the network is taken into account, the resulting modification in the predicted age can be significantly larger compared to the effect of isolated CpG perturbations. By adjusting the most influential single CpG site and following the propagation of methylation level changes we can reach up to 5.74 years in virtual age reduction, significantly larger than without taking into account of the network control. Extending our approach to the whole methylation network may identify key nodes that have controller role in the ageing process."
no,,genetics,34594039,A cross-population atlas of genetic associations for 220 human phenotypes.,Nat Genet,"Current genome-wide association studies do not yet capture sufficient diversity in populations and scope of phenotypes. To expand an atlas of genetic associations in non-European populations, we conducted 220 deep-phenotype genome-wide association studies (diseases, biomarkers and medication usage) in BioBank Japan (n = 179,000), by incorporating past medical history and text-mining of electronic medical records. Meta-analyses with the UK Biobank and FinnGen (ntotal = 628,000) identified ~5,000 new loci, which improved the resolution of the genomic map of human traits. This atlas elucidated the landscape of pleiotropy as represented by the major histocompatibility complex locus, where we conducted HLA fine-mapping. Finally, we performed statistical decomposition of matrices of phenome-wide summary statistics, and identified latent genetic components, which pinpointed responsible variants and biological mechanisms underlying current disease classifications across populations. The decomposed components enabled genetically informed subtyping of similar diseases (for example, allergic diseases). Our study suggests a potential avenue for hypothesis-free re-investigation of human diseases through genetics.© 2021. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc."
no,,single-cell,34616061,DNA methylation atlas of the mouse brain at single-cell resolution.,Nature,"Mammalian brain cells show remarkable diversity in gene expression, anatomy and function, yet the regulatory DNA landscape underlying this extensive heterogeneity is poorly understood. Here we carry out a comprehensive assessment of the epigenomes of mouse brain cell types by applying single-nucleus DNA methylation sequencing1,2to profile 103,982 nuclei (including 95,815 neurons and 8,167 non-neuronal cells) from 45 regions of the mouse cortex, hippocampus, striatum, pallidum and olfactory areas. We identified 161 cell clusters with distinct spatial locations and projection targets. We constructed taxonomies of these epigenetic types, annotated with signature genes, regulatory elements and transcription factors. These features indicate the potential regulatory landscape supporting the assignment of putative cell types and reveal repetitive usage of regulators in excitatory and inhibitory cells for determining subtypes. The DNA methylation landscape of excitatory neurons in the cortex and hippocampus varied continuously along spatial gradients. Using this deep dataset, we constructed an artificial neural network model that precisely predicts single neuron cell-type identity and brain area spatial location. Integration of high-resolution DNA methylomes with single-nucleus chromatin accessibility data3enabled prediction of high-confidence enhancer-gene interactions for all identified cell types, which were subsequently validated by cell-type-specific chromatin conformation capture experiments4. By combining multi-omic datasets (DNA methylation, chromatin contacts, and open chromatin) from single nuclei and annotating the regulatory genome of hundreds of cell types in the mouse brain, our DNA methylation atlas establishes the epigenetic basis for neuronal diversity and spatial organization throughout the mouse cerebrum.© 2021.

no,,prediction,34587932,"Combined effects of cigarette smoking, DNA methyltransferase 3B genetic polymorphism, and DNA damage on lung cancer.",BMC Cancer,"Smoking increases DNA methylation and DNA damage, and DNA damage acts as a vital cause of tumor development. The DNA methyltransferase 3B (DNMT3B) enhances promoter activity and methylation of tumor suppressor genes. Tea polyphenols may inhibit DNMT activity. We designed a case-control study to evaluate the combined effects of smoking, green tea consumption, DNMT3B - 149 polymorphism, and DNA damage on lung cancer occurrence.Questionnaires were administered to obtain demographic characteristics, life styles, and family histories of lung cancer from 190 primary lung cancer cases and 380 healthy controls. Genotypes and cellular DNA damage were determined by polymerase chain reaction and comet assay, respectively.The mean DNA tail moment for lung cancer cases was significantly higher than that for healthy controls. Compared to nonsmokers carrying the DNMT3B - 149 CT genotype, smokers carrying the TT genotype had a greater lung cancer risk (odds ratio [OR]: 2.83, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.62-4.93). DNA damage levels were divided by the tertile of the healthy controls' values. Compared to nonsmokers with low DNA damage, smokers with moderate DNA damage (OR: 2.37, 95% CI: 1.54-3.63) and smokers with high DNA damage (OR: 3.97, 95% CI: 2.63-5.98) had elevated lung cancer risks. Interaction between smoking and DNA damage significantly affected lung cancer risk.Our study suggested that the DNMT3B - 149 TT genotype, which has higher promoter activity, can increase the lung cancer risk elicited by smoking, and DNA damage may further promote smoking related lung cancer development.© 2021.

The increasing adoption of deep learning across healthcare domains together with the availability of highly characterised cancer datasets has accelerated research into the utility of deep learning in the analysis of the complex biology of cancer. While early results are promising, this is a rapidly evolving field with new knowledge emerging in both cancer biology and deep learning. In this review, we provide an overview of emerging deep learning techniques and how they are being applied to oncology. We focus on the deep learning applications for omics data types, including genomic, methylation and transcriptomic data, as well as histopathology-based genomic inference, and provide perspectives on how the different data types can be integrated to develop decision support tools. We provide specific examples of how deep learning may be applied in cancer diagnosis, prognosis and treatment management. We also assess the current limitations and challenges for the application of deep learning in precision oncology, including the lack of phenotypically rich data and the need for more explainable deep learning models. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of how current obstacles can be overcome to enable future clinical utilisation of deep learning.© 2021. The Author(s)."

Microarrays rely on digital assaying the fluorescence signals of arrays. In this study, we retrospectively constructed raw images for 37 724 published microarray data, and developed deep learning algorithms to automatically detect systematic defects. We report that an alarming amount of 26.73% of the microarray-based studies are affected by serious imaging defects. By literature mining, we found that publications associated with these affected microarrays have reported disproportionately more biological discoveries on the genes in the contaminated areas compared to other genes. 28.82% of the gene-level conclusions reported in these publications were based on measurements falling into the contaminated area, indicating severe, systematic problems caused by such contaminations.

no,,epigenetics,34593797,Chromatin accessibility associates with protein-RNA correlation in human cancer.,Nat Commun,"Although alterations in chromatin structure are known to exist in tumors, how these alterations relate to molecular phenotypes in cancer remains to be demonstrated. Multi-omics profiling of human tumors can provide insight into how alterations in chromatin structure are propagated through the pathway of gene expression to result in malignant protein expression. We applied multi-omics profiling of chromatin accessibility, RNA abundance, and protein abundance to 36 human thyroid cancer primary tumors, metastases, and patient-match normal tissue. Through quantification of chromatin accessibility associated with active transcription units and global protein expression, we identify a local chromatin structure that is highly correlated with coordinated RNA and protein expression. In particular, we identify enhancers located within gene-bodies as predictive of correlated RNA and protein expression, that is independent of overall transcriptional activity. To demonstrate the generalizability of these findings we also identify similar results in an independent cohort of human breast cancers. Taken together, these analyses suggest that local enhancers, rather than distal enhancers, are likely most predictive of cancer gene expression phenotypes. This allows for identification of potential targets for cancer therapeutic approaches and reinforces the utility of multi-omics profiling as a methodology to understand human disease.© 2021.
