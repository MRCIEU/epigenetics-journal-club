,No,dnam age,36346848,In utero exposure to the Great Depression is reflected in late-life epigenetic aging signatures.,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,"Research on maternal-fetal epigenetic programming argues that adverse exposures to the intrauterine environment can have long-term effects on adult morbidity and mortality. However, causal research on epigenetic programming in humans at a population level is rare and is often unable to separate intrauterine effects from conditions in the postnatal period that may continue to impact child development. In this study, we used a quasi-natural experiment that leverages state-year variation in economic shocks during the Great Depression to examine the causal effect of environmental exposures in early life on late-life accelerated epigenetic aging for 832 participants in the US Health and Retirement Study (HRS). HRS is the first population-representative study to collect epigenome-wide DNA methylation data that has the sample size and geographic variation necessary to exploit quasi-random variation in state environments, which expands possibilities for causal research in epigenetics. Our findings suggest that exposure to changing economic conditions in the 1930s had lasting impacts on next-generation epigenetic aging signatures that were developed to predict mortality risk (GrimAge) and physiological decline (DunedinPoAm). We show that these effects are localized to the in utero period specifically as opposed to the preconception, postnatal, childhood, or early adolescent periods. After evaluating endogenous shifts in mortality and fertility related to Depression-era birth cohorts, we conclude that these effects likely represent lower bound estimates of the true impacts of the economic shock on long-term epigenetic aging."
,No,dnam age,36304118,A set of common buccal CpGs that predict epigenetic age and associate with lifespan-regulating genes.,iScience,"Epigenetic aging clocks are computational models that use DNA methylation sites to predict age. Since cheek swabs are non-invasive and painless, collecting DNA from buccal tissue is highly desirable. Here, we review 11 existing clocks that have been applied to buccal tissue. Two of these were exclusively trained on adults and, while moderately accurate, have not been used to capture health-relevant differences in epigenetic age. Using 130 common CpGs utilized by two or more existing buccal clocks, we generate a proof-of-concept predictor in an adult methylomic dataset. In addition to accurately estimating age (r = 0.95 and mean absolute error = 3.88 years), this clock predicted that Down syndrome subjects were significantly older relative to controls. A literature and database review of CpG-associated genes identified numerous genes (e.g.,CLOCK,ELOVL2, andVGF) and molecules (e.g., alpha-linolenic acid, glycine, and spermidine) reported to influence lifespan and/or age-related disease in model organisms.© 2022 The Author(s)."
,No,dnam age,36294002,Do Loneliness and Per Capita Income Combine to Increase the Pace of Biological Aging for Black Adults across Late Middle Age?,Int J Environ Res Public Health,"In a sample of 685 late middle-aged Black adults (M age at 2019 = 57.17 years), we examined the effects of loneliness and per capita income on accelerated aging using a newly developed DNA-methylation based index: the DunedinPACE. First, using linear, mixed effects regression in a growth curve framework, we found that change in DunedinPACE was dependent on age, with a linear model best fitting the data (b = 0.004,p&lt; 0.001), indicating that average pace of change increased among older participants. A quadratic effect was also tested, but was non-significant. Beyond the effect of age, both change in loneliness (b = 0.009,p&lt; 0.05) and change in per capita income (b = -0.016,p&lt; 0.001) were significantly associated with change in DunedinPACE across an 11-year period, accounting for significant between person variability observed in the unconditional model. Including non-self-report indices of smoking and alcohol use did not reduce the association of loneliness or per capita income with DunedinPACE. However, change in smoking was strongly associated with change in DunedinPACE such that those reducing their smoking aged less rapidly than those continuing to smoke. In addition, both loneliness and per capita income were associated with DunedinPACE after controlling for variation in cell-types."
,No,dnam age,36292773,Epigenetic and Proteomic Biomarkers of Elevated Alcohol Use Predict Epigenetic Aging and Cell-Type variation Better Than Self-Report.,Genes (Basel),"Excessive alcohol consumption (EAC) has a generally accepted effect on morbidity and mortality, outcomes thought to be reflected in measures of epigenetic aging (EA). As the association of self-reported EAC with EA has not been consistent with these expectations, underscoring the need for readily employable non-self-report tools for accurately assessing and monitoring the contribution of EAC to accelerated EA, newly developed alcohol consumption DNA methylation indices, such as the Alcohol T Score (ATS) and Methyl DetectR (MDR), may be helpful. To test that hypothesis, we used these new indices along with the carbohydrate deficient transferrin (CDT), concurrent as well as past self-reports of EAC, and well-established measures of cigarette smoking to examine the relationship of EAC to both accelerated EA and immune cell counts in a cohort of 437 young Black American adults. We found that MDR, CDT, and ATS were intercorrelated, even after controlling for gender and cotinine effects. Correlations between EA and self-reported EAC were low or non-significant, replicating prior research, whereas correlations with non-self-report indices were significant and more substantial. Comparing non-self-report indices showed that the ATS predicted more than four times as much variance in EA, CDT4 cells and B-cells as for both the MDR and CDT, and better predicted indices of accelerated EA. We conclude that each of the non-self-report indices have differing predictive capacities with respect to key alcohol-related health outcomes, and that the ATS may be particularly useful for clinicians seeking to understand and prevent accelerated EA. The results also underscore the likelihood of substantial underestimates of problematic use when self-report is used and a reduction in correlations with EA and variance in cell-types."
,No,dnam age,36289503,Marijuana use and DNA methylation-based biological age in young adults.,Clin Epigenetics,"Marijuana is the third most commonly used drug in the USA and efforts to legalize it for medical and recreational use are growing. Despite the increase in use, marijuana's effect on aging remains understudied and understanding the effects of marijuana on molecular aging may provide novel insights into the role of marijuana in the aging process. We therefore sought to investigate the association between cumulative and recent use of marijuana with epigenetic age acceleration (EAA) as estimated from blood DNA methylation.A random subset of participants from The Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study with available whole blood at examination years (Y) 15 and Y20 underwent epigenomic profiling. Four EAA estimates (intrinsic epigenetic age acceleration, extrinsic epigenetic age acceleration, PhenoAge acceleration, and GrimAge acceleration) were calculated from DNA methylation levels measured at Y15 and Y20. Ever use and cumulative marijuana-years were calculated from the baseline visit to Y15 and Y20, and recent marijuana use (both any and number of days of use in the last 30 days) were calculated at Y15 and Y20. Ever use of marijuana and each additional marijuana-year were associated with a 6-month (P < 0.001) and a 2.5-month (P < 0.001) higher average in GrimAge acceleration (GAA) using generalized estimating equations, respectively. Recent use and each additional day of recent use were associated with a 20-month (P < 0.001) and a 1-month (P < 0.001) higher GAA, respectively. A statistical interaction between marijuana-years and alcohol consumption on GAA was observed (P = 0.011), with nondrinkers exhibiting a higher GAA (β = 0.21 [95% CI 0.05, 0.36], P = 0.008) compared to heavy drinkers (β = 0.05 [95% CI - 0.09, 0.18], P = 0.500) per each additional marijuana-year. No associations were observed for the remaining EAA estimates.These findings suggest cumulative and recent marijuana use are associated with age-related epigenetic changes that are related to lifespan. These observed associations may be modified by alcohol consumption. Given the increase in use and legalization, these findings provide novel insight on the effect of marijuana use on the aging process as captured through blood DNA methylation.© 2022. The Author(s)."
,No,dnam age,36227464,Maternal Adversity and Epigenetic Age Acceleration Predict Heightened Emotional Reactivity in Offspring: Implications for Intergenerational Transmission of Risk.,Res Child Adolesc Psychopathol,"Black American women are disproportionately exposed to adversities that may have an intergenerational impact on mental health. The present study examined whether maternal exposure to adversity and epigenetic age acceleration (EAA; a biomarker of stress exposure) predicts the socioemotional health of her offspring. During pregnancy, 180 Black American women self-reported experiences of childhood adversity and marginalization-related adversity (i.e., racial discrimination and gendered racial stress) and provided a blood sample for epigenetic assessment. At a three-year follow-up visit, women reported their offspring's emotional reactivity (an early indicator of psychopathology) via the CBCL/1.5-5. After adjusting for maternal education and offspring sex, results indicated that greater maternal experiences of childhood trauma (β = 0.21, SE(β) = 0.01; p = 0.01) and racial discrimination (β = 0.14, SE(β) = 0.07; p = 0.049) predicted greater offspring emotional reactivity, as did maternal EAA (β = 0.17, SE(β) = 0.09, p = 0.046). Our findings suggest that maternal EAA could serve as an early biomarker for intergenerational risk conferred by maternal adversity, and that 'maternal adversity' must be defined more broadly to include social marginalization, particularly for Black Americans.© 2022.

x,No,ewas,36345830,Association Between DNA Methylation and Blood Pressure: A 5-Year Longitudinal Twin Study.,Hypertension,"Previous EWASs (Epigenome-Wide Association Studies) have reported hundreds of blood pressure (BP) associated 5'-cytosine-phosphate-guanine-3' (CpG) sites. However, their results were inconsistent. Longitudinal observations on the temporal relationship between DNA methylation and BP are lacking.A candidate CpG site association study for BP was conducted on 1072 twins in the Chinese National Twin Registry. PubMed and EMBASE were searched for candidate CpG sites. Cross-lagged models were used to assess the temporal relationship between BP and DNA methylation in 308 twins who completed 2 surveys in 2013 and 2018. Then, the significant cross-lagged associations were validated by adopting the Inference About Causation From Examination of Familial Confounding approach. Finally, to evaluate the cumulative effects of DNA methylation on the progression of hypertension, we established methylation risk scores based on BP-associated CpG sites and performed Markov multistate models.16 and 20 CpG sites were validated to be associated with systolic BP and diastolic BP, respectively. In the cross-lagged analysis, we detected that methylation of 2 CpG sites could predict subsequent systolic BP, and systolic BP predicted methylation at another 3 CpG sites. For diastolic BP, methylation at 3 CpG sites had significant cross-lagged effects for predicting diastolic BP levels, while the prediction from the opposite direction was observed at one site. Among these, 3 associations were validated in the Inference About Causation From Examination of Familial Confounding analysis. Using the Markov multistate model, we observed that methylation risk scores were associated with the development of hypertension.Our findings suggest the significance of DNA methylation in the development of hypertension."
,Yes,ewas,36344488,Epigenome-wide DNA methylation analysis of whole blood cells derived from patients with GAD and OCD in the Chinese Han population.,Transl Psychiatry,"Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) had high comorbidity and affected more than 44 million people around the world leading to a huge burden on health and economy. Here, we conducted an epigenome-wide DNA methylation study employing 93 patients with GAD, 65 patients with OCD, and 302 health controls, to explore epigenetic alterations associated with the onset and differences of GAD and OCD. We identified multiple differentially methylated positions (DMPs) and regions (DMRs): three DMP genes included RIOK3 (cg21515243, p = 8.00 × 10-10), DNASE2 (cg09379601, p = 1.10 × 10-9), and PSMB4 (cg01334186, p = 3.70 × 10-7) and two DMR genes USP6NL (p = 4.50 × 10-4) and CPLX1 (p = 6.95 × 10-4) were associated with the onset of GAD and OCD; three DMPs genes included LDLRAP1 (cg21400344, p = 4.40 × 10-12), ACIN1 (cg23712970, p = 2.98×10-11), and SCRT1 (cg25472897, p = 5.60 × 10-11) and three DMR genes WDR19 (p = 3.39 × 10-3), SYCP1 (p = 6.41 × 10-3), and FAM172A (p = 5.74 × 10-3) were associated with the differences between GAD and OCD. Investigation of epigenetic age and chronological age revealed a different epigenetic development trajectory of GAD and OCD. Conclusively, our findings which yielded robust models may aid in distinguishing patients from healthy controls (AUC = 0.90-0.99) or classifying patients with GAD and OCD (AUC = 0.89-0.99), and may power the precision medicine for them.© 2022.

,Yes,ewas,36326208,Meta-analysis of DNA methylation datasets shows aberrant DNA methylation of thyroid development or function genes in Down syndrome.,Thyroid,"In Down syndrome (DS) there is a high occurrence of congenital hypothyroidism (CH) and subclinical hypothyroidism (SH) early in life. The etiology of CH and early SH in DS remains unclear. Previous research has shown genome-wide transcriptional and epigenetic alterations in DS. Thus, we hypothesized that CH and early SH could be caused by epigenetically driven transcriptional downregulation of thyroid-related genes, through promoter region hypermethylation.We extracted whole blood DNA methylation (DNAm) profiles of DS and non-DS individuals from four independent Illumina array-based datasets (252 DS individuals and 519 non-DS individuals). The data were divided in a discovery and validation dataset. Epigenome-wide association analysis was performed using a linear regression model, after which we filtered for thyroid-related genes.In the discovery dataset, we identified significant associations for DS in 18 thyroid-related genes. 21 of 30 significant differentially methylated positions (DMPs) were also significant in the validation dataset. A meta-analysis of the discovery and validation datasets detected 31 DMPs, including 29 promoter-associated CpGs with identical direction of effect across the datasets, and two differentially methylated regions (DMRs). 27 DMPs were hypomethylated and promoter-associated. The mean methylation difference of hypomethylated thyroid-related DMPs decreased with age.Contrary to our hypothesis of generalized hypermethylation of promoter regions of thyroid-related genes - indicative of epigenetic silencing of promoters and subsequent transcriptional downregulation, causing the biochemical thyroid abnormalities in DS -, we found an enrichment of hypomethylated DMPs annotated to promoter regions of these genes. This suggests that CH and early SH in DS are not caused by differential methylation of thyroid-related genes. Considering epigenetic regulation is dynamic, we hypothesize the observed thyroid-related gene DNAm changes could be a rescue phenomenon in an attempt to ameliorate the thyroid phenotype, through epigenetic upregulation of thyroid-related genes. This hypothesis is supported by the finding of decreasing methylation difference of thyroid-related genes with age. The prevalence of early SH declines with age, so hypothetically, epigenetic upregulation of thyroid-related genes also diminishes. While this study provides interesting insights, the exact origin of CH and early SH in DS remains unknown."
,Yes,ewas,36325427,Immune system disruptions implicated in whole blood epigenome-wide association study of depression among Parkinson's disease patients.,Brain Behav Immun Health,"Although Parkinson's Disease (PD) is typically described in terms of motor symptoms, depression is a common feature. We explored whether depression influences blood-based genome-wide DNA methylation (DNAm) in 692 subjects from a population-based PD case-control study, using both a history of clinically diagnosed depression and current depressive symptoms measured by the geriatric depression scale (GDS). While PD patients in general had more immune activation and more accelerated epigenetic immune system aging than controls, the patients experiencing current depressive symptoms (GDS≥5) showed even higher levels of both markers than patients without current depressive symptoms (GDS<5). For PD patients with a history of clinical depression compared to those without, we found no differences in immune cell composition. However, a history of clinical depression among patients was associated with differentially methylated CpGs. Epigenome-wide association analysis (EWAS) revealed 35 CpGs associated at an FDR≤0.05 (569 CpGs at FDR≤0.10, 1718 CpGs at FDR≤0.15). Gene set enrichment analysis implicated immune system pathways, including immunoregulatory interactions between lymphoid and non-lymphoid cells (p-adj = 0.003) and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction (p-adj = 0.004). Based on functional genomics, 25 (71%) of the FDR≤0.05 CpGs were associated with genetic variation at 45 different methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTL). Twenty-six of the meQTLs were also expression QTLs (eQTLs) associated with the abundance of 53 transcripts in blood and 22 transcripts in brain (substantia nigra, putamen basal ganglia, or frontal cortex). Notably, cg15199181 was strongly related to rs823114 (SNP-CpG p-value = 3.27E-310), a SNP identified in a PD meta-GWAS and related to differential expression ofPM20D1,RAB29,SLC41A1, andNUCKS1. The entire set of genes detected through functional genomics was most strongly overrepresented for interferon-gamma-mediated signaling pathway (enrichment ratio = 18.8, FDR = 4.4e-03) and T cell receptor signaling pathway (enrichment ratio = 13.2, FDR = 4.4e-03). Overall, the current study provides evidence of immune system involvement in depression among Parkinson's patients.© 2022 The Authors."
,Yes,ewas,36319817,Meta-analysis of epigenome-wide association studies of major depressive disorder.,Sci Rep,"Epigenetic mechanisms have been hypothesized to play a role in the etiology of major depressive disorder (MDD). In this study, we performed a meta-analysis between two case-control MDD cohorts to identify differentially methylated positions (DMPs) and differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in MDD. Using samples from two Cohorts (a total of 298 MDD cases and 63 controls with repeated samples, on average ~ 1.8 samples/subject), we performed an EWAS meta-analysis. Multiple cytosine-phosphate-guanine sites annotated to TNNT3 were associated with MDD reaching study-wide significance, including cg08337959 (p = 2.3 × 10-11). Among DMPs with association p values less than 0.0001, pathways from REACTOME such as Ras activation upon Ca2+influx through the NMDA receptor (p = 0.0001, p-adjusted = 0.05) and long-term potentiation (p = 0.0002, p-adjusted = 0.05) were enriched in this study. A total of 127 DMRs with Sidak-corrected p value < 0.05 were identified from the meta-analysis, including DMRs annotated to TNNT3 (chr11: 1948933 to 1949130 [6 probes], Sidak corrected P value = 4.32 × 10-41), S100A13 (chr1: 153599479 to 153600972 [22 probes], Sidak corrected P value = 5.32 × 10-18), NRXN1 (chr2: 50201413 to 50201505 [4 probes], Sidak corrected P value = 1.19 × 10-11), IL17RA (chr22: 17564750 to 17565149, Sidak corrected P value = 9.31 × 10-8), and NPFFR2 (chr4: 72897565 to 72898212, Sidak corrected P value = 8.19 × 10-7). Using 2 Cohorts of depression case-control samples, we identified DMPs and DMRs associated with MDD. The molecular pathways implicated by these data include mechanisms involved in neuronal synaptic plasticity, calcium signaling, and inflammation, consistent with reports from previous genetic and protein biomarker studies indicating that these mechanisms are involved in the neurobiology of depression.© 2022.

,Yes,ewas,36303554,Epigenome-wide association study of biomarkers of liver function identifies albumin-associated DNA methylation sites among male veterans with HIV.,Front Genet,"Background: Liver disease (LD) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality for people with HIV (PWH). The molecular factors linked with LD in PWH are varied and incompletely characterized. We performed an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) to identify associations between DNA methylation (DNAm) and biomarkers of liver function-aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, albumin, total bilirubin, platelet count, FIB-4 score, and APRI score-in male United States veterans with HIV.Methods:Blood samples and clinical data were obtained from 960 HIV-infected male PWH from the Veterans Aging Cohort Study. DNAm was assessed using the Illumina 450K or the EPIC 850K array in two mutually exclusive subsets. We performed a meta-analysis for each DNAm site measured by either platform. We also examined the associations between four measures of DNAm age acceleration (AA) and liver biomarkers.Results:Nine DNAm sites were positively associated with serum albumin in the meta-analysis of the EPIC and 450K EWAS after correcting for multiple testing. Four DNAm sites (cg16936953, cg18942579, cg01409343, and cg12054453), annotated within theTMEM49and four of the remaining five sites (cg18181703, cg03546163, cg20995564, and cg23966214) annotated toSOCS3,FKBP5,ZEB2, andSAMD14genes, respectively. The DNAm site, cg12992827, was not annotated to any known coding sequence. No significant associations were detected for the other six liver biomarkers. Higher PhenoAA was significantly associated with lower level of serum albumin (β= -0.007,p-value = 8.6 × 10-4, CI: -0.011116, -0.002884).Conclusion:We identified epigenetic associations of both individual DNAm sites and DNAm AA with liver function through serum albumin in men with HIV. Further replication analyses in independent cohorts are warranted to confirm the epigenetic mechanisms underlying liver function and LD in PWH.Copyright © 2022 Titanji, Lee, Wang, Chen, Hui, Lo Re III, So-Armah, Justice, Xu, Freiberg, Gwinn, Marconi and Sun."
,No,ewas,36292679,Profiling Genome-Wide DNA Methylation in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder and in Children with Fragile X Syndrome.,Genes (Basel),"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is an early onset, developmental disorder whose genetic cause is heterogeneous and complex. In total, 70% of ASD cases are due to an unknown etiology. Among the monogenic causes of ASD, fragile X syndrome (FXS) accounts for 2-4% of ASD cases, and 60% of individuals with FXS present with ASD. Epigenetic changes, specifically DNA methylation, which modulates gene expression levels, play a significant role in the pathogenesis of both disorders. Thus, in this study, using the Human Methylation EPIC Bead Chip, we examined the global DNA methylation profiles of biological samples derived from 57 age-matched male participants (2-6 years old), including 23 subjects with ASD, 23 subjects with FXS with ASD (FXSA) and 11 typical developing (TD) children. After controlling for technical variation and white blood cell composition, using the conservatory threshold of the false discovery rate (FDR ≤ 0.05), in the three comparison groups, TD vs. AD, TD vs. FXSA and ASD vs. FXSA, we identified 156, 79 and 3100 differentially methylated sites (DMS), and 14, 13 and 263 differential methylation regions (DMRs). Interestingly, several genes differentially methylated among the three groups were among those listed in the SFARI Gene database, including thePAK2,GTF2IandFOXP1genes important for brain development. Further, enrichment analyses identified pathways involved in several functions, including synaptic plasticity. Our preliminary study identified a significant role of altered DNA methylation in the pathology of ASD and FXS, suggesting that the characterization of a DNA methylation signature may help to unravel the pathogenicity of FXS and ASD and may help the development of an improved diagnostic classification of children with ASD and FXSA. In addition, it may pave the way for developing therapeutic interventions that could reverse the altered methylome profile in children with neurodevelopmental disorders."
,Yes,ewas,36292585,Differentially Methylated DNA Regions and Left Ventricular Hypertrophy in African Americans: A HyperGEN Study.,Genes (Basel),"Left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy (LVH) is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, and African Americans experience a disparate high risk of LVH. Genetic studies have identified potential candidate genes and variants related to the condition. Epigenetic modifications may continue to help unravel disease mechanisms. We used methylation and echocardiography data from 636 African Americans selected from the Hypertension Genetic Epidemiology Network (HyperGEN) to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with LVH. DNA extracted from whole blood was assayed on Illumina Methyl450 arrays. We fit linear mixed models to examine associations between co-methylated regions and LV traits, and we then conducted single CpG analyses within significant DMRs. We identified associations between DMRs and ejection fraction (<i>XKR6</i>), LV internal diastolic dimension (<i>TRAK1</i>), LV mass index (<i>GSE1</i>, <i>RPS15 A</i>, <i>PSMD7</i>), and relative wall thickness (<i>DNHD1</i>). In single CpG analysis, CpG sites annotated to <i>TRAK1</i> and <i>DNHD1</i> were significant. These CpGs were not associated with LV traits in replication cohorts but the direction of effect for <i>DNHD1</i> was consistent across cohorts. Of note, <i>DNHD1</i>, <i>GSE1</i>, and <i>PSMD7</i> may contribute to cardiac structural function. Future studies should evaluate relationships between regional DNA methylation patterns and the development of LVH."
,Yes,ewas,36274151,Temporal associations between leukocytes DNA methylation and blood lipids: a longitudinal study.,Clin Epigenetics,"The associations between blood lipids and DNA methylation have been investigated in epigenome-wide association studies mainly among European ancestry populations. Several studies have explored the direction of the association using cross-sectional data, while evidence of longitudinal data is still lacking.We tested the associations between peripheral blood leukocytes DNA methylation and four lipid measures from Illumina 450 K or EPIC arrays in 1084 participants from the Chinese National Twin Registry and replicated the result in 988 participants from the China Kadoorie Biobank. A total of 23 associations of 19 CpG sites were identified, with 4 CpG sites located in or adjacent to 3 genes (TMEM49, SNX5/SNORD17 and CCDC7) being novel. Among the validated associations, we conducted a cross-lagged analysis to explore the temporal sequence and found temporal associations of methylation levels of 2 CpG sites with triglyceride and 2 CpG sites with high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) in all twins. In addition, methylation levels of cg11024682 located in SREBF1 at baseline were temporally associated with triglyceride at follow-up in only monozygotic twins. We then performed a mediation analysis with the longitudinal data and the result showed that the association between body mass index and HDL-C was partially mediated by the methylation level of cg06500161 (ABCG1), with a mediation proportion of 10.1%.Our study indicated that the DNA methylation levels of ABCG1, AKAP1 and SREBF1 may be involved in lipid metabolism and provided evidence for elucidating the regulatory mechanism of lipid homeostasis.© 2022.

,Yes,ewas,36266660,Maternal blood pressure associates with placental DNA methylation both directly and through alterations in cell-type composition.,BMC Med,"Maternal blood pressure levels reflect cardiovascular adaptation to pregnancy and proper maternal-fetal exchanges through the placenta and are very sensitive to numerous environmental stressors. Maternal hypertension during pregnancy has been associated with impaired placental functions and with an increased risk for children to suffer from cardiovascular and respiratory diseases later on. Investigating changes in placental DNA methylation levels and cell-type composition in association with maternal blood pressure could help elucidate its relationships with placental and fetal development.Taking advantage of a large cohort of 666 participants, we investigated the association between epigenome-wide DNA methylation patterns in the placenta, measured using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip, placental cell-type composition, estimated in silico, and repeated measurements of maternal steady and pulsatile blood pressure indicators during pregnancy.At the site-specific level, no significant association was found between maternal blood pressure and DNA methylation levels after correction for multiple testing (false discovery rate < 0.05), but 5 out of 24 previously found CpG associations were replicated (p-value < 0.05). At the regional level, our analyses highlighted 64 differentially methylated regions significantly associated with at least one blood pressure component, including 35 regions associated with mean arterial pressure levels during late pregnancy. These regions were found enriched for genes implicated in lung development and diseases. Further mediation analyses show that a significant part of the association between steady blood pressure-but not pulsatile pressure-and placental methylation can be explained by alterations in placental cell-type composition. In particular, elevated blood pressure levels are associated with a decrease in the ratio between mesenchymal stromal cells and syncytiotrophoblasts, even in the absence of preeclampsia.This study provides the first evidence that the association between maternal steady blood pressure during pregnancy and placental DNA methylation is both direct and partly explained by changes in cell-type composition. These results could hint at molecular mechanisms linking maternal hypertension to lung development and early origins of childhood respiratory problems and at the importance of controlling maternal blood pressure during pregnancy.© 2022.

x,Yes,ewas,36253871,Local CpG density affects the trajectory and variance of age-associated DNA methylation changes.,Genome Biol,"DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark associated with the repression of gene promoters. Its pattern in the genome is disrupted with age and these changes can be used to statistically predict age with epigenetic clocks. Altered rates of aging inferred from these clocks are observed in human disease. However, the molecular mechanisms underpinning age-associated DNA methylation changes remain unknown. Local DNA sequence can program steady-state DNA methylation levels, but how it influences age-associated methylation changes is unknown.We analyze longitudinal human DNA methylation trajectories at 345,895 CpGs from 600 individuals aged between 67 and 80 to understand the factors responsible for age-associated epigenetic changes at individual CpGs. We show that changes in methylation with age occur at 182,760 loci largely independently of variation in cell type proportions. These changes are especially apparent at 8322 low CpG density loci. Using SNP data from the same individuals, we demonstrate that methylation trajectories are affected by local sequence polymorphisms at 1487 low CpG density loci. More generally, we find that low CpG density regions are particularly prone to change and do so variably between individuals in people aged over 65. This differs from the behavior of these regions in younger individuals where they predominantly lose methylation.Our results, which we reproduce in two independent groups of individuals, demonstrate that local DNA sequence influences age-associated DNA methylation changes in humans in vivo. We suggest that this occurs because interactions between CpGs reinforce maintenance of methylation patterns in CpG dense regions.© 2022. The Author(s)."
,Yes,ewas,36329530,Whole blood methylome-derived features to discriminate endocrine hypertension.,Clin Epigenetics,"Arterial hypertension represents a worldwide health burden and a major risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Hypertension can be primary (primary hypertension, PHT), or secondary to endocrine disorders (endocrine hypertension, EHT), such as Cushing's syndrome (CS), primary aldosteronism (PA), and pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma (PPGL). Diagnosis of EHT is currently based on hormone assays. Efficient detection remains challenging, but is crucial to properly orientate patients for diagnostic confirmation and specific treatment. More accurate biomarkers would help in the diagnostic pathway. We hypothesized that each type of endocrine hypertension could be associated with a specific blood DNA methylation signature, which could be used for disease discrimination. To identify such markers, we aimed at exploring the methylome profiles in a cohort of 255 patients with hypertension, either PHT (n = 42) or EHT (n = 213), and at identifying specific discriminating signatures using machine learning approaches.Unsupervised classification of samples showed discrimination of PHT from EHT. CS patients clustered separately from all other patients, whereas PA and PPGL showed an overall overlap. Global methylation was decreased in the CS group compared to PHT. Supervised comparison with PHT identified differentially methylated CpG sites for each type of endocrine hypertension, showing a diffuse genomic location. Among the most differentially methylated genes, FKBP5 was identified in the CS group. Using four different machine learning methods-Lasso (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator), Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine-predictive models for each type of endocrine hypertension were built on training cohorts (80% of samples for each hypertension type) and estimated on validation cohorts (20% of samples for each hypertension type). Balanced accuracies ranged from 0.55 to 0.74 for predicting EHT, 0.85 to 0.95 for predicting CS, 0.66 to 0.88 for predicting PA, and 0.70 to 0.83 for predicting PPGL.The blood DNA methylome can discriminate endocrine hypertension, with methylation signatures for each type of endocrine disorder.© 2022.

,No,meqtl,36342317,Identification of novel meQTLs strongly associated with rheumatoid arthritis by large-scale epigenome-wide analysis.,FEBS Open Bio,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is highly heritable, and previous studies have suggested that genetic variation may affect susceptibility to RA by altering epigenetic modifications (e.g., DNA methylation). Here, we examined how genetic variation influences DNA methylation (DNAm) in RA by integrating individual genetic variation and DNAm data. Epigenome-wide meQTL (methylation quantitative trait loci) analysis was performed on 354 RA patients and 335 controls, scanning 30,101,744 relationships between 62 SNPs and 485,512 DNA methylation sites. Two regulatory relationship pairs (FDR<0.05) showed very strong associations with RA risk. One was rs10796216-cg00475509, and the DNAm decreased by 0.0168 per addition of allele rs10796216-A. The other was rs6546473-cg13358873, for which a 0.0365 reduction of DNAm at cg13358873 was observed for each addition of allele rs6546473-A, and lower DNAm was found to be significantly associated with RA risk (P = 2.0407e-28). Moreover, both pairs of meQTL showed a strong regulatory relationship only in RA samples, so they can be subsequently considered as risk markers for RA. In conclusion, our integrated analysis of genetic and epigenetic variation suggests that genetic variation may affect the risk of RA by regulating DNA methylation levels. Alterations of DNAm at cg00475509 and cg13358873 loci conferred by rs10796216-A and rs6546473-A allele may suggest a potential risk for RA. Our results deepen our understanding of the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms of RA and provide novel associations that can be further investigated in future studies.This article is protected by copyright.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified 233 genetic variations associated with MS at the genome-wide significant level. Epigenetic studies have pinpointed differentially methylated CpG sites in MS patients. However, the interplay between genetic risk factors and epigenetic regulation remains elusive. Here, we employed a network model to integrate GWAS summary statistics of 14 802 MS cases and 26 703 controls with DNA methylation profiles from 140 MS cases and 139 controls and the human interactome. We identified differentially methylated genes by aggregating additive effects of differentially methylated CpG sites within promoter regions. We reconstructed a gene regulatory network (GRN) using literature-curated transcription factor knowledge. Colocalization of the MS GWAS and methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTL) was performed to assess the GRN. The resultant MS-associated GRN highlighted several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with GWAS-mQTL colocalization: rs6032663, rs6065926, and rs2024568 of CD40 locus, rs9913597 of STAT3 locus, and rs887864 and rs741175 of CIITA locus. Moreover, synergistic mQTL and eQTL signals were identified in CD40, suggesting gene expression alteration was likely induced by epigenetic changes. Web-based Cell-type Specific Enrichment Analysis of Genes (WebCSEA) indicated that the GRN was enriched in T follicular helper cells (p-value = 0.0016). Drug target enrichment analysis of annotations from the Therapeutic Target Database (TTD) revealed the GRN was also enriched with drug target genes (p-value = 3.89 × 10-4), revealing repurposable candidates for MS treatment. These candidates included vorinostat (HDAC1 inhibitor) and sivelestat (ELANE inhibitor), which warrant further investigation.© The Author(s) 2022. Published by Oxford University Press.

While these algorithms often have high prediction accuracy, the consistency of their performance remains to be determined. We therefore conduct a systematic evaluation across 101 different DNAm data preprocessing and normalization strategies and assess how each analytical strategy affects the consistency of 41 DNAm-based predictors.Our analyses are conducted in a large EPIC DNAm array dataset from the Jackson Heart Study (N = 2053) that included 146 pairs of technical replicate samples. By estimating the average absolute agreement between replicate pairs, we show that 32 out of 41 predictors (78%) demonstrate excellent consistency when appropriate data processing and normalization steps are implemented. Across all pairs of predictors, we find a moderate correlation in performance across analytical strategies (mean rho = 0.40, SD = 0.27), highlighting significant heterogeneity in performance across algorithms. Successful or unsuccessful removal of technical variation furthermore significantly impacts downstream phenotypic association analysis, such as all-cause mortality risk associations.We show that DNAm-based algorithms are sensitive to technical variation. The right choice of data processing strategy is important to achieve reproducible estimates and improve prediction accuracy in downstream phenotypic association analyses. For each of the 41 DNAm predictors, we report its degree of consistency and provide the best performing analytical strategy as a guideline for the research community. As DNAm-based predictors become more and more widely used, our work helps improve their performance and standardize their implementation.© 2022. The Author(s)."

Here we show technical noise produces deviations up to 9 years between replicates for six prominent epigenetic clocks, limiting their utility. We present a computational solution to bolster reliability, calculating principal components from CpG-level data as input for biological age prediction. Our retrained principal-component versions of six clocks show agreement between most replicates within 1.5 years, improved detection of clock associations and intervention effects, and reliable longitudinal trajectoriesin vivoandin vitro. This method entails only one additional step compared to traditional clocks, requires no replicates or prior knowledge of CpG reliabilities for training, and can be applied to any existing or future epigenetic biomarker. The high reliability of principal component-based clocks is critical for applications to personalized medicine, longitudinal tracking,in vitrostudies, and clinical trials of aging interventions."
,No,methods,36319638,Unsupervised learning of aging principles from longitudinal data.,Nat Commun,"Age is the leading risk factor for prevalent diseases and death. However, the relation between age-related physiological changes and lifespan is poorly understood. We combined analytical and machine learning tools to describe the aging process in large sets of longitudinal measurements. Assuming that aging results from a dynamic instability of the organism state, we designed a deep artificial neural network, including auto-encoder and auto-regression (AR) components. The AR model tied the dynamics of physiological state with the stochastic evolution of a single variable, the ""dynamic frailty indicator"" (dFI). In a subset of blood tests from the Mouse Phenome Database, dFI increased exponentially and predicted the remaining lifespan. The observation of the limiting dFI was consistent with the late-life mortality deceleration. dFI changed along with hallmarks of aging, including frailty index, molecular markers of inflammation, senescent cell accumulation, and responded to life-shortening (high-fat diet) and life-extending (rapamycin) treatments.© 2022.

We present Chromoformer, a transformer-based, three-dimensional chromatin conformation-aware deep learning architecture that achieves the state-of-the-art performance in the quantitative deciphering of the histone codes in gene regulation. The core essence of Chromoformer architecture lies in the three variants of attention operation, each specialized to model individual hierarchy of transcriptional regulation involving from core promoters to distal elements in contact with promoters through three-dimensional chromatin interactions. In-depth interpretation of Chromoformer reveals that it adaptively utilizes the long-range dependencies between histone modifications associated with transcription initiation and elongation. We also show that the quantitative kinetics of transcription factories and Polycomb group bodies can be captured by Chromoformer. Together, our study highlights the great advantage of attention-based deep modeling of complex interactions in epigenomes.© 2022. The Author(s)."

The development of non-invasive markers is an urgent priority. We report the accurate detection of epithelial OC using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and genome-wide epigenetic analysis of circulating cell free tumor DNA (cfTDNA). In a prospective study, we performed genome-wide DNA methylation profiling of cytosine (CpG) markers. Both conventional logistic regression and six AI platforms were used for OC detection. Further, we performed Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) analysis to elucidate the molecular pathogenesis of OC. A total of 179,238 CpGs were significantly differentially methylated (FDR p-value < 0.05) genome-wide in OC. High OC diagnostic accuracies were achieved. Conventional logistic regression achieved an area under the ROC curve (AUC) [95% CI] 0.99 [± 0.1] with 95% sensitivity and 100% specificity. Multiple AI platforms each achieved high diagnostic accuracies (AUC = 0.99-1.00). For example, for Deep Learning (DL)/AI AUC = 1.00, sensitivity = 100% and 88% specificity. In terms of OC pathogenesis: GSEA analysis identified 'Adipogenesis' and 'retinoblastoma gene in cancer' as the top perturbed molecular pathway in OC.

We evaluated genome-wide DNA methylation data derived from TNBC and normal breast tissues, peripheral blood of TNBC cases and controls and reference samples of sorted blood and mammary cells. Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between TNBC and normal breast tissues were stringently selected, verified and externally validated. A machine-learning algorithm was applied to select the top DMRs, which then were evaluated on plasma-derived circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) samples of TNBC patients and healthy controls. We identified 23 DMRs accounting for the methylation profile of blood cells and reference mammary cells and then selected six top DMRs for cfDNA analysis. We quantified un-/methylated copies of these DMRs by droplet digital PCR analysis in a plasma test set from TNBC patients and healthy controls and confirmed our findings obtained on tissues. Differential cfDNA methylation was confirmed in an independent validation set of plasma samples. A methylation score combining signatures of the top three DMRs overlapping with the SPAG6, LINC10606 and TBCD/ZNF750 genes had the best capability to discriminate TNBC patients from controls (AUC = 0.78 in the test set and AUC = 0.74 in validation set).

For example, in a study to develop a predictive model for cancer survival based on gene expression, effect sizes from previous studies or the grouping of genes based on pathways constitute such prior knowledge. However, this external information is typically only used post-analysis to aid in the interpretation of any findings. We propose a new hierarchical two-level ridge regression model that can integrate external information in the form of ""meta features"" to predict an outcome. We show that the model can be fit efficiently using cyclic coordinate descent by recasting the problem as a single-level regression model. In a simulation-based evaluation we show that the proposed method outperforms standard ridge regression and competing methods that integrate prior information, in terms of prediction performance when the meta features are informative on the mean of the features, and that there is no loss in performance when the meta features are uninformative. We demonstrate our approach with applications to the prediction of chronological age based on methylation features and breast cancer mortality based on gene expression features."

There is a need to identify at-risk individuals early that would benefit from timely medical interventions. DNA methylation provides an opportunity to identify an epigenetic signature of individuals at increased risk. We utilized machine learning to identify DNA methylation signatures of COVID-19 disease from data available through NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus. A training cohort of 460 individuals (164 COVID-19-infected and 296 non-infected) and an external validation dataset of 128 individuals (102 COVID-19-infected and 26 non-COVID-associated pneumonia) were reanalyzed. Data was processed using ChAMP and beta values were logit transformed. The JADBio AutoML platform was leveraged to identify a methylation signature associated with severe COVID-19 disease. We identified a random forest classification model from 4 unique methylation sites with the power to discern individuals with severe COVID-19 disease. The average area under the curve of receiver operator characteristic (AUC-ROC) of the model was 0.933 and the average area under the precision-recall curve (AUC-PRC) was 0.965. When applied to our external validation, this model produced an AUC-ROC of 0.898 and an AUC-PRC of 0.864.

Liquid biopsy provides opportunities to gain insights into the underlying biology. Here, using the highly sensitive enrichment-based sequencing technology, we provide analysis of 60 and 175 plasma DNA methylomes from patients with localized and metastatic prostate cancer, respectively. We show that the cell-free DNA methylome can capture variations beyond the tumor. A global hypermethylation in metastatic samples is observed, coupled with hypomethylation in the pericentromeric regions. Hypermethylation at the promoter of a glucocorticoid receptor gene NR3C1 is associated with a decreased immune signature. The cell-free DNA methylome is reflective of clinical outcomes and can distinguish different disease types with 0.989 prediction accuracy.

To identify potential stroke therapeutic targets, we estimate the causal effects of 308 plasma proteins on stroke outcomes in a two-sample Mendelian randomization framework and assess mediation effects by stroke risk factors. We find associations between genetically predicted plasma levels of six proteins and stroke (P ≤ 1.62 × 10-4). The genetic associations with stroke colocalize (Posterior Probability >0.7) with the genetic associations of four proteins (TFPI, TMPRSS5, CD6, CD40). Mendelian randomization supports atrial fibrillation, body mass index, smoking, blood pressure, white matter hyperintensities and type 2 diabetes as stroke risk factors (P ≤ 0.0071). Body mass index, white matter hyperintensity and atrial fibrillation appear to mediate the TFPI, IL6RA, TMPRSS5 associations with stroke. Furthermore, thirty-six proteins are associated with one or more of these risk factors using Mendelian randomization.

Plasma biomarkers are strongly needed for specific diagnosis and potential treatment monitoring of FTD. We aimed to identify specific FTD plasma biomarker profiles discriminating FTD from AD and controls, and between FTD pathological subtypes. In addition, we compared plasma results with results in post-mortem frontal cortex of FTD cases to understand the underlying process.Plasma proteins (n = 1303) from pathologically and/or genetically confirmed FTD patients (n = 56; FTLD-Tau n = 16; age = 58.2 ± 6.2; 44% female, FTLD-TDP n = 40; age = 59.8 ± 7.9; 45% female), AD patients (n = 57; age = 65.5 ± 8.0; 39% female), and non-demented controls (n = 148; 61.3 ± 7.9; 41% female) were measured using an aptamer-based proteomic technology (SomaScan). In addition, exploratory analysis in post-mortem frontal brain cortex of FTD (n = 10; FTLD-Tau n = 5; age = 56.2 ± 6.9, 60% female, and FTLD-TDP n = 5; age = 64.0 ± 7.7, 60% female) and non-demented controls (n = 4; age = 61.3 ± 8.1; 75% female) were also performed. Differentially regulated plasma and tissue proteins were identified by global testing adjusting for demographic variables and multiple testing. Logistic lasso regression was used to identify plasma protein panels discriminating FTD from non-demented controls and AD, or FTLD-Tau from FTLD-TDP. Performance of the discriminatory plasma protein panels was based on predictions obtained from bootstrapping with 1000 resampled analysis.Overall plasma protein expression profiles differed between FTD, AD and controls (6 proteins; p = 0.005), but none of the plasma proteins was specifically associated to FTD. The overall tissue protein expression profile differed between FTD and controls (7-proteins; p = 0.003). There was no difference in overall plasma or tissue expression profile between FTD subtypes. Regression analysis revealed a panel of 12-plasma proteins discriminating FTD from AD with high accuracy (AUC: 0.99). No plasma protein panels discriminating FTD from controls or FTD pathological subtypes were identified.We identified a promising plasma protein panel as a minimally-invasive tool to aid in the differential diagnosis of FTD from AD, which was primarily associated to AD pathophysiology. The lack of plasma profiles specifically associated to FTD or its pathological subtypes might be explained by FTD heterogeneity, calling for FTD studies using large and well-characterize cohorts.© 2022.

Due to the inaccessibility of brain tissue in humans, several studies use peripheral tissues such as blood, buccal swabs, and saliva as surrogates. To aid the functional interpretation of EWAS findings in such settings, there is a need to assess the correlation of DNAm variability across tissues in the same individuals. In this study, we performed a correlation analysis between DNAm data of a total of n = 120 matched post-mortem buccal and prefrontal cortex samples. We identified nearly 25,000 (3% of approximately 730,000) cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites showing significant (false discovery rate q < 0.05) correlations between buccal and PFC samples. Correlated CpG sites showed a preponderance to being located in promoter regions and showed a significant enrichment of being determined by genetic factors, i.e. methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTL), based on buccal and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex mQTL databases.

DNAm differences between patients with and without POD were examined. We also conducted enrichment analysis based on the top DNAm signals.The most different CpG site between control and POD was found at cg16526133 near the ADAMTS9 gene from the brain tissue(p = 8.66E-08). However, there are no CpG sites to reach the genome-wide significant level. The enrichment analysis based on the 1000 top hit CpG site (p < 0.05) on the four tissues showed several intriguing pathways.

Dynamic control of DNA methylation is therefore vital for embryogenesis, yet the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood.

Results: Here we report a single-cell transcriptomic atlas from Dnmt and Tet mutant mouse embryos during early organogenesis. We show that both the maintenance and de novo methyltransferase enzymes are dispensable for the formation of all major cell types at E8.5. However, DNA methyltransferases are required for silencing of prior or alternative cell fates such as pluripotency and extraembryonic programmes. Deletion of all three TET enzymes produces substantial lineage biases, in particular, a failure to generate primitive erythrocytes. Single-cell multi-omics profiling moreover reveals that this is linked to a failure to demethylate distal regulatory elements in Tet triple-knockout embryos.

Conclusions: This study provides a detailed analysis of the effects of perturbing DNA methylation on mouse organogenesis at a whole organism scale and affords new insights into the regulatory mechanisms of cell fate decisions."
,No,dnam age,31554804,Ageing affects DNA methylation drift and transcriptional cell-to-cell variability in mouse muscle stem cells,Nat Commun,"Age-related tissue alterations have been associated with a decline in stem cell number and function. Although increased cell-to-cell variability in transcription or epigenetic marks has been proposed to be a major hallmark of ageing, little is known about the molecular diversity of stem cells during ageing. Here we present a single cell multi-omics study of mouse muscle stem cells, combining single-cell transcriptome and DNA methylome profiling. Aged cells show a global increase of uncoordinated transcriptional heterogeneity biased towards genes regulating cell-niche interactions. We find context-dependent alterations of DNA methylation in aged stem cells. Importantly, promoters with increased methylation heterogeneity are associated with increased transcriptional heterogeneity of the genes they drive. These results indicate that epigenetic drift, by accumulation of stochastic DNA methylation changes in promoters, is associated with the degradation of coherent transcriptional networks during stem cell ageing. Furthermore, our observations also shed light on the mechanisms underlying the DNA methylation clock."

Given the relatively low success rates of assisted reproductive technologies (ART; ?25%), additives and adjuvants, such as glucocorticoids, are used to improve the success rate. Considering the dynamic developmental events that occur during this window, these exposures may alter blastocyst formation at a molecular level, and as such, affect not only the viability of the embryo and the ability of the blastocyst to implant, but also the developmental trajectory of the first three cell lineages, ultimately influencing the physiology of the embryo. In this study, we present a comprehensive single-cell transcriptome, methylome, and small RNA atlas in the day 7 human embryo. We show that, despite no change in morphology and developmental features, preimplantation glucocorticoid exposure reprograms the molecular profile of the TE lineage, and these changes are associated with an altered metabolic and inflammatory response. Our data also suggest that glucocorticoids can precociously mature the TE sublineages, supported by the presence of extravillous trophoblast markers in the polar sublineage and presence of X Chromosome dosage compensation. Further, we have elucidated that epigenetic regulation-DNA methylation and microRNAs (miRNAs)-likely underlies the transcriptional changes observed. This study suggests that exposures to exogenous compounds during preimplantation may unintentionally reprogram the human embryo, possibly leading to suboptimal development and longer-term health outcomes."
