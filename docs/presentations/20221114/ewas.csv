36266660,BMC Med,placenta,maternal blood pressure,666 births,null,Maternal blood pressure associates with placental DNA methylation both directly and through alterations in cell-type composition.,"Maternal blood pressure levels reflect cardiovascular adaptation to pregnancy and proper maternal-fetal exchanges through the placenta and are very sensitive to numerous environmental stressors. Maternal hypertension during pregnancy has been associated with impaired placental functions and with an increased risk for children to suffer from cardiovascular and respiratory diseases later on. Investigating changes in placental DNA methylation levels and cell-type composition in association with maternal blood pressure could help elucidate its relationships with placental and fetal development.Taking advantage of a large cohort of 666 participants, we investigated the association between epigenome-wide DNA methylation patterns in the placenta, measured using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip, placental cell-type composition, estimated in silico, and repeated measurements of maternal steady and pulsatile blood pressure indicators during pregnancy.At the site-specific level, no significant association was found between maternal blood pressure and DNA methylation levels after correction for multiple testing (false discovery rate < 0.05), but 5 out of 24 previously found CpG associations were replicated (p-value < 0.05). At the regional level, our analyses highlighted 64 differentially methylated regions significantly associated with at least one blood pressure component, including 35 regions associated with mean arterial pressure levels during late pregnancy. These regions were found enriched for genes implicated in lung development and diseases. Further mediation analyses show that a significant part of the association between steady blood pressure-but not pulsatile pressure-and placental methylation can be explained by alterations in placental cell-type composition. In particular, elevated blood pressure levels are associated with a decrease in the ratio between mesenchymal stromal cells and syncytiotrophoblasts, even in the absence of preeclampsia.This study provides the first evidence that the association between maternal steady blood pressure during pregnancy and placental DNA methylation is both direct and partly explained by changes in cell-type composition. These results could hint at molecular mechanisms linking maternal hypertension to lung development and early origins of childhood respiratory problems and at the importance of controlling maternal blood pressure during pregnancy.© 2022.

36329530,Clin Epigenetics,endocrine hypertension ,blood,255 hypertensive patients with or without endocrine disorders,over 100K sites?,Whole blood methylome-derived features to discriminate endocrine hypertension.,"Arterial hypertension represents a worldwide health burden and a major risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Hypertension can be primary (primary hypertension, PHT), or secondary to endocrine disorders (endocrine hypertension, EHT), such as Cushing's syndrome (CS), primary aldosteronism (PA), and pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma (PPGL). Diagnosis of EHT is currently based on hormone assays. Efficient detection remains challenging, but is crucial to properly orientate patients for diagnostic confirmation and specific treatment. More accurate biomarkers would help in the diagnostic pathway. We hypothesized that each type of endocrine hypertension could be associated with a specific blood DNA methylation signature, which could be used for disease discrimination. To identify such markers, we aimed at exploring the methylome profiles in a cohort of 255 patients with hypertension, either PHT (n = 42) or EHT (n = 213), and at identifying specific discriminating signatures using machine learning approaches.Unsupervised classification of samples showed discrimination of PHT from EHT. CS patients clustered separately from all other patients, whereas PA and PPGL showed an overall overlap. Global methylation was decreased in the CS group compared to PHT. Supervised comparison with PHT identified differentially methylated CpG sites for each type of endocrine hypertension, showing a diffuse genomic location. Among the most differentially methylated genes, FKBP5 was identified in the CS group. Using four different machine learning methods-Lasso (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator), Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine-predictive models for each type of endocrine hypertension were built on training cohorts (80% of samples for each hypertension type) and estimated on validation cohorts (20% of samples for each hypertension type). Balanced accuracies ranged from 0.55 to 0.74 for predicting EHT, 0.85 to 0.95 for predicting CS, 0.66 to 0.88 for predicting PA, and 0.70 to 0.83 for predicting PPGL.The blood DNA methylome can discriminate endocrine hypertension, with methylation signatures for each type of endocrine disorder.© 2022.

36325427,Brain Behav Immun Health,history of clinical depression,blood,692 Parkinon's Disease patients,35,Immune system disruptions implicated in whole blood epigenome-wide association study of depression among Parkinson's disease patients.,"Although Parkinson's Disease (PD) is typically described in terms of motor symptoms, depression is a common feature. We explored whether depression influences blood-based genome-wide DNA methylation (DNAm) in 692 subjects from a population-based PD case-control study, using both a history of clinically diagnosed depression and current depressive symptoms measured by the geriatric depression scale (GDS). While PD patients in general had more immune activation and more accelerated epigenetic immune system aging than controls, the patients experiencing current depressive symptoms (GDS≥5) showed even higher levels of both markers than patients without current depressive symptoms (GDS<5). For PD patients with a history of clinical depression compared to those without, we found no differences in immune cell composition. However, a history of clinical depression among patients was associated with differentially methylated CpGs. Epigenome-wide association analysis (EWAS) revealed 35 CpGs associated at an FDR≤0.05 (569 CpGs at FDR≤0.10, 1718 CpGs at FDR≤0.15). Gene set enrichment analysis implicated immune system pathways, including immunoregulatory interactions between lymphoid and non-lymphoid cells (p-adj = 0.003) and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction (p-adj = 0.004). Based on functional genomics, 25 (71%) of the FDR≤0.05 CpGs were associated with genetic variation at 45 different methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTL). Twenty-six of the meQTLs were also expression QTLs (eQTLs) associated with the abundance of 53 transcripts in blood and 22 transcripts in brain (substantia nigra, putamen basal ganglia, or frontal cortex). Notably, cg15199181 was strongly related to rs823114 (SNP-CpG p-value = 3.27E-310), a SNP identified in a PD meta-GWAS and related to differential expression ofPM20D1,RAB29,SLC41A1, andNUCKS1. The entire set of genes detected through functional genomics was most strongly overrepresented for interferon-gamma-mediated signaling pathway (enrichment ratio = 18.8, FDR = 4.4e-03) and T cell receptor signaling pathway (enrichment ratio = 13.2, FDR = 4.4e-03). Overall, the current study provides evidence of immune system involvement in depression among Parkinson's patients.© 2022 The Authors."
36319817,Sci Rep,major depressive disorder,blood,298 MDD cases and 63 controls,multiple sites linked to TNNT3,Meta-analysis of epigenome-wide association studies of major depressive disorder.,"Epigenetic mechanisms have been hypothesized to play a role in the etiology of major depressive disorder (MDD). In this study, we performed a meta-analysis between two case-control MDD cohorts to identify differentially methylated positions (DMPs) and differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in MDD. Using samples from two Cohorts (a total of 298 MDD cases and 63 controls with repeated samples, on average ~ 1.8 samples/subject), we performed an EWAS meta-analysis. Multiple cytosine-phosphate-guanine sites annotated to TNNT3 were associated with MDD reaching study-wide significance, including cg08337959 (p = 2.3 × 10-11). Among DMPs with association p values less than 0.0001, pathways from REACTOME such as Ras activation upon Ca2+influx through the NMDA receptor (p = 0.0001, p-adjusted = 0.05) and long-term potentiation (p = 0.0002, p-adjusted = 0.05) were enriched in this study. A total of 127 DMRs with Sidak-corrected p value < 0.05 were identified from the meta-analysis, including DMRs annotated to TNNT3 (chr11: 1948933 to 1949130 [6 probes], Sidak corrected P value = 4.32 × 10-41), S100A13 (chr1: 153599479 to 153600972 [22 probes], Sidak corrected P value = 5.32 × 10-18), NRXN1 (chr2: 50201413 to 50201505 [4 probes], Sidak corrected P value = 1.19 × 10-11), IL17RA (chr22: 17564750 to 17565149, Sidak corrected P value = 9.31 × 10-8), and NPFFR2 (chr4: 72897565 to 72898212, Sidak corrected P value = 8.19 × 10-7). Using 2 Cohorts of depression case-control samples, we identified DMPs and DMRs associated with MDD. The molecular pathways implicated by these data include mechanisms involved in neuronal synaptic plasticity, calcium signaling, and inflammation, consistent with reports from previous genetic and protein biomarker studies indicating that these mechanisms are involved in the neurobiology of depression.© 2022.

36303554,Front Genet,albumin,blood,960 HIV-infected males,9 sites,Epigenome-wide association study of biomarkers of liver function identifies albumin-associated DNA methylation sites among male veterans with HIV.,"Background: Liver disease (LD) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality for people with HIV (PWH). The molecular factors linked with LD in PWH are varied and incompletely characterized. We performed an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) to identify associations between DNA methylation (DNAm) and biomarkers of liver function-aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, albumin, total bilirubin, platelet count, FIB-4 score, and APRI score-in male United States veterans with HIV.Methods:Blood samples and clinical data were obtained from 960 HIV-infected male PWH from the Veterans Aging Cohort Study. DNAm was assessed using the Illumina 450K or the EPIC 850K array in two mutually exclusive subsets. We performed a meta-analysis for each DNAm site measured by either platform. We also examined the associations between four measures of DNAm age acceleration (AA) and liver biomarkers.Results:Nine DNAm sites were positively associated with serum albumin in the meta-analysis of the EPIC and 450K EWAS after correcting for multiple testing. Four DNAm sites (cg16936953, cg18942579, cg01409343, and cg12054453), annotated within theTMEM49and four of the remaining five sites (cg18181703, cg03546163, cg20995564, and cg23966214) annotated toSOCS3,FKBP5,ZEB2, andSAMD14genes, respectively. The DNAm site, cg12992827, was not annotated to any known coding sequence. No significant associations were detected for the other six liver biomarkers. Higher PhenoAA was significantly associated with lower level of serum albumin (β= -0.007,p-value = 8.6 × 10-4, CI: -0.011116, -0.002884).Conclusion:We identified epigenetic associations of both individual DNAm sites and DNAm AA with liver function through serum albumin in men with HIV. Further replication analyses in independent cohorts are warranted to confirm the epigenetic mechanisms underlying liver function and LD in PWH.Copyright © 2022 Titanji, Lee, Wang, Chen, Hui, Lo Re III, So-Armah, Justice, Xu, Freiberg, Gwinn, Marconi and Sun."
36253871,Genome Biol,age,blood,600 elderly ,182760 sites ,Local CpG density affects the trajectory and variance of age-associated DNA methylation changes.,"DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark associated with the repression of gene promoters. Its pattern in the genome is disrupted with age and these changes can be used to statistically predict age with epigenetic clocks. Altered rates of aging inferred from these clocks are observed in human disease. However, the molecular mechanisms underpinning age-associated DNA methylation changes remain unknown. Local DNA sequence can program steady-state DNA methylation levels, but how it influences age-associated methylation changes is unknown.We analyze longitudinal human DNA methylation trajectories at 345,895 CpGs from 600 individuals aged between 67 and 80 to understand the factors responsible for age-associated epigenetic changes at individual CpGs. We show that changes in methylation with age occur at 182,760 loci largely independently of variation in cell type proportions. These changes are especially apparent at 8322 low CpG density loci. Using SNP data from the same individuals, we demonstrate that methylation trajectories are affected by local sequence polymorphisms at 1487 low CpG density loci. More generally, we find that low CpG density regions are particularly prone to change and do so variably between individuals in people aged over 65. This differs from the behavior of these regions in younger individuals where they predominantly lose methylation.Our results, which we reproduce in two independent groups of individuals, demonstrate that local DNA sequence influences age-associated DNA methylation changes in humans in vivo. We suggest that this occurs because interactions between CpGs reinforce maintenance of methylation patterns in CpG dense regions.© 2022. The Author(s)."
36292585,Genes (Basel),left ventricular hypertrophy,blood,636 African American adults,2 sites,Differentially Methylated DNA Regions and Left Ventricular Hypertrophy in African Americans: A HyperGEN Study.,"Left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy (LVH) is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, and African Americans experience a disparate high risk of LVH. Genetic studies have identified potential candidate genes and variants related to the condition. Epigenetic modifications may continue to help unravel disease mechanisms. We used methylation and echocardiography data from 636 African Americans selected from the Hypertension Genetic Epidemiology Network (HyperGEN) to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with LVH. DNA extracted from whole blood was assayed on Illumina Methyl450 arrays. We fit linear mixed models to examine associations between co-methylated regions and LV traits, and we then conducted single CpG analyses within significant DMRs. We identified associations between DMRs and ejection fraction (<i>XKR6</i>), LV internal diastolic dimension (<i>TRAK1</i>), LV mass index (<i>GSE1</i>, <i>RPS15 A</i>, <i>PSMD7</i>), and relative wall thickness (<i>DNHD1</i>). In single CpG analysis, CpG sites annotated to <i>TRAK1</i> and <i>DNHD1</i> were significant. These CpGs were not associated with LV traits in replication cohorts but the direction of effect for <i>DNHD1</i> was consistent across cohorts. Of note, <i>DNHD1</i>, <i>GSE1</i>, and <i>PSMD7</i> may contribute to cardiac structural function. Future studies should evaluate relationships between regional DNA methylation patterns and the development of LVH."
36344488,Transl Psychiatry,generalised anxiety disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder,blood,460 Chinese adults,3 sites; 3 sites differentiate GAD and OCD,Epigenome-wide DNA methylation analysis of whole blood cells derived from patients with GAD and OCD in the Chinese Han population.,"Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) had high comorbidity and affected more than 44 million people around the world leading to a huge burden on health and economy. Here, we conducted an epigenome-wide DNA methylation study employing 93 patients with GAD, 65 patients with OCD, and 302 health controls, to explore epigenetic alterations associated with the onset and differences of GAD and OCD. We identified multiple differentially methylated positions (DMPs) and regions (DMRs): three DMP genes included RIOK3 (cg21515243, p = 8.00 × 10-10), DNASE2 (cg09379601, p = 1.10 × 10-9), and PSMB4 (cg01334186, p = 3.70 × 10-7) and two DMR genes USP6NL (p = 4.50 × 10-4) and CPLX1 (p = 6.95 × 10-4) were associated with the onset of GAD and OCD; three DMPs genes included LDLRAP1 (cg21400344, p = 4.40 × 10-12), ACIN1 (cg23712970, p = 2.98×10-11), and SCRT1 (cg25472897, p = 5.60 × 10-11) and three DMR genes WDR19 (p = 3.39 × 10-3), SYCP1 (p = 6.41 × 10-3), and FAM172A (p = 5.74 × 10-3) were associated with the differences between GAD and OCD. Investigation of epigenetic age and chronological age revealed a different epigenetic development trajectory of GAD and OCD. Conclusively, our findings which yielded robust models may aid in distinguishing patients from healthy controls (AUC = 0.90-0.99) or classifying patients with GAD and OCD (AUC = 0.89-0.99), and may power the precision medicine for them.© 2022.

36274151,Clin Epigenetics,4 lipid measures,blood,1084 from the Chinese National Twin Registry,19 sites,Temporal associations between leukocytes DNA methylation and blood lipids: a longitudinal study.,"The associations between blood lipids and DNA methylation have been investigated in epigenome-wide association studies mainly among European ancestry populations. Several studies have explored the direction of the association using cross-sectional data, while evidence of longitudinal data is still lacking.We tested the associations between peripheral blood leukocytes DNA methylation and four lipid measures from Illumina 450 K or EPIC arrays in 1084 participants from the Chinese National Twin Registry and replicated the result in 988 participants from the China Kadoorie Biobank. A total of 23 associations of 19 CpG sites were identified, with 4 CpG sites located in or adjacent to 3 genes (TMEM49, SNX5/SNORD17 and CCDC7) being novel. Among the validated associations, we conducted a cross-lagged analysis to explore the temporal sequence and found temporal associations of methylation levels of 2 CpG sites with triglyceride and 2 CpG sites with high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) in all twins. In addition, methylation levels of cg11024682 located in SREBF1 at baseline were temporally associated with triglyceride at follow-up in only monozygotic twins. We then performed a mediation analysis with the longitudinal data and the result showed that the association between body mass index and HDL-C was partially mediated by the methylation level of cg06500161 (ABCG1), with a mediation proportion of 10.1%.Our study indicated that the DNA methylation levels of ABCG1, AKAP1 and SREBF1 may be involved in lipid metabolism and provided evidence for elucidating the regulatory mechanism of lipid homeostasis.© 2022.
