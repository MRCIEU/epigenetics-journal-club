,No,20230323,dnamage,36865294,Higher testosterone and testosterone/estradiol ratio in men are associated with better epigenetic estimators of mortality risk.,medRxiv,"Sex hormones are hypothesized to drive sex-specific health disparities. Here, we study the association between sex steroid hormones and DNA methylation-based (DNAm) biomarkers of age and mortality risk including Pheno Age Acceleration (AA), Grim AA, and DNAm-based estimators of Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor 1 (PAI1), and leptin concentrations.We pooled data from three population-based cohorts, the Framingham Heart Study Offspring Cohort (FHS), the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA), and the InCHIANTI Study, including 1,062 postmenopausal women without hormone therapy and 1,612 men of European descent. Sex hormone concentrations were standardized with mean 0 and standard deviation of 1, for each study and sex separately. Sex-stratified analyses using a linear mixed regression were performed, with a Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) adjustment for multiple testing. Sensitivity analysis was performed excluding the previously used training-set for the development of Pheno and Grim age.Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG) is associated with a decrease in DNAm PAI1 among men (per 1 standard deviation (SD): -478 pg/mL; 95%CI: -614 to -343; P:1e-11; BH-P: 1e-10), and women (-434 pg/mL; 95%CI: -589 to -279; P:1e-7; BH-P:2e-6). The testosterone/estradiol (TE) ratio was associated with a decrease in Pheno AA (-0.41 years; 95%CI: -0.70 to -0.12; P:0.01; BH-P: 0.04), and DNAm PAI1 (-351 pg/mL; 95%CI: -486 to -217; P:4e-7; BH-P:3e-6) among men. In men, 1 SD increase in total testosterone was associated with a decrease in DNAm PAI1 (-481 pg/mL; 95%CI: -613 to -349; P:2e-12; BH-P:6e-11).SHBG was associated with lower DNAm PAI1 among men and women. Higher testosterone and testosterone/estradiol ratio were associated with lower DNAm PAI and a younger epigenetic age in men. A decrease in DNAm PAI1 is associated with lower mortality and morbidity risk indicating a potential protective effect of testosterone on lifespan and conceivably cardiovascular health via DNAm PAI1."

Patients were scanned by TI weighted imaging before and after 8-week risperidone monotherapy. CT estimation was automatically performed with the FreeSurfer software package. Participants' peripheral blood genomic DNA methylation (DNAm) status, quantified by using Infinium®Human Methylation 450K BeadChip, was examined in parallel with T1 scanning. In total, CT measures from 118 subjects and genomic DNAm status from 114 subjects were finally collected. Partial least squares (PLS) regression was used to detect the spatial associations between longitudinal CT variations after treatment and cortical transcriptomic data acquired from the Allen Human Brain Atlas. Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) was then performed to identify multivariate associations between DNAm of PLS1 genes and patients' clinical improvement.We detected the significant PLS1 component (2,098 genes) related to longitudinal alterations of CT, and the PLS1 genes were significantly enriched in neurobiological processes, and dopaminergic- and cancer-related pathways. Combining Laplacian score and CCA analysis, we further linked DNAm of 33 representative genes from the 2,098 PLS1 genes with patients' reduction rate of clinical symptoms.This study firstly revealed that changes of CT and clinical behaviors after treatment may be transcriptionally and epigenetically underlied. We define a ""three-step"" roadmap which represents a vital step toward the exploration of treatment- and treatment response-related biomarkers on the basis of multiple omics rather than a single omics type as a strategy for advancing precise care.Copyright © 2023 Zong, Wang, Nie, Ma, Kang, Zhang, Weng, Tan, Zheng and Hu."
matt,No,20230323,short tandem repeats,36940239,Native functions of short tandem repeats.,Elife,"Over a third of the human genome is comprised of repetitive sequences, including more than a million short tandem repeats (STRs). While studies of the pathologic consequences of repeat expansions that cause syndromic human diseases are extensive, the potential native functions of STRs are often ignored. Here, we summarize a growing body of research into the normal biological functions for repetitive elements across the genome, with a particular focus on the roles of STRs in regulating gene expression. We propose reconceptualizing the pathogenic consequences of repeat expansions as aberrancies in normal gene regulation. From this altered viewpoint, we predict that future work will reveal broader roles for STRs in neuronal function and as risk alleles for more common human neurological diseases."
,No,20230323,methods,36909524,Pretraining strategies for effective promoter-driven gene expression prediction.,bioRxiv,"Advances in gene delivery technologies are enabling rapid progress in molecular medicine, but require precise expression of genetic cargo in desired cell types, which is predominantly achieved via a regulatory DNA sequence called a promoter; however, only a handful of cell type-specific promoters are known. Efficiently designing compact promoter sequences with a high density of regulatory information by leveraging machine learning models would therefore be broadly impactful for fundamental research and direct therapeutic applications. However, models of expression from such compact promoter sequences are lacking, despite the recent success of deep learning in modelling expression from endogenous regulatory sequences. Despite the lack of large datasets measuring promoter-driven expression in many cell types, data from a few well-studied cell types or from endogenous gene expression may provide relevant information for transfer learning, which has not yet been explored in this setting. Here, we evaluate a variety of pretraining tasks and transfer strategies for modelling cell type-specific expression from compact promoters and demonstrate the effectiveness of pretraining on existing promoter-driven expression datasets from other cell types. Our approach is broadly applicable for modelling promoter-driven expression in any data-limited cell type of interest, and will enable the use of model-based optimization techniques for promoter design for gene delivery applications.

x,No,20230323,epigenetics,36762477,DNA methylation entropy is associated with DNA sequence features and developmental epigenetic divergence.,Nucleic Acids Res,"Epigenetic information defines tissue identity and is largely inherited in development through DNA methylation. While studied mostly for mean differences, methylation also encodes stochastic change, defined as entropy in information theory. Analyzing allele-specific methylation in 49 human tissue sample datasets, we find that methylation entropy is associated with specific DNA binding motifs, regulatory DNA, and CpG density. Then applying information theory to 42 mouse embryo methylation datasets, we find that the contribution of methylation entropy to time- and tissue-specific patterns of development is comparable to the contribution of methylation mean, and methylation entropy is associated with sequence and chromatin features conserved with human. Moreover, methylation entropy is directly related to gene expression variability in development, suggesting a role for epigenetic entropy in developmental plasticity.© The Author(s) 2023.

sam,No,20230323,kidney,36932062,Kidney fibrosis: from mechanisms to therapeutic medicines.,Signal Transduct Target Ther,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is estimated to affect 10-14% of global population. Kidney fibrosis, characterized by excessive extracellular matrix deposition leading to scarring, is a hallmark manifestation in different progressive CKD; However, at present no antifibrotic therapies against CKD exist. Kidney fibrosis is identified by tubule atrophy, interstitial chronic inflammation and fibrogenesis, glomerulosclerosis, and vascular rarefaction. Fibrotic niche, where organ fibrosis initiates, is a complex interplay between injured parenchyma (like tubular cells) and multiple non-parenchymal cell lineages (immune and mesenchymal cells) located spatially within scarring areas. Although the mechanisms of kidney fibrosis are complicated due to the kinds of cells involved, with the help of single-cell technology, many key questions have been explored, such as what kind of renal tubules are profibrotic, where myofibroblasts originate, which immune cells are involved, and how cells communicate with each other. In addition, genetics and epigenetics are deeper mechanisms that regulate kidney fibrosis. And the reversible nature of epigenetic changes including DNA methylation, RNA interference, and chromatin remodeling, gives an opportunity to stop or reverse kidney fibrosis by therapeutic strategies. More marketed (e.g., RAS blockage, SGLT2 inhibitors) have been developed to delay CKD progression in recent years. Furthermore, a better understanding of renal fibrosis is also favored to discover biomarkers of fibrotic injury. In the review, we update recent advances in the mechanism of renal fibrosis and summarize novel biomarkers and antifibrotic treatment for CKD.© 2023. The Author(s)."

,No,20230323,multiomics,36941332,Multiomic signatures of body mass index identify heterogeneous health phenotypes and responses to a lifestyle intervention.,Nat Med,"Multiomic profiling can reveal population heterogeneity for both health and disease states. Obesity drives a myriad of metabolic perturbations and is a risk factor for multiple chronic diseases. Here we report an atlas of cross-sectional and longitudinal changes in 1,111 blood analytes associated with variation in body mass index (BMI), as well as multiomic associations with host polygenic risk scores and gut microbiome composition, from a cohort of 1,277 individuals enrolled in a wellness program (Arivale). Machine learning model predictions of BMI from blood multiomics captured heterogeneous phenotypic states of host metabolism and gut microbiome composition better than BMI, which was also validated in an external cohort (TwinsUK). Moreover, longitudinal analyses identified variable BMI trajectories for different omics measures in response to a healthy lifestyle intervention; metabolomics-inferred BMI decreased to a greater extent than actual BMI, whereas proteomics-inferred BMI exhibited greater resistance to change. Our analyses further identified blood analyte-analyte associations that were modified by metabolomics-inferred BMI and partially reversed in individuals with metabolic obesity during the intervention. Taken together, our findings provide a blood atlas of the molecular perturbations associated with changes in obesity status, serving as a resource to quantify metabolic health for predictive and preventive medicine.© 2023.

,No,20230323,epigenetics,36922587,Spatial epigenome-transcriptome co-profiling of mammalian tissues.,Nature,"Emerging spatial technologies, including spatial transcriptomics and spatial epigenomics, are becoming powerful tools for profiling of cellular states in the tissue context1-5. However, current methods capture only one layer of omics information at a time, precluding the possibility of examining the mechanistic relationship across the central dogma of molecular biology. Here, we present two technologies for spatially resolved, genome-wide, joint profiling of the epigenome and transcriptome by cosequencing chromatin accessibility and gene expression, or histone modifications (H3K27me3, H3K27ac or H3K4me3) and gene expression on the same tissue section at near-single-cell resolution. These were applied to embryonic and juvenile mouse brain, as well as adult human brain, to map how epigenetic mechanisms control transcriptional phenotype and cell dynamics in tissue. Although highly concordant tissue features were identified by either spatial epigenome or spatial transcriptome we also observed distinct patterns, suggesting their differential roles in defining cell states. Linking epigenome to transcriptome pixel by pixel allows the uncovering of new insights in spatial epigenetic priming, differentiation and gene regulation within the tissue architecture. These technologies are of great interest in life science and biomedical research.© 2023. The Author(s)."
paul,No,20230323,methods,36908043,Pruning and thresholding approach for methylation risk scores in multi-ancestry populations.,Epigenetics,"Recent efforts have focused on developing methylation risk scores (MRS), a weighted sum of the individual's DNA methylation (DNAm) values of pre-selected CpG sites. Most of the current MRS approaches that utilize Epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) summary statistics only include genome-wide significant CpG sites and do not consider co-methylation. New methods that relax the p-value threshold to include more CpG sites and account for the inter-correlation of DNAm might improve the predictive performance of MRS. We paired informed co-methylation pruning with P-value thresholding to generate pruning and thresholding (P+T) MRS and evaluated its performance among multi-ancestry populations. Through simulation studies and real data analyses, we demonstrated that pruning provides an improvement over simple thresholding methods for prediction of phenotypes. We demonstrated that European-derived summary statistics can be used to develop P+T MRS among other populations such as African populations. However, the prediction accuracy of P+T MRS may differ across multi-ancestry population due to environmental/cultural/social differences."

Currently, siNETs can be molecularly classified as having chromosome 18 loss of heterozygosity (18LOH), multiple CNVs (MultiCNV), or no CNVs. 18LOH tumours have better progression free survival when compared to MultiCNV and NoCNV tumours, however the mechanism underlying this is unknown, and clinical practice does not currently consider CNV status.Here, we use genome-wide tumour DNA methylation (n=54) and gene expression (n=20 matched to DNA methylation) to better understand how gene regulation varies by 18LOH status. We then use multiple cell deconvolution methods to analyse how cell composition varies between 18LOH status, and determine potential associations with progression free survival.We identified 27,464 differentially methylated CpG sites and 12 differentially expressed genes between 18LOH and non-18LOH (MultiCNV + NoCNV) siNETs. Although few differentially expressed genes were identified, these genes were highly enriched with the differentially methylated CpG sites compared to the rest of the genome. We identified differences in tumour micro-environment between 18LOH and non-18LOH tumours, including CD14+ infiltration in a subset of non-18LOH tumours which had the poorest clinical outcomes.We identify a small number of genes which appear to be linked to the 18LOH status of siNETs, and find evidence of potential epigenetic dysregulation of these genes. We also find a potential prognostic marker for worse progression free outcomes in the form of higher CD14 infiltration in non-18LOH siNETs.S. Karger AG, Basel."
,Yes,20230323,ewas,36899042,Epigenome-wide meta-analysis of prenatal maternal stressful life events and newborn DNA methylation.,Mol Psychiatry,"Prenatal maternal stressful life events are associated with adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes in offspring. Biological mechanisms underlying these associations are largely unknown, but DNA methylation likely plays a role. This meta-analysis included twelve non-overlapping cohorts from ten independent longitudinal studies (N = 5,496) within the international Pregnancy and Childhood Epigenetics consortium to examine maternal stressful life events during pregnancy and DNA methylation in cord blood. Children whose mothers reported higher levels of cumulative maternal stressful life events during pregnancy exhibited differential methylation of cg26579032 in ALKBH3. Stressor-specific domains of conflict with family/friends, abuse (physical, sexual, and emotional), and death of a close friend/relative were also associated with differential methylation of CpGs in APTX, MyD88, and both UHRF1 and SDCCAG8, respectively; these genes are implicated in neurodegeneration, immune and cellular functions, regulation of global methylation levels, metabolism, and schizophrenia risk. Thus, differences in DNA methylation at these loci may provide novel insights into potential mechanisms of neurodevelopment in offspring.© 2023.

scott,No,20230323,multiomics,36891970,Exploiting the mediating role of the metabolome to unravel transcript-to-phenotype associations.,Elife,"Despite the success of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) in identifying genetic variants associated with complex traits, understanding the mechanisms behind these statistical associations remains challenging. Several methods that integrate methylation, gene expression, and protein quantitative trait loci (QTLs) with GWAS data to determine their causal role in the path from genotype to phenotype have been proposed. Here, we developed and applied a multi-omics Mendelian randomization (MR) framework to study how metabolites mediate the effect of gene expression on complex traits. We identified 216 transcript-metabolite-trait causal triplets involving 26 medically relevant phenotypes. Among these associations, 58% were missed by classical transcriptome-wide MR, which only uses gene expression and GWAS data. This allowed the identification of biologically relevant pathways, such as betweenANKHand calcium levels mediated by citrate levels andSLC6A12and serum creatinine through modulation of the levels of the renal osmolyte betaine. We show that the signals missed by transcriptome-wide MR are found, thanks to the increase in power conferred by integrating multiple omics layer. Simulation analyses show that with larger molecular QTL studies and in case of mediated effects, our multi-omics MR framework outperforms classical MR approaches designed to detect causal relationships between single molecular traits and complex phenotypes.© 2023, Auwerx et al."
,No,20230323,aging,36911092,Characteristics of circulating small noncoding RNAs in plasma and serum during human aging.,Aging Med (Milton),"Aging is a complicated process that triggers age-related disease susceptibility through intercellular communication in the microenvironment. While the classic secretome of senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) including soluble factors, growth factors, and extracellular matrix remodeling enzymes are known to impact tissue homeostasis during the aging process, the effects of novel SASP components, extracellular small noncoding RNAs (sncRNAs), on human aging are not well established.Here, by utilizing 446 small RNA-seq samples from plasma and serum of healthy donors found in the Extracellular RNA (exRNA) Atlas data repository, we correlated linear and nonlinear features between circulating sncRNAs expression and age by the maximal information coefficient (MIC) relationship determination. Age predictors were generated by ensemble machine learning methods (Adaptive Boosting, Gradient Boosting, and Random Forest) and core age-related sncRNAs were determined through weighted coefficients in machine learning models. Functional investigation was performed via target prediction of age-related miRNAs.We observed the number of highly expressed transfer RNAs (tRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) showed positive and negative associations with age respectively. Two-variable (sncRNA expression and individual age) relationships were detected by MIC and sncRNAs-based age predictors were established, resulting in a forecast performance where allR2values were greater than 0.96 and root-mean-square errors (RMSE) were less than 3.7 years in three ensemble machine learning methods. Furthermore, important age-related sncRNAs were identified based on modeling and the biological pathways of age-related miRNAs were characterized by their predicted targets, including multiple pathways in intercellular communication, cancer and immune regulation.In summary, this study provides valuable insights into circulating sncRNAs expression dynamics during human aging and may lead to advanced understanding of age-related sncRNAs functions with further elucidation.© 2023 The Authors.

sarah,No,20230323,dnamage,36802439,Epigenetic-based age acceleration in a representative sample of older Americans: Associations with aging-related morbidity and mortality.,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,"Biomarkers developed from DNA methylation (DNAm) data are of growing interest as predictors of health outcomes and mortality in older populations. However, it is unknown how epigenetic aging fits within the context of known socioeconomic and behavioral associations with aging-related health outcomes in a large, population-based, and diverse sample. This study uses data from a representative, panel study of US older adults to examine the relationship between DNAm-based age acceleration measures in the prediction of cross-sectional and longitudinal health outcomes and mortality. We examine whether recent improvements to these scores, using principal component (PC)-based measures designed to remove some of the technical noise and unreliability in measurement, improve the predictive capability of these measures. We also examine how well DNAm-based measures perform against well-known predictors of health outcomes such as demographics, SES, and health behaviors. In our sample, age acceleration calculated using ""second and third generation clocks,"" PhenoAge, GrimAge, and DunedinPACE, is consistently a significant predictor of health outcomes including cross-sectional cognitive dysfunction, functional limitations and chronic conditions assessed 2 y after DNAm measurement, and 4-y mortality. PC-based epigenetic age acceleration measures do not significantly change the relationship of DNAm-based age acceleration measures to health outcomes or mortality compared to earlier versions of these measures. While the usefulness of DNAm-based age acceleration as a predictor of later life health outcomes is quite clear, other factors such as demographics, SES, mental health, and health behaviors remain equally, if not more robust, predictors of later life outcomes."

The analysis identified 117 cis-regulatory protein quantitative trait loci (cis-pQTL) and 166 trans-pQTL. The mapped pQTL capture on average 50% of each protein's heritability. Mendelian randomization analyses revealed multiple proteins showing potential causal effects on neuro-related traits as well as complex diseases such as hypertension, high cholesterol, immune-related disorders, and psychiatric disorders.

We investigated their association with human aging in two ways. First, we quantified Numts in 1,187 post-mortem brain and blood samples. Human brains exhibited a 5.5-fold enrichment of somatic Numt insertions in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex compared to the cerebellum, suggesting that they arose spontaneously during development or with aging. Moreover, more brain Numts was linked to earlier mortality. The brains of individuals with no cognitive impairment who died at younger ages carried approximately 2 more Numts per decade of life lost than those who lived longer. Second, we tested the dynamic transfer of Numts in a repeated-measures WGS study in a human fibroblast model that recapitulates several molecular features of human aging. These longitudinal experiments revealed a gradual accumulation of one Numt every ~9 days, independent of large-scale genomic instability. Targeted genetic and pharmacological perturbations of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation did not affect numtogenesis, whereas chronic glucocorticoid stress increased the Numts transfer rate by 39.8%. Combined, our data document spontaneous numtogenesis in aging human cells and demonstrate an association between brain cortical somatic Numts and human lifespan."

The EPIC BeadChip uses a two-array design: Infinium Type I and Type II probes. These probe types exhibit different technical characteristics which may confound analyses. Numerous normalization and pre-processing methods have been developed to reduce probe type bias as well as other issues such as background and dye bias.This study evaluates the performance of various normalization methods using 16 replicated samples and three metrics: absolute beta-value difference, overlap of non-replicated CpGs between replicate pairs, and effect on beta-value distributions. Additionally, we carried out Pearson's correlation and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) analyses using both raw and SeSAMe 2 normalized data.The method we define as SeSAMe 2, which consists of the application of the regular SeSAMe pipeline with an additional round of QC, pOOBAH masking, was found to be the best performing normalization method, while quantile-based methods were found to be the worst performing methods. Whole-array Pearson's correlations were found to be high. However, in agreement with previous studies, a substantial proportion of the probes on the EPIC array showed poor reproducibility (ICC < 0.50). The majority of poor performing probes have beta values close to either 0 or 1, and relatively low standard deviations. These results suggest that probe reliability is largely the result of limited biological variation rather than technical measurement variation. Importantly, normalizing the data with SeSAMe 2 dramatically improved ICC estimates, with the proportion of probes with ICC values > 0.50 increasing from 45.18% (raw data) to 61.35% (SeSAMe 2).© 2023.

matt,No,20230323,circadian rhythm,36791098,The HP1Î± protein is mandatory to repress the circadian clock and its output genes during the 12 h period of transcriptional repression.,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,"The transcriptional repressions driven by the circadian core clock repressors RevErbα, E4BP4, and CRY1/PER1 involve feedback loops which are mandatory for generating the circadian rhythms. These repressors are known to bind to cognate DNA binding sites, but how their circadian bindings trigger the cascade of events leading to these repressions remain to be elucidated. Through molecular and genetic analyses, we now demonstrate that the chromatin protein HP1α plays a key role in these transcriptional repressions of both the circadian clock (CC) genes and their cognate output genes (CCGs). We show that these CC repressors recruit the HP1α protein downstream from a repressive cascade, and that this recruitment is mandatory for the maintenance of both the CC integrity and the expression of the circadian genes. We further show that the presence of HP1α is critical for both the repressor-induced chromatin compaction and the generation of ""transcriptionally repressed biomolecular hydrophobic condensates"" and demonstrates that HP1α is mandatory within the CC output genes for both the recruitment of DNA methylating enzymes on the intronic deoxyCpG islands and their subsequent methylation."
