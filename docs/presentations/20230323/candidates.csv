"36943494","Genome-wide identification and characterization of lipoxygenase genes related to the English grain aphid infestation response in wheat.","Planta","44 wheat LOX genes were identified by silico genome-wide search method. TaLOX5, 7, 10, 24, 29, 33 were specifically expressed post aphid infestation, indicating their participation in wheat-aphid interaction. In plants, LOX genes play important roles in various biological progresses including seed germination, tuber development, plant vegetative growth and most crucially in plant signal transduction, stress response and plant defense against plant diseases and insects. Although LOX genes have been characterized in many species, the importance of the LOX family in wheat has still not been well understood, hampering further improvement of wheat under stress conditions. Here, we identified 44 LOX genes (TaLOXs) in the whole wheat genome and classified into three subfamilies (9-LOXs, Type I 13-LOXs and Type II 13-LOXs) according to phylogenetic relationships. The TaLOXs belonging to the same subgroup shared similar gene structures and motif organizations. Synteny analysis demonstrated that segmental duplication events mainly contributed to the expansion of the LOX gene family in wheat. The results of protein-protein interaction network (PPI) and miRNA-TaLOXs predictions revealed that three TaLOXs (TaLOX20, 22 and 37) interacted mostly with proteins related to methyl jasmonate (MeJA) signaling pathway. The expression patterns of TaLOXs in different tissues (root, stem, leaf, spike and grain) under diverse abiotic stresses (heat, cold, drought, drought and heat combined treatment, and salt) as well as under diverse biotic stresses (powdery mildew pathogen, Fusarium graminearum and stripe rust pathogen) were systematically analyzed using RNA-seq data. We obtained aphid-responsive candidate genes by RNA-seq data of wheat after the English grain aphid infestation. Aphid-responsive candidate genes, including TaLOX5, 7, 10, 24, 29 and 33, were up-regulated in the wheat aphid-resistant genotype (Lunxuan144), while they were little expressed in the susceptible genotype (Jimai22) during late response (48 h and 72 h) to the English grain aphid infestation. Meanwhile, qRT-PCR analysis was used to validate these aphid-responsive candidate genes. The genetic divergence and diversity of all the TaLOXs in bread wheat and its relative species were investigated by available resequencing data. Finally, the 3D structure of the TaLOX proteins was predicted based on the homology modeling method. This study not only systematically investigated the characteristics and evolutionary relationships of TaLOXs, but also provided potential candidate genes in response to the English grain aphid infestation and laid the foundation to further study the regulatory roles in the English grain aphid infestation of LOX family in wheat and beyond.© 2023.

"36938064","RNA methylation in plants: An overview.","Front Plant Sci","RNA methylation is an important post-transcriptional modification that influences gene regulation. Over 200 different types of RNA modifications have been identified in plants. In animals, the mystery of RNA methylation has been revealed, and its biological role and applications have become increasingly clear. However, RNA methylation in plants is still poorly understood. Recently, plant science research on RNA methylation has advanced rapidly, and it has become clear that RNA methylation plays a critical role in plant development. This review summarizes current knowledge on RNA methylation in plant development. Plant writers, erasers, and readers are highlighted, as well as the occurrence, methods, and software development in RNA methylation is summarized. The most common and abundant RNA methylation in plants is N6-methyladenosine (m6A). In Arabidopsis, mutations in writers, erasers, and RNA methylation readers have affected the plant's phenotype. It has also been demonstrated that methylated TRANSLATIONALLY CONTROLLED TUMOR PROTEIN 1-messenger RNA moves from shoot to root while unmethylated TCTP1-mRNA does not. Methylated RNA immunoprecipitation, in conjunction with next-generation sequencing, has been a watershed moment in plant RNA methylation research. This method has been used successfully in rice, Arabidopsis, Brassica, and maize to study transcriptome-wide RNA methylation. Various software or tools have been used to detect methylated RNAs at the whole transcriptome level; the majority are model-based analysis tools (for example, MACS2). Finally, the limitations and future prospects of methylation of RNA research have been documented.Copyright © 2023 Shinde, Dudhate, Kadam and Hong."
"36938056","Identification of SNP loci and candidate genes genetically controlling norisoprenoids in grape berry based on genome-wide association study.","Front Plant Sci","Obtaining new grapevine varieties with unique aromas has been a long-standing goal of breeders. Norisoprenoids are of particular interest to wine producers and researchers, as these compounds are responsible for the important varietal aromas in wine, characterized by a complex floral and fruity smell, and are likely present in all grape varieties. However, the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci and candidate genes genetically controlling the norisoprenoid content in grape berry remain unknown. To this end, in this study, we investigated 13 norisoprenoid traits across two years in an F1population consisting of 149 individuals from a hybrid ofVitis viniferaL. cv. Muscat Alexandria andV. viniferaL. cv. Christmas Rose. Based on 568,953 SNP markers, genome-wide association analysis revealed that 27 candidate SNP loci belonging to 18 genes were significantly associated with the concentrations of norisoprenoid components in grape berry. Among them, 13 SNPs were confirmed in a grapevine germplasm population comprising 97 varieties, including two non-synonymous mutations SNPs within theVvDXS1andVvGGPPSgenes, respectively in the isoprenoid metabolic pathway. Genotype analysis showed that the grapevine individuals with the heterozygous genotype C/T at chr5:2987350 ofVvGGPPSaccumulated higher average levels of 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one andβ-cyclocitral than those with the homozygous genotype C/C. Furthermore,VvGGPPSwas highly expressed in individuals with high norisoprenoids concentrations. Transient overexpression ofVvGGPPSin the leaves ofVitis quinquangularisand tobacco resulted in an increase in norisoprenoid concentrations. These findings indicate the importance ofVvGGPPSin the genetic control of norisoprenoids in grape berries, serving as a potential molecular breeding target for aroma.Copyright © 2023 Sun, He, Sun, Xu, Fu, Sun, Zhu, Duan and Pan."
"36937425","Genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic signatures of prostate cancer between African American and European American patients.","Front Oncol","Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men in the United States, and racial disparities are greatly observed in the disease. Specifically, African American (AA) patients have 60% higher incidence and mortality rates, in addition to higher grade and stage prostate tumors, than European American (EA) patients. In order to narrow the gap between clinical outcomes for these two populations, genetic and molecular signatures contributing to this disparity have been characterized. Over the past decade, profiles of prostate tumor samples from different ethnic groups have been developed using molecular and functional assays coupled with next generation sequencing or microarrays. Comparative genome-wide analyses of genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic profiles from prostate tumor samples have uncovered potential race-specific mutations, copy number alterations, DNA methylation, and gene expression patterns. In this study, we reviewed over 20 published studies that examined the aforementioned molecular contributions to racial disparities in AA and EA prostate cancer patients. The reviewed genomic studies revealed mutations, deletions, amplifications, duplications, or fusion genes differentially enriched in AA patients relative to EA patients. Commonly reported genomic alterations included mutations or copy number alterations ofFOXA1, KMT2D, SPOP, MYC,PTEN,TP53,ZFHX3, and theTMPRSS2-ERGfusion. The reviewed epigenomic studies identified that CpG sites near the promoters ofPMEPA1,RARB,SNRPN, andTIMP3genes were differentially methylated between AA and EA patients. Lastly, the reviewed transcriptomic studies identified genes (e.g.CCL4, CHRM3,CRYBB2,CXCR4, GALR1,GSTM3,SPINK1) and signaling pathways dysregulated between AA and EA patients. The most frequently found dysregulated pathways were involved in immune and inflammatory responses and neuroactive ligand signaling. Overall, we observed that the genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic alterations evaluated between AA and EA prostate cancer patients varied between studies, highlighting the impact of using different methods and sample sizes. The reported genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic alterations do not only uncover molecular mechanisms of tumorigenesis but also provide researchers and clinicians valuable resources to identify novel biomarkers and treatment modalities to improve the disparity of clinical outcomes between AA and EA patients.Copyright © 2023 Stevens, Hightower, Buxbaum, Falzarano and Rhie."
"36936794","Detailed molecular and epigenetic characterization of the pig IPEC-J2 and chicken SL-29 cell lines.","iScience","The pig IPEC-J2 and chicken SL-29 cell lines are of interest because of their untransformed nature and wide use in functional studies. Molecular characterization of these cell lines is important to gain insight into possible molecular aberrations. The aim of this paper is to provide a molecular and epigenetic characterization of the IPEC-J2 and SL-29 cell lines, a cell-line reference for the FAANG community, and future biomedical research. Whole genome sequencing, gene expression, DNA methylation, chromatin accessibility, and ChIP-seq of four histone marks (H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K27ac, H3K27me3) and an insulator (CTCF) are used to achieve these aims. Heteroploidy (aneuploidy) of various chromosomes was observed from whole genome sequencing analysis in both cell lines. Furthermore, higher gene expression for genes located on chromosomes with aneuploidy in comparison to diploid chromosomes was observed. Regulatory complexity of gene expression, DNA methylation, and chromatin accessibility was investigated through an integrative approach.© 2023 The Authors."
"36936429","DNA methylation patterns associated with breast cancer prognosis that are specific to tumor subtype and menopausal status.","Front Genet","Tumor subtype and menopausal status are strong predictors of breast cancer (BC) prognosis. We aimed to find and validate subtype- or menopausal-status-specific changes in tumor DNA methylation (DNAm) associated with all-cause mortality or BC progression. Associations between site-specific tumor DNAm and BC prognosis were estimated among The Cancer Genome Atlas participants (n= 692) with Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array data. All-cause mortality and BC progression were modeled using Cox proportional hazards models stratified by tumor subtypes, adjusting for age, race, stage, menopausal status, tumor purity, and cell type proportion. Effect measure modification by subtype and menopausal status were evaluated by incorporating a product term with DNAm. Site-specific inference was used to identify subtype- or menopausal-status-specific differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and functional pathways. The validation of the results was carried out on an independent dataset (GSE72308;n= 180). We identified a total of fifteen unique CpG probes that were significantly associated (P≤1×10-7with survival outcomes in subtype- or menopausal-status-specific manner. Seven probes were associated with overall survival (OS) or progression-free interval (PFI) for women with luminal A subtype, and four probes were associated with PFI for women with luminal B subtype. Five probes were associated with PFI for post-menopausal women. A majority of significant probes showed a lower risk of OS or BC progression with higher DNAm. We identified subtype- or menopausal-status-specific DMRs and functional pathways of which top associated pathways differed across subtypes or menopausal status. None of significant probes from site-specific analyses met genome-wide significant level in validation analyses while directions and magnitudes of coefficients showed consistent pattern. We have identified subtype- or menopausal-status-specific DNAm biomarkers, DMRs and functional pathways associated with all-cause mortality or BC progression, albeit with limited validation. Future studies with larger independent cohort of non-post-menopausal women with non-luminal A subtypes are warranted for identifying subtype- and menopausal-status-specific DNAm biomarkers for BC prognosis.Copyright © 2023 Kim, Binder, Zhou and Jung."
"36929374","Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of aggressive behaviour: a longitudinal population-based study.","J Child Psychol Psychiatry","Human aggression is influenced by an interplay between genetic predisposition and experience across the life span. This interaction is thought to occur through epigenetic mechanisms, inducing differential gene expression, thereby moderating neuronal cell and circuit function, and thus shaping aggressive behaviour.Genome-wide DNA methylation (DNAm) levels were measured in peripheral blood obtained from 95 individuals participating in the Estonian Children Personality Behaviours and Health Study (ECPBHS) at 15 and 25 years of age. We examined the association between aggressive behaviour, as measured by Life History of Aggression (LHA) total score and DNAm levels both assessed at age 25. We further examined the pleiotropic effect of genetic variants regulating LHA-associated differentially methylated positions (DMPs) and multiple traits related to aggressive behaviours. Lastly, we tested whether the DNA methylomic loci identified in association with LHA at age 25 were also present at age 15.We found one differentially methylated position (DMP) (cg17815886; p = 1.12 × 10-8) and five differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with LHA after multiple testing adjustments. The DMP annotated to the PDLIM5 gene, and DMRs resided in the vicinity of four protein-encoding genes (TRIM10, GTF2H4, SLC45A4, B3GALT4) and a long intergenic non-coding RNA (LINC02068). We observed evidence for the colocalization of genetic variants associated with top DMPs and general cognitive function, educational attainment and cholesterol levels. Notably, a subset of the DMPs associated with LHA at age 25 also displayed altered DNAm patterns at age 15 with high accuracy in predicting aggression.Our findings highlight the potential role of DNAm in the development of aggressive behaviours. We observed pleiotropic genetic variants associated with identified DMPs, and various traits previously established to be relevant in shaping aggression in humans. The concordance of DNAm signatures in adolescents and young adults may have predictive value for inappropriate and maladaptive aggression later in life.© 2023 The Authors.

"36929072","Cell-Type Deconvolution of Bulk DNA Methylation Data with EpiSCORE.","Methods Mol Biol","DNA methylation data generated from bulk tissue represents a mixture of many different cell types. Variation in the cell-type composition of tissues is thus a major confounder when inferring differential DNA methylation. Due to the high cost of single-cell methylome sequencing, computational methods that can dissect the cell-type heterogeneity of bulk DNA methylomes offer an efficient and cost-effective solution, especially in the context of large-scale EWAS. In this chapter, we present a step-by-step tutorial of Epigenetic cell-type deconvolution using Single-Cell Omic References (EpiSCORE), a reference-based method that leverages the high-resolution nature of single-cell RNA-Seq datasets to facilitate microdissection of bulk-tissue DNA methylomes.© 2023.

"36928858","Genomics in Treatment Development.","Adv Neurobiol","The Human Genome Project mapped the 3 billion base pairs in the human genome, which ushered in a new generation of genomically focused treatment development. While this has been very successful in other areas, neuroscience has been largely devoid of such developments. This is in large part because there are very few neurological or mental health conditions that are related to single-gene variants. While developments in pharmacogenomics have been somewhat successful, the use of genetic information in practice has to do with drug metabolism and adverse reactions. Studies of drug metabolism related to genetic variations are an important part of drug development. However, outside of cancer biology, the actual translation of genomic information into novel therapies has been limited. Epigenetics, which relates in part to the effects of the environment on DNA, is a promising newer area of relevance to CNS disorders. The environment can induce chemical modifications of DNA (e.g., cytosine methylation), which can be induced by the environment and may represent either shorter- or longer-term changes. Given the importance of environmental influences on CNS disorders, epigenetics may identify important treatment targets in the future.© 2023.

"36924904","Long-term glucocorticoid exposure persistently impairs CD4+ T cell biology by epigenetically modulating the mTORC1 pathway.","Biochem Pharmacol","Conventional glucocorticoid (GC) treatment has a long-term influence on T-cell immunity, resulting in an increased risk of opportunistic infection after drug withdrawal. The underlying mechanisms remain ambiguous. This study demonstrated that long-term GC treatment induced persistent lymphopenia in patients with primary glomerular disease. GCs continuously suppressed the proportion of CD4+ T cells even after the daily dose was tapered down to the physiologic equivalences, leading to a significant decline of the CD4/CD8 ratio. Meanwhile, GCs impaired CD4+ T cell biology, leading to enhanced apoptotic cell death, reduced proliferative capacity, downregulated pro-inflammatory genes, and upregulated immunoregulatory genes. Specifically, GCs altered FOXP3 expression pattern in CD4+ T cells and favored their acquisition of an active T regulatory (Treg) cell phenotype with enhanced IL-10 production upon stimulation. Mechanistically, GCs tampered with the transcriptional regulation of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway, resulting in an inhibitory impact on the signaling activity. Targeting mTORC1 signaling by siRNAs could sufficiently modify the viability of GC-exposed CD4+ T cells. By high-throughput sequencing of genome-wide DNA methylation and mRNA, we further uncovered a causal relationship between the altered DNA methylation level and transcription activity in a subset of mTORC1 pathway genes in long-term GC exposure. Taken together, this study reveals a novel regulation of mTORC1 signaling, which might dominate the long-term influence of GC on CD4+ T cell biology in a dose-independent manner.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

"36922868","The pattern of alternative splicing and DNA methylation alteration and their interaction in linseed (Linum usitatissimum L.) response to repeated drought stresses.","Biol Res","Drought stress has significantly hampered agricultural productivity worldwide and can also result in modifications to DNA methylation levels. However, the dynamics of DNA methylation and its association with the changes in gene transcription and alternative splicing (AS) under drought stress are unknown in linseed, which is frequently cultivated in arid and semiarid regions.We analysed AS events and DNA methylation patterns in drought-tolerant (Z141) and drought-sensitive (NY-17) linseed under drought stress (DS) and repeated drought stress (RD) treatments. We found that the number of intron-retention (IR) and alternative 3' splice site (Alt3'SS) events were significantly higher in Z141 and NY-17 under drought stress. We found that the linseed response to the DS treatment was mainly regulated by transcription, while the response to the RD treatment was coregulated by transcription and AS. Whole genome-wide DNA methylation analysis revealed that drought stress caused an increase in the overall methylation level of linseed. Although we did not observe any correlation between differentially methylated genes (DMGs) and differentially spliced genes (DSGs) in this study, we found that the DSGs whose gene body region was hypermethylated in Z141 and hypomethylated in NY-17 were enriched in abiotic stress response Gene Ontology (GO) terms. This finding implies that gene body methylation plays an important role in AS regulation in some specific genes.Our study is the first comprehensive genome-wide analysis of the relationship between linseed methylation changes and AS under drought and repeated drought stress. Our study revealed different interaction patterns between differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and DSGs under DS and RD treatments and differences between methylation and AS regulation in drought-tolerant and drought-sensitive linseed varieties. The findings will probably be of interest in the future. Our results provide interesting insights into the association between gene expression, AS, and DNA methylation in linseed under drought stress. Differences in these associations may account for the differences in linseed drought tolerance.© 2023. The Author(s)."

But few reports have been reported on the phylogenetic analysis and gene expression profiling of TIFY family genes in birch (Betula platyphylla).In this study, we characterized TIFY family and identified 12 TIFY genes and using phylogeny and chromosome mapping analysis in birch. TIFY family members were divided into JAZ, ZML, PPD and TIFY subfamilies. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 12 TIFY genes were clustered into six evolutionary branches. The chromosome distribution showed that 12 TIFY genes were unevenly distributed on 5 chromosomes. Some TIFY family members were derived from gene duplication in birch. We found that six JAZ genes from JAZ subfamily played essential roles in response to Methyl jasmonate (MeJA), the JAZ genes were correlated with COI1 under MeJA. Co-expression and GO enrichment analysis further revealed that JAZ genes were related to hormone. JAZ proteins involved in the ABA and SA pathways. Subcellular localization experiments confirmed that the JAZ proteins were localized in the nucleus. Yeast two-hybrid assay showed that the JAZ proteins may form homologous or heterodimers to regulate hormones.Our results provided novel insights into biological function of TIFY family and JAZ subfamily in birch. It provides the theoretical reference for in-depth analysis of plant hormone and molecular breeding design for resistance.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"36922640","DNA methyltransferase inhibition induces dynamic gene expression changes in lung CD4(+) T cells of neonatal mice with E. coli pneumonia.","Sci Rep","Bacterial pulmonary infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in neonates, with less severity in older children. Previous studies demonstrated that the DNA of CD4+T cells in the mouse lung, whose primary responsibility is to coordinate the immune response to foreign pathogens, is differentially methylated in neonates compared with juveniles. Nevertheless, the effect of this differential DNA methylation on CD4+T cell gene expression and response to infection remains unclear. Here we treated E. coli-infected neonatal (4-day-old) and juvenile (13-day-old) mice with decitabine (DAC), a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor with broad-spectrum DNA demethylating activity, and performed simultaneous genome-wide DNA methylation and transcriptional profiling on lung CD4+T cells. We show that juvenile and neonatal mice experienced differential demethylation in response to DAC treatment, with larger methylation differences observed in neonates. By cross-filtering differentially expressed genes between juveniles and neonates with those sites that were demethylated in neonates, we find that interferon-responsive genes such as Ifit1 are the most down-regulated methylation-sensitive genes in neonatal mice. DAC treatment shifted neonatal lung CD4+T cells toward a gene expression program similar to that of juveniles. Following lung infection with E. coli, lung CD4+T cells in neonatal mice exhibit epigenetic repression of important host defense pathways, which are activated by inhibition of DNA methyltransferase activity to resemble a more mature profile.© 2023.

"36945044","DNA methylation abnormalities induced by advanced maternal age in villi prime a high-risk state for spontaneous abortion.","Clin Epigenetics","Advanced maternal age (AMA) has increased in many high-income countries in recent decades. AMA is generally associated with a higher risk of various pregnancy complications, and the underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. In the current study, we profiled the DNA methylome of 24 human chorionic villi samples (CVSs) from early pregnancies in AMA and young maternal age (YMA), 11 CVSs from early spontaneous abortion (SA) cases using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS), and the transcriptome of 10 CVSs from AMA and YMA pregnancies with mRNA sequencing(mRNA-seq). Single-cell villous transcriptional atlas presented expression patterns of targeted AMA-/SA-related genes. Trophoblast cellular impairment was investigated through the knockdown of GNE expression in HTR8-S/Vneo cells.AMA-induced local DNA methylation changes, defined as AMA-related differentially methylated regions (DMRs), may be derived from the abnormal expression of genes involved in DNA demethylation, such as GADD45B. These DNA methylation changes were significantly enriched in the processes involved in NOTCH signaling and extracellular matrix organization and were reflected in the transcriptional alterations in the corresponding biological processes and specific genes. Furthermore, the DNA methylation level of special AMA-related DMRs not only significantly changed in AMA but also showed more excessive defects in CVS from spontaneous abortion (SA), including four AMA-related DMRs whose nearby genes overlapped with AMA-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (CDK11A, C19orf71, COL5A1, and GNE). The decreased DNA methylation level of DMR near GNE was positively correlated with the downregulated expression of GNE in AMA. Single-cell atlas further revealed comparatively high expression of GNE in the trophoblast lineage, and knockdown of GNE in HTR8-S/Vneo cells significantly impaired cellular proliferation and migration.Our study provides valuable resources for investigating AMA-induced epigenetic abnormalities and provides new insights for explaining the increased risks of pregnancy complications in AMA pregnancies.© 2023.

"36936396","DNA methylation differences in monozygotic twins with Van der Woude syndrome.","Front Dent Med","Van der Woude Syndrome (VWS) is an autosomal dominant disorder responsible for 2% of all syndromic orofacial clefts (OFCs) withIRF6being the primary causal gene (70%). Cases may present with lip pits and either cleft lip, cleft lip with cleft palate, or cleft palate, with marked phenotypic discordance even among individuals carrying the same mutation. This suggests that genetic or epigenetic modifiers may play additional roles in the syndrome's etiology and variability in expression. We report the first DNA methylation profiling of 2 pairs of monozygotic twins with VWS. Our goal is to explore epigenetic contributions to VWS etiology and variable phenotypic expressivity by comparing DNAm profiles in both twin pairs. While the mutations that cause VWS in these twins are known, the additional mechanism behind their phenotypic risk and variability in expression remains unclear.We generated whole genome DNAm data for both twin pairs. Differentially methylated positions (DMPs) were selected based on: (1) a coefficient of variation in DNAm levels in unaffected individuals < 20%, and (2) intra-twin pair absolute difference in DNAm levels >5% (delta beta > | 0.05|). We then divided the DMPs in two subgroups for each twin pair for further analysis: (1) higher methylation levels in twin A (Twin A > Twin B); and (2) higher methylation levels in twin B (Twin B >Twin A).Gene ontology analysis revealed a list of enriched genes that showed significant differential DNAm, including clef-associated genes. Among the cleft-associated genes,TP63was the most significant hit (p=7.82E-12). Both twin pairs presented differential DNAm levels in CpG sites in/nearTP63(Twin 1A > Twin 1B and Twin 2A < Twin 2B). The genesTP63andIRF6function in a biological regulatory loop to coordinate epithelial proliferation and differentiation in a process that is critical for palatal fusion. The effects of the causal mutations inIRF6can be further impacted by epigenetic dysregulation ofIRF6itself, or genes in its pathway. Our data shows evidence that changes in DNAm is a plausible mechanism that can lead to markedly distinct phenotypes, even among individuals carrying the same mutation."

"36936056","Premature Ovarian Insufficiency.","Curr Opin Endocr Metab Res","Natural menopause typically occurs between the ages of 46 to 55 years. Premature ovarian insufficiency or premature menopause refers to compromised ovarian follicular activity, occurring spontaneously or because of medical interventions, prior to the age of 40 years. The premature loss of estrogen leads to bothersome menopause symptoms and predisposes the women to multiple long-term health risks including a higher mortality risk. Hormone replacement therapy used until the natural age of menopause can help manage the symptoms effectively and can mitigate the long-term risk of estrogen deprivation to some extent. However, hormone replacement therapy is underutilized in this population due to the inappropriate extrapolation of potential risks that have been demonstrated with hormone therapy use in women after natural menopause. There is a large unmet need for educating patients and providers regarding the impact of premature ovarian insufficiency and the compelling need for its appropriate management."

Here, we study the association between sex steroid hormones and DNA methylation-based (DNAm) biomarkers of age and mortality risk including Pheno Age Acceleration (AA), Grim AA, and DNAm-based estimators of Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor 1 (PAI1), and leptin concentrations.We pooled data from three population-based cohorts, the Framingham Heart Study Offspring Cohort (FHS), the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA), and the InCHIANTI Study, including 1,062 postmenopausal women without hormone therapy and 1,612 men of European descent. Sex hormone concentrations were standardized with mean 0 and standard deviation of 1, for each study and sex separately. Sex-stratified analyses using a linear mixed regression were performed, with a Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) adjustment for multiple testing. Sensitivity analysis was performed excluding the previously used training-set for the development of Pheno and Grim age.Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG) is associated with a decrease in DNAm PAI1 among men (per 1 standard deviation (SD): -478 pg/mL; 95%CI: -614 to -343; P:1e-11; BH-P: 1e-10), and women (-434 pg/mL; 95%CI: -589 to -279; P:1e-7; BH-P:2e-6). The testosterone/estradiol (TE) ratio was associated with a decrease in Pheno AA (-0.41 years; 95%CI: -0.70 to -0.12; P:0.01; BH-P: 0.04), and DNAm PAI1 (-351 pg/mL; 95%CI: -486 to -217; P:4e-7; BH-P:3e-6) among men. In men, 1 SD increase in total testosterone was associated with a decrease in DNAm PAI1 (-481 pg/mL; 95%CI: -613 to -349; P:2e-12; BH-P:6e-11).SHBG was associated with lower DNAm PAI1 among men and women. Higher testosterone and testosterone/estradiol ratio were associated with lower DNAm PAI and a younger epigenetic age in men. A decrease in DNAm PAI1 is associated with lower mortality and morbidity risk indicating a potential protective effect of testosterone on lifespan and conceivably cardiovascular health via DNAm PAI1."

Patients were scanned by TI weighted imaging before and after 8-week risperidone monotherapy. CT estimation was automatically performed with the FreeSurfer software package. Participants' peripheral blood genomic DNA methylation (DNAm) status, quantified by using Infinium®Human Methylation 450K BeadChip, was examined in parallel with T1 scanning. In total, CT measures from 118 subjects and genomic DNAm status from 114 subjects were finally collected. Partial least squares (PLS) regression was used to detect the spatial associations between longitudinal CT variations after treatment and cortical transcriptomic data acquired from the Allen Human Brain Atlas. Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) was then performed to identify multivariate associations between DNAm of PLS1 genes and patients' clinical improvement.We detected the significant PLS1 component (2,098 genes) related to longitudinal alterations of CT, and the PLS1 genes were significantly enriched in neurobiological processes, and dopaminergic- and cancer-related pathways. Combining Laplacian score and CCA analysis, we further linked DNAm of 33 representative genes from the 2,098 PLS1 genes with patients' reduction rate of clinical symptoms.This study firstly revealed that changes of CT and clinical behaviors after treatment may be transcriptionally and epigenetically underlied. We define a ""three-step"" roadmap which represents a vital step toward the exploration of treatment- and treatment response-related biomarkers on the basis of multiple omics rather than a single omics type as a strategy for advancing precise care.Copyright © 2023 Zong, Wang, Nie, Ma, Kang, Zhang, Weng, Tan, Zheng and Hu."
"36936559","Effect of age, sex, and morbidity count on trial attrition: meta-analysis of individual participant level data from phase 3/4 industry funded clinical trials.","BMJ Med","To estimate the association between individual participant characteristics and attrition from randomised controlled trials.Meta-analysis of individual participant level data (IPD).Clinical trial repositories (Clinical Study Data Request and Yale University Open Data Access).Eligible phase 3 or 4 trials identified according to prespecified criteria (PROSPERO CRD42018048202).Association between comorbidity count (identified using medical history or concomitant drug treatment data) and trial attrition (failure for any reason to complete the final trial visit), estimated in logistic regression models and adjusted for age and sex. Estimates were meta-analysed in bayesian linear models, with partial pooling across index conditions and drug classes.In 92 trials across 20 index conditions and 17 drug classes, the mean comorbidity count ranged from 0.3 to 2.7. Neither age nor sex was clearly associated with attrition (odds ratio 1.04, 95% credible interval 0.98 to 1.11; and 0.99, 0.93 to 1.05, respectively). However, comorbidity count was associated with trial attrition (odds ratio per additional comorbidity 1.11, 95% credible interval 1.07 to 1.14). No evidence of non-linearity (assessed via a second order polynomial) was seen in the association between comorbidity count and trial attrition, with minimal variation across drug classes and index conditions. At a trial level, an increase in participant comorbidity count has a minor impact on attrition: for a notional trial with high level of attrition in individuals without comorbidity, doubling the mean comorbidity count from 1 to 2 translates to an increase in trial attrition from 29% to 31%.Increased comorbidity count, irrespective of age and sex, is associated with a modest increased odds of participant attrition. The benefit of increased generalisability of including participants with multimorbidity seems likely to outweigh the disadvantages of increased attrition.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022.

"36941441","Causal effects on complex traits are similar for common variants across segments of different continental ancestries within admixed individuals.","Nat Genet","Individuals of admixed ancestries (for example, African Americans) inherit a mosaic of ancestry segments (local ancestry) originating from multiple continental ancestral populations. This offers the unique opportunity of investigating the similarity of genetic effects on traits across ancestries within the same population. Here we introduce an approach to estimate correlation of causal genetic effects (radmix) across local ancestries and analyze 38 complex traits in African-European admixed individuals (N = 53,001) to observe very high correlations (meta-analysis radmix = 0.95, 95% credible interval 0.93-0.97), much higher than correlation of causal effects across continental ancestries. We replicate our results using regression-based methods from marginal genome-wide association study summary statistics. We also report realistic scenarios where regression-based methods yield inflated heterogeneity-by-ancestry due to ancestry-specific tagging of causal effects, and/or polygenicity. Our results motivate genetic analyses that assume minimal heterogeneity in causal effects by ancestry, with implications for the inclusion of ancestry-diverse individuals in studies.© 2023.

"36907129","Haplotype analysis of genomic prediction by incorporating genomic pathway information based on high-density SNP marker in Chinese yellow-feathered chicken.","Poult Sci","Genomic selection using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers is now intensively investigated in breeding and has been widely utilized for genetic improvement. Currently, several studies have used haplotype (consisting of multiallelic SNPs) for genomic prediction and revealed its performance advantage. In this study, we comprehensively evaluated the performance of haplotype models for genomic prediction in 15 traits, including 6 growth, 5 carcass, and 4 feeding traits in a Chinese yellow-feathered chicken population. We adopted 3 methods to define haplotypes from high-density SNP panels, and our strategy included combining Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway information and considering linkage disequilibrium (LD) information. Our results showed an increase in prediction accuracy due to haplotypes ranging from -0.04∼27.16% in all traits, where the significant improvements were found in 12 traits. The estimates of haplotype epistasis heritability were strongly correlated with the accuracy increase by haplotype models. In addition, incorporating genomic annotation information could further increase the accuracy of the haplotype model, where the further increase in accuracy is significantly relative to the increase of relative haplotype epistasis heritability. The genomic prediction using LD information for constructing haplotypes has the best prediction performance among the 4 traits. These results uncovered that haplotype methods were beneficial for genomic prediction, and the accuracy could be further increased by incorporating genomic annotation information. Moreover, using LD information would potentially improve the performance of genomic prediction.Copyright © 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

While studies of the pathologic consequences of repeat expansions that cause syndromic human diseases are extensive, the potential native functions of STRs are often ignored. Here, we summarize a growing body of research into the normal biological functions for repetitive elements across the genome, with a particular focus on the roles of STRs in regulating gene expression. We propose reconceptualizing the pathogenic consequences of repeat expansions as aberrancies in normal gene regulation. From this altered viewpoint, we predict that future work will reveal broader roles for STRs in neuronal function and as risk alleles for more common human neurological diseases."
"36941259","Small molecule metabolites: discovery of biomarkers and therapeutic targets.","Signal Transduct Target Ther","Metabolic abnormalities lead to the dysfunction of metabolic pathways and metabolite accumulation or deficiency which is well-recognized hallmarks of diseases. Metabolite signatures that have close proximity to subject's phenotypic informative dimension, are useful for predicting diagnosis and prognosis of diseases as well as monitoring treatments. The lack of early biomarkers could lead to poor diagnosis and serious outcomes. Therefore, noninvasive diagnosis and monitoring methods with high specificity and selectivity are desperately needed. Small molecule metabolites-based metabolomics has become a specialized tool for metabolic biomarker and pathway analysis, for revealing possible mechanisms of human various diseases and deciphering therapeutic potentials. It could help identify functional biomarkers related to phenotypic variation and delineate biochemical pathways changes as early indicators of pathological dysfunction and damage prior to disease development. Recently, scientists have established a large number of metabolic profiles to reveal the underlying mechanisms and metabolic networks for therapeutic target exploration in biomedicine. This review summarized the metabolic analysis on the potential value of small-molecule candidate metabolites as biomarkers with clinical events, which may lead to better diagnosis, prognosis, drug screening and treatment.

"36922674","Epigenetic and epitranscriptomic regulation of axon regeneration.","Mol Psychiatry","Effective axonal regeneration in the adult mammalian nervous system requires coordination of elevated intrinsic growth capacity and decreased responses to the inhibitory environment. Intrinsic regenerative capacity largely depends on the gene regulatory network and protein translation machinery. A failure to activate these pathways upon injury is underlying a lack of robust axon regeneration in the mature mammalian central nervous system. Epigenetics and epitranscriptomics are key regulatory mechanisms that shape gene expression and protein translation. Here, we provide an overview of different types of modifications on DNA, histones, and RNA, underpinning the regenerative competence of axons in the mature mammalian peripheral and central nervous systems. We highlight other non-neuronal cells and their epigenetic changes in determining the microenvironment for tissue repair and axon regeneration. We also address advancements of single-cell technology in charting transcriptomic and epigenetic landscapes that may further facilitate the mechanistic understanding of differential regenerative capacity in neuronal subtypes. Finally, as epigenetic and epitranscriptomic processes are commonly affected by brain injuries and psychiatric disorders, understanding their alterations upon brain injury would provide unprecedented mechanistic insights into etiology of injury-associated-psychiatric disorders and facilitate the development of therapeutic interventions to restore brain function.© 2023.

"36937047","Adolescent binge ethanol impacts H3K36me3 regulation of synaptic genes.","Front Mol Neurosci","Adolescence is marked in part by the ongoing development of the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Binge ethanol use during this critical stage in neurodevelopment induces significant structural changes to the PFC, as well as cognitive and behavioral deficits that can last into adulthood. Previous studies showed that adolescent binge ethanol causes lasting deficits in working memory, decreases in the expression of chromatin remodeling genes responsible for the methylation of histone 3 lysine 36 (H3K36), and global decreases in H3K36 in the PFC. H3K36me3 is present within the coding region of actively-transcribed genes, and safeguards against aberrant, cryptic transcription by RNA Polymerase II. We hypothesize that altered methylation of H3K36 could play a role in adolescent binge ethanol-induced memory deficits. To investigate this at the molecular level, ethanol (4 g/kg, i.g.) or water was administered intermittently to adolescent mice. RNA-and ChIP-sequencing were then performed within the same tissue to determine gene expression changes and identify genes and loci where H3K36me3 was disrupted by ethanol. We further assessed ethanol-induced changes at the transcription level with differential exon-use and cryptic transcription analysis - a hallmark of decreased H3K36me3. Here, we found ethanol-induced changes to the gene expression and H3K36me3-regulation of synaptic-related genes in all our analyses. Notably, H3K36me3 was differentially trimethylated between ethanol and control conditions at synaptic-related genes, andSnap25andCplx1showed evidence of cryptic transcription in males and females treated with ethanol during adolescence. Our results provide preliminary evidence that ethanol-induced changes to H3K36me3 during adolescent neurodevelopment may be linked to synaptic dysregulation at the transcriptional level, which may explain the reported ethanol-induced changes to PFC synaptic function.Copyright © 2023 Brocato and Wolstenholme."

Experimental crosses are valuable resources for mapping such traits. Traditionally, genome-wide analyses of experimental crosses have targeted major loci using data from a single generation (often the F2) with individuals from later generations being generated for replication and fine-mapping. Here, we aim to confidently identify minor-effect loci contributing to the highly polygenic basis of the long-term, bi-directional selection responses for 56-d body weight in the Virginia body weight chicken lines. To achieve this, a strategy was developed to make use of data from all generations (F2-F18) of the advanced intercross line, developed by crossing the low and high selected lines after 40 generations of selection. A cost-efficient low-coverage sequencing based approach was used to obtain high-confidence genotypes in 1Mb bins across 99.3% of the chicken genome for >3,300 intercross individuals. In total, 12 genome-wide significant, and 30 additional suggestive QTL reaching a 10% FDR threshold, were mapped for 56-d body weight. Only 2 of these QTL reached genome-wide significance in earlier analyses of the F2generation. The minor-effect QTL mapped here were generally due to an overall increase in power by integrating data across generations, with contributions from increased genome-coverage and improved marker information content. The 12 significant QTL explain >37% of the difference between the parental lines, three times more than 2 previously reported significant QTL. The 42 significant and suggestive QTL together explain >80%. Making integrated use of all available samples from multiple generations in experimental crosses are economically feasible using the low-cost, sequencing-based genotyping strategies outlined here. Our empirical results illustrate the value of this strategy for mapping novel minor-effect loci contributing to complex traits to provide a more confident, comprehensive view of the individual loci that form the genetic basis of the highly polygenic, long-term selection responses for 56-d body weight in the Virginia body weight chicken lines.Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

"36865197","Pleiotropic contribution of rbfox1 to psychiatric and neurodevelopmental phenotypes in a zebrafish model.","bioRxiv","RBFOX1is a highly pleiotropic gene that contributes to several psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. Both rare and common variants inRBFOX1have been associated with several psychiatric conditions, but the mechanisms underlying the pleiotropic effects ofRBFOX1are not yet understood. Here we found that, in zebrafish,rbfox1is expressed in spinal cord, mid- and hindbrain during developmental stages. In adults, expression is restricted to specific areas of the brain, including telencephalic and diencephalic regions with an important role in receiving and processing sensory information and in directing behaviour. To investigate the effect ofrbfox1deficiency on behaviour, we usedrbfox1sa15940, arbfox1loss-of-function line. We found thatrbfox1sa15940mutants present hyperactivity, thigmotaxis, decreased freezing behaviour and altered social behaviour. We repeated these behavioural tests in a secondrbfox1loss-of-function line with a different genetic background,rbfox1del19, and found thatrbfox1deficiency affects behaviour similarly in this line, although there were some differences.rbfox1del19mutants present similar thigmotaxis, but stronger alterations in social behaviour and lower levels of hyperactivity thanrbfox1sa15940fish. Taken together, these results suggest thatrbfox1deficiency leads to multiple behavioural changes in zebrafish that might be modulated by environmental, epigenetic and genetic background effects, and that resemble phenotypic alterations present inRbfox1-deficient mice and in patients with different psychiatric conditions. Our study thus highlights the evolutionary conservation ofrbfox1function in behaviour and paves the way to further investigate the mechanisms underlyingrbfox1pleiotropy on the onset of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders."

Here, we show that WNT/β-catenin signaling activation sustains transient mouse epiblast-like cells as epiblast-like stem cells (EpiLSCs). EpiLSCs display metastable formative pluripotency with bivalent cellular energy metabolism and unique transcriptomic features and chromatin accessibility. We develop single-cell stage label transfer (scSTALT) to study the formative pluripotency continuum and reveal that EpiLSCs recapitulate a unique developmental period in vivo, filling the gap of the formative pluripotency continuum between other published formative stem cells. WNT/β-catenin signaling activation counteracts differentiation effects of activin A and bFGF by preventing complete dissolution of naive pluripotency regulatory network. Moreover, EpiLSCs have direct competence toward germline specification, which is further matured by an FGF receptor inhibitor. Our EpiLSCs can serve as an in vitro model for mimicking and studying early post-implantation development and pluripotency transition.Copyright © 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

"36865230","Distinct CSF biomarker-associated DNA methylation in Alzheimer's disease and cognitively normal subjects.","Res Sq","Background Growing evidence has demonstrated that DNA methylation (DNAm) plays an important role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and that DNAm differences can be detected in the blood of AD subjects. Most studies have correlated blood DNAm with the clinical diagnosis of AD in living individuals. However, as the pathophysiological process of AD can begin many years before the onset of clinical symptoms, there is often disagreement between neuropathology in the brain and clinical phenotypes. Therefore, blood DNAm associated with AD neuropathology, rather than with clinical data, would provide more relevant information on AD pathogenesis. Methods We performed a comprehensive analysis to identify blood DNAm associated with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pathological biomarkers for AD. Our study included matched samples of whole blood DNA methylation, CSF Aβ42, phosphorylated tau181(pTau181), and total tau (tTau) biomarkers data, measured on the same subjects and at the same clinical visits from a total of 202 subjects (123 CN or cognitively normal, 79 AD) in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. To validate our findings, we also examined the association between premortem blood DNAm and postmortem brain neuropathology measured on a group of 69 subjects in the London dataset. Results We identified a number of novel associations between blood DNAm and CSF biomarkers, demonstrating that changes in pathological processes in the CSF are reflected in the blood epigenome. Overall, the CSF biomarker-associated DNAm is relatively distinct in CN and AD subjects, highlighting the importance of analyzing omics data measured on cognitively normal subjects (which includes preclinical AD subjects) to identify diagnostic biomarkers, and considering disease stages in the development and testing of AD treatment strategies. Moreover, our analysis revealed biological processes associated with early brain impairment relevant to AD are marked by DNAm in the blood, and blood DNAm at several CpGs in the DMR onHOXA5gene are associated with pTau181in the CSF, as well as tau-pathology and DNAm in the brain, nominating DNAm at this locus as a promising candidate AD biomarker. Conclusions Our study provides a valuable resource for future mechanistic and biomarker studies of DNAm in AD."
"36927494","The effect of high polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon exposure on biological aging indicators.","Environ Health","Aging represents a serious health and socioeconomic concern for our society. However, not all people age in the same way and air pollution has been shown to largely impact this process. We explored whether polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), excellent fossil and wood burning tracers, accelerate biological aging detected by lymphocytes DNA methylation age (DNAmAge) and telomere length (TL), early nuclear DNA (nDNA) hallmarks of non-mitotic and mitotic cellular aging, and mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNAcn).The study population consisted of 49 male noncurrent-smoking coke-oven workers and 44 matched controls. Occupational and environmental sources of PAH exposures were evaluated by structured questionnaire and internal dose (urinary 1-pyrenol). We estimated Occup_PAHs, the product of 1-pyrenol and years of employment as coke-oven workers, and Environ_PAHs, from multiple items (diet, indoor and outdoor). Biological aging was determined by DNAmAge, via pyrosequencing, and by TL and mtDNAcn, via quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Genomic instability markers in lymphocytes as target dose [anti-benzo[a]pyrene diolepoxide (anti-BPDE)-DNA adduct], genetic instability (micronuclei), gene-specific (p53, IL6 and HIC1) and global (Alu and LINE-1 repeats) DNA methylation, and genetic polymorphisms (GSTM1) were also evaluated in the latent variable nDNA_changes. Structural equation modelling (SEM) analysis evaluated these multifaceted relationships.In univariate analysis, biological aging was higher in coke-oven workers than controls as detected by higher percentage of subjects with biological age older than chronological age (AgeAcc ≥ 0, p = 0.007) and TL (p = 0.038), mtDNAcn was instead similar. Genomic instability, i.e., genotoxic and epigenetic alterations (LINE-1, p53 and Alu) and latent variable nDNA_changes were higher in workers (p < 0.001). In SEM analysis, DNAmAge and TL were positively correlated with Occup_PAHs (p < 0.0001). Instead, mtDNAcn is positively correlated with the latent variable nDNA_changes (p < 0.0001) which is in turn triggered by Occup_PAHs and Environ_PAHs.Occupational PAHs exposure influences DNAmAge and TL, suggesting that PAHs target both non-mitotic and mitotic mechanisms and made coke-oven workers biologically older. Also, differences in mtDNAcn, which is modified through nDNA alterations, triggered by environmental and occupational PAH exposure, suggested a nuclear-mitochondrial core-axis of aging. By decreasing this risky gerontogenic exposure, biological aging and the consequent age-related diseases could be prevented.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Genetic variants in cyclic-adenosine-monophosphate-response-element-binding protein 3 regulatory factor (CREBRF) gene are frequently observed in Pacific Islanders, a population with elevated prostate cancer incidence. CREBRF has been shown to play a role in other cancers, however its function in prostate homeostasis and tumorigenesis has not been previously explored. We determined the incidence of CREBRF alterations in publicly available databases and examined the impact of CREBRF deletion on the murine prostate in order to determine whether CREBRF impacts prostate physiology or pathophysiology.Alterations in CREBRF were identified in prostate cancer patients via in silico analysis of several publicly available datasets through cBioPortal. MaleCrebrfknockout and wild-type littermate mice were generated and examined for prostate defects at 4 months of age. Immunohistochemical staining of murine prostate sections was used to determine the impact ofCrebrfknockout on proliferation, apoptosis, inflammation and blood vessel density in the prostate. Serum adipokine levels were measured using a Luminex Multiplex Assay.CREBRF alterations were identified in up to 4.05% of prostate tumors and the mutations identified were categorized as likely damaging. Median survival of prostate cancer patients with genetic alterations in CREBRF was 41.23 months, compared to 131 months for patients without these changes. In the murine model, the prostates ofCrebrfknockout mice had reduced epithelial proliferation and increased TUNEL+apoptotic cells. Circulating adipokines PAI-1 and MCP-1 were also altered inCrebrfknockout mice compared to age-matched controls.Prostate cancer patients with genetic alterations in CREBRF had a significantly decreased overall survival suggesting that wild type CREBRF may play a role in limiting prostate tumorigenesis and progression. The murine knockout model demonstrated that CREBRF could modulate proliferation and apoptosis and macrophage density in the prostate. Serum levels of adipokines PAI-1 and MCP-1 were also altered and may contribute to the phenotypic changes observed in the prostates ofCrebrfknockout mice. Future studies focused on populations susceptible to CREBRF mutations and mechanistic studies will be required to fully elucidate the potential role of CREBRF in prostate tumorigenesis.AJCEU Copyright © 2023."

We found evidence of partner choice for 64 traits, 40 of which had larger phenotypic correlation than causal effect. This suggests that confounders contribute to trait similarity, among which household income, overall health rating and education accounted for 29.8, 14.1 and 11.6% of correlations between partners, respectively. Finally, mediation analysis revealed that most causal associations between different traits in the two partners are indirect.

"36923930","The Emerging Role of Super-enhancers as Therapeutic Targets in The Digestive System Tumors.","Int J Biol Sci","Digestive system tumors include malignancies of the stomach, pancreas, colon, rectum, and the esophagus, and are associated with high morbidity and mortality. Aberrant epigenetic modifications play a vital role in the progression of digestive system tumors. The aberrant transcription of key oncogenes is driven by super-enhancers (SEs), which are characterized by large clusters of enhancers with significantly high density of transcription factors, cofactors, and epigenetic modulatory proteins. The SEs consist of critical epigenetic regulatory elements, which modulate the biological characteristics of digestive system tumors including tumor cell identity and differentiation, tumorigenesis, environmental response, immune response, and chemotherapeutic resistance. The core transcription regulatory loop of the digestive system tumors is complex and a high density of transcription regulatory complexes in the SEs and the crosstalk between SEs and the noncoding RNAs. In this review, we summarized the known characteristics and functions of the SEs in the digestive system tumors. Furthermore, we discuss the oncogenic roles and regulatory mechanisms of SEs in the digestive system tumors. We highlight the role of SE-driven genes, enhancer RNAs (eRNAs), lncRNAs, and miRNAs in the digestive system tumor growth and progression. Finally, we discuss clinical significance of the CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing system and inhibitors of SE-related proteins such as BET and CDK7 as potential cancer therapeutics.© The author(s)."

Leveraging genome-wide data from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, we tested the enrichment of self-domestication and neural crest function loci with respect to the heritability of autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia (SCZ in East Asian and European ancestries, EAS and EUR, respectively), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and Tourette's syndrome (TS). Considering only self-domestication and neural-crest-function annotations in the linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC) model, our partitioned heritability analysis revealed statistically significant enrichments across all disorders investigated. The estimates of the heritability enrichments for self-domestication loci were similar across neurodevelopmental disorders, ranging from 0.902 (EAS SCZ, p = 4.55 × 10-20) to 1.577 (TS, p = 5.85 × 10-5). Conversely, a wider spectrum of heritability enrichment estimates was present for neural crest function with the highest enrichment observed for TS (enrichment = 3.453, p = 2.88 × 10-3) and the lowest for EAS SCZ (enrichment = 1.971, p = 3.81 × 10-3). Although these estimates appear to be strong, the enrichments for self-domestication and neural crest function were null once we included additional annotations related to different genomic features. This indicates that the effect of self-domestication on the polygenic architecture of neurodevelopmental disorders is not independent of other functions of human genome.© 2023.

While underlying mechanisms leading to the occurrence of frailty are complex, the importance of genetic factors has not been fully investigated. We conducted a large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) of frailty, as defined by the five criteria (weight loss, exhaustion, physical activity, walking speed, and grip strength) captured in the Fried Frailty Score (FFS), in 386,565 European descent participants enrolled in the UK Biobank (mean age 57 [SD 8] years, 208,481 [54%] females). We identified 37 independent, novel loci associated with the FFS (p < 5 × 10-8), including seven loci without prior described associations with other traits. The variants associated with FFS were significantly enriched in brain tissues as well as aging-related pathways. Our post-GWAS bioinformatic analyses revealed significant genetic correlations between FFS and cardiovascular-, neurological-, and inflammation-related diseases/traits, and subsequent Mendelian Randomization analyses identified causal associations with chronic pain, obesity, diabetes, education-related traits, joint disorders, and depressive/neurological, metabolic, and respiratory diseases. The GWAS signals were replicated in the Health and Retirement Study (HRS, n = 9,720, mean age 73 [SD 7], 5,582 [57%] females), where the polygenic risk score built from UKB GWAS was significantly associated with the FFS in HRS individuals (OR per SD of the score 1.27, 95% CI 1.22-1.31, p = 1.3 × 10-11).

However, this approach lacks cell-specific resolution. We performed comprehensive transcriptomic analyses on bulk tissue and laser-capture microdissected (LCM) neurons from 59 postmortem human brains (27 ASD and 32 controls) in the superior temporal gyrus (STG) of individuals ranging from 2 to 73 years of age. In bulk tissue, synaptic signaling, heat shock protein-related pathways, and RNA splicing were significantly altered in ASD. There was age-dependent dysregulation of genes involved in gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) (GAD1andGAD2) and glutamate (SLC38A1) signaling pathways. In LCM neurons, AP-1-mediated neuroinflammation and insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathways were upregulated in ASD, while mitochondrial function, ribosome, and spliceosome components were downregulated. GABA synthesizing enzymesGAD1andGAD2were both downregulated in ASD neurons. Mechanistic modeling suggested a direct link between inflammation and ASD in neurons, and prioritized inflammation-associated genes for future study. Alterations in small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) associated with splicing events suggested interplay between snoRNA dysregulation and splicing disruption in neurons of individuals with ASD. Our findings supported the fundamental hypothesis of altered neuronal communication in ASD, demonstrated that inflammation was elevated at least in part in ASD neurons, and may reveal windows of opportunity for biotherapeutics to target the trajectory of gene expression and clinical manifestation of ASD throughout the human lifespan."

The T2D dataset was obtained from the DIAGRAM Consortium. The ADHD datasets were obtained from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium. We compared genome-wide association signals to reveal shared genetic variation between T2D and ADHD using the larger ADHD2022 dataset. Moreover, molecular pathways were constructed based on large-scale literature data to understand the connection between ADHD and T2D.T2D has positive genetic correlations with ADHD2019 (rg=0.33) and ADHD2022 (rg=0.31). Genetic liability to ADHD2019 was associated with an increased risk for T2D (odds ratio (OR): 1.30, p<0.001), while genetic liability to ADHD2022 had a suggestive causal effect on T2D (OR: 1.30, p=0.086). Genetic liability to T2D was associated with a higher risk for ADHD2019 (OR: 1.05, p=0.001) and ADHD2022 (OR: 1.03, p<0.001). The polygenic overlap analysis showed that most causal variants of T2D are shared with ADHD2022. T2D and ADHD2022 have three overlapping loci. Molecular pathway analysis suggests that ADHD and T2D could promote the risk of each other through inflammatory pathways.Our study demonstrates substantial shared genetics and bidirectional causal associations between ADHD and T2D.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023.

We conducted observational and Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses to assess the associations of sleep duration and daytime napping with PAD risk.Sleep traits were assessed for associations with incident PAD using cohort analysis among 53 416 Swedish adults. Replicated was sought in a case-control study of 28 123 PAD cases and 128 459 controls from the veterans affairs Million Veteran Program (MVP) and a cohort study of 452 028 individuals from the UK Biobank study (UKB). Two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) was used for casual inference-based analyses of sleep-related traits and PAD (31 307 PAD cases 211 753 controls). Observational analyses demonstrated a U-shaped association between sleep duration and PAD risk. In Swedish adults, incident PAD risk was higher in those with short sleep [<5 h; hazard ratio (HR) 1.74; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.31-2.31] or long sleep (≥8 h; HR 1.24; 95% CI 1.08-1.43), compared to individuals with a sleep duration of 7 to <8 h/night. This finding was supported by the analyses in MVP and UKB. Observational analysis also revealed positive associations between daytime napping (HR 1.32, 95% CI 1.18-1.49) with PAD. MR analysis supported an inverse association between sleep duration [odds ratio (OR) per hour increase: 0.79, 95% CI, 0.55, 0.89] and PAD and an association between short sleep and increased PAD (OR 1.20, 95% CI, 1.04-1.38).Short sleep duration was associated with an increased risk of PAD.© The Author(s) 2023.

We performed a genome-wide association study and meta-analysis of data from 34,422 individuals with acne and 364,991 controls from three independent European-ancestry cohorts. We replicated 19 previously implicated genome-wide significant risk loci and identified four novel loci [11q12.2 (FADS2), 12q21.1 (LGR5), 17q25.3 (FASN), and 22q12.1 (ZNRF3-KREMEN1)], bringing the total number of reported acne risk loci to 50. Our meta-analysis results explain 9.4% of the phenotypic variance of acne. A polygenic model of acne risk variants showed that individuals in the top 5% of the risk percentiles had a 1.62-fold (95% CI 1.47-1.78) increased acne risk relative to individuals with average risk (20-80% on the polygenic risk score distribution). Our findings highlight the Wnt and MAPK pathways as key factors in the genetic predisposition to acne vulgaris, together with the effects of genetic variation on the structure and maintenance of the hair follicle and pilosebaceous unit. Two novel loci, 11q12.2 and 17q25.3, contain genes encoding key enzymes involved in lipid biosynthesis pathways.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Amyloid precursor protein (APP) mutations are implicated in hypertension development. Nonetheless, studies on the association of APP gene polymorphism and promoter methylation with hypertension are limited. Therefore, this case-control aims to evaluate the genetic association of APP gene polymorphism and promoter methylation with EH in Guizhou populations.We conducted a case-control study on 343 EH patients and 335 healthy controls (including Miao, Buyi, and Han populations) in the Guizhou province of China to analyze 11 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (rs2040273, rs63750921, rs2211772, rs2830077, rs467021, rs368196, rs466433, rs364048, rs364051, rs438031, rs463946) in the APP gene via MassARRAY SNP. The MassARRAY EpiTYPER was employed to detect the methylation levels of the promoters.In the Han population, the rs2211772 genotype distribution was significantly different between disease and control groups (χ2 = 6.343, P = 0.039). The CC genotype reduced the risk of hypertension compared to the TT or TC genotype (OR 0.105, 95%CI 0.012-0.914, P = 0.041). For rs2040273 in the Miao population, AG or GG genotype reduced the hypertension risk compared with the AA genotype (OR 0.533, 95%CI 0.294-0.965, P = 0.038). Haplotype TCC (rs364051-rs438031-rs463946) increased the risk of EH in Guizhou (OR 1.427, 95%CI 1.020-1.996, P = 0.037). Each 1% increase in CpG_19 (- 613 bp) methylation level was associated with a 4.1% increase in hypertension risk (OR 1.041, 95%CI 1.002-1.081, P = 0.039). Each 1% increase in CpG_1 (- 296 bp) methylation level was associated with an 8% decrease in hypertension risk in women (OR 0.920, 95%CI 0.860-0.984, P = 0.015). CpG_19 significantly correlated with systolic blood pressure (r = 0.2, P = 0.03). The methylation levels of CpG_19 in hypertensive patients with rs466433, rs364048, and rs364051 minor alleles were lower than that with wild-type alleles (P < 0.05). Moreover, rs467021 and rs364051 showed strong synergistic interaction with EH (χ2 = 7.633, P = 0.006). CpG_11, CpG_19, and rs364051 showed weak synergistic interaction with EH (χ2 = 19.874, P < 0.001).In summary, rs2211772 polymorphism and promoter methylation level of APP gene may be linked to EH in Guizhou populations.

"36719112","SWEET: a single-sample network inference method for deciphering individual features in disease.","Brief Bioinform","Recently, extracting inherent biological system information (e.g. cellular networks) from genome-wide expression profiles for developing personalized diagnostic and therapeutic strategies has become increasingly important. However, accurately constructing single-sample networks (SINs) to capture individual characteristics and heterogeneity in disease remains challenging. Here, we propose a sample-specific-weighted correlation network (SWEET) method to model SINs by integrating the genome-wide sample-to-sample correlation (i.e. sample weights) with the differential network between perturbed and aggregate networks. For a group of samples, the genome-wide sample weights can be assessed without prior knowledge of intrinsic subpopulations to address the network edge number bias caused by sample size differences. Compared with the state-of-the-art SIN inference methods, the SWEET SINs in 16 cancers more likely fit the scale-free property, display higher overlap with the human interactomes and perform better in identifying three types of cancer-related genes. Moreover, integrating SWEET SINs with a network proximity measure facilitates characterizing individual features and therapy in diseases, such as somatic mutation, mut-driver and essential genes. Biological experiments further validated two candidate repurposable drugs, albendazole for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and encorafenib for HNSCC. By applying SWEET, we also identified two possible LUAD subtypes that exhibit distinct clinical features and molecular mechanisms. Overall, the SWEET method complements current SIN inference and analysis methods and presents a view of biological systems at the network level to offer numerous clues for further investigation and clinical translation in network medicine and precision medicine.© The Author(s) 2023.

Blood-based RNA alternative splicing (AS) events, which have not been well characterized in pathogen infection, have potential normalization and assay platform stability advantages over gene expression for diagnosis. Here, we present a computational framework for developing AS diagnostic biomarkers. Leveraging a large prospective cohort of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and whole-blood RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data, we identify a major functional AS program switch upon viral infection. Using an independent cohort, we demonstrate the improved accuracy of AS biomarkers for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis compared with six reported transcriptome signatures. We then optimize a subset of AS-based biomarkers to develop microfluidic PCR diagnostic assays. This assay achieves nearly perfect test accuracy (61/62 = 98.4%) using a naive principal component classifier, significantly more accurate than a gene expression PCR assay in the same cohort. Therefore, our RNA splicing computational framework enables a promising avenue for host-response diagnosis of infection."

"36909524","Pretraining strategies for effective promoter-driven gene expression prediction.","bioRxiv","Advances in gene delivery technologies are enabling rapid progress in molecular medicine, but require precise expression of genetic cargo in desired cell types, which is predominantly achieved via a regulatory DNA sequence called a promoter; however, only a handful of cell type-specific promoters are known. Efficiently designing compact promoter sequences with a high density of regulatory information by leveraging machine learning models would therefore be broadly impactful for fundamental research and direct therapeutic applications. However, models of expression from such compact promoter sequences are lacking, despite the recent success of deep learning in modelling expression from endogenous regulatory sequences. Despite the lack of large datasets measuring promoter-driven expression in many cell types, data from a few well-studied cell types or from endogenous gene expression may provide relevant information for transfer learning, which has not yet been explored in this setting. Here, we evaluate a variety of pretraining tasks and transfer strategies for modelling cell type-specific expression from compact promoters and demonstrate the effectiveness of pretraining on existing promoter-driven expression datasets from other cell types. Our approach is broadly applicable for modelling promoter-driven expression in any data-limited cell type of interest, and will enable the use of model-based optimization techniques for promoter design for gene delivery applications.

Here, we systematically investigated the genomic and transcriptomic diversity in Kazaks, Uyghurs, and Huis-three admixed populations of various Eurasian ancestries living in Xinjiang, China. All three populations showed elevated genetic diversity and closer genetic distance compared with the reference populations across the Eurasian continent. However, we also observed differentiated genomic diversity and inferred different demographic histories among the three populations. Varying ancestry proportions observed in both the global and local aspects corresponded to the population-differentiated genomic diversity, with the most representative signals observed in the genes EDAR, SULT1C4, and SLC24A5. The varying local ancestry partly resulted from the postadmixture local adaptation, with the most significant signals observed in immunity- and metabolism-related pathways. Admixture-shaped genomic diversity further influenced the transcriptomic diversity in the admixed populations; in particular, population-specific regulatory effects were associated with immunity- and metabolism-involved genes such as MTHFR, FCER1G, SDHC, and BDH2. Furthermore, differentially expressed genes between the populations were identified, many of which could be explained by the population-specific regulatory properties, including genes related to health concerns (e.g., AHI1 between Kazak and Uyghurs [P < 6.92 × 10-5] and CTRC between Huis and Uyghurs [P < 2.32 × 10-4]).

However, to fully understand the functional implications of these variants, detailed annotation of the horse genome is required. Due to the limited availability of functional data for the equine genome, as well as the technical limitations of short-read RNA-seq, existing annotation of the equine genome contains limited information about important aspects of gene regulation, such as alternate isoforms and regulatory elements, which are either not transcribed or transcribed at a very low level. To solve above problems, the Functional Annotation of the Animal Genomes (FAANG) project proposed a systemic approach to tissue collection, phenotyping, and data generation, adopting the blueprint laid out by the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project. Here we detail the first comprehensive overview of gene expression and regulation in the horse, presenting 39,625 novel transcripts, 84,613 candidate cis-regulatory elements (CRE) and their target genes, 332,115 open chromatin regions genome wide across a diverse set of tissues. We showed substantial concordance between chromatin accessibility, chromatin states in different genic features and gene expression. This comprehensive and expanded set of genomics resources will provide the equine research community ample opportunities for studies of complex traits in the horse.Copyright: © 2023 Peng et al.

We therefore mapped chromatin accessibility using ATAC-seq for 10 B-ALL molecular subtypes in primary ALL cells from 154 patients. Comparisons with B-cell progenitors identified candidate B-ALL cell-of-origin and AP-1-associatedcis-regulatory rewiring in B-ALL.Cis-regulatory rewiring promoted B-ALL-specific gene regulatory networks impacting oncogenic signaling pathways that perturb normal B-cell development. We also identified that over 20% of B-ALL accessible chromatin sites exhibit strong subtype enrichment, with transcription factor (TF) footprint profiling identifying candidate TFs that maintain subtype-specific chromatin architectures. Over 9000 inherited genetic variants were further uncovered that contribute to variability in chromatin accessibility among individual patient samples.

While studied mostly for mean differences, methylation also encodes stochastic change, defined as entropy in information theory. Analyzing allele-specific methylation in 49 human tissue sample datasets, we find that methylation entropy is associated with specific DNA binding motifs, regulatory DNA, and CpG density. Then applying information theory to 42 mouse embryo methylation datasets, we find that the contribution of methylation entropy to time- and tissue-specific patterns of development is comparable to the contribution of methylation mean, and methylation entropy is associated with sequence and chromatin features conserved with human. Moreover, methylation entropy is directly related to gene expression variability in development, suggesting a role for epigenetic entropy in developmental plasticity.© The Author(s) 2023.

"36932062","Kidney fibrosis: from mechanisms to therapeutic medicines.","Signal Transduct Target Ther","Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is estimated to affect 10-14% of global population. Kidney fibrosis, characterized by excessive extracellular matrix deposition leading to scarring, is a hallmark manifestation in different progressive CKD; However, at present no antifibrotic therapies against CKD exist. Kidney fibrosis is identified by tubule atrophy, interstitial chronic inflammation and fibrogenesis, glomerulosclerosis, and vascular rarefaction. Fibrotic niche, where organ fibrosis initiates, is a complex interplay between injured parenchyma (like tubular cells) and multiple non-parenchymal cell lineages (immune and mesenchymal cells) located spatially within scarring areas. Although the mechanisms of kidney fibrosis are complicated due to the kinds of cells involved, with the help of single-cell technology, many key questions have been explored, such as what kind of renal tubules are profibrotic, where myofibroblasts originate, which immune cells are involved, and how cells communicate with each other. In addition, genetics and epigenetics are deeper mechanisms that regulate kidney fibrosis. And the reversible nature of epigenetic changes including DNA methylation, RNA interference, and chromatin remodeling, gives an opportunity to stop or reverse kidney fibrosis by therapeutic strategies. More marketed (e.g., RAS blockage, SGLT2 inhibitors) have been developed to delay CKD progression in recent years. Furthermore, a better understanding of renal fibrosis is also favored to discover biomarkers of fibrotic injury. In the review, we update recent advances in the mechanism of renal fibrosis and summarize novel biomarkers and antifibrotic treatment for CKD.© 2023. The Author(s)."

In a previous study, we found that low levels of sulphur and cobalt (low S/Co) in the diet offered to oocyte donors altered the DNA methylome of bovine embryos. However, due to the extensive epigenetic reprogramming that occurs during embryogenesis, we hypothesized that the different methylation regions (DMRs) identified in the blastocysts may not maintain in adulthood. Here, we aimed to characterize DMRs previously identified in embryos, in the blood and sperm of adult progenies of two groups of heifers (low S/Co and control). We used six bulls and characterized the DNA methylation levels ofKDM2A,KDM5A,KMT2D, andDOT1Lgenes. Our results showed that all DMRs analysed in both groups and tissues were hypermethylated unlike that noticed in the embryonic methylome profiles. These results suggest that embryo DMRs were reprogrammed during the final stages ofde novomethylation during embryogenesis or later in development. Therefore, due to the highly dynamic epigenetic state during early embryonic development, we suggest that is essential to validate the DMRs found in embryos in adult individuals."

"36941675","Weak gene-gene interaction facilitates the evolution of gene expression plasticity.","BMC Biol","Individual organisms may exhibit phenotypic plasticity when they acclimate to different conditions. Such plastic responses may facilitate or constrain the adaptation of their descendant populations to new environments, complicating their evolutionary trajectories beyond the genetic blueprint. Intriguingly, phenotypic plasticity itself can evolve in terms of its direction and magnitude during adaptation. However, we know little about what determines the evolution of phenotypic plasticity, including gene expression plasticity. Recent laboratory-based studies suggest dominance of reversing gene expression plasticity-plastic responses that move the levels of gene expression away from the new optima. Nevertheless, evidence from natural populations is still limited.Here, we studied gene expression plasticity and its evolution in the montane and lowland populations of an elevationally widespread songbird-the Rufous-capped Babbler (Cyanoderma ruficeps)-with reciprocal transplant experiments and transcriptomic analyses; we set common gardens at altitudes close to these populations' native ranges. We confirmed the prevalence of reversing plasticity in genes associated with altitudinal adaptation. Interestingly, we found a positive relationship between magnitude and degree of evolution in gene expression plasticity, which was pertinent to not only adaptation-associated genes but also the whole transcriptomes from multiple tissues. Furthermore, we revealed that genes with weaker expressional interactions with other genes tended to exhibit stronger plasticity and higher degree of plasticity evolution, which explains the positive magnitude-evolution relationship.Our experimental evidence demonstrates that species may initiate their adaptation to new habitats with genes exhibiting strong expression plasticity. We also highlight the role of expression interdependence among genes in regulating the magnitude and evolution of expression plasticity. This study illuminates how the evolution of phenotypic plasticity in gene expression facilitates the adaptation of species to challenging environments in nature.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Consensus BLCA transcriptomic subtypes have been proposed, with two major Luminal and Basal subgroups, presenting distinct molecular and clinical characteristics. However, how these distinct subtypes are regulated remains unclear. We hypothesized that epigenetic activation of distinct super-enhancers could drive the transcriptional programs of BLCA subtypes. Through integrated RNA-sequencing and epigenomic profiling of histone marks in primary tumours, cancer cell lines, and normal human urothelia, we established the first integrated epigenetic map of BLCA and demonstrated the link between subtype and epigenetic control. We identified the repertoire of activated super-enhancers and highlighted Basal, Luminal and Normal-associated SEs. We revealed super-enhancer-regulated networks of candidate master transcription factors for Luminal and Basal subgroups including FOXA1 and ZBED2, respectively. FOXA1 CRISPR-Cas9 mutation triggered a shift from Luminal to Basal phenotype, confirming its role in Luminal identity regulation and induced ZBED2 overexpression. In parallel, we showed that both FOXA1 and ZBED2 play concordant roles in preventing inflammatory response in cancer cells through STAT2 inhibition. Our study furthers the understanding of epigenetic regulation of muscle-invasive BLCA and identifies a co-regulated network of super-enhancers and associated transcription factors providing potential targets for the treatment of this aggressive disease.© 2023.

"36940084","Construction of Metastasis-Specific Regulation Network in Ovarian Cancer Based on Prognostic Stemness-Related Signatures.","Reprod Sci","WE aimed to reveal the correlation between ovarian cancer (OV) metastasis and cancer stemness in OV. RNA-seq data and clinical information of 591 OV samples (551 without metastasis and 40 with metastasis) were obtained from TCGA. The edgeR method was used to determine differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and transcription factors (DETFs). Then, mRNA expression-based stemness index was calculated using one-class logistic regression (OCLR). Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to define stemness-related genes (SRGs). Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression were conducted to identify the prognostic SRGs (PSRGs). PSRGs, DETFs, and 50 hallmark pathways quantified by gene set variation analysis (GSVA) were integrated into Pearson co-expression analysis. Significant co-expression interactions were utilized to construct an OV metastasis-specific regulation network. Cell communication analysis was carried out based on single cell RNA sequencing data to explore the molecular regulation mechanism of OV. Eventually, assay for targeting accessible-chromatin with high throughout sequencing (ATAC), chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) validation, and multiple data sets were used to validate the expression levels and prognostic values of key stemness-related signatures. Moreover, connectivity map (CMap) was used to identify potential inhibitors of stemness-related signatures. Based on edgeR, WGCNA, and Cox proportional hazard regression, 22 PSRGs were defined to construct a prognostic prediction model for metastatic OV. In the metastasis-specific regulation network, key TF-PSRS interaction pair was NR4A1-EGR3 (correlation coefficient = 0.81, p < 0.05, positive), and key PSRG-hallmark pathway interaction pair was EGR3-TNFα signaling via NFκB (correlation coefficient = 0.44, p < 0.05, positive), which were validated in multi-omics databases. Thioridazine was postulated to be the most significant compound in treatment of OV metastasis. PSRGs played critical roles in OV metastasis. Specifically, EGR3 was the most significant PSRG, which was positively regulated by DETF NR4A1, inducing metastasis via TNFα signaling.© 2023.

However, many endogenous RNAs containing double-stranded regions can be misrecognized and activate innate immunity. The interferon inducible ADAR1-p150 suppresses dsRNA sensing, an essential function for ADAR1 in many cancers, including breast. Although ADAR1-p150 has been well established in this role, the functions of the constitutively expressed ADAR1-p110 isoform are less understood. We used proximity labeling to identify putative ADAR1-p110 interacting proteins in breast cancer cell lines. Of the proteins identified, the RNA helicase DHX9 was of particular interest. Knockdown of DHX9 in ADAR1-dependent cell lines caused cell death and activation of the dsRNA sensor PKR. In ADAR1-independent cell lines, combined knockdown of DHX9 and ADAR1, but neither alone, caused activation of multiple dsRNA sensing pathways leading to a viral mimicry phenotype. Together, these results reveal an important role for DHX9 in suppressing dsRNA sensing by multiple pathways."

In this microenvironment, the post-biotics and similar molecules such as p40 exert several beneficial effects through regulation of IECs. Importantly, post-biotics were discovered to be transactivators of the EGF receptor (EGFR) in IECs, inducing protective cellular responses and alleviating colitis. The transient exposure to post-biotics such as p40 during the neonatal period reprograms IECs by upregulation of a methyltransferase, Setd1β, leading to a sustained increase in TGF- β release for the expansion of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in the intestinal lamina propria and durable protection against colitis in adulthood. This crosstalk between the IECs and post-biotic secreted factors was not reviewed previously. Therefore, this review describes the role of probiotic-derived factors in the sustainability of intestinal health and improving gut homeostasis via certain signaling pathways. In the era of precision medicine and targeted therapies, more basic, preclinical, and clinical evidence is needed to clarify the efficacy of probiotics released as functional factors in maintaining intestinal health and preventing and treating disease.© 2023.

"36729133","Associations of psychiatric disease and ageing with FKBP5 expression converge on superficial layer neurons of the neocortex.","Acta Neuropathol","Identification and characterisation of novel targets for treatment is a priority in the field of psychiatry. FKBP5 is a gene with decades of evidence suggesting its pathogenic role in a subset of psychiatric patients, with potential to be leveraged as a therapeutic target for these individuals. While it is widely reported that FKBP5/FKBP51 mRNA/protein (FKBP5/1) expression is impacted by psychiatric disease state, risk genotype and age, it is not known in which cell types and sub-anatomical areas of the human brain this occurs. This knowledge is critical to propel FKBP5/1-targeted treatment development. Here, we performed an extensive, large-scale postmortem study (n = 1024) of FKBP5/1, examining neocortical areas (BA9, BA11 and ventral BA24/BA24a) derived from subjects that lived with schizophrenia, major depression or bipolar disorder. With an extensive battery of RNA (bulk RNA sequencing, single-nucleus RNA sequencing, microarray, qPCR, RNAscope) and protein (immunoblot, immunohistochemistry) analysis approaches, we thoroughly investigated the effects of disease state, ageing and genotype on cortical FKBP5/1 expression including in a cell type-specific manner. We identified consistently heightened FKBP5/1 levels in psychopathology and with age, but not genotype, with these effects strongest in schizophrenia. Using single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNAseq; BA9 and BA11) and targeted histology (BA9, BA24a), we established that these disease and ageing effects on FKBP5/1 expression were most pronounced in excitatory superficial layer neurons of the neocortex, and this effect appeared to be consistent in both the granular and agranular areas examined. We then found that this increase in FKBP5 levels may impact on synaptic plasticity, as FKBP5 gex levels strongly and inversely correlated with dendritic mushroom spine density and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels in superficial layer neurons in BA11. These findings pinpoint a novel cellular and molecular mechanism that has potential to open a new avenue of FKBP51 drug development to treat cognitive symptoms in psychiatric disorders.© 2023.

"36936885","Context-dependent DNA methylation signatures in animal livestock.","Environ Epigenet","DNA methylation is an important epigenetic modification that is widely conserved across animal genomes. It is widely accepted that DNA methylation patterns can change in a context-dependent manner, including in response to changing environmental parameters. However, this phenomenon has not been analyzed in animal livestock yet, where it holds major potential for biomarker development. Building on the previous identification of population-specific DNA methylation in clonal marbled crayfish, we have now generated numerous base-resolution methylomes to analyze location-specific DNA methylation patterns. We also describe the time-dependent conversion of epigenetic signatures upon transfer from one environment to another. We further demonstrate production system-specific methylation signatures in shrimp, river-specific signatures in salmon and farm-specific signatures in chicken. Together, our findings provide a detailed resource for epigenetic variation in animal livestock and suggest the possibility for origin tracing of animal products by epigenetic fingerprinting.© The Author(s) 2023.

"36941364","BNST PKCÎ´ neurons are activated by specific aversive conditions to promote anxiety-like behavior.","Neuropsychopharmacology","The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is a critical mediator of stress responses and anxiety-like behaviors. Neurons expressing protein kinase C delta (BNSTPKCδ) are an abundant but understudied subpopulation implicated in inhibiting feeding, but which have conflicting reports about their role in anxiety-like behaviors. We have previously shown that expression of PKCδ is dynamically regulated by stress and that BNSTPKCδcells are recruited during bouts of active stress coping. Here, we first show that in vivo activation of this population is mildly aversive. This aversion was insensitive to prior restraint stress exposure. Further investigation revealed that unlike other BNST subpopulations, BNSTPKCδcells do not exhibit increased cfos expression following restraint stress. Ex vivo current clamp recordings also indicate they are resistant to firing. To elucidate their afferent control, we next used rabies tracing with whole-brain imaging and channelrhodopsin-assisted circuit mapping, finding that BNSTPKCδcells receive abundant input from affective, arousal, and sensory regions including the basolateral amygdala (BLA) paraventricular thalamus (PVT) and central amygdala PKCδ-expressing cells (CeAPKCδ). Given these findings, we used in vivo optogenetics and fiber photometry to further examine BNSTPKCδcells in the context of stress and anxiety-like behavior. We found that BNSTPKCδcell activity is associated with increased anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus maze, increases following footshock, and unlike other BNST subpopulations, does not desensitize to repeated stress exposure. Taken together, we propose a model in which BNSTPKCδcells may serve as threat detectors, integrating exteroceptive and interoceptive information to inform stress coping behaviors.© 2023.

It then applies manifold learning to locally refine the alignment, revealing conserved and specific developmental trajectories across brains and organoids. Using BOMA, we found that human cortical organoids better align with certain brain cortical regions than with other non-cortical regions, implying organoid-preserved developmental gene expression programs specific to brain regions. Additionally, our alignment of non-human primate and human brains reveals highly conserved gene expression around birth. Also, we integrated and analyzed developmental single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data of human brains and organoids, showing conserved and specific cell trajectories and clusters. Further identification of expressed genes of such clusters and enrichment analyses reveal brain- or organoid-specific developmental functions and pathways. Finally, we experimentally validated important specific expressed genes through the use of immunofluorescence. BOMA is open-source available as a web tool for community use.© 2023 The Author(s)."

For example, granule cells-the most abundant neuron type-develop unusually late and exhibit unique nuclear morphology. Here, by developing our high-resolution single-cell 3D genome assay Dip-C into population-scale (Pop-C) and virus-enriched (vDip-C) modes, we were able to resolve the first 3D genome structures of single cerebellar cells, create life-spanning 3D genome atlases for both human and mouse, and jointly measure transcriptome and chromatin accessibility during development. We found that while the transcriptome and chromatin accessibility of human granule cells exhibit a characteristic maturation pattern within the first year of postnatal life, 3D genome architecture gradually remodels throughout life into a non-neuronal state with ultra-long-range intra-chromosomal contacts and specific inter-chromosomal contacts. This 3D genome remodeling is conserved in mice, and robust to heterozygous deletion of chromatin remodeling disease-associated genes (Chd8orArid1b). Together these results reveal unexpected and evolutionarily-conserved molecular processes underlying the unique development and aging of the mammalian cerebellum."
"36937903","Pathogenesis of pulmonary hypertension caused by left heart disease.","Front Cardiovasc Med","Pulmonary hypertension has high disability and mortality rates. Among them, pulmonary hypertension caused by left heart disease (PH-LHD) is the most common type. According to the 2022 ESC/ERS Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary hypertension, PH-LHD is classified as group 2 pulmonary hypertension. PH-LHD belongs to postcapillary pulmonary hypertension, which is distinguished from other types of pulmonary hypertension because of its elevated pulmonary artery wedge pressure. PH-LHD includes PH due to systolic or diastolic left ventricular dysfunction, mitral or aortic valve disease and congenital left heart disease. The primary strategy in managing PH-LHD is optimizing treatment of the underlying cardiac disease. Recent clinical studies have found that mechanical unloading of left ventricle by an implantable non-pulsatile left ventricular assist device with continuous flow properties can reverse pulmonary hypertension in patients with heart failure. However, the specific therapies for PH in LHD have not yet been identified. Treatments that specifically target PH in LHD could slow its progression and potentially improve disease severity, leading to far better clinical outcomes. Therefore, exploring the current research on the pathogenesis of PH-LHD is important. This paper summarizes and classifies the research articles on the pathogenesis of PH-LHD to provide references for the mechanism research and clinical treatment of PH-LHD, particularly molecular targeted therapy.Copyright © 2023 Xiao, Lai, Yu, Wu and Zhang."

In addition, activation of peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPAR-γ) has been found to prevent PH progression. However, the molecular mechanism responsible for the protective effect of PPAR-γ activation on TERT expression in the pathogenesis of PH remains unknown. This study was performed to address these issues.Intraperitoneal injection of monocrotaline (MCT) was used to establish PH. BIBR1532 was applied to inhibit the activity of telomerase. The right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) and histological analysis were used to detect the development of PH. The protein levels of p-Akt, t-Akt, c-Myc and TERT were determined by western blotting. Pharmacological inhibition of TERT by BIBR1532 effectively suppressed RVSP, RVHI and the WT% in MCT-induced PH rats.Pharmacological inhibition of Akt/c-Myc pathway by LY294002 diminished TERT upregulation, RVSP, RVHI and WT% in MCT-PH rats. Activation of PPAR-γ by pioglitazone inhibited p-Akt and c-Myc expressions and further downregulated TERT, thus to reduced RVSP, RVHI and WT% in MCT-treated PH rats.In conclusion, TERT upregulation contributes to PH development in MCT-treated rats. Activation of PPAR-γ prevents pulmonary arterial remodeling through Akt/c-Myc/TERT axis suppression.© 2023 The Authors."

Increasing research evidence demonstrates that genetics may be a key factor responsible for the occurrence of the disease. Although previous reports identified quite a few AD-associated genes, they were mostly limited owing to patient sample size and selection bias. There is a lack of comprehensive research aimed to identify AD-associated risk mutations systematically. To address this challenge, we hereby construct a large-scale AD mutation and co-mutation framework ('AD-Syn-Net'), and propose deep learning models named Deep-SMCI and Deep-CMCI configured with fully connected layers that are capable of predicting cognitive impairment of subjects effectively based on genetic mutation and co-mutation profiles. Next, we apply the customized frameworks to data sets to evaluate the importance scores of the mutations and identified mutation effectors and co-mutation combination vulnerabilities contributing to cognitive impairment. Furthermore, we evaluate the influence of mutation pairs on the network architecture to dissect the genetic organization of AD and identify novel co-mutations that could be responsible for dementia, laying a solid foundation for proposing future targeted therapy for AD precision medicine.

"36937187","Large-scale analyses of CAV1 and CAV2 suggest their expression is higher in post-mortem ALS brain tissue and affects survival.","Front Cell Neurosci","Introduction:Caveolin-1 and Caveolin-2 (CAV1 and CAV2) are proteins associated with intercellular neurotrophic signalling. There is converging evidence that CAV1 and CAV2 (CAV1/2) genes have a role in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Disease-associated variants have been identified within CAV1/2 enhancers, which reduce gene expression and lead to disruption of membrane lipid rafts.Methods:Using large ALS whole-genome sequencing and post-mortem RNA sequencing datasets (5,987 and 365 tissue samples, respectively), and iPSC-derived motor neurons from 55 individuals, we investigated the role of CAV1/2 expression and enhancer variants in the ALS phenotype.Results:We report a differential expression analysis between ALS cases and controls for CAV1 and CAV2 genes across various post-mortem brain tissues and three independent datasets. CAV1 and CAV2 expression was consistently higher in ALS patients compared to controls, with significant results across the primary motor cortex, lateral motor cortex, and cerebellum. We also identify increased survival among carriers of CAV1/2 enhancer mutations compared to non-carriers within Project MinE and slower progression as measured by the ALSFRS. Carriers showed a median increase in survival of 345 days.Discussion:These results add to an increasing body of evidence linking CAV1 and CAV2 genes to ALS. We propose that carriers of CAV1/2 enhancer mutations may be conceptualised as an ALS subtype who present a less severe ALS phenotype with a longer survival duration and slower progression. Upregulation of CAV1/2 genes in ALS cases may indicate a causal pathway or a compensatory mechanism. Given prior research supporting the beneficial role of CAV1/2 expression in ALS patients, we consider a compensatory mechanism to better fit the available evidence, although further investigation into the biological pathways associated with CAV1/2 is needed to support this conclusion.Copyright © 2023 Adey, Cooper-Knock, Al Khleifat, Fogh, van Damme, Corcia, Couratier, Hardiman, McLaughlin, Gotkine, Drory, Silani, Ticozzi, Veldink, van den Berg, de Carvalho, Pinto, Mora Pardina, Povedano Panades, Andersen, Weber, Başak, Shaw, Shaw, Morrison, Landers, Glass, Vourc’h, Dobson, Breen, Al-Chalabi, Jones and Iacoangeli."

The diseases are hypothesized to share a genetic predisposition, but there are few GWAS studies of GDM and none of them is sufficiently powered to assess whether any variants or biological pathways are specific to GDM. We conducted the largest genome-wide association study of GDM to date in 12,332 cases and 131,109 parous female controls in the FinnGen Study and identified 13 GDM-associated loci including 8 novel loci. Genetic features distinct from T2D were identified both at the locus and genomic scale. Our results suggest that the genetics of GDM risk falls into two distinct categories - one part conventional T2D polygenic risk and one part predominantly influencing mechanisms disrupted in pregnancy. Loci with GDM-predominant effects map to genes related to islet cells, central glucose homeostasis, steroidogenesis, and placental expression. These results pave the way for an improved biological understanding of GDM pathophysiology and its role in the development and course of T2D."

The mechanisms underlying this variability in COPD phenotypes are unclear. To investigate the potential contribution of genetic variants to phenotypic heterogeneity, we examined the association of genome-wide associated lung function, COPD, and asthma variants with other phenotypes using phenome-wide association results derived in the UK Biobank. Our clustering analysis of the variants-phenotypes association matrix identified three clusters of genetic variants with different effects on white blood cell counts, height, and body mass index (BMI). To assess the potential clinical and molecular effects of these groups of variants, we investigated the association between cluster-specific genetic risk scores and phenotypes in the COPDGene cohort. We observed differences in steroid use, BMI, lymphocyte counts, chronic bronchitis, and differential gene and protein expression across the three genetic risk scores. Our results suggest that multi-phenotype analysis of obstructive lung disease-related risk variants may identify genetically driven phenotypic patterns in COPD."

To identify cell type-specific alterations to cytosine modifications in pediatric central nervous system tumors we utilized a multi-omic approach that integrated bulk DNA cytosine modification data (methylation and hydroxymethylation) with both bulk and single-cell RNA-sequencing data. We demonstrate a large reduction in the scope of significantly differentially modified cytosines in tumors when accounting for tumor cell type composition. In the progenitor-like cell types of tumors, we identified a preponderance differential CpG hydroxymethylation rather than methylation. Genes with differential hydroxymethylation, like HDAC4 and IGF1R, were associated with cell type-specific changes in gene expression in tumors. Our results highlight the importance of epigenomic alterations in the progenitor-like cell types and its role in cell type-specific transcriptional regulation in pediatric CNS tumors."

To define biological risk patterns of lymphatic spread, we studied DNA-methylation and genomic copy number in primary tumors and corresponding lymph nodes metastases.DNA-methylation and genomic copy number profiles of primary tumors (PT) and paired synchronous lymph node metastases (LN) from Gleason Score (GS)-6/7a (n = 20 LN-positive, n = 20 LN-negative) and GS-9/10 patients (LN-positive n = 20) after prostatectomy and lymphonodectomy were analyzed.GS-6/7a pN0 PTs and GS-6/7a pN1 PTs differed in histone H3K27me3/H3K9me3 mediated methylation. PTs compared to LNs, in both, GS-6/7a pN1 and GS-9/10 pN1 patients showed large differences in DNA-methylation mediated by histones H3K4me1/2, in addition to copy number changes of chromosomal regions 11q13.1, 14q11.2 and 15q26.1. Between GS-6/7a pN1 and GS-9/10 pN1 patients, methylation levels differed more when comparing LNs than PTs. 16q21-22.1 was specifically lost in GS-9/10 pN0 PTs. Immune system-related pathways characterized the differences between PTs and LNs in both GS-6/7a pN1 and GS-9/10 pN1 patients. Comparing PTs and LKs between GS-6/7a pN1 and GS-9/10 pN1 patients revealed altered transmembrane and G-protein-coupled receptor signaling.Our data suggest that progression of prostate cancer, including lymphatic spread, is associated with histone-mediated DNA-methylation and we hypothesize a methylation signature predicting lymphatic spread in GS-6/7a patients from primary tumors. Lymphatic spread in GS-6/7a patients, flanked by DNA-methylation and CNA alterations, appears to be more complex than in GS-9/10 patients, in whom the primary tumors already appear to bear lymph node metastasis-enabling alterations.© 2023 The Author(s)."

To explore the molecular underpinnings of these defects, we combined multiomics, single-cell measurements, and functional testing of MuSCs from young and old mice. The multiomics approach allowed us to assess which changes are causal, which are compensatory, and which are simply correlative. We identified glutathione (GSH) metabolism as perturbed in old MuSCs, with both causal and compensatory components. Contrary to young MuSCs, old MuSCs exhibit a population dichotomy composed of GSHhighcells (comparable with young MuSCs) and GSHlowcells with impaired functionality. Mechanistically, we show that antagonism between NRF2 and NF-κB maintains this bimodality. Experimental manipulation of GSH levels altered the functional dichotomy of aged MuSCs. These findings identify a novel mechanism of stem cell aging and highlight glutathione metabolism as an accessible target for reversing MuSC aging.Published by Elsevier Inc."
"36932057","Antipsychotic drug use complicates assessment of gene expression changes associated with schizophrenia.","Transl Psychiatry","Recent postmortem transcriptomic studies of schizophrenia (SCZ) have shown hundreds of differentially expressed genes. However, the extent to which these gene expression changes reflect antipsychotic drug (APD) exposure remains uncertain. We compared differential gene expression in the prefrontal cortex of SCZ patients who tested positive for APDs at the time of death with SCZ patients who did not. APD exposure was associated with numerous changes in the brain transcriptome, especially among SCZ patients on atypical APDs. Brain transcriptome data from macaques chronically treated with APDs showed that APDs affect the expression of many functionally relevant genes, some of which show expression changes in the same directions as those observed in SCZ. Co-expression modules enriched for synaptic function showed convergent patterns between SCZ and some of the APD effects, while those associated with inflammation and glucose metabolism exhibited predominantly divergent patterns between SCZ and APD effects. In contrast, major cell-type shifts inferred in SCZ were primarily unaffected by APD use. These results show that APDs may confound SCZ-associated gene expression changes in postmortem brain tissue. Disentangling these effects will help identify causal genes and improve our neurobiological understanding of SCZ.© 2023.

Here we investigated the clinical and translational aspects of an early phase II study of azacitidine and carboplatin priming for anti-PDL1 immunotherapy (avelumab) in patients with advanced ICB-resistant melanoma.A total of 20 participants with ICB-resistant metastatic melanoma received 2 × 4-week cycles of azacitidine and carboplatin followed by ICB rechallenge with anti-PD-L1 avelumab. The primary objective was overall response rate after priming and ICB rechallenge. Secondary objectives were clinical benefit rate (CBR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Translational correlation analysis of HLA-A and PD-L1 expression, RNA sequencing, and reduced representation bisulfite sequencing of biopsies at baseline, after priming and after six cycles of avelmuab was performed.The overall response rate (ORR) determined after azacitidine and carboplatin priming was 10% (2/20) with two partial responses (PR). The ORR determined after priming followed by six cycles of avelumab (week 22) was 10%, with 2 of 20 participants achieving immune partial response (iPR). The CBR for azacitidine and carboplatin priming was 65% (13/20) and after priming followed by six cycles of avelumab CBR was 35% (n= 7/20). The median PFS was 18.0 weeks [95% confidence interval (CI): 14.87-21.13 weeks] and the median OS was 47.86 weeks (95% CI: 9.67-86.06 weeks). Translational correlation analysis confirmed HLA-A generally increased after priming with azacitidine and carboplatin, particularly if it was absent at the start of treatment. Average methylation of CpGs across the HLA-A locus was decreased after priming and T cells, in particular CD8+, showed the greatest increase in infiltration.Priming with azacitidine and carboplatin can induce disease stabilization and resensitization to ICB for metastatic melanoma.There are limited treatments for melanoma once resistance to ICB occurs.

"36923279","Potent Stimulation of the Androgen Receptor Instigates a Viral Mimicry Response in Prostate Cancer.","Cancer Res Commun","Inhibiting the androgen receptor (AR), a ligand-activated transcription factor, with androgen deprivation therapy is a standard-of-care treatment for metastatic prostate cancer. Paradoxically, activation of AR can also inhibit the growth of prostate cancer in some patients and experimental systems, but the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are poorly understood. This study exploited a potent synthetic androgen, methyltestosterone (MeT), to investigate AR agonist-induced growth inhibition. MeT strongly inhibited growth of prostate cancer cells expressing AR, but not AR-negative models. Genes and pathways regulated by MeT were highly analogous to those regulated by DHT, although MeT induced a quantitatively greater androgenic response in prostate cancer cells. MeT potently downregulated DNA methyltransferases, leading to global DNA hypomethylation. These epigenomic changes were associated with dysregulation of transposable element expression, including upregulation of endogenous retrovirus (ERV) transcripts after sustained MeT treatment. Increased ERV expression led to accumulation of double-stranded RNA and a ""viral mimicry"" response characterized by activation of IFN signaling, upregulation of MHC class I molecules, and enhanced recognition of murine prostate cancer cells by CD8+T cells. Positive associations between AR activity and ERVs/antiviral pathways were evident in patient transcriptomic data, supporting the clinical relevance of our findings. Collectively, our study reveals that the potent androgen MeT can increase the immunogenicity of prostate cancer cells via a viral mimicry response, a finding that has potential implications for the development of strategies to sensitize this cancer type to immunotherapies.Our study demonstrates that potent androgen stimulation of prostate cancer cells can elicit a viral mimicry response, resulting in enhanced IFN signaling.

Activation of transposable elements (TE) can trigger an innate immune response, which can synergize with immunotherapeutic protocols in patients. However, TE activity in relation to immune gene response is not fully known in human SCLC. Here, we compared TE expression in 104 human SCLC and 24 normal tissues and established their involvement in innate immune responses. We observed that different intergenic TEs, mainly endogenous retroviral (ERV) families, are deregulated in SCLC. Similarly to other cancers, we detected a subset of LTRs that correlate with innate immune gene signatures and cytosolic RNA sensors, such as RIG-I. These LTRs are downregulated in SCLC tumors vs. normal tissues, and are mainly located at transcriptional repressed regions, marked with H3K4me2 in different cell lines. Analyses of different genomic datasets show that chromatin repression is likely due to de-methylase LSD1 activity. Moreover, high expression levels of ERV LTRs predict a better survival upon chemotherapy of SCLC patients. The findings reveal a specific pattern of TE-mediated activation of innate immune genes in SCLC, which can be exploited to establish more effective immunotherapeutic combinations.© 2023.

"36715830","A Proactive Approach to Prevent Hematopoietic Exhaustion During Cancer Chemotherapy in Older Patients: Temporary Cell-Cycle Arrest.","Drugs Aging","Age is associated with the decline of multiple organ systems. In older patients, hematological toxicities associated with chemotherapy are often dose limiting, impairing dose intensity and treatment efficacy. Contrary to the classical path using growth factors to activate tissue regeneration, a novel strategy is emerging to prevent chemotherapy toxicity that involves temporary cell-cycle arrest of normal cells, such as hematopoietic or epithelial precursors. This proactive approach may allow the sparing of the stem cell reserve of these tissues. Two molecules are included in this new category, trilaciclib and ALRN-6924, which induce cell-cycle arrest by two different pathways. Previous approaches, such as the use of myelopoietic growth factors, were reactive and they might even have accelerated the depletion of stem cells by enhancing the commitment of these elements. Trilaciclib causes cell-cycle arrest by CDK 4/6 inhibition and ALRN-6924 by p53 activation. In a pooled analysis of three randomized phase II studies of patients with small cell lung cancer, trilaciclib prevented neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia. Similar chemoprotective results were observed with ALRN-6924 in an open-label phase Ib study of patients with p53-mutated small cell lung cancer. Trilaciclib is now approved as a myelopreservation agent in patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer. ALRN-6924 is currently in phase Ib clinical development in patients with p53-mutated cancer. In addition to preserving the normal hemopoietic pool, these drugs promise to preserve the stem cell reserve of other normal tissues with high turnover, preventing potentially other dose-limiting toxicities, such as mucositis and diarrhea. An ""ex vivo"" study provided early evidence that ALRN-6924 may prevent chemotherapy-induced alopecia. By affording protection from multiple toxicities with a single drug, trilaciclib and ALRN-6924 have the potential to transform the current standards of supportive care for oncology patients and may prevent the depletion of tissue stem cells already compromised with age.© 2023.

"36941354","Clonal haematopoiesis and dysregulation of the immune system.","Nat Rev Immunol","Age-related diseases are frequently linked to pathological immune dysfunction, including excessive inflammation, autoreactivity and immunodeficiency. Recent analyses of human genetic data have revealed that somatic mutations and mosaic chromosomal alterations in blood cells - a condition known as clonal haematopoiesis (CH) - are associated with ageing and pathological immune dysfunction. Indeed, large-scale epidemiological studies and experimental mouse models have demonstrated that CH can promote cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic liver disease, osteoporosis and gout. The genes most frequently mutated in CH, the epigenetic regulators TET2 and DNMT3A, implicate increased chemokine expression and inflammasome hyperactivation in myeloid cells as a possible mechanistic connection between CH and age-related diseases. In addition, TET2 and DNMT3A mutations in lymphoid cells have been shown to drive methylation-dependent alterations in differentiation and function. Here we review the observational and mechanistic studies describing the connection between CH and pathological immune dysfunction, the effects of CH-associated genetic alterations on the function of myeloid and lymphoid cells, and the clinical and therapeutic implications of CH as a target for immunomodulation.© 2023.

As such, preconception care is recommended to couples during this time to enable them to optimise their health in preparation for pregnancy. Historically, preconception research predominately focuses on maternal modifiable risks and health behaviours associated with pregnancy and offspring outcomes; limited attention has been given to inform paternal preconception health risks and outcomes. This systematic review aims to advance paternal preconception research by synthesising the current evidence on modifiable paternal preconception health behaviours and risk factors to identify associations with pregnancy and/or offspring outcomes.Medline, Embase, Maternity and Infant care, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Scopus, and ISI Proceedings were searched on the 5thof January 2023, a date limit was set [2012-2023] in each database. A Google Scholar search was also conducted identifying all other relevant papers. Studies were included if they were observational, reporting associations of modifiable risk factors in the preconception period among males (e.g., identified as reproductive partners of pregnant women and/or fathers of offspring for which outcomes were reported) with adverse pregnancy and offspring outcomes. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Exposure and outcome heterogeneity precluded meta-analysis, and results were summarised in tables.This review identified 56 cohort and nine case control studies. Studies reported on a range of risk factors and/or health behaviours including paternal body composition (n = 25), alcohol intake (n = 6), cannabis use (n = 5), physical activity (n = 2), smoking (n = 20), stress (n = 3) and nutrition (n = 13). Outcomes included fecundability, IVF/ISCI live birth, offspring weight, body composition/BMI, asthma, lung function, leukemia, preterm birth, and behavioural issues. Despite the limited number of studies and substantial heterogeneity in reporting, results of studies assessed as good quality showed that paternal smoking may increase the risk of birth defects and higher paternal BMI was associated with higher offspring birthweight.The current evidence demonstrates a role of paternal preconception health in influencing outcomes related to pregnancy success and offspring health. The evidence is however limited and heterogenous, and further high-quality research is needed to inform clinical preconception care guidelines to support men and couples to prepare for a health pregnancy and child.© 2023.

"36941332","Multiomic signatures of body mass index identify heterogeneous health phenotypes and responses to a lifestyle intervention.","Nat Med","Multiomic profiling can reveal population heterogeneity for both health and disease states. Obesity drives a myriad of metabolic perturbations and is a risk factor for multiple chronic diseases. Here we report an atlas of cross-sectional and longitudinal changes in 1,111 blood analytes associated with variation in body mass index (BMI), as well as multiomic associations with host polygenic risk scores and gut microbiome composition, from a cohort of 1,277 individuals enrolled in a wellness program (Arivale). Machine learning model predictions of BMI from blood multiomics captured heterogeneous phenotypic states of host metabolism and gut microbiome composition better than BMI, which was also validated in an external cohort (TwinsUK). Moreover, longitudinal analyses identified variable BMI trajectories for different omics measures in response to a healthy lifestyle intervention; metabolomics-inferred BMI decreased to a greater extent than actual BMI, whereas proteomics-inferred BMI exhibited greater resistance to change. Our analyses further identified blood analyte-analyte associations that were modified by metabolomics-inferred BMI and partially reversed in individuals with metabolic obesity during the intervention. Taken together, our findings provide a blood atlas of the molecular perturbations associated with changes in obesity status, serving as a resource to quantify metabolic health for predictive and preventive medicine.© 2023.

Physicians can improve their diagnostic efficiency with the assistance of AI techniques for improving the subsequent personalized treatment and surveillance. AI algorithms fundamentally capture data, identify underlying patterns, achieve preset endpoints, and provide decisions and predictions about real-world events with working principles of machine learning and deep learning. AI algorithms with sufficient graphic processing unit power have been demonstrated to provide timely diagnostic references based on preliminary training of large amounts of clinical and imaging data. The sample size issue is an inevitable challenge for pediatric oncology considering its low morbidity and individual heterogeneity. However, this problem may be solved in the near future considering the exponential advancements of AI algorithms technically to decrease the dependence of AI operation on the amount of data sets and the efficiency of computing power. For instance, it could be a feasible solution by shifting convolutional neural networks (CNNs) from adults and sharing CNN algorithms across multiple institutions besides original data.

"36941428","Lipid-accumulated reactive astrocytes promote disease progression in epilepsy.","Nat Neurosci","Reactive astrocytes play an important role in neurological diseases, but their molecular and functional phenotypes in epilepsy are unclear. Here, we show that in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and mouse models of epilepsy, excessive lipid accumulation in astrocytes leads to the formation of lipid-accumulated reactive astrocytes (LARAs), a new reactive astrocyte subtype characterized by elevated APOE expression. Genetic knockout of APOE inhibited LARA formation and seizure activities in epileptic mice. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing in TLE patients confirmed the existence of a LARA subpopulation with a distinct molecular signature. Functional studies in epilepsy mouse models and human brain slices showed that LARAs promote neuronal hyperactivity and disease progression. Targeting LARAs by intervention with lipid transport and metabolism could thus provide new therapeutic options for drug-resistant TLE.© 2023.

Neutrophils are the most abundant leukocyte in humans and represent innate immunity's first line of defense. We previously found that primary mouse bone marrow neutrophils show widespread sex-dimorphism throughout life, including at the transcriptional level. Extracellular matrix [ECM]-related terms were observed among the top sex-dimorphic genes. Since the ECM is emerging as an important regulator of innate immune responses, we sought to further investigate the transcriptomic profile of primary mouse bone marrow neutrophils at both the bulk and single-cell level to understand how biological sex may influence ECM component expression in neutrophils throughout life. Here, using curated gene lists of ECM components and unbiased weighted gene coexpression network analysis [WGCNA], we find that multiple ECM-related gene sets show widespread female-bias in expression in primary mouse neutrophils. Since many immune-related diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis) are more prevalent in females, our work may provide insights into the pathogenesis of sex-dimorphic inflammatory diseases."

"36925638","Comprehensive genomics analysis of aging related gene signature to predict the prognosis and drug resistance of colon adenocarcinoma.","Front Pharmacol","Background:Colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) is a heterogeneous tumor and senescence is crucial in the occurrence of cancer. This study aimed to identify senescence-based subtypes and construct a prognostic signature to predict the prognosis and guide immunotherapy or chemotherapy decisions for COAD patients.Methods:Based on the single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data of 13 samples from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, we assessed cellular senescence characteristics. Transcriptome data, copy number variations (CNVs) and single nucleotide variations (SNVs) data were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. GSE39582 and GSE17537 were used for validation. Senescence subtypes were identified using unsupervised consensus clustering analysis, and a prognostic signature was developed using univariate Cox analysis and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). Response of risk groups to chemotherapy was predicted using the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values. We further analyzed the relationship between risk gene expression and methylation level. The prediction performance was assessed by nomogram.Results:Senescence-related pathways were highly enriched in malignant cells and bulk RNA-seq verified cellular senescence. Three senescence subtypes were identified, in which patients in clust3 had poorest prognosis and higher T stage, accompanied with higher tumor mutation burden (TMB) and mutations, activated inflammatory response, more immune cell infiltration, and higher immune escape tendency. A senescence-based signature using 11 genes (MFNG, GPRC5B, TNNT1, CCL22, NOXA1, PABPC1L, PCOLCE2, MID2, CPA3, HSPA1A, and CALB1) was established, and accurately predicted a lower prognosis in high risk patients. Its robustness was validated by external cohort. Low risk patients were more sensitive to small molecule drugs including Erlotinib, Sunitinib, MG-132, CGP-082996, AZ628, Sorafenib, VX-680, and Z-LLNle-CHO. Risk score was an independent prognostic factor and nomogram confirmed its reliability. Four risk genes (CALB1, CPA3, NOXA1, and TNNT1) had significant positive correlation with their methylation level, while six genes (CCL22, GPRC5B, HSPA1A, MFNG, PABPC1L, and PCOLCE2) were negatively correlated with their methylation level.Conclusion:This study provides novel understanding of heterogeneity in COAD from the perspective of senescence, and develops signatures for prognosis prediction in COAD.Copyright © 2023 Feng, Fu and Nie."
"36867023","Molecular and spatial profiling of the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus.","Elife","The paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT) is known to regulate various cognitive and behavioral processes. However, while functional diversity among PVT circuits has often been linked to cellular differences, the molecular identity and spatial distribution of PVT cell types remain unclear. To address this gap, here we used single nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) and identified five molecularly distinct PVT neuronal subtypes in the mouse brain. Additionally, multiplex fluorescent in situ hybridization of top marker genes revealed that PVT subtypes are organized by a combination of previously unidentified molecular gradients. Lastly, comparing our dataset with a recently published single-cell sequencing atlas of the thalamus yielded novel insight into the PVT's connectivity with the cortex, including unexpected innervation of auditory and visual areas. This comparison also revealed that our data contains a largely non-overlapping transcriptomic map of multiple midline thalamic nuclei. Collectively, our findings uncover previously unknown features of the molecular diversity and anatomical organization of the PVT and provide a valuable resource for future investigations."
"36909842","Pleiotropic endophenotypic and phenotype effects of GABAergic neurosteroid synthesis deficiency in posttraumatic stress disorder.","Curr Opin Endocr Metab Res","PTSD is associated with deficits in synthesis of progesterone metabolites such as allopregnanolone and pregnanolone that potently facilitate gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA) effects at GABAAreceptors. These neurosteroids modulate neuronal firing rate, regional brain connectivity, and activation of amygdala-mediated autonomic nervous system, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and behavioral reactions to unconditioned and conditioned threat. They also play critical roles in learning and memory processes such as extinction and extinction retention and inhibit toll-like receptor activation of intracellular pro-inflammatory pathways. Deficient synthesis of these neurosteroids thus may contribute to individually variable PTSD clinical phenotypes encompassing symptom severity, capacity for PTSD recovery, and vulnerability to common PTSD-comorbidities such as major depression, chronic pain, alcohol and nicotine dependence, cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, reproductive disorders, and autoimmune conditions."

It causes joint pain and disability, decreased quality of life, and a huge burden on healthcare services for society. However, the current main diagnostic methods are not suitable for early diagnosing patients of OA. The use of machine learning (ML) in OA diagnosis has increased dramatically in the past few years. Hence, in this review article, we describe the research progress in the application of ML in the early diagnosis of OA, discuss the current trends and limitations of ML approaches, and propose future research priorities to apply the tools in the field of OA. Accurate ML-based predictive models with imaging techniques that are sensitive to early changes in OA ahead of the emergence of clinical features are expected to address the current dilemma. The diagnostic ability of the fusion model that combines multidimensional information makes patient-specific early diagnosis and prognosis estimation of OA possible in the future.© The Author(s), 2023."

We investigated whether three distinct dietary patterns in mid-childhood were associated with lung function and incident asthma in adolescence.In the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, 'processed', 'traditional', and 'health-conscious' dietary patterns were identified using principal components analysis from food frequency questionnaires at 7 years of age. Post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), and forced expiratory flow at 25-75% of FVC (FEF25-75) were measured at 15.5 years and were transformed to z-scores based on the Global Lung Function Initiative curves. Incident asthma was defined by new cases of doctor-diagnosed asthma at age 11 or 14 years.In multivariable-adjusted models, the 'health-conscious' pattern was positively associated with FEV1(regression coefficient comparing top versus bottom quartile of pattern score 0.16, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.31, P for trend 0.04) and FVC (0.18, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.33, P for trend 0.02), while the 'processed' pattern was negatively associated with FVC (- 0.17, 95% CI - 0.33 to - 0.01, P for trend 0.03). Associations between the 'health-conscious' and 'processed' patterns and lung function were modified by SCGB1A1 and GPX4 gene polymorphisms. We found no evidence of an association between the 'traditional' pattern and lung function, nor between any pattern and FEF25-75or incident asthma.A 'health-conscious' diet in mid-childhood was associated with higher subsequent lung function, while a diet high in processed food was associated with lower lung function.© 2023.

Here we analyzed >10,000 primary tumors and 356 immune-checkpoint-treated metastases using immune dN/dS, the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous mutations in the immunopeptidome, to measure immune selection in cohorts and individuals. We classified tumors as immune edited when antigenic mutations were removed by negative selection and immune escaped when antigenicity was covered up by aberrant immune modulation. Only in immune-edited tumors was immune predation linked to CD8 T cell infiltration. Immune-escaped metastases experienced the best response to immunotherapy, whereas immune-edited patients did not benefit, suggesting a preexisting resistance mechanism. Similarly, in a longitudinal cohort, nivolumab treatment removes neoantigens exclusively in the immunopeptidome of nonimmune-edited patients, the group with the best overall survival response. Our work uses dN/dS to differentiate between immune-edited and immune-escaped tumors, measuring potential antigenicity and ultimately helping predict response to treatment.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"36927187","Nutritional Modulation of Associations between Prenatal Exposure to Persistent Organic Pollutants and Childhood Obesity: A Prospective Cohort Study.","Environ Health Perspect","Prenatal exposure to persistent organic pollutants (POPs) may contribute to the development of childhood obesity and metabolic disorders. However, little is known about whether the maternal nutritional status during pregnancy can modulate these associations.The main objective was to characterize the joint associations and interactions between prenatal levels of POPs and nutrients on childhood obesity.We used data from to the Spanish INfancia y Medio Ambiente-Environment and Childhood (INMA) birth cohort, on POPs and nutritional biomarkers measured in maternal blood collected at the first trimester of pregnancy and child anthropometric measurements at 7 years of age. Six organochlorine compounds (OCs) [dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene, hexachlorobenzene (HCB),β-hexachlorocyclohexane(β-HCH) and polychlorinated biphenyls 138, 153, 180] and four per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) were measured. Nutrients included vitamins (D, B12, and folate), polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), and dietary carotenoids. Two POPs-nutrients mixtures data sets were established:a) OCs, PFAS, vitamins, and carotenoids (n=660), andb) OCs, PUFAs, and vitamins (n=558). Joint associations of mixtures on obesity were characterized using Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR). Relative importance of biomarkers and two-way interactions were identified using gradient boosting machine, hierarchical group lasso regularization, and BKMR. Interactions were further characterized using multivariate regression models in the multiplicative and additive scale.Forty percent of children had overweight or obesity. We observed a positive overall joint association of both POPs-nutrients mixtures on overweight/obesity risk, with HCB and vitamin B12 the biomarkers contributing the most. Recurrent interactions were found between HCB and vitamin B12 across screening models. Relative risk for a natural log increase of HCB was 1.31 (95% CI: 1.11, 1.54,pInteraction=0.02) in the tertile 2 of vitamin B12 and in the additive scale a relative excess risk due to interaction of 0.11 (95% CI: 0.02, 0.20) was found. Interaction between perfluorooctane sulfonate andβ-cryptoxanthinsuggested a protective effect of the antioxidant on overweight/obesity risk.These results support that maternal nutritional status may modulate the effect of prenatal exposure to POPs on childhood overweight/obesity. These findings may help to develop a biological hypothesis for future toxicological studies and to better interpret inconsistent findings in epidemiological studies. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP11258."
"36867662","The anatomy of transcriptionally active chromatin loops in Drosophila primary spermatocytes using super-resolution microscopy.","PLoS Genet","While the biochemistry of gene transcription has been well studied, our understanding of how this process is organised in 3D within the intact nucleus is less well understood. Here we investigate the structure of actively transcribed chromatin and the architecture of its interaction with active RNA polymerase. For this analysis, we have used super-resolution microscopy to image the Drosophila melanogaster Y loops which represent huge, several megabases long, single transcription units. The Y loops provide a particularly amenable model system for transcriptionally active chromatin. We find that, although these transcribed loops are decondensed they are not organised as extended 10nm fibres, but rather they largely consist of chains of nucleosome clusters. The average width of each cluster is around 50nm. We find that foci of active RNA polymerase are generally located off the main fibre axis on the periphery of the nucleosome clusters. Foci of RNA polymerase and nascent transcripts are distributed around the Y loops rather than being clustered in individual transcription factories. However, as the RNA polymerase foci are considerably less prevalent than the nucleosome clusters, the organisation of this active chromatin into chains of nucleosome clusters is unlikely to be determined by the activity of the polymerases transcribing the Y loops. These results provide a foundation for understanding the topological relationship between chromatin and the process of gene transcription.Copyright: © 2023 Ball et al.

Anle138b is a small molecule which has previously shown efficacy in mice in reducing tau aggregates and rescuing AD disease phenotypes.In this work, we employed bioinformatics analysis-including pathway enrichment and causal reasoning-of an in vitro tauopathy model. The model consisted of cultured rat cortical neurons either unseeded or seeded with tau aggregates derived from human AD patients, both of which were treated with Anle138b to generate hypotheses for its mode of action. In parallel, we used a collection of human target prediction models to predict direct targets of Anle138b based on its chemical structure.Combining the different approaches, we found evidence supporting the hypothesis that the action of Anle138b involves several processes which are key to AD progression, including cholesterol homeostasis and neuroinflammation. On the pathway level, we found significantly enriched pathways related to these two processes including those entitled ""Superpathway of cholesterol biosynthesis"" and ""Granulocyte adhesion and diapedesis"". With causal reasoning, we inferred differential activity of SREBF1/2 (involved in cholesterol regulation) and mediators of the inflammatory response such as NFKB1 and RELA. Notably, our findings were also observed in Anle138b-treated unseeded neurons, meaning that the inferred processes are independent of tau pathology and thus represent the direct action of the compound in the cellular system. Through structure-based ligand-target prediction, we predicted the intracellular cholesterol carrier NPC1 as well as NF-κB subunits as potential targets of Anle138b, with structurally similar compounds in the model training set known to target the same proteins.This study has generated feasible hypotheses for the potential mechanism of action of Anle138b, which will enable the development of future molecular interventions aiming to reduce tau pathology in AD patients.© 2023.

"36935420","A genome-wide association analysis of loss of ambulation in dystrophinopathy patients suggests multiple candidate modifiers of disease severity.","Eur J Hum Genet","The major determinant of disease severity in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) or milder Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) is whether the dystrophin gene (DMD) mutation truncates the mRNA reading frame or allows expression of a partially functional protein. However, even in the complete absence of dystrophin, variability in disease severity is observed, and candidate gene studies have implicated several genes as modifiers. Here we present the largest genome-wide search to date for loci influencing severity in N = 419 DMD patients. Availability of subjects for such studies is quite limited, leading to modest sample sizes, which present a challenge for GWAS design. We have therefore taken special steps to minimize heterogeneity within our dataset at the DMD locus itself, taking a novel approach to mutation classification to effectively exclude the possibility of residual dystrophin expression, and utilized statistical methods that are well adapted to smaller sample sizes, including the use of a novel linear regression-like residual for time to ambulatory loss and the application of evidential statistics for the GWAS approach. Finally, we applied an unbiased in silico pipeline, utilizing functional genomic datasets to explore the potential impact of the best supported SNPs. In all, we obtained eight SNPs (out of 1,385,356 total) with posterior probability of trait-marker association (PPLD) ≥ 0.4, representing six distinct loci. Our analysis prioritized likely non-coding SNP regulatory effects on six genes (ETAA1, PARD6G, GALNTL6, MAN1A1, ADAMTS19, and NCALD), each with plausibility as a DMD modifier. These results support both recurrent and potentially new pathways for intervention in the dystrophinopathies.© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to European Society of Human Genetics."

The mechanisms responsible for these chamber-selective transcriptional programs remain largely undefined.We nominated candidate chamber-selective enhancers (CSEs) by determining the genome-wide occupancy of 7 key cardiac transcription factors (GATA4, MEF2A, MEF2C, NKX2-5, SRF, TBX5, TEAD1) and transcriptional coactivator P300 in atria and ventricles. Candidate enhancers were tested using an adeno-associated virus-mediated massively parallel reporter assay. Chromatin features of CSEs were evaluated by performing assay of transposase accessible chromatin sequencing and acetylation of histone H3 at lysine 27-HiChIP on aCMs and vCMs. CSE sequence requirements were determined by systematic tiling mutagenesis of 29 CSEs at 5 bp resolution. Estrogen-related receptor (ERR) function in cardiomyocytes was evaluated by Cre-loxP-mediated inactivation of ERRα and ERRγ in cardiomyocytes.We identified 134 066 and 97 506 regions reproducibly occupied by at least 1 transcription factor or P300, in atria or ventricles, respectively. Enhancer activities of 2639 regions bound by transcription factors or P300 were tested in aCMs and vCMs by adeno-associated virus-mediated massively parallel reporter assay. This identified 1092 active enhancers in aCMs or vCMs. Several overlapped loci associated with cardiovascular disease through genome-wide association studies, and 229 exhibited chamber-selective activity in aCMs or vCMs. Many CSEs exhibited differential chromatin accessibility between aCMs and vCMs, and CSEs were enriched for aCM- or vCM-selective acetylation of histone H3 at lysine 27-anchored loops. Tiling mutagenesis of 29 CSEs identified the binding motif of ERRα/γ as important for ventricular enhancer activity. The requirement of ERRα/γ to activate ventricular CSEs and promote vCM identity was confirmed by loss of the vCM gene profile in ERRα/γ knockout vCMs.We identified 229 CSEs that could be useful research tools or direct therapeutic gene expression. We showed that chamber-selective multi-transcription factor, P300 occupancy, open chromatin, and chromatin looping are predictive features of CSEs. We found that ERRα/γ are essential for maintenance of ventricular identity. Finally, our gene expression, epigenetic, 3-dimensional genome, and enhancer activity atlas provide key resources for future studies of chamber-selective gene regulation."
"36945027","Transmembrane potential, an indicator in situ reporting cellular senescence and stress response in plant tissues.","Plant Methods","Plant cells usually sustain a stable membrane potential due to influx and/or efflux of charged ions across plasma membrane. With the growth and development of plants, different tissues and cells undergo systemic or local programmed decline. Whether the membrane potential of plasma membrane could report senescence signal of plant tissues and cells is unclear.We applied a maneuverable transmembrane potential (TMP) detection method with patch-clamp setup to examine the senescence signal of leaf tissue cells in situ over the whole life cycle in Arabidopsis thaliana. The data showed that the TMPs of plant tissues and cells were varied at different growth stages, and the change of TMP was higher at the vegetative growth stage than at the reproductive stage of plant growth. The distinct change of TMP was detectable between the normal and the senescent tissues and cells in several plant species. Moreover, diverse abiotic stimuli, such as heat stress, hyperpolarized the TMP in a short time, followed by depolarized membrane potential with the senescence occurring.

"36935511","Exercise suppresses neuroinflammation for alleviating Alzheimer's disease.","J Neuroinflammation","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease, with the characteristics of neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) and senile plaque (SP) formation. Although great progresses have been made in clinical trials based on relevant hypotheses, these studies are also accompanied by the emergence of toxic and side effects, and it is an urgent task to explore the underlying mechanisms for the benefits to prevent and treat AD. Herein, based on animal experiments and a few clinical trials, neuroinflammation in AD is characterized by long-term activation of pro-inflammatory microglia and the NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasomes. Damaged signals from the periphery and within the brain continuously activate microglia, thus resulting in a constant source of inflammatory responses. The long-term chronic inflammatory response also exacerbates endoplasmic reticulum oxidative stress in microglia, which triggers microglia-dependent immune responses, ultimately leading to the occurrence and deterioration of AD. In this review, we systematically summarized and sorted out that exercise ameliorates AD by directly and indirectly regulating immune response of the central nervous system and promoting hippocampal neurogenesis to provide a new direction for exploring the neuroinflammation activity in AD.© 2023.

"36926662","Meta-analysis of the effects of smoking and smoking cessation on triglyceride levels.","Toxicol Rep","Smoking increases lipid levels, including triglycerides, leading to increased cardiovascular disease risk. We performed a meta-analysis to quantify the effects of smoking and smoking cessation on triglyceride levels. The PubMed and Scopus databases were searched to identify studies reporting either triglyceride levels in smokers and non-smokers or the effects of smoking cessation on triglyceride levels. Fixed- and random-effects models were used to perform the analyses when three or more studies/comparisons were available. We identified 169 and 21 studies evaluating the effects of smoking and smoking cessation, respectively, on triglyceride levels. Triglyceride levels were 0.50 mmol/L (95% confidence interval: 0.49-0.50 mmol/L) higher in smokers than non-smokers, but the effect differed widely across studies. No statistically significant effect was observed on triglyceride levels between baseline and 6 weeks (mean difference [MD] = 0.02 [-0.09, 0.12] mmol/L), 2 months (MD = 0.03 [-0.21, 0.27] mmol/L), 3 months (MD = 0.08 [-0.03, 0.21] mmol/L), or 1 year (MD = 0.04 [-0.06, 0.14] mmol/L) after quitting. However, a slightly significant decrease in triglyceride levels was observed at 1 month after cessation (MD = -0.15 [-0.15, -0.01] mmol/L). The results of this meta-analysis provide a basis for understanding the effects of smoking and smoking cessation on triglyceride levels, which could have important implications for public health.© 2023 The Authors."
"36922587","Spatial epigenome-transcriptome co-profiling of mammalian tissues.","Nature","Emerging spatial technologies, including spatial transcriptomics and spatial epigenomics, are becoming powerful tools for profiling of cellular states in the tissue context1-5. However, current methods capture only one layer of omics information at a time, precluding the possibility of examining the mechanistic relationship across the central dogma of molecular biology. Here, we present two technologies for spatially resolved, genome-wide, joint profiling of the epigenome and transcriptome by cosequencing chromatin accessibility and gene expression, or histone modifications (H3K27me3, H3K27ac or H3K4me3) and gene expression on the same tissue section at near-single-cell resolution. These were applied to embryonic and juvenile mouse brain, as well as adult human brain, to map how epigenetic mechanisms control transcriptional phenotype and cell dynamics in tissue. Although highly concordant tissue features were identified by either spatial epigenome or spatial transcriptome we also observed distinct patterns, suggesting their differential roles in defining cell states. Linking epigenome to transcriptome pixel by pixel allows the uncovering of new insights in spatial epigenetic priming, differentiation and gene regulation within the tissue architecture. These technologies are of great interest in life science and biomedical research.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Two-dimensional (2D) cell culture and animal models, which have been used to analyze AD pathology and search for effective treatments for decades, have significantly contributed to our understanding of the mechanism of AD. Despite their successes, 2D and animal models can only capture a fraction of AD mechanisms due to their inability to recapitulate human brain-specific tissue structure, function, and cellular diversity. Recently, the emergence of three-dimensional (3D) cerebral organoids using tissue engineering and induced pluripotent stem cell technology has paved the way to develop models that resemble features of human brain tissue more accurately in comparison to prior models.

The exploration of disease development and therapeutic strategies at the genetic level have become the key to the treatment of cancer and other genetic diseases. The functional analysis of genes and mutations has been slow and laborious. Therefore, there is an urgent need for alternative approaches to improve the current status of cancer research. Gene editing technologies provide technical support for efficient gene disruption and modification in vivo and in vitro, in particular the use of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas systems. Currently, the applications of CRISPR-Cas systems in cancer rely on different Cas effector proteins and the design of guide RNAs. Furthermore, effective vector delivery must be met for the CRISPR-Cas systems to enter human clinical trials. In this review article, we describe the mechanism of the CRISPR-Cas systems and highlight the applications of class II Cas effector proteins. We also propose a synthetic biology approach to modify the CRISPR-Cas systems, and summarize various delivery approaches facilitating the clinical application of the CRISPR-Cas systems. By modifying the CRISPR-Cas system and optimizing its in vivo delivery, promising and effective treatments for cancers using the CRISPR-Cas system are emerging.© 2022 The Authors.

"36923460","The applicability of the European GMO legislation to epigenetically modified organisms.","Front Bioeng Biotechnol","In addition to classic genetic engineering for the targeted modification of the base sequence of the DNA, epigenetic methods for the targeted modification of the genetic material without base changes are increasingly being used. Such epigenetic techniques can be used, for example, to influence stress tolerance to heat or aridity in plants. The regulatory handling of organisms generated by means of epigenetic techniques on the grounds of genetic engineering law has not yet been clarified. This paper critically reviews the legal classification of epigenetically modified organisms as GMOs as expressed in the study on New Genomic Techniques published in April 2021 by the European Commission. The paper shows that there are reasons to assume that epigenetically modified organisms are not covered by the European GMO legislation. In addition, the paper provides an introductory overview of the significance of epigenetics and the methods used to intentionally influence epigenetic traits and illustrates the possibility for a consistent, risk-based regulation of epigenetic modifications.Copyright © 2023 Faltus."
"36909504","SIRT6 activation rescues the age-related decline in DNA damage repair in primary human chondrocytes.","bioRxiv","While advanced age has long been recognized as the greatest risk factor for osteoarthritis (OA), the biological mechanisms behind this connection remain unclear. Previous work has demonstrated that chondrocytes from older cadaveric donors have elevated levels of DNA damage as compared to chondrocytes from younger donors. The purpose of this study was to determine whether a decline in DNA repair efficiency is one explanation for the accumulation of DNA damage with age, and to quantify the improvement in repair with activation of Sirtuin 6 (SIRT6). Using an acute irradiation model to bring the baseline level of all donors to the same starting point, this study demonstrates a decline in repair efficiency during aging when comparing chondrocytes from young (≤45 years old), middle-aged (50-65 years old), or older (>70 years old) cadaveric donors with no known history of OA or macroscopic cartilage degradation at isolation. Activation of SIRT6 in middle-aged chondrocytes with MDL-800 (20 μM) improved the repair efficiency, while inhibition with EX-527 (10 μM) inhibited the rate of repair and the increased the percentage of cells that retained high levels of damage. Treating chondrocytes from older donors with MDL-800 for 48 hours significantly reduced the amount of DNA damage, despite this damage having accumulated over decades. Lastly, chondrocytes isolated from the proximal femurs of mice between 4 months and 22 months of age revealed both an increase in DNA damage with aging, and a decrease in DNA damage following MDL-800 treatment."
"36756698","DNA repair in cardiomyocytes is critical for maintaining cardiac function in mice.","Aging Cell","Heart failure has reached epidemic proportions in a progressively ageing population. The molecular mechanisms underlying heart failure remain elusive, but evidence indicates that DNA damage is enhanced in failing hearts. Here, we tested the hypothesis that endogenous DNA repair in cardiomyocytes is critical for maintaining normal cardiac function, so that perturbed repair of spontaneous DNA damage drives early onset of heart failure. To increase the burden of spontaneous DNA damage, we knocked out the DNA repair endonucleases xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group G (XPG) and excision repair cross-complementation group 1 (ERCC1), either systemically or cardiomyocyte-restricted, and studied the effects on cardiac function and structure. Loss of DNA repair permitted normal heart development but subsequently caused progressive deterioration of cardiac function, resulting in overt congestive heart failure and premature death within 6 months. Cardiac biopsies revealed increased oxidative stress associated with increased fibrosis and apoptosis. Moreover, gene set enrichment analysis showed enrichment of pathways associated with impaired DNA repair and apoptosis, and identified TP53 as one of the top active upstream transcription regulators. In support of the observed cardiac phenotype in mutant mice, several genetic variants in the ERCC1 and XPG gene in human GWAS data were found to be associated with cardiac remodelling and dysfunction. In conclusion, unrepaired spontaneous DNA damage in differentiated cardiomyocytes drives early onset of cardiac failure. These observations implicate DNA damage as a potential novel therapeutic target and highlight systemic and cardiomyocyte-restricted DNA repair-deficient mouse mutants as bona fide models of heart failure.© 2023 The Authors.

There is significant variation in age at onset and severity of symptoms highlighting the importance of genetic diversity in the study of AD. To address this, we analyzed cell and pathology composition of 6- and 14-month-old AD-BXD mouse brains using the semi-automated workflow (QUINT); which we expanded to allow for nonlinear refinement of brain atlas-registration, and quality control assessment of atlas-registration and brain section integrity. Near global age-related increases in microglia, astrocyte, and amyloid-beta accumulation were measured, while regional variation in neuron load existed among strains. Furthermore, hippocampal immunohistochemistry analyses were combined with bulk RNA- sequencing results to demonstrate the relationship between cell composition and gene expression. Overall, the additional functionality of the QUINT workflow delivers a highly effective method for registering and quantifying cell and pathology changes in diverse disease models."

However, the translation of computational results into a clinical use-case scenario remains challenging. A rate-limiting step is the rigorous selection of reliable biomarker candidates among a host of biological features included in multivariate models. We propose Stabl, a machine learning framework that unifies the biomarker discovery process with multivariate predictive modeling of clinical outcomes by selecting a sparse and reliable set of biomarkers. Evaluation of Stabl on synthetic datasets and four independent clinical studies demonstrates improved biomarker sparsity and reliability compared to commonly used SRMs at similar predictive performance. Stabl readily extends to double- and triple-omics integration tasks and identifies a sparser and more reliable set of biomarkers than those selected by state-of-the-art early- and late-fusion SRMs, thereby facilitating the biological interpretation and clinical translation of complex multi-omic predictive models.

Previous studies have identified an association between platelet indices and blood pressure (BP). However, causal inferences are prone to bias by confounding effects and reverse causation. We performed a Mendelian randomization (MR) study to compare the causal roles between genetically determined platelet indices and BP levels.Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with platelet count (PLT), plateletcrit (PCT), mean platelet volume (MPV), platelet distribution width (PDW), and BP at the level of genome-wide significance (p < 5 × 10- 8) in the UK Biobank were used as instrumental variables. In bidirectional univariable MR analyses, inverse variance-weighted (IVW), MR‒Egger, and weighted median methods were used to obtain estimates for individual causal power. In addition, heterogeneity and sensitivity analyses were performed to examine the pleiotropy of effect estimates. Finally, multivariable MR analyses were undertaken to disentangle the comparative effects of four platelet indices on BP.In the univariable MR analyses, increased levels of PLT and PCT were associated with higher BP, and PDW was associated with higher DBP alone. In the reverse direction, SBP had a minor influence on PLT and PCT. In multivariable MR analysis, PDW and PLT revealed an independent effect, whereas the association for PCT and MPV was insignificant after colinear correction.These findings suggest that platelets and BP may affect each other. PDW and PLT are independent platelet indices influencing BP. Increased platelet activation and aggregation may be involved in the pathogenesis of hypertension, which may provide insights into evaluating thromboembolic events in people with high BP. The necessity of initiating antiplatelet therapy among hypertension groups needs further investigation.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Inclusion criteria included a clinical autosomal recessive disease diagnosis and single heterozygous pathogenic variant in the gene of interest identified by first-line analysis (60%-9/15) or a clinical diagnosis of an X-linked recessive or autosomal dominant disease with no causative variant identified (40%-6/15). We performed a multi-step analysis involving short-read genome sequencing (srGS) and complementary approaches such as mRNA sequencing (mRNA-seq), long-read genome sequencing (lrG), or optical genome mapping (oGM) selected according to the outcome of the GS analysis.Results:SrGS alone or in combination with additional genomic and/or transcriptomic technologies allowed us to resolve 87% of individuals by identifying single nucleotide variants/indels missed by first-line targeted tests, identifying variants affecting transcription, or structural variants sometimes requiring lrGS or oGM for their characterization.Conclusion:Hypothesis-driven implementation of combined omics technologies is particularly effective in identifying molecular etiologies.

However, the analyses of perceived stress and stress systems in pED patients need to be more in-depth, especially the interactions between them.Our study included 75 patients with pEDs and 75 healthy men. The International Index of Erectile Function-5 (IIEF-5) and the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) were used for assessing the severity of ED and perceived stress. All participants collected saliva samples on three consecutive days at eight specific times with strict reference to the time of morning awakening for measuring cortisol parameters and wore electrocardiography for 24 h to derive heart rate variability (HRV).The PSS-10 scores of pED patients were significantly higher than the control group (p<0.001). Although PSS-10 and IIEF-5 scores were negatively correlated in pED patients, there was no statistical significance between them (r=-0.049,p=0.677). Compared with the control group, the HRV parameters of pED patients were significantly increased in LF/HF ratio (p=0.014) but significantly decreased in LF, HF, and pNN50 (p<0.001). However, the two groups had no statistically significant differences in cortisol variables (allp>0.05). The interaction between sympathovagal modulation (HF, rMSSD) and cortisol awakening response (CAR AUCi) explained significantly greater variance in perceived stress than either stress system alone. Higher parasympathetic activity combined with a higher cortisol awakening response was associated with greater perceived stress.Our results suggested that the interrelation between ANS and HPA axis activity might enhance our comprehension of how stress affected the physical and mental health of pED patients.Copyright © 2023 Xu, Chen, Gu, Liu, Yang, Li, Rao, Dong, Yang, Huang, Jin, Wang, Liu, Wang and Bai."

In this review we will discuss the genetic susceptibility to COVID-19, the pathogenesis and the local and systemic biomarkers correlated with c-ARDS and the therapeutic options that target the cell signalling pathways of c-ARDS.© 2023.

"36922495","Revealing influencing factors on global waste distribution via deep-learning based dumpsite detection from satellite imagery.","Nat Commun","With the advancement of global civilisation, monitoring and managing dumpsites have become essential parts of environmental governance in various countries. Dumpsite locations are difficult to obtain in a timely manner by local government agencies and environmental groups. The World Bank shows that governments need to spend massive labour and economic costs to collect illegal dumpsites to implement management. Here we show that applying novel deep convolutional networks to high-resolution satellite images can provide an effective, efficient, and low-cost method to detect dumpsites. In sampled areas of 28 cities around the world, our model detects nearly 1000 dumpsites that appeared around 2021. This approach reduces the investigation time by more than 96.8% compared with the manual method. With this novel and powerful methodology, it is now capable of analysing the relationship between dumpsites and various social attributes on a global scale, temporally and spatially.© 2023.

"36937657","The molecular basis of p21-activated kinase-associated neurodevelopmental disorders: From genotype to phenotype.","Front Neurosci","Although the identification of numerous genes involved in neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) has reshaped our understanding of their etiology, there are still major obstacles in the way of developing therapeutic solutions for intellectual disability (ID) and other NDDs. These include extensive clinical and genetic heterogeneity, rarity of recurrent pathogenic variants, and comorbidity with other psychiatric traits. Moreover, a large intragenic mutational landscape is at play in some NDDs, leading to a broad range of clinical symptoms. Such diversity of symptoms is due to the different effects DNA variations have on protein functions and their impacts on downstream biological processes. The type of functional alterations, such as loss or gain of function, and interference with signaling pathways, has yet to be correlated with clinical symptoms for most genes. This review aims at discussing our current understanding of how the molecular changes of group Ip21-activated kinases(PAK1,2and3), which are essential actors of brain development and function; contribute to a broad clinical spectrum of NDDs. Identifying differences inPAKstructure, regulation and spatio-temporal expression may help understanding the specific functions of each group IPAK. Deciphering how each variation type affects these parameters will help uncover the mechanisms underlying mutation pathogenicity. This is a prerequisite for the development of personalized therapeutic approaches.Copyright © 2023 Dobrigna, Poëa-Guyon, Rousseau, Vincent, Toutain and Barnier."
"36865318","Concerning the eXclusion in human genomics: The choice of sex chromosome representation in the human genome drastically affects number of identified variants.","bioRxiv","Over the past 30 years, a community of scientists have pieced together every base pair of the human reference genome from telomere-to-telomere. Interestingly, most human genomics studies omit more than 5% of the genome from their analyses. Under 'normal' circumstances, omitting any chromosome(s) from analysis of the human genome would be reason for concern-the exception being the sex chromosomes. Sex chromosomes in eutherians share an evolutionary origin as an ancestral pair of autosomes. In humans, they share three regions of high sequence identity (~98-100%), which-along with the unique transmission patterns of the sex chromosomes-introduce technical artifacts into genomic analyses. However, the human X chromosome bears numerous important genes-including more ""immune response"" genes than any other chromosome-which makes its exclusion irresponsible when sex differences across human diseases are widespread. To better characterize the effect that including/excluding the X chromosome may have on variants called, we conducted a pilot study on the Terra cloud platform to replicate a subset of standard genomic practices using both the CHM13 reference genome and sex chromosome complement-aware (SCC-aware) reference genome. We compared quality of variant calling, expression quantification, and allele-specific expression using these two reference genome versions across 50 human samples from the Genotype-Tissue-Expression consortium annotated as females. We found that after correction, the whole X chromosome (100%) can generate reliable variant calls-allowing for the inclusion of the whole genome in human genomics analyses as a departure from the status quo of omitting the sex chromosomes from empirical and clinical genomics studies."
"36937914","Causal association between sleep traits and the risk of coronary artery disease in patients with diabetes.","Front Cardiovasc Med","The association between sleep traits and coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients with diabetes has been reported in previous observational studies. However, whether these potential relationships are causal remains unclear. We aim to assess the causal relationship between sleep traits and CAD in diabetic.Genetic instrumental variables associated with five sleep-related traits (insomnia, sleep duration, ease of getting up, morningness and snoring) were extracted from corresponding genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The associations of genetic variants with CAD were based on 15,666 individuals with diabetes (3,968 CAD cases and 11,696 controls). The primary analysis was derived using the inverse variance weighting method. Further sensitivity analysis was conducted to confirm the robustness and consistency of the main results.Genetic liability to insomnia was significantly related to the increased risk of CAD in individuals with diabetes [odds ratio (OR): 1.163; 95% CI: 1.072-1.254;p = 0.001]. Suggestive evidence was found for the borderline associations between both sleep duration (OR: 0.629; 95% CI: 0.380-1.042,p = 0.072) and snoring (OR: 1.010, 95% CI: 1.000-1.020,p = 0.050) with CAD risk. However, no consistent evidence was found for the association between ease of getting up and morningness with the risk of CAD in diabetic. Similar results can be verified in most sensitivity analyses.We provide consistent evidence for the causal effect of insomnia on the increased risk of CAD in individuals with diabetes. The management of sleep health should be emphasized to prevent CAD in diabetic patients.© 2023 Tian, Ma, Shen, Hu, Cui and Huangfu."
"36927485","Relationships between circulating metabolites and facial skin aging: a Mendelian randomization study.","Hum Genomics","Blood metabolites are important to various aspects of our health. However, currently, there is little evidence about the role of circulating metabolites in the process of skin aging.To examine the potential effects of circulating metabolites on the process of skin aging.In the primary analyses, we applied several MR methods to study the associations between 249 metabolites and facial skin aging risk. In the secondary analyses, we replicated the analyses with another array of datasets including 123 metabolites. MR Bayesian model averaging (MR-BMA) method was further used to prioritize the metabolites for the identification of predominant metabolites that are associated with skin aging.In the primary analyses, only the unsaturation degree of fatty acids was found significantly associated with skin aging with the IVW method after multiple testing (odds ratio = 1.084, 95% confidence interval = 1.049-1.120, p = 1.737 × 10-06). Additionally, 11 out of 17 unsaturation-related biomarkers showed a significant or suggestively significant causal effect [p < 0.05 and > 2 × 10-4(0.05/249 metabolites)]. In the secondary analyses, seven metabolic biomarkers were found significantly associated with skin aging [p < 4 × 10-4(0.05/123)], while six of them were related to the unsaturation degree. MR-BMA method validated that the unsaturation degree of fatty acids plays a dominant role in facial skin aging.Our study used systemic MR analyses and provided a comprehensive atlas for the associations between circulating metabolites and the risk of facial skin aging. Genetically proxied unsaturation degree of fatty acids was highlighted as a dominant factor correlated with the risk of facial skin aging.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"36934108","Spatial transcriptomics using multiplexed deterministic barcoding in tissue.","Nat Commun","Spatially resolved transcriptomics of tissue sections enables advances in fundamental and applied biomedical research. Here, we present Multiplexed Deterministic Barcoding in Tissue (xDBiT) to acquire spatially resolved transcriptomes of nine tissue sections in parallel. New microfluidic chips were developed to spatially encode mRNAs over a total tissue area of 1.17 cm2with a 50 µm resolution. Optimization of the biochemical protocol increased read and gene counts per spot by one order of magnitude compared to previous reports. Furthermore, the introduction of alignment markers allowed seamless registration of images and spatial transcriptomic spots. Together with technological advances, we provide an open-source computational pipeline to prepare raw sequencing data for downstream analysis. The functionality of xDBiT was demonstrated by acquiring 16 spatially resolved transcriptomic datasets from five different murine organs, including the cerebellum, liver, kidney, spleen, and heart. Factor analysis and deconvolution of spatial transcriptomes allowed for in-depth characterization of the murine kidney.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"36928843","Evolution and implications of de novo genes in humans.","Nat Ecol Evol","Genes and translated open reading frames (ORFs) that emerged de novo from previously non-coding sequences provide species with opportunities for adaptation. When aberrantly activated, some human-specific de novo genes and ORFs have disease-promoting properties-for instance, driving tumour growth. Thousands of putative de novo coding sequences have been described in humans, but we still do not know what fraction of those ORFs has readily acquired a function. Here, we discuss the challenges and controversies surrounding the detection, mechanisms of origin, annotation, validation and characterization of de novo genes and ORFs. Through manual curation of literature and databases, we provide a thorough table with most de novo genes reported for humans to date. We re-evaluate each locus by tracing the enabling mutations and list proposed disease associations, protein characteristics and supporting evidence for translation and protein detection. This work will support future explorations of de novo genes and ORFs in humans.© 2023. Springer Nature Limited."

"36941542","Robust classification using average correlations as features (ACF).","BMC Bioinformatics","In single-cell transcriptomics and other omics technologies, large fractions of missing values commonly occur. Researchers often either consider only those features that were measured for each instance of their dataset, thereby accepting severe loss of information, or use imputation which can lead to erroneous results. Pairwise metrics allow for imputation-free classification with minimal loss of data.Using pairwise correlations as metric, state-of-the-art approaches to classification would include the K-nearest-neighbor- (KNN) and distribution-based-classification-classifier. Our novel method, termed average correlations as features (ACF), significantly outperforms those approaches by training tunable machine learning models on inter-class and intra-class correlations. Our approach is characterized in simulation studies and its classification performance is demonstrated on real-world datasets from single-cell RNA sequencing and bottom-up proteomics. Furthermore, we demonstrate that variants of our method offer superior flexibility and performance over KNN classifiers and can be used in conjunction with other machine learning methods. In summary, ACF is a flexible method that enables missing value tolerant classification with minimal loss of data.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"36909581","Widespread epistasis shapes RNA Polymerase II active site function and evolution.","bioRxiv","Structurally conserved multi-subunit RNA Polymerases (msRNAPs) are responsible for cellular genome transcription in all kingdoms of life. At the heart of these RNA polymerases is an ultra- conserved active site domain, the trigger loop (TL). The TL participates in substrate selection, catalysis, and translocation of transcription elongation by switching between an open, catalytic- disfavoring state and a closed, catalytic-favoring state in the active site and is therefore central to the msRNAP nucleotide addition cycle. Previous studies have observed diverse genetic interactions between eukaryotic RNA polymerase II (Pol II) TL residues, supporting the idea that the TLâ€™s function is shaped by functional interactions of residues within the TL and between the TL and its proximal domains. The nature and conservation of these intra-TL and inter-TL residue interaction networks, as well as how they control msRNAP function, remains to be determined. To identify the residue interactions that shape TL function and evolution, we have dissected the Pol II intra-TL and TL-Pol II residue interactions by deep mutational scanning inSaccharomyces cerevisiaePol II. Through analysis of over 15000 alleles, representing single mutants, a subset of double mutants, and evolutionarily observed TL haplotypes, we identify interaction networks within the TL and between the TL and other Pol II domains. Substituting residues creates allele-specific networks and propagates epistatic effects across the Pol II active site. Our studies provide a powerful system to understand the plasticity of RNA polymerase mechanism and evolution."
