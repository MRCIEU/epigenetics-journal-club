,37511531,Epigenome-Wide Associations of Placental DNA Methylation and Behavioral and Emotional Difficulties in Children at 3 Years of Age.,Int J Mol Sci,"The placenta is a key organ for fetal and brain development. Its epigenome can be regarded as a biochemical record of the prenatal environment and a potential mechanism of its association with the future health of the fetus. We investigated associations between placental DNA methylation levels and child behavioral and emotional difficulties, assessed at 3 years of age using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) in 441 mother-child dyads from the EDEN cohort. Hypothesis-driven and exploratory analyses (on differentially methylated probes (EWAS) and regions (DMR)) were adjusted for confounders, technical factors, and cell composition estimates, corrected for multiple comparisons, and stratified by child sex. Hypothesis-driven analyses showed an association of cg26703534 (AHRR) with emotional symptoms, and exploratory analyses identified two probes, cg09126090 (intergenic region) and cg10305789 (PPP1R16B), as negatively associated with peer relationship problems, as well as 33 DMRs, mostly positively associated with at least one of the SDQ subscales. Among girls, most associations were seen with emotional difficulties, whereas in boys, DMRs were as much associated with emotional than behavioral difficulties. This study provides the first evidence of associations between placental DNA methylation and child behavioral and emotional difficulties. Our results suggest sex-specific associations and might provide new insights into the mechanisms of neurodevelopment."
,37503194,An epigenome-wide association study of child appetitive traits and DNA methylation.,bioRxiv,"Childhood appetitive traits are consistently associated with obesity risk, and yet their etiology is poorly understood. Appetitive traits are complex phenotypes which are hypothesized to be influenced by both genetic and environmental factors, as well as their interactions. Early-life epigenetic processes, such as DNA methylation (DNAm), may be involved in the developmental programming of appetite regulation in childhood. In the current study, we meta-analyzed epigenome-wide association studies (EWASs) of cord blood DNAm and early-childhood appetitive traits. Data were from two independent cohorts: the Generation R Study (n=1,086, Rotterdam, the Netherlands) and the Healthy Start study (n=236, Colorado, USA). DNAm at autosomal methylation sites in cord blood was measured using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. Parents reported on their child's food responsiveness, emotional undereating, satiety responsiveness and food fussiness using the Children's Eating Behaviour Questionnaire at age 4-5 years. Multiple regression models were used to examine the association of DNAm (predictor) at the individual site- and regional-level (using DMRff) with each appetitive trait (outcome), adjusting for covariates. Bonferroni-correction was applied to adjust for multiple testing. There were no associations of DNAm and any appetitive trait at the individual site-level. However, at the regional level, we identified 45 associations of DNAm with food responsiveness, 7 associations of DNAm with emotional undereating, 13 associations of DNAm with satiety responsiveness, and 9 associations of DNAm with food fussiness. This study shows that DNAm in the newborn may partially explain variation in appetitive traits expressed in early childhood and provides preliminary support for early programming of child appetitive traits through DNAm. Investigating differential DNAm associated with appetitive traits could be an important first step in identifying biological pathways underlying the development of these behaviors."
,37502923,sciMET-cap: High-throughput single-cell methylation analysis with a reduced sequencing burden.,bioRxiv,"DNA methylation is a key component of the mammalian epigenome, playing a regulatory role in development, disease, and other processes. Robust, high-throughput single-cell DNA methylation assays are now possible (sciMET); however, the genome-wide nature of DNA methylation results in a high sequencing burden per cell. Here, we leverage target enrichment with sciMET to capture sufficient information per cell for cell type assignment using substantially fewer sequence reads (sciMET-cap). Sufficient off-target coverage further enables the production of near-complete methylomes for individual cell types. We characterize sciMET-cap on human PBMCs and brain (middle frontal gyrus)."
,37502922,Multi-ancestry epigenome-wide analyses identify methylated sites associated with aortic augmentation index in TOPMed MESA.,Res Sq,"Despite the prognostic value of arterial stiffness (AS) and pulsatile hemodynamics (PH) for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, epigenetic modifications that contribute to AS/PH remain unknown. To gain a better understanding of the link between epigenetics (DNA methylation) and AS/PH, we examined the relationship of eight measures of AS/PH with CpG sites and co-methylated regions using multi-ancestry participants from Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) with sample sizes ranging from 438 to 874. Epigenome-wide association analysis identified one genome-wide significant CpG (cg20711926-CYP1B1) associated with aortic augmentation index (AIx). Follow-up analyses, including gene set enrichment analysis, expression quantitative trait methylation analysis, and functional enrichment analysis on differentially methylated positions and regions, further prioritized three CpGs and their annotated genes (cg23800023-ETS1, cg08426368-TGFB3, and cg17350632-HLA-DPB1) for AIx. Among these,ETS1andTGFB3have been previously prioritized as candidate genes. Furthermore, bothETS1andHLA-DPB1have significant tissue correlations between Whole Blood and Aorta in GTEx, which suggestsETS1andHLA-DPB1could be potential biomarkers in understanding pathophysiology of AS/PH. Overall, our findings support the possible role of epigenetic regulation via DNA methylation of specific genes associated with AIx as well as identifying potential targets for regulation of AS/PH."
,37501075,Genome-wide discovery of circulating cell-free DNA methylation biomarkers for colorectal cancer detection.,Clin Epigenetics,"Colorectal polyp is known a precursor of colorectal cancer (CRC) that holds an increased risk for progression to CRC. Circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) methylation has shown favorable performance in the detection and monitoring the malignant progression in a variety of cancers.To discover cfDNA methylation markers for the diagnosis of CRC, we first performed a genome-wide analysis between eight CRC and eight polyp tissues using the Infinium HumanMethylationEPIC BeadChip. We identified 7008 DMCs, and after filtering, we validated 39 DMCs by MethylTarget sequencing in 62 CRC and 56 polyp tissues. A panel of four CpGs (cg04486886, cg06712559, cg13539460, and cg27541454) was selected as the methylation marker in tissue by LASSO and random forest models. A diagnosis prediction model was built based on the four CpGs, and the methylation diagnosis score (md-score) can effectively discriminate tissues with CRC from polyp patients (AUROC > 0.9). Finally, the cg27541454 was confirmed hypermethylated in CRC (AUC = 0.85) in the plasma validation cohort.Our findings suggest that the md-score could robustly detect CRC from polyp tissues, and cg27541454 may be a promising candidate noninvasive biomarker for CRC early diagnosis.© 2023.

,37496173,The lipidomic correlates of epigenetic aging across the adult lifespan: A population-based study.,Aging Cell,"Lipid signaling is involved in longevity regulation, but which specific lipid molecular species affect human biological aging remains largely unknown. We investigated the relation between complex lipids and DNA methylation-based metrics of biological aging among 4181 participants (mean age 55.1 years (range 30.0-95.0)) from the Rhineland Study, an ongoing population-based cohort study in Bonn, Germany. The absolute concentration of 14 lipid classes, covering 964 molecular species and 267 fatty acid composites, was measured by Metabolon Complex Lipid Panel. DNA methylation-based metrics of biological aging (AgeAccelPheno and AgeAccelGrim) were calculated based on published algorithms. Epigenome-wide association analyses (EWAS) of biological aging-associated lipids and pathway analysis were performed to gain biological insights into the mechanisms underlying the effects of lipidomics on biological aging. We found that higher levels of molecular species belonging to neutral lipids, phosphatidylethanolamines, phosphatidylinositols, and dihydroceramides were associated with faster biological aging, whereas higher levels of lysophosphatidylcholine, hexosylceramide, and lactosylceramide species were associated with slower biological aging. Ceramide, phosphatidylcholine, and lysophosphatidylethanolamine species with odd-numbered fatty acid tail lengths were associated with slower biological aging, whereas those with even-numbered chain lengths were associated with faster biological aging. EWAS combined with functional pathway analysis revealed several complex lipids associated with biological aging as important regulators of known longevity and aging-related pathways.© 2023 The Authors.

,37466420,Genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation and its relationship with serum homocysteine levels in patients with hypertension.,J Hypertens,"Homocysteine (Hcy) is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, and elevated plasma Hcy levels could aggravate vascular injury in hypertension. Hyperhomocysteinemia can change the methylation status of global DNA and specific genes. In the present study, we aim to examine the comprehensive influence of Hcy levels on DNA methylation status in patients with hypertension.Epigenome-wide methylation profiles of the peripheral leukocyte DNA of 218 patients with hypertension were analyzed using the Illumina Infinium Methylation EPIC BeadChip. Differentially methylated positions (DMPs) associated with serum Hcy levels were identified by mixed linear regression with the adjustment of potential confounders. Gene Ontology analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis were conducted to determine the potential functions of the identified DMPs. The association between the methylation level of DMPs and carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (Cf-PWV) was also analyzed.Five DMPs at cg13169662, cg03179312, cg21976560, cg25262698, and cg09433843 showed significant association with serum Hcy levels (false discovery rate-corrected P < 0.05). An additional six CpG sites met the threshold for suggestive significance (P < 1 × 10-6), among which three DMPs (cg25781123, cg26463106, and cg06679221) were annotated to THUMPD3. Furthermore, the methylation levels of cg13169662 and cg25262698 (RPRD1A) were significantly associated with Cf-PWV.Our results suggest that Hcy could induce DNA methylation alteration in patients with hypertension. Further functional research is warranted to elucidate the concrete role of DMPs in hypertension.Copyright © 2023 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved."
,37464577,Epigenome-wide association study using peripheral blood leukocytes identifies genomic regions associated with periodontal disease and edentulism in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study.,J Clin Periodontol,"To investigate individual susceptibility to periodontitis by conducting an epigenome-wide association study using peripheral blood.We included 1077 African American and 457 European American participants of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study who had completed a dental examination or reported being edentulous at Visit 4 and had available data on DNA methylation from Visit 2 or 3. DNA methylation levels were compared by periodontal disease severity and edentulism through discovery analyses and subsequent testing of individual CpGs.Our discovery analysis replicated findings from a previous study reporting a region in gene ZFP57 (6p22.1) that was significantly hypomethylated in severe periodontal disease compared with no/mild periodontal disease in European American participants. Higher methylation levels in a separate region in an unknown gene (located in Chr10: 743,992-744,958) was associated with significantly higher odds of edentulism compared with no/mild periodontal disease in African American participants. In subsequent CpG testing, four CpGs in a region previously associated with periodontitis located within HOXA4 were significantly hypermethylated in severe periodontal disease compared with no/mild periodontal disease in African American participants (odds ratio per 1 SD increase in methylation level: cg11015251: 1.28 (1.02, 1.61); cg14359292: 1.24 (1.01, 1.54); cg07317062: 1.30 (1.05, 1.61); cg08657492: 1.25 (1.01, 1.55)).Our study highlights epigenetic variations in ZPF57 and HOXA4 that are significantly and reproducibly associated with periodontitis. Future studies should evaluate gene regulatory mechanisms in the candidate regions of these loci.© 2023 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd."
,37461726,Critical evaluation of the reliability of DNA methylation probes on the Illumina MethylationEPIC BeadChip microarrays for dementia research.,Res Sq,"Background DNA methylation (DNAm) has been implicated in many diseases including dementia. Array-based technologies offer a cost-effective and comprehensive approach for measuring DNAm on a genome-wide scale. However, the accuracy of DNAm measurements obtained using Illumina arrays can vary across different probes. Previous research has focused primarily on assessing the reliability of DNAm in younger subjects, and have compared duplicate samples between the 450k-450k or 450k-EPIC platforms, with limited investigations on EPIC-EPIC comparisons. Methods We conducted a comprehensive assessment of probe reliability on the Illumina EPIC arrays using 138 duplicated blood DNAm samples from subjects older than 65 years in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study. To assess the reliability of each probe, we computed intraclass correlations (ICCs) for each probe. Both the magnitude and patterns of reliability in the EPIC-EPIC comparison were assessed. Furthermore, we also investigated the impact of probe reliability on the analyses of epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS). Results Our findings revealed the reliability of probes on the EPIC arrays is higher than those of previous studies involving duplicate measurements on 450k-EPIC or 450k-450k arrays. Consistent with earlier research, we observed increased reliability in probes with substantial between-subject variances or average methylation beta values ranging from 0.2 to 0.8. Lower reliability was observed in type I probes or probes located within the promoter and CpG island regions. In addition, we found some probes can yield high ICC values despite significant disagreement in duplicate measurements, primarily due to their relatively high between-subject variance. To account for such discrepancies explicitly, we introduced a novel statistical measure called the modified ICC, which penalizes the ICC based on the half-width of the 95% confidence limits of agreement. Importantly, we found probe reliability has significant implications in various downstream analyses of EWAS, such as meta-analysis, differentially methylated regions analysis, and integrative analyses within the cross-tissue or multi-omics contexts. Conclusion We developed a valuable resource for dementia research, providing crucial reliability information for probes on the EPIC array. This resource can be utilized to identify and prioritize high-quality probes, thereby minimizing the potential for false discoveries and maximizing the potential of EWAS."
,37415231,Epigenetic marks associated with gestational diabetes mellitus across two time points during pregnancy.,Clin Epigenetics,"An adverse intrauterine or periconceptional environment, such as hyperglycemia during pregnancy, can affect the DNA methylation pattern both in mothers and their offspring. In this study, we explored the epigenetic profile in maternal peripheral blood samples through pregnancy to find potential epigenetic biomarkers for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), as well as candidate genes involved in GDM development. We performed an epigenome-wide association study in maternal peripheral blood samples in 32 pregnant women (16 with GDM and 16 non-GDM) at pregnancy week 24-28 and 36-38. Biochemical, anthropometric, and obstetrical variables were collected from all the participants. The main results were validated in an independent cohort with different ethnic origin (European = 307; South Asians = 165). Two hundred and seventy-two CpGs sites remained significantly different between GDM and non-GDM pregnant women across two time points during pregnancy. The significant CpG sites were related to pathways associated with type I diabetes mellitus, insulin resistance and secretion. Cg01459453 (SELP gene) was the most differentiated in the GDM group versus non-GDM (73.6 vs. 60.9, p = 1.06E-11; FDR = 7.87E-06). Three CpG sites (cg01459453, cg15329406, and cg04095097) were able to discriminate between GDM cases and controls (AUC = 1; p = 1.26E-09). Three differentially methylated positions (DMPs) were replicated in an independent cohort. To conclude, epigenetic marks during pregnancy differed between GDM cases and controls suggesting a role for these genes in GDM development. Three CpGs were able to discriminate GDM and non-GDM groups with high specificity and sensitivity, which may be biomarker candidates for diagnosis or prediction of GDM.© 2023. The Author(s)."
sw,37405974,Contributions of neighborhood social environment and air pollution exposure to Black-White disparities in epigenetic aging.,PLoS One,"Racial disparities in many aging-related health outcomes are persistent and pervasive among older Americans, reflecting accelerated biological aging for Black Americans compared to White, known as weathering. Environmental determinants that contribute to weathering are poorly understood. Having a higher biological age, measured by DNA methylation (DNAm), than chronological age is robustly associated with worse age-related outcomes and higher social adversity. We hypothesize that individual socioeconomic status (SES), neighborhood social environment, and air pollution exposures contribute to racial disparities in DNAm aging according to GrimAge and Dunedin Pace of Aging methylation (DPoAm). We perform retrospective cross-sectional analyses among 2,960 non-Hispanic participants (82% White, 18% Black) in the Health and Retirement Study whose 2016 DNAm age is linked to survey responses and geographic data. DNAm aging is defined as the residual after regressing DNAm age on chronological age. We observe Black individuals have significantly accelerated DNAm aging on average compared to White individuals according to GrimAge (239%) and DPoAm (238%). We implement multivariable linear regression models and threefold decomposition to identify exposures that contribute to this disparity. Exposure measures include individual-level SES, census-tract-level socioeconomic deprivation and air pollution (fine particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, and ozone), and perceived neighborhood social and physical disorder. Race and gender are included as covariates. Regression and decomposition results show that individual-level SES is strongly associated with and accounts for a large portion of the disparity in both GrimAge and DPoAm aging. Higher neighborhood deprivation for Black participants significantly contributes to the disparity in GrimAge aging. Black participants are more vulnerable to fine particulate matter exposure for DPoAm, perhaps due to individual- and neighborhood-level SES, which may contribute to the disparity in DPoAm aging. DNAm aging may play a role in the environment ""getting under the skin"", contributing to age-related health disparities between older Black and White Americans.Copyright: © 2023 Yannatos et al.

,37278618,Associations of four biological age markers with child development: A multi-omic analysis in the European HELIX cohort.,Elife,"While biological age in adults is often understood as representing general health and resilience, the conceptual interpretation of accelerated biological age in children and its relationship to development remains unclear. We aimed to clarify the relationship of accelerated biological age, assessed through two established biological age indicators, telomere length and DNA methylation age, and two novel candidate biological age indicators, to child developmental outcomes, including growth and adiposity, cognition, behavior, lung function and the onset of puberty, among European school-age children participating in the HELIX exposome cohort.The study population included up to 1173 children, aged between 5 and 12 years, from study centres in the UK, France, Spain, Norway, Lithuania, and Greece. Telomere length was measured through qPCR, blood DNA methylation, and gene expression was measured using microarray, and proteins and metabolites were measured by a range of targeted assays. DNA methylation age was assessed using Horvath's skin and blood clock, while novel blood transcriptome and 'immunometabolic' (based on plasma proteins and urinary and serum metabolites) clocks were derived and tested in a subset of children assessed six months after the main follow-up visit. Associations between biological age indicators with child developmental measures as well as health risk factors were estimated using linear regression, adjusted for chronological age, sex, ethnicity, and study centre. The clock derived markers were expressed as Δ age (i.e. predicted minus chronological age).Transcriptome and immunometabolic clocks predicted chronological age well in the test set (r=0.93 andr=0.84 respectively). Generally, weak correlations were observed, after adjustment for chronological age, between the biological age indicators.Among associations with health risk factors, higher birthweight was associated with greater immunometabolic Δ age, smoke exposure with greater DNA methylation Δ age, and high family affluence with longer telomere length.Among associations with child developmental measures, all biological age markers were associated with greater BMI and fat mass, and all markers except telomere length were associated with greater height, at least at nominal significance (p<0.05). Immunometabolic Δ age was associated with better working memory (p=4 e-3) and reduced inattentiveness (p=4 e-4), while DNA methylation Δ age was associated with greater inattentiveness (p=0.03) and poorer externalizing behaviors (p=0.01). Shorter telomere length was also associated with poorer externalizing behaviors (p=0.03).In children, as in adults, biological aging appears to be a multi-faceted process and adiposity is an important correlate of accelerated biological aging. Patterns of associations suggested that accelerated immunometabolic age may be beneficial for some aspects of child development while accelerated DNA methylation age and telomere attrition may reflect early detrimental aspects of biological aging, apparent even in children.UK Research and Innovation (MR/S03532X/1); European Commission (grant agreement numbers: 308333; 874583).© 2023, Robinson et al."
ms,37364131,Antisense oligonucleotide rescue of CGG expansion-dependent FMR1 mis-splicing in fragile X syndrome restores FMRP.,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,"Aberrant alternative splicing of mRNAs results in dysregulated gene expression in multiple neurological disorders. Here, we show that hundreds of mRNAs are incorrectly expressed and spliced in white blood cells and brain tissues of individuals with fragile X syndrome (FXS). Surprisingly, theFMR1 (Fragile X Messenger Ribonucleoprotein 1)gene is transcribed in >70% of the FXS tissues. In allFMR1-expressing FXS tissues,FMR1RNA itself is mis-spliced in a CGG expansion-dependent manner to generate the little-knownFMR1-217 RNA isoform, which is comprised ofFMR1exon 1 and a pseudo-exon in intron 1.FMR1-217 is also expressed in FXS premutation carrier-derived skin fibroblasts and brain tissues. We show that in cells aberrantly expressing mis-splicedFMR1, antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) treatment reducesFMR1-217, rescues full-lengthFMR1RNA, and restores FMRP (Fragile X Messenger RibonucleoProtein) to normal levels. Notably,FMR1gene reactivation in transcriptionally silent FXS cells using 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-AzadC), which prevents DNA methylation, increasesFMR1-217 RNA levels but not FMRP. ASO treatment of cells prior to 5-AzadC application rescues full-lengthFMR1expression and restores FMRP. These findings indicate that misregulated RNA-processing events in blood could serve as potent biomarkers for FXS and that in those individuals expressingFMR1-217, ASO treatment may offer a therapeutic approach to mitigate the disorder."
,37414898,A prognostic risk score for development and spread of chronic pain.,Nat Med,"Chronic pain is a complex condition influenced by a combination of biological, psychological and social factors. Using data from the UK Biobank (n = 493,211), we showed that pain spreads from proximal to distal sites and developed a biopsychosocial model that predicted the number of coexisting pain sites. This data-driven model was used to identify a risk score that classified various chronic pain conditions (area under the curve (AUC) 0.70-0.88) and pain-related medical conditions (AUC 0.67-0.86). In longitudinal analyses, the risk score predicted the development of widespread chronic pain, the spreading of chronic pain across body sites and high-impact pain about 9 years later (AUC 0.68-0.78). Key risk factors included sleeplessness, feeling 'fed-up', tiredness, stressful life events and a body mass index >30. A simplified version of this score, named the risk of pain spreading, obtained similar predictive performance based on six simple questions with binarized answers. The risk of pain spreading was then validated in the Northern Finland Birth Cohort (n = 5,525) and the PREVENT-AD cohort (n = 178), obtaining comparable predictive performance. Our findings show that chronic pain conditions can be predicted from a common set of biopsychosocial factors, which can aid in tailoring research protocols, optimizing patient randomization in clinical trials and improving pain management.© 2023.

sw,37461498,Effect of Parental Adverse Childhood Experiences on Intergenerational DNA Methylation Signatures.,Res Sq,"Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) are events that occur before a child turns 18 years old that may cause trauma. In this study, the effect of cumulative ACEs experienced on human maternal DNA methylation (DNAm) was estimated while accounting for interaction with domains of ACEs in prenatal peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples from the Maternal and Developmental Risks from Environmental Stressors (MADRES) pregnancy cohort. The intergenerational transmission of ACE-associated DNAm was also explored used paired maternal and neonatal cord blood samples. Replication in buccal samples was explored in the Children's Health Study (CHS). We used a four-level categorical indicator variable for ACEs exposure: none (0 ACEs), low (1-3 ACEs), moderate (4-6 ACEs), and high (> 6 ACEs). Effects of ACEs on maternal DNAm (N = 240) were estimated using linear models. To evaluate evidence for intergenerational transmission, mediation analysis was used. Analysis of maternal samples displayed some shared but mostly distinct effects of ACEs on DNAm across low, moderate, and high ACEs categories.CLCN7andPTPRN2was associated with maternal DNAm in the low ACE group and this association replicated in the CHS. ACE-associated methylation was observed in maternal and neonatal profiles in theCOMTpromoter region, with some evidence of mediation by maternalCOMTmethylation. Specific genomic loci exhibited mutually exclusive maternal ACE effects on DNAm in either maternal or neonatal population. There is some evidence for an intergenerational effect of ACEs, supported by shared DNAm signatures in theCOMTgene across maternal-neonatal paired samples."
,37430364,CimpleG: finding simple CpG methylation signatures.,Genome Biol,"DNA methylation signatures are usually based on multivariate approaches that require hundreds of sites for predictions. Here, we propose a computational framework named CimpleG for the detection of small CpG methylation signatures used for cell-type classification and deconvolution. We show that CimpleG is both time efficient and performs as well as top performing methods for cell-type classification of blood cells and other somatic cells, while basing its prediction on a single DNA methylation site per cell type. Altogether, CimpleG provides a complete computational framework for the delineation of DNAm signatures and cellular deconvolution.© 2023. The Author(s)."
,37443060,Stability selection enhances feature selection and enables accurate prediction of gestational age using only five DNA methylation sites.,Clin Epigenetics,"DNA methylation (DNAm) is robustly associated with chronological age in children and adults, and gestational age (GA) in newborns. This property has enabled the development of several epigenetic clocks that can accurately predict chronological age and GA. However, the lack of overlap in predictive CpGs across different epigenetic clocks remains elusive. Our main aim was therefore to identify and characterize CpGs that are stably predictive of GA.We applied a statistical approach called 'stability selection' to DNAm data from 2138 newborns in the Norwegian Mother, Father, and Child Cohort study. Stability selection combines subsampling with variable selection to restrict the number of false discoveries in the set of selected variables. Twenty-four CpGs were identified as being stably predictive of GA. Intriguingly, only up to 10% of the CpGs in previous GA clocks were found to be stably selected. Based on these results, we used generalized additive model regression to develop a new GA clock consisting of only five CpGs, which showed a similar predictive performance as previous GA clocks (R2 = 0.674, median absolute deviation = 4.4 days). These CpGs were in or near genes and regulatory regions involved in immune responses, metabolism, and developmental processes. Furthermore, accounting for nonlinear associations improved prediction performance in preterm newborns.We present a methodological framework for feature selection that is broadly applicable to any trait that can be predicted from DNAm data. We demonstrate its utility by identifying CpGs that are highly predictive of GA and present a new and highly performant GA clock based on only five CpGs that is more amenable to a clinical setting.© 2023.

,37447167,Association of the DNA Methylation of Obesity-Related Genes with the Dietary Nutrient Intake in Children.,Nutrients,"The occurrence of obesity stems from both genetic and external influences. Despite thorough research and attempts to address it through various means such as dietary changes, physical activity, education, and medications, a lasting solution to this widespread problem remains elusive. Nutrients play a crucial role in various cellular processes, including the regulation of gene expression. One of the mechanisms by which nutrients can affect gene expression is through DNA methylation. This modification can alter the accessibility of DNA to transcription factors and other regulatory proteins, thereby influencing gene expression. Nutrients such as folate and vitamin B12 are involved in the one-carbon metabolism pathway, which provides the methyl groups necessary for DNA methylation. Studies have shown that the inadequate intake of these nutrients can lead to alterations in DNA methylation patterns. For this study, we aim to understand the differences in the association of the dietary intake between normal weight and overweight/obese children and between European American and African American children with the DNA methylation of the three genesNRF1,FTO, andLEPR. The research discovered a significant association between the nutritional intake of 6-10-years-old children, particularly the methyl donors present in their diet, and the methylation of theNRF1,FTO, andLEPRgenes. Additionally, the study emphasizes the significance of considering health inequalities, particularly family income and maternal education, when investigating the epigenetic impact of methyl donors in diet and gene methylation."
ms,37495687,Evolutionary histories of breast cancer and related clones.,Nature,"Recent studies have documented frequent evolution of clones carrying common cancer mutations in apparently normal tissues, which are implicated in cancer development1-3. However, our knowledge is still missing with regard to what additional driver events take place in what order, before one or more of these clones in normal tissues ultimately evolve to cancer. Here, using phylogenetic analyses of multiple microdissected samples from both cancer and non-cancer lesions, we show unique evolutionary histories of breast cancers harbouring der(1;16), a common driver alteration found in roughly 20% of breast cancers. The approximate timing of early evolutionary events was estimated from the mutation rate measured in normal epithelial cells. In der(1;16)(+) cancers, the derivative chromosome was acquired from early puberty to late adolescence, followed by the emergence of a common ancestor by the patient's early 30s, from which both cancer and non-cancer clones evolved. Replacing the pre-existing mammary epithelium in the following years, these clones occupied a large area within the premenopausal breast tissues by the time of cancer diagnosis. Evolution of multiple independent cancer founders from the non-cancer ancestors was common, contributing to intratumour heterogeneity. The number of driver events did not correlate with histology, suggesting the role of local microenvironments and/or epigenetic driver events. A similar evolutionary pattern was also observed in another case evolving from an AKT1-mutated founder. Taken together, our findings provide new insight into how breast cancer evolves.© 2023.

,37443254,Leveraging polygenic enrichments of gene features to predict genes underlying complex traits and diseases.,Nat Genet,"Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) are a valuable tool for understanding the biology of complex human traits and diseases, but associated variants rarely point directly to causal genes. In the present study, we introduce a new method, polygenic priority score (PoPS), that learns trait-relevant gene features, such as cell-type-specific expression, to prioritize genes at GWAS loci. Using a large evaluation set of genes with fine-mapped coding variants, we show that PoPS and the closest gene individually outperform other gene prioritization methods, but observe the best overall performance by combining PoPS with orthogonal methods. Using this combined approach, we prioritize 10,642 unique gene-trait pairs across 113 complex traits and diseases with high precision, finding not only well-established gene-trait relationships but nominating new genes at unresolved loci, such as LGR4 for estimated glomerular filtration rate and CCR7 for deep vein thrombosis. Overall, we demonstrate that PoPS provides a powerful addition to the gene prioritization toolbox.© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc."

Here, to better understand these differences, we evaluated the organization of single cells using multiplexed imaging and single-nucleus RNA and open chromatin assays across eight different intestinal sites from nine donors. Through systematic analyses, we find cell compositions that differ substantially across regions of the intestine and demonstrate the complexity of epithelial subtypes, and find that the same cell types are organized into distinct neighbourhoods and communities, highlighting distinct immunological niches that are present in the intestine. We also map gene regulatory differences in these cells that are suggestive of a regulatory differentiation cascade, and associate intestinal disease heritability with specific cell types. These results describe the complexity of the cell composition, regulation and organization for this organ, and serve as an important reference map for understanding human biology and disease.© 2023.

x,37500728,Single-molecule genome-wide mutation profiles of cell-free DNA for non-invasive detection of cancer.,Nat Genet,"Somatic mutations are a hallmark of tumorigenesis and may be useful for non-invasive diagnosis of cancer. We analyzed whole-genome sequencing data from 2,511 individuals in the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) study as well as 489 individuals from four prospective cohorts and found distinct regional mutation type-specific frequencies in tissue and cell-free DNA from patients with cancer that were associated with replication timing and other chromatin features. A machine-learning model using genome-wide mutational profiles combined with other features and followed by CT imaging detected >90% of patients with lung cancer, including those with stage I and II disease. The fixed model was validated in an independent cohort, detected patients with cancer earlier than standard approaches and could be used to monitor response to therapy. This approach lays the groundwork for non-invasive cancer detection using genome-wide mutation features that may facilitate cancer screening and monitoring.© 2023. The Author(s)."
x,37399400,Comprehensive tissue deconvolution of cell-free DNA by deep learning for disease diagnosis and monitoring.,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,"Plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is a noninvasive biomarker for cell death of all organs. Deciphering the tissue origin of cfDNA can reveal abnormal cell death because of diseases, which has great clinical potential in disease detection and monitoring. Despite the great promise, the sensitive and accurate quantification of tissue-derived cfDNA remains challenging to existing methods due to the limited characterization of tissue methylation and the reliance on unsupervised methods. To fully exploit the clinical potential of tissue-derived cfDNA, here we present one of thelargestcomprehensive and high-resolution methylation atlas based on 521 noncancer tissue samples spanning 29 major types of human tissues. We systematically identified fragment-level tissue-specific methylation patterns and extensively validated them in orthogonal datasets. Based on the rich tissue methylation atlas, we develop thefirstsupervised tissue deconvolution approach, a deep-learning-powered model,cfSort, for sensitive and accurate tissue deconvolution in cfDNA. On the benchmarking data,cfSortshowed superior sensitivity and accuracy compared to the existing methods. We further demonstrated the clinical utilities ofcfSortwith two potential applications: aiding disease diagnosis and monitoring treatment side effects. The tissue-derived cfDNA fraction estimated fromcfSortreflected the clinical outcomes of the patients. In summary, the tissue methylation atlas andcfSortenhanced the performance of tissue deconvolution in cfDNA, thus facilitating cfDNA-based disease detection and longitudinal treatment monitoring."
x,37496025,Short-term smoking cessation leads to a universal decrease in whole blood genomic DNA methylation in patients with a smoking history.,World J Surg Oncol,"Epigenetics is involved in various human diseases. Smoking is one of the most common environmental factors causing epigenetic changes. The DNA methylation changes and mechanisms after quitting smoking have yet to be defined. The present study examined the changes in DNA methylation levels before and after short-term smoking cessation and explored the potential mechanism.Whole blood and clinical data were collected from 8 patients before and after short-term smoking cessation, DNA methylation was assessed, and differentially methylated sites were analyzed, followed by a comprehensive analysis of the differentially methylated sites with clinical data. GO/KEGG enrichment and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analyses identified the hub genes. The differentially methylated sites between former and current smokers in GSE50660 from the GEO database were detected by GEO2R. Then, a Venn analysis was carried out using the differentially methylated sites. GO/KEGG enrichment analysis was performed on the genes corresponding to the common DNA methylation sites, the PPI network was constructed, and hub genes were predicted. The enriched genes associated with the cell cycle were selected, and the pan-cancer gene expression and clinical significance in lung cancer were analyzed based on the TCGA database.Most genes showed decreased DNA methylation levels after short-term smoking cessation; 694 upregulated methylation CpG sites and 3184 downregulated methylation CpG sites were identified. The DNA methylation levels were altered according to the clinical data (body weight, expiratory, and tobacco dependence score). Enrichment analysis, construction of the PPI network, and pan-cancer analysis suggested that smoking cessation may affect various biological processes.Smoking cessation leads to epigenetic changes, mainly decreased in the decline of most DNA methylation levels. Bioinformatics further identified the biologically relevant changes after short-term smoking cessation.© 2023. The Author(s)."
,37495688,Rewiring cancer drivers to activate apoptosis.,Nature,"Genes that drive the proliferation, survival, invasion and metastasis of malignant cells have been identified for many human cancers1-4. Independent studies have identified cell death pathways that eliminate cells for the good of the organism5,6. The coexistence of cell death pathways with driver mutations suggests that the cancer driver could be rewired to activate cell death using chemical inducers of proximity (CIPs). Here we describe a new class of molecules called transcriptional/epigenetic CIPs (TCIPs) that recruit the endogenous cancer driver, or a downstream transcription factor, to the promoters of cell death genes, thereby activating their expression. We focused on diffuse large B cell lymphoma, in which the transcription factor B cell lymphoma 6 (BCL6) is deregulated7. BCL6 binds to the promoters of cell death genes and epigenetically suppresses their expression8. We produced TCIPs by covalently linking small molecules that bind BCL6 to those that bind to transcriptional activators that contribute to the oncogenic program, such as BRD4. The most potent molecule, TCIP1, increases binding of BRD4 by 50% over genomic BCL6-binding sites to produce transcriptional elongation at pro-apoptotic target genes within 15 min, while reducing binding of BRD4 over enhancers by only 10%, reflecting a gain-of-function mechanism. TCIP1 kills diffuse large B cell lymphoma cell lines, including chemotherapy-resistant, TP53-mutant lines, at EC50of 1-10 nM in 72 h and exhibits cell-specific and tissue-specific effects, capturing the combinatorial specificity inherent to transcription. The TCIP concept also has therapeutic applications in regulating the expression of genes for regenerative medicine and developmental disorders.© 2023.

x,37409096,DNA methylation biomarkers distinguishing early-stage prostate cancer from benign prostatic hyperplasia.,Prostate Int,"DNA methylation markers are considered robust diagnostic features in various cancer types, as epigenetic marks are commonly altered during cancer progression. Differentiation between benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and early-stage prostate cancer (PCa) is clinically difficult, relying on the information of the patient's symptoms or levels of prostate-specific antigen.A total of 42 PCa patients and 11 BPH patients were recruited. Genomic DNA was purified from tissues and used for the library preparation of the target-enriched methylome with enzymatic conversion and a Twist 85 Mbp EM-seq panel. Paired-end sequencing (150 bp) was performed using NovaSeq 6000 or NextSeq 550. After quality control, including adapter trimming and de-duplication of raw sequencing data, differential methylation patterns were analyzed between the BPH and PCa groups.We report DNA methylation patterns existing between BPH and PCa. The major finding is that broad hypermethylation occurred at genic loci in PCa tissues as compared to the BPH. Gene ontology analysis suggested that hypermethylation of genic loci involved in chromatin and transcriptional regulation is involved in cancer progression. We also compared PCa tissues with high Gleason scores to tissues with low Gleason scores. The high-Gleason PCa tissues showed hundreds of focal differentially methylated CpG sites corresponding to genes functioning in cancer cell proliferation or metastasis. This suggests that dissecting early-to-advanced-grade cancer stages requires an in-depth analysis of differential methylation at the single CpG site level.Our study reports that enzymatic methylome sequencing data can be used to distinguish PCa from BPH and advanced PCa from early-stage PCa. The stage-specific methylation patterns in this study will be valuable resources for diagnostic purposes as well as further development of liquid biopsy approaches for the early detection of PCa.© 2023 The Asian Pacific Prostate Society.
